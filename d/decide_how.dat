5|$|After {{being caught}} by the Environmental Protection Agency dumping nuclear waste in the city park, Mr. Burns is fined $3 million. A town meeting is held so that the {{citizens}} can <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to spend the money. Marge suggests that the city {{use the money to}} fix Main Street, which is in poor condition. The town is about to vote in favor when someone new to town, a fast-talking salesman named Lyle Lanley, suggests that Springfield construct a city monorail. After being swayed by a song, the now enthused townspeople decide to build the monorail.|$|E
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get that piece. In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E

5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, {{the job of a}} manager has become more complex. A player–manager needs to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> much playing time to give himself. Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player–manager.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{agreed with}} the {{plaintiff}} that since the PSA had authority to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to allocate berths, it was also entrusted with the duty to exercise that discretion after taking various key factors into consideration, and would have acted unlawfully if it had abrogated its responsibility by taking orders from other public authorities such as the Gambling Suppression Branch or the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board unless it was under a statutory duty to do so. However, on {{the facts of the}} case, the decision to deny berths to the plaintiff's cruise ship had been taken by the PSA alone.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Conviction, {{the game}} {{would have no}} {{interactive}} torture sequences. Instead, players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation. The system was not complex, and {{it was hoped that}} players would choose based on instinct. According to Béland, every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices. However, the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> deeply a knife penetrates a person's shoulder. After a mixed-to-negative response, Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product.|$|E
5|$|Illness forced Mason to absent {{himself from}} the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, {{and he did not}} attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With {{independence}} from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Richard Henry Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress {{to be a part of}} the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, George Wythe, and a young delegate from Orange County, James Madison. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.|$|E

5|$|In November 1968, Grant {{secured a}} $143,000 advance {{contract}} from Atlantic Records, {{which was then}} the biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic were a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and jazz artists, but in the late 1960s they began to {{take an interest in}} British progressive rock acts. Record executives signed Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in deciding when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album. They would also <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own company, Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.|$|E
5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player walk through the streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
5|$|The {{competitors}} must <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> much to pay each agent, and {{how much}} to pay the local guide in that region. If there are competing offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E

5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and nearly died. He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters were speaking, and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, castration, and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to <b>decide</b> <b>how</b> to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.|$|E
