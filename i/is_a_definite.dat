In some orders of insects the cross-veins are so numerous that the whole venational pattern becomes a close network of branching veins and cross-veins. Ordinarily, however, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> number of cross-veins having specific locations. The more constant cross-veins are the humeral cross-vein (h) between costa and subcosta, the radial cross-vein (r) between R and the first fork of Rs, the sectorial cross-vein (s) between the two forks of R8, the median cross-vein (m–m) between M2 and M3, and the mediocubital cross-vein (m-cu) between media and cubitus.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. For example, if an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> demand.|$|E

The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the {{surface integral}} is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that VUR is present in more than 10% of the population. Younger children are more prone to VUR because of the relative shortness of the submucosal ureters. This susceptibility decreases with age as the length of the ureters increases as the children grow.	In {{children under the age of}} 1 year with a urinary tract infection, 70% will have VUR. This number decreases to 15% by the age of 12.

25|$|Beyond this, most {{substances}} {{have three}} ordinarily recognized states of matter, solid, liquid, and gas, {{and a fourth}} less obviously recognized one, plasma. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as for example, glass, and liquid crystal. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter {{in what might be}} viewed as the same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two phases within the 'body'. Definite rules are known, telling how distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.|$|E

500|$|Another feature {{peculiar}} to waveguide filters {{is that there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> frequency, the cutoff frequency, below which no transmission can take place. [...] This means that in theory low-pass filters cannot be made in waveguides. [...] However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. [...] The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter {{for all practical purposes}} if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. [...] The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. [...] Likewise, the guide wavelength (λg) and characteristic impedance (Z0) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.|$|E

I’m not sure if the show’s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this is setting up some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice.

500|$|The Hurricane Research Division of the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory {{created the}} r-CLIPER (rainfall {{climatology}} and persistence) model {{to act as}} a baseline for all verification regarding tropical cyclone rainfall. [...] The theory is, if the global forecast models cannot beat predictions based on climatology, then there is no skill in their use. [...] There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>definite</b> advantage to using the forecast track with r-CLIPER because it could be run out 120hours/5days with the forecast track of any tropical cyclone globally within a short amount of time. [...] The short range variation which uses persistence is the Tropical Rainfall Potential technique (TRaP) technique, which uses satellite-derived rainfall amounts from microwave imaging satellites and extrapolates the current rainfall configuration forward for 24hours along the current forecast track. [...] This technique's main flaw is that it assumes a steady state tropical cyclone which undergoes little structural change with time, which is why it is only run forward for 24hours into the future.|$|E

Twelve weeks after its original release, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days.
