5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on <b>end-of-life</b> health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive. The provision was not included in ACA.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{consumption}} of indium worldwide is LCD production. Demand rose rapidly {{from the late}} 1990s to 2010 with the popularity of LCD computer monitors and television sets, which now account for 50% of indium consumption. Increased manufacturing efficiency and recycling (especially in Japan) maintain a balance between demand and supply. According to the UNEP, indium's <b>end-of-life</b> recycling rate is less than 1%.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} <b>end-of-life</b> care, Brady died of restrictive {{pulmonary disease}} in Ashworth Hospital on 15 May 2017. On 21 September 2017, the inquest {{found that he}} {{died of natural causes}} and his hunger strike had not been a contributory factor. Brady had refused food and fluids for more than 48 hours on various occasions, causing him to be fitted with a nasogastric tube, although his inquest noted that his body mass index was not a cause for concern. Brady was cremated on 25 October 2017 and his ashes were disposed of at sea.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 session, Roberts {{sponsored}} several bills {{relating to}} juvenile criminal offenders, including legislation {{to allow more}} juveniles to have their criminal records expunged, and to allow young adults to serve sentences within the Youth Offender System instead of correctional facilities. Roberts also sponsored legislation to make minor adjustment to the statutes concerning the Colorado Youth Advisory Council, legislation to create a regional self-insurance plan within the San Luis Valley, and legislation revising statutes surrounding <b>end-of-life</b> care.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, {{the company}} {{announced}} that as of March 31, 2010, PokerTracker Holdem v2 {{would no longer be}} supported. The decision was made because PokerTracker 3 had been released on May 15, 2008, nearly two years prior to the <b>end-of-life</b> date. The company felt that discontinuing support of v2 would avail resources which could be dedicated to improving PT3 and providing exceptional customer service. Similarly on December 31, 2010, PokerTracker Omaha v2 will also no longer be supported, as its features have been completely integrated into the PokerTracker 3 product line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of <b>end-of-life</b> care, {{midazolam}} is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|The End Of Life date (EOL, sunset date) for Python 2.7 was {{initially}} set at 2015, then postponed to 2020 {{out of concern}} that {{a large body of}} existing code cannot easily be forward-ported to Python 3. In January 2017, Google announced work on a Python 2.7 to Go transcompiler, which The Register speculated was in response to Python 2.7's planned <b>end-of-life</b> but Google cited performance under concurrent workloads as their only motivation.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Roberts sat on {{an interim}} committee dealing with hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding <b>end-of-life</b> care and advance directives. Other legislation that Roberts carried in 2010 included {{a bill to}} allow voluntary income tax contributions to support 2-1-1 services, and she fought against cuts to the Native American tuition waiver program at Fort Lewis College. Roberts {{was one of only}} three Republican House members to vote in support of Colorado's 2010 budget, after successfully sponsoring an amendment that removed restrictions on Fort Lewis College's ability to set its own out-of-state tuition rates.|$|E
5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of <b>end-of-life</b> care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E
5|$|Physician: Physicians {{involved}} in patient care may include the primary physician, {{who can provide}} valuable information about patient medical history, and physicians connected to the hospice team. These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in <b>end-of-life</b> care.|$|E
5|$|While early {{efforts to}} legalize {{same-sex}} marriage failed, the legislature approved two bills in 2008 that granted all unmarried couples certain domestic partnership rights, including {{the ability to}} make hospital and nursing home visits, <b>end-of-life</b> choices and other medical decisions, in addition to rights to joint property ownership. Domestic partners must be at least 18 years old and be able to provide an affidavit attesting to their relationship along with two documents, such as joint checking accounts, mortgages or car leases; coverage on health insurance policies or the designation as a primary beneficiary in a will. The laws went into effect on July 1, 2008.|$|E

25|$|Some U.S. {{retailers}} offer {{opportunities for}} consumer recycling of discarded electronic devices. In the US, the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) urges consumers to dispose properly of <b>end-of-life</b> electronics through its recycling locator at www.GreenerGadgets.org. This list only includes manufacturer and retailer programs {{that use the}} strictest standards and third-party certified recycling locations, to provide consumers assurance that their products will be recycled safely and responsibly. CEA {{research has found that}} 58 percent of consumers know where to take their <b>end-of-life</b> electronics, and the electronics industry would very much like to see that level of awareness increase. Consumer electronics manufacturers and retailers sponsor or operate more than 5,000 recycling locations nationwide and have vowed to recycle one billion pounds annually by 2016, a sharp increase from 300 million pounds industry recycled in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Levels {{of metals}} {{recycling}} are generally low. Unless future <b>end-of-life</b> recycling rates are stepped up, some rare metals may become unavailable {{for use in}} a variety of consumer products. Due to the low recycling rates, some landfills now contain higher concentrations of metal than mines themselves.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrists and {{clinical}} psychologists are often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions {{at the end of}} life. Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make <b>end-of-life</b> decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of their}} condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make <b>end-of-life</b> decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{penalties}} on {{hospitals are}} charged after knee or hip replacements, $265,000 per excess readmission. The goals are to encourage better post-hospital care and more referrals to hospice and <b>end-of-life</b> care {{in lieu of}} treatment, while the effect is also to reduce coverage in hospitals that treat poor and frail patients. The total penalties for above-average readmissions in 2013 are $280 million, for 7,000 excess readmissions, or $40,000 for each readmission above the US average rate.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on <b>end-of-life</b> decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of <b>end-of-life</b> decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide whether they want to live.|$|E

From the recycling process originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).|$|E
25|$|In 2016 it was {{announced}} that the BBC would withdraw the iPlayer from a range of internet-enabled Freesat and Freeview TVs and set-top boxes dating from between 2010 and 2014, including Sony, Humax and Grundig products. The BBC cited the incompatibility of MHEG encoding on iPlayer V2 with these devices, and said that developing an upgrade would not be cost-effective. The <b>end-of-life</b> iPlayer V2 was withdrawn in September 2016, after which BBC iPlayer functionality was no longer supported on those receivers, although it continued to be available on newer equipment.|$|E

25|$|The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) was a UK {{care pathway}} (excluding Wales) {{covering}} palliative care options for {{patients in the}} final days or hours of life. It was developed to help doctors and nurses provide quality <b>end-of-life</b> care. Now discredited, the LCP was widely abused as a 'tick box exercise', with patients being casually assessed as terminal, heavily sedated, and denied water so the diagnosis became self-fulfilling. Hospitals were also provided cash incentives to achieve targets for the number of patients killed on the LCP.|$|E
25|$|Palliative care {{is often}} {{required}} {{in the final stages}} of the disease, often when dopaminergic treatments have become ineffective. The aim of palliative care is to achieve the maximum quality of life for the person with the disease and those surrounding him or her. Some central issues of palliative are caring for patients at home while adequate care can be given there, reducing or withdrawing dopaminergic drug intake to reduce drug side effects and complications, preventing pressure ulcers by management of pressure areas of inactive patients, and facilitating the patient's <b>end-of-life</b> decisions for the patient, as well as involved friends and relatives.|$|E
