5|$|The {{meanings}} {{expressed in}} kilims derive both <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> motifs used, {{and by their}} pattern and arrangement in the rug as a whole. A few symbols are widespread across Anatolia {{as well as other}} regions including Persia and the Caucasus; others are confined to Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen men's {{and fifteen}} women's teams {{competed in the}} team competitions. The teams {{consisted}} of the country's three archers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> round, and the team's initial ranking was determined by summing the three members' scores in the individual ranking round. Each round of eliminations consisted of each team firing 27 arrows (9 by each archer).|$|E
5|$|While {{more recent}} critics have {{emphasized}} the revolutionary aspects of the cross-class friendship between Jemima and Maria, others have questioned the extent of that radicalism, arguing that Jemima's story occupies a small section of the novel and is abruptly truncated. Mary Poovey also maintains that Wollstonecraft fails to extend her critique of marriage and society <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> to the systemic level.|$|E

30|$|The {{institutional}} {{research committee}} waived informed consents <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> {{in this study}} {{because there are no}} risks and no intervention to <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> for measuring <b>the</b> counts in blood samples by using two different counters.|$|R
5000|$|For theorists {{aligned with}} Yalom, {{psychological}} dysfunction results <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> refusal or inability {{to deal with}} the normal existential anxiety that comes from confronting life's [...] "givens": mortality, isolation, meaninglessness, and freedom.|$|R
5|$|After {{missing the}} podium at the 2007–08 season's first two World Cups, Neuner {{was part of}} Germany's winning relay team in Pokljuka, Slovenia in December 2007. She claimed her eighth World Cup win at the mass start in Oberhof in January 2008, and later that month won the relay race in Ruhpolding with the German team. Shortly before her 21st birthday, Neuner decided to again compete at the Junior/Youth World Championships, held in Ruhpolding in January 2008—the last time she was {{eligible}} to enter. She won gold in the sprint and the pursuit, but withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> race {{to prepare for the}} senior world championships alongside her German team mates.|$|E
5|$|The novel extrapolates Balzac's {{analysis}} of desire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> to society; {{he feared that}} the world, like Valentin, was losing its way due to material excess and misguided priorities. In the gambling house, the orgiastic feast, the antique shop, and the discussions with men of science, Balzac examines this dilemma in various contexts. The lust for social status to which Valentin is led by Rastignac is emblematic of this excess; the gorgeous but unattainable Foedora symbolizes the pleasures offered by high society.|$|E
5|$|Scientists study snow at a {{wide variety}} of scales that include the physics of {{chemical}} bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.|$|E
50|$|Greater Sudbury Transit also {{operates}} a Trans-Cab service for any outlying area {{which does not}} receive bus service (including Long Lake, Richard Lake, Radar Base, Skead, Wahnapitae, Whitefish & Dowling which provides a taxi <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> home to a transit bus stop.|$|R
5000|$|Friedel's law {{is used in}} X-ray diffraction, {{crystallography}} and scattering {{from real}} potential within the Born approximation. Note that a twin operation ( [...] Opération de maclage) is equivalent to an inversion centre and <b>the</b> intensities <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> are equivalent under Friedel's law.|$|R

25|$|The maximum {{luminosity}} of an {{eclipsing binary}} system {{is equal to}} the sum of the luminosity contributions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> stars. When one star passes in front of the other, the luminosity of the system is seen to decrease. The luminosity returns to normal once the two stars are no longer in alignment.|$|E
5000|$|Note that f is an {{expectation}} value for an unspecified, hypothetical, perfectly Mendelian gene. Its definition holds {{regardless of whether}} the organism's genome actually contains such a gene. Therefore, the coefficient of inbreeding is a statistical value derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> pedigree and cannot be verified or [...] "measured" [...] exactly by looking at <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> genome.|$|R
25|$|There are a {{large number}} of occupations and professions {{that are part of the}} wine industry, ranging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> who grow <b>the</b> grapes, prepare the wine, bottle it, sell it, assess it, market it and finally make {{recommendations}} to clients and serve the wine.|$|R

25|$|The {{formalization}} of constructivism from a within-the-human {{perspective is}} generally attributed to Jean Piaget, who articulated {{mechanisms by which}} information from the environment and ideas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> interact and result in internalized structures developed by learners. He identified processes of assimilation and accommodation that are key in this interaction as individuals construct new knowledge from their experiences.|$|E
25|$|The OLPC XO-1 {{hardware}} lacks connectivity {{to external}} monitors or projectors, {{and teachers are}} not provided with software for remote assessment. As a result, students are unable to present their work to the whole class, and teachers must also assess students' work <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> laptops. Teachers often {{find it difficult to}} use the keyboard and screen, which were designed with student use in mind.|$|E
25|$|This {{involves}} {{tracking the}} volume of visits, leads, and customers to a website <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> social channel.

50|$|Although most {{specific}} phobias stem <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individuals</b> themselves, <b>the</b> {{most common}} type of needle phobia, affecting 50% of those afflicted, is an inherited vasovagal reflex reaction. Approximately 80% of people with a fear of needles report that a relative within the first degree exhibits the same disorder.|$|R
5000|$|Age {{stereotypes}} are internalized: In a {{study by}} Donlon, Ashman, and Levy (2005), it was demonstrated that older individuals with greater lifetime exposure to television (a source of predominantly negative age stereotypes) possessed more negative age stereotypes, thus suggesting that age stereotypes are internalized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual's</b> host culture.|$|R
25|$|The 4 × 400 meter relay pool also {{consisted}} of eight men; the top seven <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> 400 meters (Williams, Smallwood, LuValle, Al Fitch, Bob Young, Harold Cagle and Eddie O'Brien), {{as well as}} 800-meter champion John Woodruff. In this case, the four runners selected purely for the relay (Fitch, Young, Cagle and O'Brien) were used at the Olympics; they won silver behind the British team.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Clarice {{produced}} a simple, hand painted pattern of Crocus flowers in orange, blue and purple, each flower being constructed with confident upward strokes. Then green leaves were added by holding the piece {{upside down and}} painting thin lines amongst the flowers. Being made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual</b> brushstrokes, the Crocus pattern was clearly completely hand-painted, and the vibrant colours instantly attracted large sales.|$|E
25|$|In this condition, the {{experimenter}} gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs {{them to go}} play. After that initial instruction, {{the experimenter}} pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>individual.</b> If the individual engages {{in the behavior of}} interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly {{in the form of a}} reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.|$|E
