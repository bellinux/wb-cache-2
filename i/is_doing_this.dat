Wesker has {{attached}} a mind-control device to Valentine's chest, which makes her fight Redfield and his new partner, Sheva Alomar, a local agent. Valentine knows that she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> but is barely able to stop herself, although she has enough control to open her jumpsuit so that Alomar and Redfield can see the device. Alomar pulls it off and Valentine is freed from Wesker's control. She urges Alomar and Redfield to continue with their mission to stop Wesker. The DLC episode Desperate Escape describes Valentine's escape to safety {{with the help of}} another local BSAA agent, Josh Stone.|$|E

25|$|The {{third day}} he follows Aoi, the eldest daughter, {{to the train}} station and shows her the photo of her tied up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, she asks Kimura why he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> at which point she remembers he is the same groper whom she {{reported}} for molesting a woman. Getting in a vehicle, Kimura and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and takes photos after withdrawing.|$|E
25|$|Years later, as Henry rides {{through a}} forest, he {{narrowly}} avoids {{a collision with}} an oncoming carriage, resulting in the woman inside being thrown to the ground. Realizing he has met this realm's version of Cinderella, he offers her {{a ride to the}} ball as an apology. Cinderella, however, knocks him out and takes the motorcycle once she's been shown how it works, with Henry chasing her. At the same time, Lady Tremaine is about to set off for the palace, having clipped the Fairy Godmother's wings and taken her wand. When questioned why she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> she explains to Drizella that magic has no power compared to fear, a point she drives home by destroying the Fairy Godmother.|$|E
25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.|$|E

25|$|Bub {{manages to}} escape from his chain and finds Dr. Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he expresses sadness and then becomes enraged. He finds a pistol {{discarded}} {{on the floor and}} goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile, Miguel, who has become suicidal, opens the gates to the compound, allowing the horde of zombies lurking outside to enter onto the elevator, devouring him. While Miguel <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> John overcomes his captors, knocking both Rhodes and Torrez out before stealing their weapons and going into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill. The zombies rapidly enter the complex; Pvt. Rickles and Pvt. Torrez are torn apart by the horde while Pvt. Steel attempts to shoot Bub through a covered window, but gets bitten on the neck by another zombie. Refusing to be eaten alive or succumb to the infection, he commits suicide by shooting himself. Rhodes attempts to escape, but is chased and shot several times by a gun-toting Bub. Rhodes is chased into a horde of zombies and Bub mocks Rhodes with a salute and departs, as Rhodes is violently torn apart by the zombies.|$|E
25|$|Abercrombie {{thought that}} the carbon {{particle}} is a marker on the cell surface and its behaviour reflects what the surface <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>This</b> led him to propose that, as a cell moves, membrane from internal stores is added {{at the front of}} the cell—enabling the cell to extend forward—and retrieved toward the rear of the cell. This process of exocytosis {{at the front of the}} cell and endocytosis elsewhere has been modified by Bretscher. He and Hopkins showed that the specific membrane endocytosed by coated pits on motile cells is returned by exocytosis to the cell surface at the leading edge. The spatial difference between the sites of exocytosis (at the front) and endocytosis (everywhere on the surface) leads to a flow of the matrix of the plasma membrane—lipids—from the front toward the rear. Large objects, such as patches, would be swept along with this flow, whereas non-crosslinked small molecules would be able to diffuse by Brownian motion against the flow and so evade being swept backward. Hence, in this theory, the need for crosslinking. Bretscher proposed that on stationary cells exocytosis is random—and therefore a major difference between motile and nonmotile cells.|$|E

500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is on a {{business}} call with the investors {{and members of the}} business venture he is up for. Many distractions from the background make the call difficult. At the end of the day, Jim apologizes, but then hears the person on the phone saying this is not working out. Meanwhile, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) convinces several {{of the men in the}} office to grow mustaches for [...] "Movember". He says he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> to support the cure for prostate cancer but is actually using it for a chance to socialize more with the office, to no avail. Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) later shows Erin his mustache, but she finds it repulsive. He shaves it off shortly after that.|$|E

Dust suddenly appears, now greatly changed in her appearance and persona with altered powers, and proceeds to confront and easily kill each member. Anole tries in vain to reason with her. Defeated, he asks her why she <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> and she replies that mutants are a [...] "plague upon the earth" [...] and that she has become [...] "the cure", before killing him with her powers.|$|E
500|$|Espenson {{said that}} this was one of their most love-centered episodes; when they {{realized}} {{it was going to be}} airing near Valentine's Day, they decided to [...] "lean into" [...] this theme. Unusual for Once Upon a Time, the theme of this episode changed during the writing process. It was initially meant to center on Rumpelstiltskin choosing power over love. However, as Espenson went through drafts and discussed them with others, she decided that Rumpelstiltskin might think he <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> but really his actions are motivated by not believing that he is worthy of love at all. In the interest of time, Espenson was forced to edit out many plot points, including a failed escape attempt by Belle. Despite this, she sought to trim down more time from the Storybrooke scenes and [...] "preserve as much as we could of the fairy tale side," [...] as the Belle-Rumpelstiltskin relationship was a love story that needed time to grow in order to be believable.|$|E

Karen {{attempts}} to lure Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) away from Scranton by offering him a pay raise. Regional Manager Michael Scott (Steve Carell), believing that Karen <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> {{to get back at}} Jim for dumping her, decides to retaliate. Michael and salesman Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) trick Jim into joining them on a trip to Utica to prank Karen’s branch. After a failed attempt to steal the branch's industrial copier, the group is discovered by Karen, who chastises them in her office. Privately, she mocks Jim for devising such an elaborate ruse to see her. Jim's attempts to deflect the issue are unsuccessful, letting slip that he and Pam are happily dating. The group returns to Scranton, where Michael bids Stanley farewell. Stanley decides to stay in Scranton, revealing that his threat was a bluff to get a raise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rationale}} for the abolition is summarized by former Wall Street Journal reporter Mei Fong: [...] "The reason China <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. [...] They have this huge crushing demographic crisis {{as a result of}} the one-child policy. And if people don’t start having more children, they’re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population." [...] China's ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.|$|E
