40|$|Nightclubs are {{business}}es. Their {{business is}} pleasure; <b>however</b> <b>pleasure</b> has its price. People {{have become increasingly}} concerned {{about the problems of}} violence in society but why do higher levels of violence occur in nightclubs despite the established patterns of behaviour that dictates how we socialise and act? In response, researchers have focused on identifying social and situational factors that may contribute to violence from a government perspective, focusing on a variety of specific issues ranging from financial standpoints with effective target marketing strategies to legal obligations of supplying alcohol and abiding regulatory conditions. There is little research into specific design properties that can determine design standards to ensure/improve the physical design of nightclub environments to reduce patron violence. To address this gap, this current article aims to understand how people experience and respond to the physical environment of nightclubs and how these spaces influence their behaviour. The first section of this paper examines the background on nightclubs and theories concerning the influence of pleasure. The second section of this paper details the findings of existing studies that have examined the nightlife context and the various factors that influence patron violence. The main finding of this paper is that although alcohol likely plays a contributing role in aggressive patron behaviour, there is evidence that the relationship is moderated by a number of significant factors relating to the characteristics of the drinking environment such as: physical comfort; the degree of overall 'permissiveness‘ in the establishment; crowding; and physical environmental elements most influenced by day to-day management practices such as lighting, ventilation, cleanliness and seating arrangements. The findings from this paper have been used to develop a framework to guide exploratory research on how specific elements of the physical environment of nightclubs have an impact on elevated patron aggression and assault (Koleczko & Garcia Hansen, 2011) ...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} thesis was to explore the instantaneous relationship between perceptions of workload employees experience {{on a daily basis}} in the working environment and emotions they may be experiencing {{over a period of time}} in the context of a longitudinal study. This may seem as an expected relationship, as emotions form part of basic human anatomy, and are often dictated by daily activities. It is crucial to understand this process as a dynamic process hence the need to assess the relationship over a period of time, instead of in a cross-sectional nature. In doing so the study aimed to understand the concepts of workload and emotions as found in the context of various literatures. An understanding was gained of the concepts of workload and emotion that would allow the current study to find a foundation for a better investigation and exploration. The study was performed in a longitudinal manner, which assisted in accommodating the dynamic relationship presented by the variables at hand. The study was conducted online via a survey engine, where the instruments were administered to the sample collected, over a three week period on alternated days, three times a day. The instruments used consisted of a biographical questionnaire, a workload questionnaire comprised of selection and open ended questions and the single item Affect Grid to measure emotions along with open ended questions. A final sample of 60 participants was collected, consisting of 26 females and 34 men. The results of this study showed for the emotion arousal, time of day was significant. The study identified that the afternoon period is when the arousal was at its highest, thus participants felt most aroused towards this time of day. Workload also had no significant influence on the emotion arousal. The results also showed that for the emotion pleasure, workload had a significant influence; <b>however</b> <b>pleasure</b> had no significance to the time of da...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the role}} of retail {{environment}} in affecting customer behaviour is highly acknowledged by marketing scholars, the mechanism causing the effect is still a promising area of research. In this respect, most of S-O-R-based research in the relevant literature comprises either emotional or cognitive states as organism factors. Together, emotion and cognition as mediators are mostly investigated in studies addressing either a single or a few environmental stimuli, with less attention paid to the interplay mediating role of customer emotion and cognition on the shopping environment-customer behaviour relationship. With this in mind, this thesis aims to investigate the effect of various factors within the shopping environment on customer mall behaviour through examining the mediating role of customer emotions and cognition. With the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) model as a backbone, {{and supported by the}} cognitive theory of emotions as well as “affect as information” theory, different scenarios of mediation for both customer emotions and cognition (O) in the relationship between shopping environment factors (S) and customer behavioural response (R) are addressed in one holistic framework. Based on a thorough analysis of the existing literature, a conceptual research model comprising eleven main research hypotheses is developed and then empirically examined. Using a dataset of 1, 028 valid survey questionnaires collected using the mall intercept technique, structural equation modelling asserts the capability of various factors within the shopping environment in influencing customer behavioural response through a cognitive-emotional sequence of mediation. Analysis shows that, out of the seventeen direct structural paths included in the structural model, thirteen paths are significant and in the hypothesised direction, lending support to the majority of research hypotheses. The findings of hypothesis testing indicate that the mall shopping environment {{plays an important role in}} shaping customer cognition (evaluation of a mall’s overall shopping environment) and in driving their behavioural response, while its direct impact on customer emotions seems to be much less significant. Both customer emotions and cognition are important in predicting customer mall behaviour. <b>However,</b> <b>pleasure,</b> and not the emotion of arousal, plays a role in determining how customers behave in shopping malls. The mediating effect of customer emotions on the relationship between shopping environment factors and customer behavioural response is marginal, while cognition plays a critical mediating impact. Nevertheless, in accordance with the overall finding of this thesis, the mediating role of emotions becomes more significant as a second-step mediating variable. Theoretically, this study introduces a comprehensive understanding on how a mall’s shopping environment affects customer buying behaviour. It also provides distinctive insights onto the mechanism by which customer emotions and cognition mediate the effect. Practically, the findings emphasise the significance of the shopping environment as a marketing tool. The research findings are informative to malls’ operators seeking to understand how the shopping mall environment can be best utilised to enrich the shopping experience of customers and to ultimately drive their buying behaviour. Limitations and areas of future research are also discussed...|$|E
