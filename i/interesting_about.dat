He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something <b>interesting</b> <b>about,</b> or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe has said that the volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as {{one might}} expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E

500|$|... what is <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> this film, perhaps, is {{the moment}} when it was made.

And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E

500|$|The releases, as {{they fell}} in the line between games and {{software}} products, went largely unreviewed. Prior to release, the initial products were regarded as having [...] "potential". Critics' reactions to the series were tepid; they felt that the products would sell well, given the publisher and subject matter, but {{that there was little}} <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> them. They felt {{that it would not be}} worth localizing the products to sell in non-Japanese markets, as there was not much of a market for non-game software for the Nintendo DS without heavy advertising, due to prior failures in promoting such products.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the praise}} was {{balanced}} by certain critics. Blender considered By the Way {{to be an}} indistinguishable sequel to Californication, calling it [...] "Californication 2". It further condemned the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound. Jaime Lowe of The Village Voice panned Kiedis's lyrics as [...] "absolutely baffling" [...] and commented that [...] "it's as if {{he picked up a}} rhyming dictionary and arbitrarily strung some phrases together." [...] The newspaper's Robert Christgau was also critical of his songwriting, writing that [...] "it's not enough for Anthony Kiedis to get all mature—he's supposed to say something <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> maturity." [...] Entertainment Weekly praised By the Way for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album's energy mild; for being [...] "more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is." ...|$|E

500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of Take This to Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E
500|$|On the {{creation}} of Yang, Shonda Rhimes said the character contained [...] "a little bit of [...] personality". Speaking with talk show host Oprah Winfrey, Rhimes said: [...] "Cristina was second, simply because she's {{the kind of woman}} I know really well, and I like her. There's something <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> a person who is that driven, a little bit emotionally disconnected but still a caring, sweet, and smart individual you could be friends with." [...] Sandra Oh, initially auditioned for the character of Bailey, adding: [...] "Thank God I did not get that part", explaining the show would not be the same without fellow cast member, Wilson. Discussing casting Oh as Yang, Rhimes said: [...] "She brought this energy that felt very fresh. From the beginning, I've been shaping Cristina around Sandra a little bit. One of my favorite things to do is take as much of her dialogue out of a scene as possible because she does so much nonverbally. Then I just watch what she manages to do without having a word to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Reaction to [...] "You're Getting Old" [...] was positive. Critics {{pointed to}} the self-referencing aim of the episode in growing older and redefining senses of humor as well as cynicism. While Ramsey Isler of IGN found the episode to be largely humorless and monotonous, he {{interpreted}} this as intentional {{on the part of}} the show's creators, who he believed had grown weary of creating the series. Isler called the final moments of the episode [...] "the most somber material the series has ever produced... providing the emotional soundtrack for a montage of images that just rip the heart out of any South Park fan", giving the episode an 8.5/10. HitFix's review on the episode focused on its personal philosophic themes, with reviewer Alan Sepinwall stating [...] "But what was <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> Stan's existential crisis, and how he struggled to like anything, is that the show's philosophy has often largely been about how other people care too much about things... Yet here, Stan's lack of passion – and the Marsh parents' – was clearly shown to be a bad thing for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers' {{opinions}} on the graphics and gameplay were largely negative, while {{opinions on}} the title's music varied. The background music was described as [...] "...the only thing that is remotely <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> this appallingly tedious game..." [...] by Popular Computing Weeklys reviewer. He followed this by stating [...] "At first it sounds all right, if a little monotonous, then it begins to grate the nerves. After a while it begins to take on all {{the appeal of the}} Chinese water torture." [...] Crash magazine's three reviewers were more positive about the music, stating [...] "The sound is fairly well done...", [...] "The title screen plays a nice tune..." [...] and [...] "...the game's drawing point is the sound..." [...] The game's graphics were described as [...] "fairly crude", [...] "unattractive" [...] and [...] "...none too exciting, consisting of colourful but flickery characters." [...] One reviewer stated [...] "The graphics are large and colourful but {{there is a lot of}} character clash..." [...] Overall impressions of Moonlight Madness were negative. Crash magazine's reviewers compared the game unfavourably to Booty. One expressed disappointment because of Bubble Bus' history of releasing [...] "great arcade/adventures". Your Sinclairs reviewer stated [...] "Maybe Bubble Bus had a touch of Moonlight Madness when it picked this one for its new release." [...] The reviewer from ZX Computing stated [...] "Keeping to the boy scout theme, be prepared before you buy this one." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings did {{not think}} of his work as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E

2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot's Ron Dulin, {{who scored}} the game 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise – but {{somewhere along the}} production line, someone forgot to include a game." [...] He was critical of the random nature of the game, especially the multiple endings; [...] "To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague {{for the bulk of}} the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up." [...] He concluded, [...] "most of what's <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> the game is exactly what was <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> the film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game's flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting." ...|$|E
