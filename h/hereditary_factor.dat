40|$|Although a {{familial}} {{tendency to}} develop brain tumors {{in the absence}} of well-recognized hereditary disorders is an important issue, it has been rarely reported. Studies of the familial occurrence of gliomas have yielded conflicting results.

This latent or recessive gene theory claims that these non-dominant <b>hereditary</b> <b>factors</b> determine the Object selection, voluntary and involuntary, of the individual.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} and widely cited adoption study on criminality was conducted by Sarnoff A. Mednick and Karl O. Christiansen in Denmark, where relevant data was relatively easily available that demonstrated that criminality has a significant genetic component that interacts with environmental risk factors. Adoption studies that followed have had similar results. The twin, adoption, and family studies have been a common method to test on criminals to determine if there is a correlation. When studying the criminals that are adopted children, their biological and adoptive parents are used for the experiment as well. The first study involving adopted children dealt with the genetics of criminal behavior that proved the children which were more likely to become criminals were biologically related to offenders. This study demonstrates that crime is correlated to be a <b>hereditary</b> <b>factor.</b> The study took place in the 1980s in Iowa and used 52 adopted children which were born into female offenders. Results showed seven of the fifty two children had committed a criminal act and only one of the adoptive parents had been accused of a crime. The relationship between crime and adoption study has shown evidence to property crime and not to violent crime in adopted vs not adopted individuals and their adoptive parents or biological ones. Other factors such as age and where the child was moved during adoption affect the accuracy in the conclusions. Even though the adoption study dealing with crime is performed all over the world, possible information has been declined, obtained from deficient adoption centers, and not conducted face to face. The study has been proven to be influenced by genetic factors, but statistics are not 100% defined.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on mechanisms, {{independent}} of activated Factor XI, capable of activating Factor IX. The reaction product of tissue factor and Factor VII functioned as a potent Factor IX activator in the assay system used. Activated Factor IX itself activated Factor X; thrombin failed to activate Factor IX. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the reaction product of tissue factor and Factor VII activated Factor IX, with replacement of the band corresponding to native factor IX [molecular weight (Mr) 55, 000] by bands corresponding to the heavy chain (Mr 27, 000) and light chain (Mr 17, 000) of activated Factor IX. When either Factor VII or calcium ions were left out of incubation mixtures, the band of native Factor IX persisted unchanged. Contact of blood with tissue factor represents a second mechanism, bypassing activated Factor XI, for the activation of Factor IX during hemostasis. It may help to explain {{the discrepancy between the}} mild bleeding of <b>hereditary</b> <b>Factor</b> XI deficiency and the severe bleeding of <b>hereditary</b> <b>Factor</b> IX deficiency...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study a {{possible}} <b>hereditary</b> <b>factor</b> leading to multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility, histocompatibility (HL-A) types were studied in families where two or more first-degree relatives had MS.

The distribution of HL-A chromosomes was essentially the same for affected and unaffected family members.

In the classic waterfall description of blood coagulation, there are 2 ways to trigger the plasma clotting system: the tis-sue factor (or extrinsic) pathway and the contact (or intrinsic) pathway. 1 Extensive studies in knockout mice have demon-strated that the triggering of blood clotting via the tissue factor/ factor VIIa complex (TF:VIIa) is essential for normal hemo-stasis. 2 In contrast, humans and mice that completely lack the proteins that trigger the contact pathway (factor XII, prekalli-krein, or high molecular weight kininogen) exhibit no bleeding tendencies, indicating that the triggers of the classical contact/ intrinsic pathway are dispensable for normal hemostasis. ...|$|E
