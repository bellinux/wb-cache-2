25|$|There {{were really}} no {{actions on the}} part of the missionaries there that were not entirely justified. There was no government, no organization. There were houses of men who had been firing on the foreign quarter; their {{property}} had been abandoned as a result of a state of war, and it was taken in order to succor hundreds of suffering and destitute Chinese whose lives the original owners had been laboring to destroy. Winter was coming on, measures of some kind were imperative, and the appropriation of property for the ends in view was unquestionably justified. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> justify the conduct of the American missionaries before the siege, during the siege and after the siege.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{hold the}} view that the police {{organisation}} is not a police force but a police service, which offers to the right individual not merely a job but all the advantages of a professional career. I believe in doing everything reasonably possible by way of improving the conditions and amenities for all ranks of the service, and in particular in delegating both authority and responsibility to officers according to their rank. Having done this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept nothing but the highest standard of service by way of return." ...|$|E

2500|$|Smith continues: It is {{incidentally}} a gratification to many whose {{sense of}} justice has been outraged by the captious criticisms of those with neither knowledge nor candour to comprehend existing conditions, to see that Mr. Conger has not hesitated to take the responsibility for his own advice consistently given to American citizens acting in times of storm and stress. He has comprehensively replied to all the current criticism by the remark : [...] " [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> justify {{the conduct of the}} missionaries before the siege, during the siege, and after the siege." ...|$|E
2500|$|The judge William Keogh, before passing {{sentence}} {{asked him}} if he had any further remarks to make in reference to his case. Mr. Kickham briefly replied: [...] "I believe, my lords, I have said enough already. I will only add that I am convicted for doing nothing but my duty. I have endeavoured to serve Ireland, and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> suffer for Ireland." [...] Then the judge with many expressions of sympathy for the prisoner, and many compliments in reference to his intellectual attainments, sentenced him to be kept in penal servitude for fourteen years.|$|E
2500|$|The Mildura Rural City Council and {{residents}} spent almost $2million fighting the Government's {{proposal for the}} LTCF at Nowingi. On 10 January 2007 the Victorian Government did not rule out some form of reimbursement for the Rural City of Mildura council's legal and other costs in opposing the LTCF. [...] "The general rule is that people bear their own costs, that {{is most likely to}} apply in this case ... but I've indicated and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> talk to the council and mayor about the whole issue of how Mildura moves forward and I'll do that," [...] John Thwaites said.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{deploying}} to Iraq Smith {{had written}} to his parents, [...] "There {{are two ways to}} come home, stepping off the plane and being carried off the plane. It doesn't matter how I come home, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give all that I am to ensure that all my boys make it home." [...] Smith was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Gulf of Mexico, where he loved to fish. He has a memorial marker in Arlington National Cemetery Arlington, Virginia and his marker can be found in memorial Section D, lot 67. He also has a memorial at his high school outside of the schools NJROTC building.|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2009 poll, Bunning's {{approval}} rating was just 28%, and he trailed the four most likely Democratic candidates in hypothetical contests. 54% {{of voters in}} the state disapproved of Bunning's performance. [...] Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson announced on April 30, 2009, that he would form an exploratory committee to run for Bunning's seat. It was speculated {{that this was a}} precursor to Bunning's retirement. [...] "He (Bunning) told Trey to do this", one senior congressional official said of Bunning. [...] "Why else would he tell his main rival to prepare for a run?" [...] However, Bunning said at a Lincoln Day dinner in Kentucky on 9 May that he still planned to run: [...] "The battle is going to be long, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> fight for my values." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Burgess {{published}} Flame into Being: The Life and Work of D. H. Lawrence, {{and while}} discussing Lady Chatterley's Lover in his biography, Burgess compared that novel's notoriety with A Clockwork Orange: [...] "We all {{suffer from the}} popular desire to make the known notorious. The book I am best known for, or only known for, is a novel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> repudiate: written {{a quarter of a}} century ago, a jeu d'esprit knocked off for money in three weeks, it became known as the raw material for a film which seemed to glorify sex and violence. The film made it easy for readers of the book to misunderstand what it was about, and the misunderstanding will pursue me until I die. I should not have written the book because of this danger of misinterpretation, and the same may be said of Lawrence and Lady Chatterley's Lover." [...] Burgess has also dismissed A Clockwork Orange as [...] "too didactic to be artistic".|$|E

2500|$|He also regretted Burke's {{attacks on}} Fox and Pitt's {{objection}} to Fox in a possible coalition government. In {{the aftermath of}} the Battle of Valmy (20 September) and the retreat of the counter-revolutionary armies, Burke and other conservative Whigs claimed that the Whigs must now be explicitly anti-French, {{even to the point of}} war. In late November Thomas Grenville wrote to Fitzwilliam and said that he spoke of [...] "giving greater latitude to the principle of interference in internal governments of foreign countries, than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give". When France announced that King Louis XVI was to put on trial, Pitt recalled Parliament by calling out the militia, an action Fitzwilliam thought unwarranted and designed to curry favour with conservative Whigs. He also viewed Fox's toasts to the rights of people as the only legitimate form of government as provocative at that moment, writing on 6 December: [...] "I by no means like him". At a meeting of leading Whigs at Burlington House on 11 December, Fitzwilliam tried to conciliate Fox in his desire to oppose the government. On 15 December Fox advocated recognising the French Republic and Fitzwilliam resisted pressure from conservative Whig MPs to split from Fox, supporting the Duke of Portland's attempts to keep the party together. With the mass-resignation from the Whig Club of Burke and other conservative Whig MPs, Fitzwilliam wrote to Lady Rockingham on 28 February 1793 and spoke of the Whig party split into three factions: those who wholeheartedly support the Revolution; those who wholeheartedly condemn it, support the government and wish for a war to destroy it; and the third (which Fitzwilliam identified with) [...] "thinking French principles...wicked and formidable, are ready to resist them" [...] by supporting the government's [...] "measures of vigour" [...] but [...] "engaging for nothing further". The Friends of the People were responsible for the split, Fitzwilliam contended.|$|E
