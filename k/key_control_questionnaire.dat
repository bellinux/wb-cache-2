The South African local {{government}} environment {{has a number}} of cross-cutting legislation in place to govern its portfolio over municipalities. This field is a much specialised area of expertise as each function is customised to its environment based on the policies and procedures taken from the legislation as a guide to minimise risk in a municipality. The SA Constitution (1996), Chapter 7 on {{local government}}, governs the autonomy of each municipality. The main legislation encompassed to ensure that the municipal control environment is in place is found in the Municipal Financial Management Act (MFMA) (56 of 2003). Since its implementation, the focus was to ensure sound and sustainable management of the financial affairs of a municipality and its entities, as well as to establish treasury norms and standards for the local sphere of government, and to provide for matters connected therewith. The matters connected therewith are not stated. It {{is for this reason that}} the research was undertaken to show the importance of the entire internal control environment that impacts on the clean audit opinion received from the Auditor-General of South Africa (AGSA). The analysis obtained, showed that more emphasis are placed on financial management when it is the area of leadership, compliance to laws and regulations and pre-determined objectives (performance management) that are also key and are weighted the same as financial management, to obtain a clean audit report. In addition, this study was conducted to test the hypothesis, namely the weaknesses in the internal control environment within the municipality. Information was obtained from five groups by means of one-on-one interviews and hand delivered questionnaires. Group 1, 2 and 3 consisted of ten political office bearers in the political management team (executive mayor, speaker of council, chief-whip of council and mayoral committee members), councilors, and ten from the senior management (executive of the administration level 1 - 3). Group 4 and 5 (level 4 - 12 respectively) consisted of ten officials not in management positions. The questionnaire comprised of six sections of questions (governance controls, financial management controls, predetermined objectives/performance management, leadership controls, cluster specific controls and general and other information on controls), that was aimed at determining the extent of experience, knowledge and attitude of the respondent towards planning, implementing, reviewing, monitoring, assessing, documenting and response towards their internal control environment within each specific department, and the legal responsibility on political office bearers oversight role. The analysis of the results indicated clearly that the overall understanding of internal controls differed per group. The planning, implementing, reviewing, monitoring, assessing, documenting and response to internal controls for non-management officials were unclear, but their awareness towards a clean audit was understood. Respondents in the political executive and the administration were more aware of their responsibilities and accountabilities towards internal control and the important task of achieving a clean audit. However, they acknowledged that the questionnaire made them aware of more aspects from a compliance perspective to be performed by the administration. The executive of the administration acknowledged that limited emphasis is made on internal controls to detect weaknesses. The analysis also proved that more emphasis and priority must be placed on internal controls from the respondents. The results are supported by the AGSAs intervention with the implementation of the <b>key</b> <b>control</b> <b>questionnaire</b> within the municipality to ensure that weaknesses in the internal control can be identified and corrected at an earlier stage before the audit starts. The importance of internal controls during the analysis has proven that process management is an important attribute and tool for internal controls in achieving a clean audit. Other municipalities might benefit from this study as it provides key points towards a clean audit that highlight the importance of leadership, performance management, planning and governance and embracing diversity as a strategic move towards financial sustainability and management towards the achievement of a clean.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to examine how the Monitoring Activities {{component}} of the COSO Framework can be applied and implemented in a publicly traded company. The {{purpose of the}} monitoring component of the COSO Framework is to ensure the effectiveness of internal controls within an organization. This thesis will contribute {{to the understanding of the}} practical implications of the implementation of the monitoring activities. The thesis is carried out as a single case study with a constructive research approach in a Finnish based case company operating in both production and retail business. During the case study most important <b>key</b> processes, <b>key</b> <b>control</b> requirements and <b>key</b> <b>controls</b> are identified.

So effect of atrovastatin in chronic asthma patient was studied in TB and chest department of Tertiary care hospital of central India.  Objective : The effect of Atorvastatin on lung function and sputum cell count in chronic Asthma. Material and Methods: In randomized,parallel,double blind placebo {{controlled clinical trial}} 60 chronic asthma patients who were taking inhaled corticosteroids were to receive either Atrovastatin or placebo for 12 weeks. Pulmonary function test, sputum cell count & lipid profile were done.   Result: With Atorvastatin significant improvement in ACQ(asthma <b>control</b> <b>questionnaire),</b> significant decrease in SCC(sputum cell count) & significant reduction in risk of asthma exacerbations after 12 weeks. No significant improvement in all parameters were seen with placebo. It was observed that mean changes in ACQ, SCC were statistically significant p < 0. 05 in Atorvastatin group as compared to placebo group, but mean changes in FEV 1 (pre) and FEV 1 (post),PEFR {{were not statistically significant}} at 12 weeks between the 2 groups. Conclusion: Atorvastatin significantly improved asthma control according to asthma <b>control</b> <b>questionnaires</b> & reduced risk of asthma exacerbations correlated with reduction in sputum cell count.

40|$|Multi-party key {{agreement}} protocols indirectly {{assume that}} each principal equally {{contributes to the}} final form of the key. In this paper we consider three malleability attacks on multi-party key agreement protocols. The first attack, called strong <b>key</b> <b>control</b> allows a dishonest principal (or a group of principals) to fix {{the key to a}} pre-set value. The second attack is weak <b>key</b> <b>control</b> in which the key is still random, but the set from which the key is drawn is much smaller than expected. The third attack is named selective <b>key</b> <b>control</b> in which a dishonest principal (or a group of dishonest principals) is able to remove a contribution of honest principals to the group key. The paper discusses the above three attacks on several key agreement protocols, including DH (Diffie-Hellman), BD (Burmester-Desmedt) and JV (Just-Vaudenay). We show that dishonest principals in all three protocols can weakly <b>control</b> the <b>key,</b> and the only protocol which does not allow for strong <b>key</b> <b>control</b> is the DH protocol. The BD and JV protocols permit to modify the group key by any pair of neighboring principals. This modification remains undetected by honest principals...|$|R

The YAK protocol is {{a variant of the}} two-pass HMQV protocol, but uses zero-knowledge proofs for proving knowledge of ephemeral values. In this paper, we show that the YAK protocol lacks joint <b>key</b> <b>control</b> and perfect forward secrecy attributes, and is vulnerable to some attacks including unknown key-share and key-replication attacks. This invalidates the semantic security of the protocol in several security models. There are also other considerations regarding the impersonation and small subgroup attacks.
