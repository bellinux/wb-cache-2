Such heterogeneous message transfers can be structured using the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), which allows a flexible common data exchange. Parsers {{have been developed}} to check syntax of component interactions, but there are as yet no techniques for checking the semantic correctness of the interactions. This paper presents a technique for using mutation analysis to test the semantic correctness of XMLbased component interactions. In this paper, the web software interactions are specified using an Interaction Specification Model (ISM) that consists of document type <b>definitions,</b> <b>messaging</b> specifications, and a set of constraints. Test cases are XML messages that are passed between the web software components. Classes of interaction-specific mutation operators are introduced and applied to the ISM to generate mutant interactions and test cases. 1...|$|R

The algorithm is then sometimes called [...] "loopy" [...] belief propagation, because graphs typically contain cycles, or loops. The initialization and scheduling of message updates must be adjusted slightly (compared with the previously described schedule for acyclic graphs) because graphs might not contain any leaves. Instead, one initializes all variable messages to 1 and uses the same <b>message</b> <b>definitions</b> above, updating all messages at every iteration (although messages coming from known leaves or tree-structured subgraphs may no longer need updating after sufficient iterations).

40|$|There is a {{multitude}} of seller-centric e-marketplaces in the Business-to-Business Electronic Commerce (B 2 B EC) environment. As the name implies, they are not organized from the buying organization 2 ̆ 7 s point of view. Thus, the buying organization needs to define a buyer-centric directory from the external e-marketplaces. This is particularly important in desk-top purchasing systems that use the internalized e-catalog. Recently, the one-to-one e-catalog approach is attempted to allow the buyer to select a sub-directory from a seller 2 ̆ 7 s directory. Although this is a helpful screening capability, there are still several problems to be resolved such as the mismatched level of details, directory depths unbalance, and changed category names. In addition, the integration with multiple sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs and maintaining consistency with the dynamically changing sellers 2 ̆ 7 e-catalogs should be supported. To overcome these problems, we adopt the logic programming approach because it can represent the structures of both buyers 2 ̆ 7 and sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. Predicates as <b>directory</b> <b>definition</b> language can effectively represent the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s extraction of relevant parts from sellers 2 ̆ 7 directories. The crudely selected directory can be modified using five directory modification rules. To control the application of these rules, we devised a top-down control algorithm. The algorithm could improve the depth and balance of the directory significantly, which will result in automatically generating more effective buyer 2 ̆ 7 s directory...|$|R
