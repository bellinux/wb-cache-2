5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand {{ambulances}} {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount offensive weapons, military ambulances are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as ambulances as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military ambulances are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E

500|$|Bart and Milhouse have {{to remain}} inside The Simpsons house when an ozone hole moves over Springfield. The two dress up as ladies and jump on the bed, singing [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves". When Homer comes in abruptly, Bart falls off {{of the bed and}} lands on one of Homer's bowling balls and breaks his coccyx. Dr. Hibbert informs Homer and Marge that Bart will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> {{wheelchair}} until the bone has healed. When Bart arrives at Springfield Elementary School the following day, he finds that he cannot enter because the school lacks ramps for the disabled. As Principal Skinner considers a ramp for the school, mafia boss Fat Tony emerges and suggests that his construction company would be a good choice of company to build it. Although the new ramp system almost immediately collapses, Fat Tony informs Skinner that the construction supposedly cost US$200,000 and that the school will still have to pay. In response, Principal Skinner decides to close Springfield Elementary due to lack of funds (having used them to pay off Fat Tony and thus avoid brutal mob reprisals).|$|E

2500|$|In {{real-world}} situations, {{stations are}} often constrained by limited space, legacy designs, and track geometry or roadway layout. [...] Stations may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> compromise design, with a platform curved {{in a way}} that will allow a vehicle or train to arrive and depart without mechanical interference, but which leaves unavoidable horizontal and possibly vertical gaps between the cars and the platform edge. [...] These spaces are caused by the geometric gap between a curve (circular arc or otherwise) and the straight-line chord or tangent formed by a railcar or bus in proximity to a platform. [...] These types of gaps are geometrically intrinsic, and cannot be eliminated as long as the platform is located on a curved or banked segment of track or guideway.|$|E

2500|$|Some partial limited-access divided {{highways}} {{such as the}} Hanlon Parkway and Black Creek Drive have stop-controlled at-grade intersections {{and private}} entrances, but have sufficient right-of-way to convert them to full freeways with interchanges if traffic warrants. However, some older divided highways like the Trans-Canada north of Victoria BC are on relatively narrow road allowances that make any future grade separation almost completely unfeasible, regardless of traffic volumes and speeds. There are also RIRO expressways, such as Highway 11 and a portion of Highway 35, which are not full freeways since they allow access to existing properties, but traffic speeds are faster than regular roads due to a median barrier preventing left turns (motorists <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> [...] "turnabout" [...] overpass to access exits on the opposing direction). Speed limits in Canada are usually 80 to 90 km/h on signalized divided highways and 100 to 120 km/h on freeways.|$|E
2500|$|Mobilization for World War II, {{which began}} in the United States in 1940, led to the {{establishment}} of a southern approach route to the bridge. The War Department, which controlled Arlington National Cemetery, announced that it would use the land east of the cemetery for rapid expansion of military training facilities and new office space. To accommodate traffic to this area, Secretary of War Harry Hines Woodring agreed in May 1940 to give the state of Virginia a [...] wide easement for a new, wide road extending from the cemetery's south boundary northwest to Columbia Island. In October 1940, Congress passed legislation authorizing the War Department to purchase Washington-Hoover Airport This legislation, however, provided formal approval of the roadway easement for construction of a second Arlington Memorial Bridge approach. An unnamed sourced suggested in February 1941 that a portion of Boundary Channel near the under-construction Pentagon be filled in so that the new road did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>a</b> bridge to connect to the George Washington Memorial Parkway and Arlington Memorial Bridge. The CFA asked military engineers to study this proposal.|$|E
