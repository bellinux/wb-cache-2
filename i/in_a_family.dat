5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E

5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin.

Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E

Antônio Neto made great {{efforts to provide}} Honório Hermeto with an education of much higher quality than would normally have been expected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of their limited financial means. The promotion to captain in 1819 increased Antônio Neto's income, allowing his eldest son to go to Portugal and enroll in the University of Coimbra's law school in 1820, thus ending Honório Hermeto's brief military career. He was an excellent student and struck up acquaintances among his fellow Brazilians in Coimbra, including Paulino Soares de Sousa (who {{would become one of}} his greatest allies and later the 1st Viscount of Uruguai) and Aureliano de Sousa Oliveira Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{numerical}} treatment of bifurcation problems {{one of the}} main tasks is to control the spectrum of matrices <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parametrized <b>family.</b> If the original problem possesses symmetry, then the matrices are additionally equivariant.

We classify the generic eigenvalue behavior <b>in</b> such <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of equivariant matrices by the type of underlying symmetry...|$|R
5|$|Charlie's first notable storyline was {{a lesbian}} {{relationship}} with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children, and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children {{should not be}} exposed to same-sex relationships <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great one to portray in terms of acting.|$|E
