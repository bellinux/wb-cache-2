25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVapor {{deposited}} multilayered aluminum/oxide and bimetallics {{are promising}} materials for Micro Electro Mechanical System technologies as energy carriers, for instance, microinitiators or heat microsources in biological or chemical applications. Among these materials, the Al/Ni couple has received much attention both experimentally and theoretically. However, the detailed {{relation between the}} chemical composition of the intermixed interfacial regions {{and its impact on}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>capabilities</b> remains elusive. In this contribution, we propose a twofold strategy combining atomistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and a macroscopic 1 D model of chemical kinetics. The DFT calculations allow the description of the elementary chemical processes (involving Al, Ni atoms and vacancies basic ingredients) and to parameterize the macroscopic model, in which the system is described as a stack of infinite layers. This gives the temporal evolution of the system composition and temperature. We demonstrate that the amount of vacancies, originating from the deposition process and the Al and Ni lattice mismatch, plays a critical role on both the ignition time and the temperature. The presence of vacancies enhances the migration of atoms between layers and so dramatically speeds up the atomic mixing at low temperatures far below ignition temperature, also pointing to the relation between experimental deposition procedures and ageing of the nanolaminates.

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} use of gas turbine engines, any {{performance}} improvements would yield significant impacts to many military and civilian programs. While hardware upgrades require costly replacements to existing equipment, fuel performance enhancement could provide a near term cost effective solution. This thesis research focused on the development and qualification of a suitable test stand system to provide bench testing of nanocatalyst additives for jet fuels on a fullscale tactical gas turbine engine. A Williams International F- 121 fanjet engine was acquired and set up as the centerpiece component for the desired test stand. The required auxiliary systems and sensor equipment were designed and constructed. Initial baseline performance of the test stand and F- 121 engine were demonstrated.

Because this <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> can meet the demands of a gas-detonation-driver shock tunnel and it doesn't require additional facilities, the hot turbulent jet initiation method can be applied to large hydrogen-oxygen detonation-driver shock tunnels.

40|$|A {{technology}} {{program was}} started in 1994 {{within the framework of}} the German Aeronautics Research Program to develop axial staged combustor technology up to a core engine demonstrator. The objective was to demonstrate a 50 % NOx reduction against the ICAO CAEP II limit without any compromise on the CO, UHC and smoke emission level compared to the latest single annular combustor technology. All other requirements, like <b>ignition</b> and relight <b>capability,</b> stability, durability and turbine inlet temperature traverse, were set equal to today’s state-of-the-art combustors. The combustor cooling concept chosen was of the angled effusion type. Development of adequate modeling techniques and steady-state and transient rig tests to calibrate the thermal models was the key factor for the success of the project. Despite the 15 % increase in cooled surface, the overall combustor flow fraction required for cooling was reduced by 15 % without any change in the combustor liner material from that of the in-service single annular combustor of the BR 715. The axially staged combustor technology developed in the described program enables RR Deutschland to offer a staged combustor for the BR 715 within the usual timescale of an engine certification process.

40|$|Helium (He) nanodroplets {{irradiated}} by intense near-infrared laser pulses form a nanoplasma by avalanche-like electron impact ionizations even {{at lower}} laser intensities where He {{is not directly}} field ionized, provided that the droplets contain a few dopant atoms which provide seed electrons for the electron impact ionization avalanche. In this theoretical paper on calcium and xenon doped He droplets we elucidate the mechanism which induces ionization avalanches, termed ignition. We find that the partial loss of seed electrons from the activated droplets starkly assists ignition, as the Coulomb barrier for ionization of helium is lowered by the electric field of the dopant cations, and this deshielding of the cation charges enhances their electric field. In addition, the dopant ions assist the acceleration of the seed electrons (slingshot effect) by the laser field, supporting electron impact ionizations of He and also causing electron loss by catapulting electrons away. The dopants' ability to lower the Coulomb barriers at He {{as well as the}} slingshot effect decrease with the spatial expansion of the dopant, causing a dependence of the dopants' <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> on the dopant mass. Here, we develop criteria (impact count functions) to assess the <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> of dopants, based on (i) the spatial overlap of the seed electron cloud with the He atoms and (ii) the overlap of their kinetic energy distribution with the distribution of Coulomb barrier heights at He. The relatively long time delays between the instants of dopant ionization and ignition (incubation times) for calcium doped droplets are determined to a large extent by {{the time it takes to}} deshield the dopant ions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the task reported herein was to define, evaluate, and optimize variable geometry concepts suitable for use with a Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor.

40|$|Understanding {{impurity}} transport in the scrape-o layer (SOL) of tokamak plasmas is {{a necessary}} piece of devel-oping the physics basis for designing next-generation reactors. A system for inferring impurity transport parallel and perpendicular to local magnetic eld lines has been developed on Alcator C-Mod using gas-injection ". In this system, impurity gas is injected at a xed position in the SOL via a reciprocating fast-scanning probe, and the resulting emission is imaged. In this paper visible light emission patterns from C+ 1 and C+ 2 ions are presented. The transport of impurities (dened as any material {{which is not the}} primary fusion fuel) along and across magnetic eld lines in the edge plasma of a tokamak reactor is of fundamental importance to reactor operation. Impurities will always be present in a reactor due to the sputtering of materials from plasma-facing components. Impurities may also be injected externally in a controlled manner for operational or diagnostic purposes. Whether those impurities remain contained near the walls or end up in the plasma core can determine both a reactor’s <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> as well as its overall performance.

In this work, numerical study of the ignition process in gas turbines from the energy deposit to the light-around is performed with several objectives: increase the level of confidence of Large Eddy Simulations tool for the analysis of the ignition process, investigate the mechanisms controlling ignition in conditions representative of realistic aeronautical gas turbine flows and improve the low-order methodologies for the prediction of ignition performance.

Driven by future NO_x emissions requirements and the corresponding emissions goals a NO_x reduction down to 49 % CAEPII C 1 for the ICAO take-off - landing cycle was achieved for the current E 3 EII engine cycle. The required cooling air reduction was obtained by application of optimised impingement effusion cooled tiles for the combustor liner cooling. The focus of {{the research}} and development work was given to the lean module burner which initially was conceived for an application within an axially staged combustor. During the course of the project due to cost and weight reasons the single annular combustor concept was favoured. Therefore the demands on the main burner in respect to operability were tightened which lead to the need for an integrated pilot zone within the lean module burner. An internally staged lean module burner was designed in collaboration with a fuel spray nozzle manufacturer. Within a fully annular combustor rig a prototype burner was successfully tested under simulated engine conditions. The emissions performance as well as the thermal load onto the combustor walls were investigated.

Pre-chamber spark plugs are identified as a promising means of achieving turbulent jet ignition as they require minimal engine modification with respect to component packaging in cylinder head and the ignition system. Detailed experiments were performed with a 6 cylinder 9. 4 liter turbo-charged engine equipped with multi-point gas injection system to compare performance and emissions characteristics of operation with pre-chamber and conventional spark plug. The results indicate that <b>ignition</b> <b>capability</b> is significantly enhanced as flame development angle and combustion duration are reduced by upto 30 % compared to those with conventional spark plugs at certain operating points. Maximum possible dilution (limited by combustion stability index, Coefficient of Variation (COV) of Gross Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEPg)) with excess air and EGR were investigated experimentally at engine speed of 1500 rpm and 5, 12 and 18 bar IMEPg operating load and {{results indicate that the}} lean limit is extended by 0. 8 - 1 Lambda unit and 5 - 8 % EGR rate units. It was also observed that pre-chamber spark plugs cause charge pre-ignition at loads exceeding 10 - 12 bar IMEPg. To avoid this, the minimum amount of dilution, with excess air and then EGR, which is required to operate above 10 bar IMEPg was estimated experimentally. Finally, to compare performance and emission characteristics of operation with these two ignition techniques, the engine was tested on an ESC-like (European Stationary Cycle) 12 mode cycle. Results indicated marginal reduction in cycle averaged NOx emissions with maximum excess air dilution and about 50 % reduction with maximum EGR dilution, whereas CO and HC emissions increased.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program was to develop low-emissions, {{efficient}} fuel-flexible combustion technology which enables operation of a given gas turbine on {{a wider range of}} opportunity fuels that lie outside of current natural gas-centered fuel specifications. The program encompasses a selection of important, representative fuels of opportunity for gas turbines with widely varying fundamental properties of combustion. The research program covers conceptual and detailed combustor design, fabrication, and testing of retrofitable and/or novel fuel-flexible gas turbine combustor hardware, specifically advanced fuel nozzle technology, at full-scale gas turbine combustor conditions. This project was performed over the period of October 2008 through September 2011 under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 08 NT 05868 for the U. S. Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory (USDOE/NETL) entitled "Fuel Flexible Combustion Systems for High-Efficiency Utilization of Opportunity Fuels in Gas Turbines". The overall objective of this program was met with great success. GE was able to successfully demonstrate the operability of two fuel-flexible combustion nozzles over a wide range of opportunity fuels at heavy-duty gas turbine conditions while meeting emissions goals. The GE MS 6000 B (" 6 B") gas turbine engine was chosen as the target platform for new fuel-flexible premixer development. Comprehensive conceptual design and analysis of new fuel-flexible premixing nozzles were undertaken. Gas turbine cycle models and detailed flow network models of the combustor provide the premixer conditions (temperature, pressure, pressure drops, velocities, and air flow splits) and illustrate the impact of widely varying fuel flow rates on the combustor. Detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms were employed to compare some fundamental combustion characteristics of the target fuels, including flame speeds and lean blow-out behavior. Perfectly premixed combustion experiments were conducted to provide experimental combustion data of our target fuels at gas turbine conditions. Based on an initial assessment of premixer design requirements and challenges, the most promising sub-scale premixer concepts were evaluated both experimentally and computationally. After comprehensive screening tests, two best performing concepts were scaled up for further development. High pressure single nozzle tests were performed with the scaled premixer concepts at target gas turbine conditions with opportunity fuels. Single-digit NOx emissions were demonstrated for syngas fuels.
