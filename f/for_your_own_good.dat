[...] "Mama" [...] was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] in March 1997, timed not only for the Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1995, {{the trio}} {{recorded}} their second EP, It's <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good,</b> {{which appeared in}} the following June. The six-track EP was co-produced by Lindsay Gravina (Underground Lovers, Cosmic Psychos), Mike Alonso (Jericho) and The Living End for the Rapido label. It included their first radio airplay hit, [...] "From Here on In", which was placed on high rotation by national youth radio network, Triple J. Shortly after, Piripitzi was fired as his lifestyle choices were holding back the band. He was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey (later in The Knockout Drops). With Demsey the group appeared at major festivals: Pushover and the Falls Festival. Demsey's drum style was compared with The Who's Keith Moon. [...] "From Here on In" [...] was used on the soundtrack for the 1998 film, Occasional Course Language.|$|E

L. at I, Dorotheergasse 6, Vienna; an address that I recommend your taking a note of; and I {{have also made}} the reflection that the fury, or whatever, that Edinburgh inspires you with ought, you know, to do the very opposite of drying up the founts of your genius in writing to me--since you say your letter would have been other (as it truly might have been longer) didn't you suffer so from all that surrounds you. That's the very most juvenile logic possible--and the juvenility of it (which yet in a manner touches me) is why I call you retrogressive--by way of a long stroke of endearment. There was exactly an admirable matter for you to write me about--a matter as to which you are strongly and abundantly feeling; and in a relation which lives on communication as ours surely should, and would (save for starving,) such occasions fertilise. However, of course the terms are easy on which you extract communication from me, and always have been, and always will be--so that there's doubtless {{a point of view}} from which your reservations (another fine word) are quite right. I'm glad at any rate that you've been reading Balzac (whose [...] "romantic" [...] side is rot!) and a great contemporary of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> even in his unconsidered trifles. I've just been reading Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street and finding in it an unexpected amount of talent and life. Really a very interesting and remarkable performance, I think, in spite of a considerable, or large, element of waste and irresponsibility--selection isn't in him--and at one and the same time so extremely young (he too) and so confoundingly mature. It has the feature of improving so as it goes on, and disposes me much to read, if I can, its immediate predecessor. You must tell me again what you know of him (I've forgotten what you did tell me, more or less,) but in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>good</b> time. I think--I mean I blindly feel--I should be with you about Auld Reekie--which somehow hasn't a right to be so handsome. But I long <b>for</b> illustrations--at <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>good</b> time. We have emerged from a very clear and quiet Xmas--quiet for me, save for rather a large assault of correspondence. It weighs on me still, so this is what I call--and you will too--very brief.... I wish you the very decentest New Year that ever was. Yours, dearest boy, all affectionately, ...|$|R

Let me tell you, your wife's good name is more endangered by your stubbornness than anything else.|$|R
2500|$|Chris Cheney and Owen, on {{piano and}} double bass, were in The Runaway Boys. In 1994, the pair started {{to write their}} own {{material}} and were joined by Joe Piripitzi on drums to form The Living End. They released two successive extended plays, Hellbound (1995) and It's <b>for</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good</b> (November 1996), which contained their first radio single, [...] "From Here on In". The track is co-written by Cheney and Owen. In 1996 while Green Day were touring Australia, The Living End sent their second EP to the band, and supported them on their tour, which then led to radio station, Triple J, playing their first single. Late that year Piripitzi was replaced on drums by Travis Demsey. In September 1997 The Living End issued a third EP, Second Solution / Prisoner of Society, with four of its five tracks written by Cheney. The EP peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It became the highest selling Australian-made 'single' for the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The Swiss {{childhood}} researcher Alice Miller gave Hitler {{a section}} in her 1980 published book <b>For</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Good.</b> Miller owed her knowledge about Hitler to biographic and pathographic {{works such as}} those by Rudolf Olden (1935), Konrad Heiden (1936/37), Franz Jetzinger (1958), Joachim Fest (1973), Helm Stierlin (1975), and John Toland (1976). She wrote that the family setting in which Hitler grew up was not only dominated by an authoritarian and often brutal father, Alois Hitler, but could be characterized as [...] "prototype of a totalitarian regime". She wrote that Hitler’s hate-ridden and destructive personality, that later made millions of people suffer, emerged under the humiliating and degrading treatment and the beating that he received from his father as a child. Miller believes that the mother, whose first three children died at an early age, was barely capable of fostering a warm relationship to her son. She posits that Hitler early on identified with his tyrannical father, and later transferred the trauma of his parental home onto Germany; his contemporaries followed him willingly because they had experienced a childhood that was very similar.|$|E
