2500|$|As well {{as being}} {{painstakingly}} restored by enthusiasts to accurate wartime specification, the M20 has also been developed by specialists for speed trials. A 1938 BSA M20 ridden by Bill Jenkins from Dallas achieved {{a top speed of}} 108mph at Bonneville Salt Flats making it the fastest M20 for this venue in the world. The original side-valve engine was extensively modified and fuelled with nitrous oxide. [...] The intake port fed by the carburetor, originally horizontal, was re-drilled at a steep angle into the cylinder casting so it pointed up at the underside of the <b>intake</b> <b>valve.</b> The motorcycle did however retain the long BSA prop stand that hinged under the seat and clipped to the rear mudguard when not in use [...] so it looked like a stock M20. [...] In October 1995 an M20 fitted with a BSA Gold Star [...] crankshaft sprocket and running on a 95% methanol / 5% acetone mix ridden by Pat Jeal achieved a terminal speed of 112mph at the disused airfield of RAF Elvington, Yorkshire.|$|E
5000|$|Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> earlier than normal. This involves closing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closing is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> openingEarly <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> opening {{is another}} {{variation}} that has significant potential to reduce emissions. In a traditional engine, {{a process called}} valve overlap is used to aid in controlling the cylinder temperature. By opening the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> early, some of the inert/combusted exhaust gas will back flow out of the cylinder, via the <b>intake</b> <b>valve,</b> where it cools momentarily in the intake manifold. This inert gas then fills the cylinder in the subsequent intake stroke, which aids in controlling {{the temperature of the}} cylinder and nitric oxide emissions. It also improves volumetric efficiency, because there is less exhaust gas to be expelled on the exhaust stroke.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} motorcycle engines had {{exhaust valves}} operated {{in the same}} way as a side-valve engine, but they had overhead intake valves held closed by a weak spring. The <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> was opened by the suction caused by the intake stroke. As the need for mechanical control of the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> arose, the design was modified by adding another cam to the camshaft and using a pushrod and rocker arm to operate the <b>intake</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{very high}} engine loads, AVCS {{advances}} the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> further to open even sooner during the exhaust stroke. This produces a scavenging effect - that is, intake airflow helps clear the cylinder of exhaust gas. It also closes the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> sooner on the compression stroke. This results in improved volumetric efficiency {{and helps to}} generate higher power output.|$|R
50|$|The I-Active Valve Lift System (i {{stands for}} intelligence) or i-AVLS is a {{valvetrain}} technology implemented by Subaru in the 2.5L naturally aspirated engines SOHC to improve emissions, efficiency and performance. Note that AVLS {{is different from}} AVCS used on other Subaru engines. AVLS improves performance and efficiency by changing which camshaft is operating {{which of the two}} <b>intake</b> <b>valves.</b> The camshafts on all AVLS Subaru engines have specially designed lobes for <b>intake</b> <b>valves.</b> They feature two different cam profiles: a low/mid lift profile or a high lift profile. The two <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> in each cylinder are operated by a rocker arm with its own cam lobe. The cam utilized is selected by the Engine Control Unit (ECU). To select different valve lift modes, oil pressure generated by the engine moves a pin which locks the two lobes together. At low engine speeds the low/mid lift camshafts increases the speed of air rushing into the engine thereby increasing torque and efficiency. At higher engine speeds the high lift camshafts fully open the <b>intake</b> <b>valves,</b> reducing resistance to incoming air and improving power. AVLS only operates one of the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> in each cylinder as the other is always open to promote swirl.|$|R

50|$|A mass of air (working fluid) {{is drawn}} into the cylinder, from 0 to 1, at {{atmospheric}} pressure (constant pressure) through the open <b>intake</b> <b>valve,</b> while the exhaust valve is closed during this process. The <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes at point 1.|$|E
50|$|The two {{corrections}} for {{dynamic compression}} ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions, {{but not in}} equal strength. An engine with high static compression ratio and late <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closure will have a DCR similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closure.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{commonly}} related that [...] "stand off" [...] (air-fuel mix that gets pushed {{back out of}} the port, usually at full throttle / low rpm) is somehow captured by installing a longer intake pipe (stack). but, it is actually that the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is closing too late and the combustion chamber is simply overfilling and blowing back out the intake port, before the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes. A longer inlet pipe will create a later intake pressure wave that will help keep the air in the chamber until the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes.|$|E

5000|$|How hit-and-miss engines work: The <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> on hit-and-miss engines has no actuator; instead, a light spring {{holds the}} <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closed unless a vacuum in the {{cylinder}} draws it open. This vacuum only occurs if the exhaust valve is closed during the piston's down-stroke. When the hit-and-miss engine is operating above its set speed, the governor holds the exhaust valve open, preventing a vacuum in the cylinder and causing the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> to remain closed, thus interrupting the Otto cycle firing mechanism. When {{the engine is}} operating at or below its set speed, the governor allows the exhaust valve to close. On the next down-stroke a vacuum in the cylinder will open the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> and let the fuel-air mixture enter. This mechanism prevents fuel consumption during the intake stroke of [...] "miss" [...] cycles.|$|E
50|$|In the Miller-cycle engine, {{the piston}} begins to {{compress}} the fuel-air mixture {{only after the}} <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes; and the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total piston travel of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open <b>intake</b> <b>valve,</b> {{and back into the}} intake manifold.|$|E

50|$|Two {{distinct}} cam profiles {{are used}} to provide two engine modes: a low-speed mode, consisting of low-lift cam profiles; and a high-speed mode. The low-lift cams and rocker arms - which drive separate <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> - are positioned {{on either side of}} a centrally located high-lift cam. Each of the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> is operated by a low-lift cam and rocker arm, while placing a T-lever between them allows the valves to follow the action of the high-lift cam.|$|R
5000|$|In the Miller cycle, the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is {{left open}} {{longer than it}} would be in an Otto-cycle engine. In effect, the {{compression}} stroke is two discrete cycles: the initial portion when the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is open and final portion when the <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> is closed. This two-stage intake stroke creates the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] stroke that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston initially moves upwards in what is traditionally the compression stroke, the charge is partially expelled back out through the still-open <b>intake</b> <b>valve.</b> Typically, this loss of charge air would result in a loss of power. However, in the Miller cycle, this is compensated for by the use of a supercharger. The supercharger typically will need to be of the positive-displacement (Roots or screw) type due to its ability to produce boost at relatively low engine speeds. Otherwise, low-rpm power will suffer.|$|E

50|$|During low-rpm operation, {{only one}} <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> opens, {{allowing}} air and fuel into the combustion chamber. The other <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> {{has only a}} slight amount of lift and its timing is staggered. As a result, the air-fuel charge drawn through the open <b>intake</b> <b>valve</b> undergoes a swirl effect. The swirl creates a stratified charge with a rich mixture near the spark plug for good light-off, and a progressively leaner mixture toward its periphery. This stratified charge, combined with improved EGR control, results in lower emissions especially during the critical warm-up period, and better fuel economy. Low-friction, roller-bearing rocker arms are used to help reduce friction and improve engine efficiency.|$|E

50|$|By {{retarding}} the cams at idle or {{very low}} engine loads, you achieve a smoother, easier idle. From idle through medium engine loads, AVCS advances the <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> to begin opening {{during the last}} part of the exhaust stroke, when the exhaust valves are still slightly open. Some of the pressure created during the exhaust stroke flows into the intake manifold, having the effect of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). The <b>intake</b> <b>valves</b> also close earlier during the intake stroke. This helps with engine efficiency and fuel economy.|$|R
