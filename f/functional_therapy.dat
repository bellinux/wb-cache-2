40|$|Introduction. New neurorehabilitation {{together}} with conventional techniques provide methods and technologies for maximizing what is preserved from the sensory motor system after cerebrovascular insult. The rehabilitation technique named <b>functional</b> electrical <b>therapy</b> {{was investigated in}} more than 60 patients in acute, subacute and chronic phase after cerebrovascular insult. The functional sensory information generated by <b>functional</b> electrical <b>therapy</b> was hypothesized to result in the intensive functional brain training of the activities performed. <b>Functional</b> Electrical <b>Therapy.</b> <b>Functional</b> electrical <b>therapy</b> {{is a combination of}} functional exercise and electrical <b>therapy.</b> The <b>functional</b> electrical <b>therapy</b> protocol comprises voluntary movement of the paretic arm in synchrony with the electrically assisted hand functions in order to perform typical daily activities. The daily treatment of 30 minutes lasts three weeks. The outcome measures include several tests for the evaluation of arm/hand functionality: upper extremity function test, drawing test, modified Aschworth scale, motor activity log and passive range of movement. Results of <b>Functional</b> Electrical <b>Therapy</b> Studies. Results from our several clinical studies showed that <b>functional</b> electrical <b>therapy,</b> if applied in acute and subacute stroke patients, leads to faster and greater improvement of functioning of the hemiplegic arm/hand compared to the control group.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluates the}} {{skeletal}} response to functional orthodontic therapy in growing children with hemifacial microsomia (HM). A method of classification for mandibular growth subsequent to treatment is also suggested. Materials and Methods: Sixteen growing children with unilateral HM were treated. Each patient was graded {{according to the}} skeletal, auricular, tissue (SAT) classification. Patients graded S- 4 -S- 5 were excluded because {{the severity of the}} malformation made them unsuitable for functional orthodontic treatment. All patients initially underwent a period of treatment with an asymmetrical functional activator (AFA). Results: In 7 of 16 cases (43. 7 %) classified as S- 1 -S- 2 /T- 1, regardless of the value of A, <b>functional</b> <b>therapy</b> brought about mandibular growth greater {{on the side of the}} malformation (G(3) -G(4)), re-establishing structural and functional harmony of the entire stomatognatic apparatus. Of the five cases (31. 2 %) classified as S- 2 /T- 2, four required surgical intervention at about 10 years of age after an initial period of <b>functional</b> <b>therapy</b> that produced mandibular growth classified G(1) -G(2). In the other case, functional treatment was sufficient to correct the malformation. In four patients (25 %) classified as S- 3 /T- 3 or S- 3 /T- 2, it was necessary to combine surgical treatment with <b>functional</b> <b>therapy.</b> Conclusion: Use of the AFA in growing children with HM makes it possible to induce harmonious maxillomandibular growth. Statistically, in S- 1 -S- 2 /T- 2 cases, <b>functional</b> <b>therapy</b> brings about an overall resolution of the malformation whereas in more severe cases (S- 2 /T- 2), it needs to be combined with orthodontics using fixed appliances and surgical intervention...|$|E

[12] showed that in Class II patients {{there is a significant}} increase in EMG activity in the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles during treatment with a twin block, due to an enhanced stretch reflex of the elevator muscles. Indeed, in patients in therapy with an activator, the viscoelasticity of the soft tissues generates a passive tension that has a more important role than the phasic stretch reflex during orthopaedic therapy with activators [13]. Yuen et al. [14] also showed that the effects of an activator on the neuromuscular system are due to the downward shifts of the mandible, which change the fibre lengths of the muscles.|$|R

Data (CGM, insulin injections, carbohydrates) from 12 type- 1 diabetic subjects were collected. An unconstrained optimization algorithm estimated the model’s parameters on n samples. Then, the estimated model was simulated on a set of n/ 2 samples as a cross-validation. The estimation was performed over at least 24 hours. The model-fit was very satisfactory as the mean standard deviation (SD) was 26 mg/dl.

30|$|It can be {{confirmed}} that the masticatory muscles respond positively to treatments with elastodontic appliances when {{they are used to}} bring the patient from compensatory balance to orthological balance. Indeed, during <b>functional</b> <b>therapy,</b> the elevator muscles undergo an elongation that is proportional to the amount of bite raising and mandibular protrusion [34]. When a muscle changes its length, the shape and amplitude of the motor unit change progressively [14, 35]. Before structural adaptation to the masseter muscle, this lengthening takes place, and an increased activity would act to restore the original length reflexively. This adaptation of the muscular function takes place within a relatively short period, before compensatory morphological changes can occur [7].|$|E
30|$|For this reason, a lot {{of studies}} have {{investigated}} the muscle changes during such functional treatment [17 – 32]. Hiyama et al. analysed neuromuscular adaptation to <b>functional</b> <b>therapy</b> {{through the use of}} needle EMGs [17]. Indeed, functional orthodontic appliances have been used for decades to correct skeletal malocclusions. Clinicians have suggested that the changes associated with functional appliances are due to the enhancement of muscular activity when dramatic skeletal and occlusal changes occur [29]. This, in turn, can modify mandibular and maxillary growth while guiding the eruption of teeth into more acceptable relationships [33]. However, it is still unclear how functional appliances influence the jaw muscles and mediate bony changes [34 – 36].|$|E
40|$|Question: What are physiotherapists’ {{perspectives}} on managing the cognitive, {{psychological and social}} dimensions of chronic low back pain after intensive biopsychosocial training? Design: Qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews to explore physiotherapists’ perceptions of their identification and treatment of the biopsychosocial dimensions of chronic low back pain after intensive Cognitive <b>Functional</b> <b>Therapy</b> (CFT) training. Participants: Thirteen qualified physiotherapists from four countries who had received specific CFT training. The training involved supervised implementation of CFT in clinical practice with patients. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. An interpretive descriptive analysis was performed using a qualitative software package. Results: Four main themes emerged from the data: self-reported changes in understanding and attitudes; self-reported changes in professional practice; altered scope of practice; and increased confidence and satisfaction. Participants described increased {{understanding of the nature}} of pain, the role of patient beliefs, and a new appreciation of the therapeutic alliance. Changes in practice included use of new assessments, changes in communication, and adoption of a functional approach. Since undertaking CFT training, participants described a greater awareness of their role and scope of practice as clinicians in identifying and addressing these factors. Conclusion: Physiotherapists expressed confidence in their capacity and skill set to manage the biopsychosocial dimensions of chronic low back pain after CFT training, and identified a clear role for including these skills within the physiotherapy profession. Despite this, further clinical trials are needed to justify the time and cost of training, so that intensive CFT training may be made more readily accessible to clinicians, which to date has not been the case.
