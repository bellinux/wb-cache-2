40|$|The use of dry {{malt extract}} was {{proposed}} {{in this study}} as nutritional complementation of the yeast in wine alcoholic fermentation, aiming {{for the creation of}} a new alcoholic beverage to be added to the market called “Malted Wine”. Two kinds of grape wines were synthetized: The malted wine (consisting of grape pulp, water, dry malt extract and white sugar) and a regularly supplemented wine (consisting of grape pulp, water, white sugar and synthetic nutrients) for comparative purposes.  The result was an acid, slightly salty and <b>dry</b> <b>beverage.</b> Its acceptance was higher than that of another commercial dry wine, attenuating the possibility of the acceptance of the beverage. Furthermore, its pH and alcoholic strength are in the acceptable range for consumption (3. 50 and 12. 6 º GL, respectively) and its mineral content is 62. 5 % higher than that of the regular wine, having then a highly nutritive beverage. The addition of this beverage to the market of alcoholic beverages can mean a higher variety and profit in this branch of the market, and can also contribute for healthier diets.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} {{for the detection}} of the color adulteration of green table olives with E- 141 ii colorant. Addition of this colorant to table olives to obtain a green permanent color in the product is a fraudulent practice, because the FDA allows its use only in citrus-based <b>dry</b> <b>beverage</b> mixes and European Union regulations do not permit the addition of colorants to table olives. The method consists of a pigment extraction in liquid phase and subsequent analysis by HPLC-DAD. The fraudulent addition of E- 141 ii is determined from the detection in fruit and/or packing solution, of peaks identified as copper chlorophyllin complexes, which are compounds completely foreign to the natural pigment profile of green table olives. The proposed methodology allows controlling the color quality of green table olives. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Sub-atmospheric fluidised bed freeze drying is a potential method of producing high quality <b>dried</b> <b>beverages</b> (such as coffee) more cheaply than using conventional freeze drying methods. Equipment at Loughborough has been further modified to enable fluidised bed freeze drying {{to be carried out}} at - 30 ºC to enable materials with low collapse temperatures to be freeze dried. Two base materials were tested: instant coffee and maltodextrin, which were both doped with a representative selection of volatile compounds found in ground coffee. Even at these low temperatures it was found that significant drying had occurred after 2 hours of fluidisation at 0. 1 bara. Coffee and maltodextrin (both initially 20...|$|R
40|$|Drying a fresh lutein-enriched egg-yolk {{beverage}} {{would extend}} its shelf life, however, functional properties {{should not be}} affected. It was investigated whether consumption of a <b>dried</b> <b>beverage</b> containing lutein-enriched egg-yolk significantly increases serum lutein. One-hundred healthy young subjects participated in this 6 -weeks randomized controlled study. Subjects consumed either a “plain” control beverage (n¿=¿ 26), a fresh lutein-enriched egg-yolk beverage (n¿=¿ 25), a dried version of this beverage (n¿=¿ 25), or a beverage composed of the dried individual components of the drink (n¿=¿ 24).

5000|$|Taylor began {{performing}} in clubs and coffee-bars {{such as the}} Cul de Sac in Hillbrow, Johannesburg in the 1960s and achieved massive success with the comedic song Ballad of the Southern Suburbs Johannesburg, known also as [...] "Ag Pleez Deddy" [...] in 1961. The song was a surprise hit. In a performance in Chicago, he explained that while teaching South African children English, he was [...] "enchanted" [...] by their patois, and their lust for many Western European luxuries, like Pepsi Cola, and Canada <b>Dry</b> <b>beverages,</b> Eskimo Pie, popcorn, chewing gum, and flicks like [...] "Tarzan", and other products. Taylor mimicked their accent in the song, which features a child begging his father {{to take him to}} different places and buy these treats. It was frowned upon by parents and the Government, because the song mixed English and Afrikaans - a practice the Nationalist government disapproved of, feeling that all languages should be kept [...] "pure"; just one reason that Taylor was soon required to leave the Country while under apartheid political rule. However, the children loved it, and so it became a massive hit song, selling more than any Elvis Presley single in South Africa. Also in the early sixties he contributed to the successful musical show Wait a Minim!, performing several of his own compositions.|$|R

5000|$|Dry {{ginger ale}} is {{recognized}} as a Canadian creation by John McLaughlin, a chemist and pharmacist. Having established a soda water bottling plant in 1890, McLaughlin began developing flavour extracts {{to add to the}} water in 1904. That year, he introduced [...] "Pale Dry Ginger Ale", the bubbly libation that would be patented in 1907 as [...] "Canada Dry Ginger Ale". An instant success, Canada Dry products were accepted by appointment to the Vice-Regal Household of the Governor General of Canada. The dry-style also became popular in the United States during the Prohibition era, when it was used as a mixer for alcoholic <b>beverages.</b> <b>Dry</b> ginger ale quickly surpassed golden ginger ale in popularity. Today, golden ginger ale is an uncommon, more regional drink exemplified by Vernors. By contrast, dry ginger ale is produced on a large scale internationally, and is a staple in supermarkets and bars, and on airlines.|$|R

40|$|Fungal {{glucose oxidase}} (GOD) is widely {{employed}} in the different sectors of food industries for use in baking products, <b>dry</b> egg powder, <b>beverages,</b> and gluconic acid production. GOD also has several other novel applications in chemical, pharmaceutical, textile, and other biotechnological industries. The electrochemical suitability of GOD catalyzed reactions has enabled its successful use in bioelectronic devices, particularly biofuel cells, and biosensors. Other crucial aspects of GOD such as improved feeding efficiency in response to GOD supplemental diet, roles in antimicrobial activities, and enhancing pathogen defense response, thereby providing induced resistance in plants have also been reported. Moreover, the medical science, another emerging branch where GOD was recently reported to induce several apoptosis characteristics as well as cellular senescence by downregulating Klotho gene expression. These widespread applications of GOD have led to increased demand for more extensive research to improve its production, characterization, and enhanced stability to enable long term usages. Currently, GOD is mainly produced and purified from Aspergillus niger and Penicillium species, but the yield is relatively low and the purification process is troublesome. It is practical to build an excellent GOD-producing strain. Therefore, the present review describes innovative methods of enhancing fungal GOD production by using genetic and non-genetic approaches in-depth along with purification techniques. The review also highlights current research progress in the cost effective production of GOD, including key advances, potential applications and limitations. Therefore, there is an extensive need to commercialize these processes by developing and optimizing novel strategies for cost effective GOD production...|$|R
