25|$|We were {{scarcely}} a musket-shot from the shore, when the captain {{pointed out to}} me one of the midshipmen in the boat, of the name of Lockhart, asking me if I knew his family in Scotland. I answered in the negative, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never been in any other service than that of Mrs. Gray. I was uneasy lest Mr. Lockhart should have recognized me for, as I had been a schoolfellow of his elder brother and frequently in the house of his father, Mr. Lockhart of Carnwath, he might very possibly have known me. He was about eighteen years of age and had been four years in the navy. His eldest brother, the heir to a considerable estate, had been foolish enough, like so many others, to join the standard of Prince Charles.|$|E
25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} any reason? Sit down, or, if you please, I will {{get up and walk}} with you. He tells me that you have chosen to quarrel with <b>him,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made you do so. He says that you <b>have</b> confessed to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> asked you to quarrel with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> seen you," [...] I answered, [...] "that you are well, {{and that}} he will hear from you to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And this is best of all," [...] said Stead, {{recovering}} {{breath and}} speech. [...] "I thank <b>Him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{lived to see}} this day! It is all safe, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|I did not answer, fearing to tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been awake {{watching}} him.|$|E
60|$|I thanked His Highness for his condescension, but I assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{made up my}} mind not {{to marry}} again.|$|E
60|$|He {{was really}} devoted to me, I believe. But he cheered up when I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{recommended}} him for my successor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still economical, <b>I</b> see. Well, <b>that's</b> all the {{information}} <b>I</b> require. You <b>have</b> given your word of honor not to notify <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> discovered his whereabouts. Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{persist in}} your obstinacy," [...] {{he said to}} Jack, [...] "I must return alone to Mr. Keller's house, and tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> left you here with your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Do {{not tell}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> warned you, or he will kill me by some evil death;’ {{and the old}} man screamed after him down the glen; but Theseus strode on in his wrath.|$|R
60|$|I assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no {{intention}} of dropping it, and that I should do {{everything in my power}} to protect Mr. Kilbright.|$|E
60|$|In {{the chamber}} beneath was my uncle Sepa. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been {{watching}} the sun rise over the city of Alexandria.|$|E
6000|$|The moment her {{progress}} was checked she promptly capsized. Perry was overwhelmed. I didn't upbraid him, nor remind <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> [...] "told him so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Thorpe {{is such a}} very {{particular}} friend of my brother's, that if he talks to me, I must talk to him again; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> any acquaintance with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you please," [...] Mary said hesitatingly, [...] "I {{would rather}} {{that you would}} not be there when feyther comes back. Of course <b>I</b> shall tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been down to see you, and I know he will be very angry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> {{found out}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> behaved so ill to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been ashamed ever since {{to look at}} him or speak to him,' said Ellen; 'I long to ask his pardon, but <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> would {{distress}} <b>him</b> more than anything.' ...|$|R
60|$|His hand closed fast on my arm. Some lurking {{devil in}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen yet, leapt {{up and looked}} at me out of his eyes.|$|E
60|$|I {{little thought}} what it was, little thought in how {{short a time}} I should {{understand}} it better, but I assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> confidence in him.|$|E
60|$|I {{informed}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{never even}} seen Dr. Fontaine; and then, by way of changing the topic, inquired if I {{was too late for}} the regular supper-hour at Main Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{may just}} inform <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got {{a clue to}} the {{identity}} of one, at least, of the men who broke my frames; that he belongs to the same gang who attacked Sykes and Pearson's dressing-shop, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hope to <b>have</b> <b>him</b> in custody to-morrow. You can remember that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course, he's getting old. One can't {{expect to}} remain young for ever'--she {{was a woman}} who {{frequently}} said profound things--'and I've known all along he wasn't the sort of man to make old bones. He's never had the go in <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> Why, I'd make two of him.' ...|$|R
5000|$|His (Umar's) {{strictness}} {{was there}} because of my softness when the weight of Caliphate will be over his shoulders he will remain no longer strict. If I will be asked by God to whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> appointed my successor, <b>I</b> will tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> appointed the best man among your men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not then, but I {{have done}} so since by letter. Twice I have written to him, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> nothing of my own, and {{that there could be}} nothing between us." ...|$|E
60|$|I mildly entreated {{him not to}} be despondent. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{heard by}} chance of his being in {{difficulty}} and had come to consult with him what could best be done.|$|E
60|$|So, when to-morrow came, I {{went to my}} {{guardian}} after breakfast, in {{the room}} that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it in trust to tell him something.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very sorry, mamma. I think <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> {{been better}} if you had had a little more {{patience}} with me, but even now if you really wish me {{to stay at home}} I will do so. I can write again to uncle and tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> changed my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{sounds like}} Miss Williams--she is so religious. God doesn't mean {{anything}} to me, Miss Channing. I've just the same resentful feeling toward <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> for all the world, if he exists at all. There, I've shocked you in good earnest now. You should have left me alone, Miss Channing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, then; I’ll do it," [...] {{said the}} girl, hastily. [...] "I shall just write and tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> changed {{my name to}} Trimblett. People {{have a right to}} change their name if they like. Lots of them do it. Make haste, you’ll lose your omnibus. I shall never forget your kindness—never." ...|$|R
60|$|Something like fear {{began to}} creep into my soul and, {{reminding}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not yet dined, I proposed we {{should return to}} the house. But no; nothing would tear him from his place of outlook.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{want you}} to help him because you are his friend—and mine, but it would hurt him if you told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> asked you to; and I do not {{even know what the}} trouble is,” she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I comforted myself,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'I {{said things}} to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> longed to say, and how beautifully he took them! But I could {{not feel that}} {{he knew what he}} was about much better than he did the first time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do so; {{it is to}} see <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to this town. He {{worked for}} a long time with a friend of mine some years ago, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> brought a message from him. I may be some time talking with him, so when I go in you can tie up your mules for a while." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never <b>had,</b> {{but would}} try to do so if possible.|$|R
60|$|I did a bit o' {{thinking}} arter he 'ad gorn aboard agin. <b>I</b> dursn't tell <b>'im</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> {{wrote the}} letter, but I thought if he 'ad {{one or two}} more he'd see that some one was 'aving a game with <b>'im,</b> and <b>that</b> it might do 'im good. Besides which it was a little amusement for me.|$|R
