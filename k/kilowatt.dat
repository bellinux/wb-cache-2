5|$|The Croton Dam and {{hydroelectric}} {{plant is}} {{owned and operated}} by Consumers Energy, an electric power company headquartered in Jackson, Michigan. Croton generated 44 million <b>kilowatt</b> hours of electricity in 2006, which would satisfy the annual electric consumption of about 6,000 residential customers.|$|E
5|$|Feed-in tariffs are {{designated}} prices {{which must be}} paid by utility companies for each <b>kilowatt</b> hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid. These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per <b>kilowatt.</b> In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per <b>kilowatt</b> for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
50|$|This hydro-electric dam {{is capable}} of {{producing}} 2,600 <b>kilowatts.</b> The original two Allis-Chalmers Vertical Shaft units produce 550 <b>kilowatts</b> each {{for a total of}} 1,100 <b>kilowatts.</b> The 1982 second powerhouse and two new units allow for an additional 750 <b>kilowatts</b> each, providing another 1,500 <b>kilowatts.</b> There are 33 gates that hold back the St. Joseph River and creating the Sturgis Reservoir.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, the Lloyd Shoals Dam {{project was}} {{completed}} at 100 {{feet tall and}} 1,070 feet of concrete masonry. Then, it had four 2,400 <b>kilowatts</b> generation units. In 1916, a fifth unit generating 2,400 <b>kilowatts</b> was added, {{and a year later}} a sixth unit generating 2,400 <b>kilowatts</b> was added. With all six units operational, it can have an output of 14,400 <b>kilowatts.</b> Because of improvements since then, it now can generate up to 21,000 <b>kilowatts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{operates}} at 50 <b>kilowatts</b> transmitter power output & 7,896 kW ERP {{due to its}} network stability. They use JAMPRO 48-panel antenna and two 60 kW Acrodyne transmitters with 120 <b>kilowatts</b> of transmitter power (for a total of 7,896 <b>kilowatts</b> ERP) however, it operates only at 50 <b>kilowatts</b> TPO, as of 2011.|$|R
5|$|Guitar Method (subtitled 1996–1999) is {{the only}} album by indie {{supergroup}} Kid <b>Kilowatt,</b> initially released by Second Nature Recordings on vinyl in 2003, and later on CD by Hydra Head Records in 2004. It consists of material recorded {{over a period of}} three years, including after the band's breakup. Still, it did not see release as a whole for over four years after the last track was recorded.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for hydroelectric power generation due to the steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of hydroelectric power stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 <b>kilowatt</b> JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|The first {{crude oil}} arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14, 1943, {{and the first}} refined product in the Little Big Inch arrived on March 2, 1944. The Big Inch carried up to 334,456 barrels of crude oil a day, the Little Big Inch 239,844 barrels of gasoline; the lines were among the largest {{industrial}} consumers of electricity in the US, requiring 3.89 million <b>kilowatt</b> {{hours a day to}} pump the oil along the pipes.|$|E

50|$|An {{electricity}} provider, year-end 2009, the Company finished approximately six billion kilowatt-hours of on-grid electricity, {{and had an}} attributable {{installed capacity}} of 1.5 million <b>kilowatts,</b> including 1.4 million <b>kilowatts</b> of thermal power and 100,000 <b>kilowatts</b> of hydropower.|$|R
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. The voltage was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 <b>kilowatt</b> capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in {{the south end of}} {{the generator}} building.|$|E
5|$|Since 1969, the Hyatt {{plant has}} worked in tandem with an {{extensive}} pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito's lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2.2 billion <b>kilowatt</b> hours (kWh) of electricity each year, {{about half of the}} total power produced by the SWP's eight hydroelectric facilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} {{attempts to}} minimize its environmental impact through several mechanisms, including minimizing area usage. Energy consumption {{is reduced by}} using recirculating excess heat to melt snow and ice for drinking water and heating. Waste is minimized through purchase planning and recycling; the remaining waste is compressed and transported away from the Antarctic. Fuel is handled {{in such a way}} that even small spills are minimized. In 2016 a solar PV plant with 7.3 <b>kilowatt</b> peak has been installed on one of the roof tops. It serves as a pilot installation for the declared middle term target of reducing the oil consumption of the research station significantly, by extending the solar PV plant over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|The {{hydroelectric}} {{plant at}} the base of the dam has four generators capable of producing 203 MW combined. The TID's share is 139 MW or 68.47%, while MID receives 64 MW or 31.53%. Three generators, each with a capacity of 55 MW, were included in the original design of the dam while an additional 38 MW generator was incorporated in 1989. The plant generates an average of 618.4 million <b>kilowatt</b> hours (KWh) of electricity each year, equal to an average output of 70.6MW. The cities of Modesto and Turlock receive a large share of their power supplies from New Don Pedro Dam.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in <b>kilowatt</b> and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} housed three {{coal-fired}} Lancashire boilers, each of 200 HP capacity and each with individual economisers. These boilers provided steam for two 410 <b>kilowatt</b> (kW) and one 150kW direct current Parsons turbo generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 970kW. Before {{being used in}} the Lemington power station, these generators had been used in Forth Banks Power Station and in Newburn Steelworks. One of the steam turbines from these sets is now on display at the Electric Power and Historical Museum in Yokohama, Japan, after sitting on display in the entrance to Blyth Power Station for many years.|$|E
50|$|On April 9, 1979, the FCC granted WPGC {{a permit}} to raise power from 10 <b>kilowatts</b> to 50 <b>kilowatts</b> directional.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Queensland's rural electrification, {{despite its}} {{promising}} start, was lagging {{behind the other}} States. In 1936 the Royal Commission On Electricity reported that, in units generated per head of population, Queensland ranked last in Australia. By 1936 there were 62 Electricity undertakings in Queensland. Of these, 51 generated power and 41 were local authorities. Production was heavily tilted in favour of Brisbane. The BCC had an installed capacity for generating 56,250 <b>kilowatts</b> (New Farm), and CEL could generate 37,500 <b>Kilowatts</b> (Bulimba). Cairns ranked next, at 4,400 <b>kilowatts,</b> followed by Townsville at 3,810 <b>kilowatts,</b> and Toowoomba at 2,400 <b>kilowatts.</b> Of the 152,000,000 units of electricity used in Queensland in 1935, only 30,000,000 units were used outside South East Queensland.|$|R
5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion <b>kilowatt</b> hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing energy security, convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid PV {{systems have}} {{traditionally}} used rechargeable batteries to store excess electricity. With grid-tied systems, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the transmission grid, while standard grid electricity can be used to meet shortfalls. Net metering programs give household systems a credit for any electricity they deliver to the grid. This is handled by 'rolling back' the meter whenever the home produces more electricity than it consumes. If the net electricity use is below zero, the utility then rolls over the <b>kilowatt</b> hour credit to the next month. Other approaches involve the use of two meters, to measure electricity consumed vs. electricity produced. This is less common due to the increased installation cost of the second meter. Most standard meters accurately measure in both directions, making a second meter unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 <b>kilowatt</b> range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} licensed to broadcast at 100 <b>kilowatts,</b> {{but because of}} transmitter interference to the Greater Sudbury Airport the station's license was permanently amended to 11 <b>kilowatts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were turbo-generators designed for naval use; these provided 1,250 <b>kilowatts</b> each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850 <b>kilowatts</b> each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200 kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400 <b>kilowatts,</b> {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450 volts on an alternating current.|$|R
50|$|Marinediesel AB is a {{manufacturer}} of high speed diesel engines for marine use, ranging in power output from 127 <b>kilowatts</b> to 373 <b>kilowatts.</b> The company was founded in 1992 in Ängelholm, Sweden.|$|R
25|$|Economically, {{electric}} heat can {{be compared}} to other sources of home heating by multiplying the local cost per <b>kilowatt</b> hour for electricity by the number of kilowatts the heater uses. E.g.: 1500-watt heater at 12 cents per <b>kilowatt</b> hour 1.5×12=18 cents per hour. When comparing to burning fuel it may be useful to convert <b>kilowatt</b> hours to BTUs: 1.5kWh × 3412.142=5118 BTU.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} unit of {{measurement}} on the electricity meter is the <b>kilowatt</b> hour , which {{is equal to the}} amount of energy used by a load of one <b>kilowatt</b> over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI megajoule instead.|$|E
25|$|Estonia exports mainly {{machinery}} and equipment, wood and paper, textiles, food products, furniture, and metals and chemical products.
