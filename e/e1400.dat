50|$|The next Bongo van {{appeared}} in September 1977. It was a mid-engine {{rear wheel drive}} vehicle. Ford sold {{this version of the}} van as the Ford Econovan, while Mazda sold it for export as the E1300, <b>E1400,</b> and E1600, depending on engine size. Beginning in February 1980 a 2.2-litre diesel engine was also available, sold in export as the E2200. This generation was also manufactured by Kia in South Korea, as the Kia Bongo and Ceres. The Bongo/Ceres underwent a number of facelifts and was still available as late as 1999. As the E1600, this model went on sale in Great Britain in 1982, only a year before being replaced. The British market only received the long wheelbase 1-tonne panel van version with small, twinned rear wheels. The UK model has a five-speed manual gearbox with a column mounted shifter.|$|E
