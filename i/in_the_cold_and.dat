25|$|The annual {{precipitation}} {{in the lower}} parts of the park is 700–800mm. At the altitude of 1000–2200m it varies between 1050 and 1200mm, and at higher altitudes the precipitation decreases. The driest month is February and the most humid months are May and June. The annual evaporation is 450–500mm at the altitude of 800–1000m and 350–400mm at 1000–2200m, which determines a positive water balance. At higher altitudes the humidity of the air is 80–85% and falls to 30% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> dry winter days. Due to {{the orientation of the}} slopes in the park, permanent snow cover is formed by mid-December. The duration of the snow cover at around 1200m is 160–180 days and reaches 190–200 days at higher altitudes. In March the thickness of the snow cover is 60–70cm in the lower areas of the park but it can surpass 200cm in the alpine zone. Melting begins during the first ten days of April. In the cirques the snow firn, which forms specific natural habitat, melts in mid-June.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} P. exigua foragers {{leave the}} nest around 6am and foraging stops around 7pm. Foraging activity {{has been recorded}} from 11 to 12 am. In the hot and humid season, P. exigua exhibit greater nest activity than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> dry season. Although the foraging of wasps decreases in rainy weather, the delivery of food and nest material does not stop completely. The habitat temperatures directly correlate with wasp activity: as the temperature increases, so does worker foraging. Luminosity has also been reported to influence {{the beginning and the}} end of the species’ foraging activity. Luminosity seems to have a greater affect on wasp activity when temperatures are more moderate. Additionally, wind speed directly impacts wasp activity; the stronger the wind, the less likely wasps are to exit their nests. Silva (2002) suggests P. exigua participate in a greater amplitude of activity as the latitude of their nesting region decreases. In other words, the closer the wasps are to the Equator, the more active the colonies are. In Ribeiro Jr.’s study on P. exigua from Brazil, he proposed that the wasp develops its foraging activities more efficiently within a flight range of 75m from its nest.|$|E
25|$|Rahul Dravid of the Indians found form after a {{hitherto}} ordinary tour, {{upon his}} captain Ganguly won the toss and opted to bat first. His 107 included over a 114-run partnership with Hrishikesh Kanitkar {{who made a}} half-century, with the two batting for over three hours. Vijay Bharadwaj then added 58 runs with Dravid before both and VVS Laxman were dismissed in a span of 4.3 overs and 8 runs. The Indians ended the day's plat at 241/6. Upon resumption, they declared at lunch with the score at 269/9; the tail putting on an unbroken 47-run partnership. Andrew Downton finished with figures of 5/90, the best for Tasmania. In reply, Tasmania began strongly and wen to stumps at 166/0, with the openers batting for over the fours hours on a slow pitch on day two, {{and none of the}} six bowlers for the Indians providing any breakthrough. At 88 overnight, captain Jamie Cox completed his century, his 24th in first-class cricket, the following morning before being dismissed for 139, while Dene Hills made 84. Daniel Marsh and Andrew Dykes then put on 104 runs for the fourth wicket, before Dykes' dismissal for 61 while Marsh batted on building another partnership, of 91 runs, with Shaun Young <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> windy conditions. Marsh went to stumps having faced 156 deliveries for his 118, with his team at having secured a lead of 156 runs. 20 minutes into the final morning, he reached his highest first-class score before being dismissed for 157, with his team declaring the innings at 548/5. The match ended in a draw after draw after the Indians finished at 130/3; Laxman top-scoring for them (58).|$|E

500|$|Dylan and the Band were a major musical {{influence}} on Harrison {{at the end}} of his career with the Beatles. While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968, he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band's sense of communal music-making and to the creative equality among the band members, which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney's domination of the Beatles' songwriting and creative direction. This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the Beatles, tensions among whom [...] surfaced again in January 1969, during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios for what became the album Let It Be. Frustrated by the poor working conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> sterile film studio, as well as by what he perceived as Lennon's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney, Harrison quit the group on 10 January, but agreed to return twelve days later.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a few alleged {{sightings}} of large sharks, purportedly megalodon, measuring anywhere from [...] throughout the 1900s, however they all lack supporting evidence. More likely they were misidentified whale sharks. One Polynesian myth regards a [...] shark called Lord of the Deep, but this is probably an exaggeration of a whale shark. Reports of supposedly fresh megalodon teeth, such as those made by [...] in 1873 which were erroneously dated to be around 11,000 to 24,000 years old, are probably teeth that were well-preserved by a thick mineral-crust precipitate of manganese dioxide, and so had a lower decomposition rate and retained a white color during fossilization. Fossil megalodon teeth can vary in color from off-white to dark browns and greys, and some fossil teeth may have been redeposited into a younger stratum. The claims that megalodon could remain elusive in the depths, similar to the megamouth shark which was discovered in 1976, are unlikely as the shark evolved around warm coastal waters and probably could not survive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> nutrient-poor deep sea environment.|$|E
500|$|An early painting, The Cabaret of Mère Anthony (1866), {{represents}} for Renoir [...] "some of {{the most}} agreeable memories" [...] of his life with friends at a village inn during this time. [...] He soon moved {{to the village of}} Chailly near Marlotte and the forest of Fontainebleau, and began working with model Lise Tréhot who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouillère, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868. [...] Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked en plein air, painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures. [...] Years later, he told art dealer Ambroise Vollard that he could not stand the cold: [...] "But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow? [...] It is a blight on the face of Nature." [...] Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life.|$|E
500|$|Spencer Gore's {{painting}} Richmond Park, {{thought to}} have been painted in the autumn of 1913 or shortly before the artist's death in March 1914, was exhibited at the Paterson and Carfax Gallery in 1920. In 1939 it was exhibited in Warsaw, Helsingfors and Stockholm by the British Council as Group of Trees. It is now {{in the collection of the}} Tate Gallery under its original title but is not currently on display. [...] The painting is one of a series of landscapes painted in Richmond Park during the last months of Gore's life. According to Tate curator Helena Bonett, Gore's early death from pneumonia, two months before what would have been his 36th birthday, was brought on by his painting outdoors in Richmond Park <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> wet winter months. It is not certain where in the park the picture was made but a row of trees close to the pond near Cambrian Gate has a very close resemblance to those in the painting.

500|$|Around May 28, local family {{planning}} officials phoned Feng {{to try to}} persuade her to have an abortion. The attempt was unsuccessful, so on May 30 they visited the family house while Feng's husband was away at work. [...] At first, authorities tried to persuade her to voluntarily have an abortion. After several hours, she told the officials she was going out to buy food, and left them in her living room. Instead, she went to an aunt's house, but around 15 officials followed her. They did not immediately arrest Feng, instead setting up shifts to keep watch over her at the aunt's house. [...] Early the next morning, Feng escaped, causing the guards to panic.

500|$|From {{about the}} 4th century BCE, {{the use of}} {{stiffened}} ends on composite bows became widespread. The stiffened end of the bow is a [...] "siyah" [...] (Arabic, Persian), [...] "szarv" [...] (Hungarian), [...] "sarvi" [...] (Finnish; both 'sarvi' and 'szarv' mean 'horn') or [...] "kasan" [...] (Turkish); the bending section is a [...] "dustar" [...] (Arabic), [...] "lapa" [...] (Finnish) or [...] "sal" [...] (Turkish). For centuries, the stiffening was accomplished by attaching laths of bone or antler {{to the sides of}} the bow at its ends. The bone or antler strips are more likely to survive burial {{than the rest of the}} bow. The first bone strips suitable for this purpose come from [...] "graves of the fourth or third centuries" [...] BCE. These stiffeners are found associated with nomads of the time. Maenchen-Helfen states that they are not found in Achaemenid Persia, nor in early Imperial Rome, nor in Han China. However Coulston attributes Roman stiffeners to about or before 9 CE. He identifies a Steppe Tradition of Scythian bows with working tips, which lasted, in Europe, until the arrival of the Huns, and a Near East or Levantine tradition with siyahs, possibly introduced by the Parni as siyahs are found in Sassanid but not Achaemenid contexts. Siyahs have also been described from the Arabian peninsula. Composite bows were adopted by the Roman Empire and were made even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> damp of Britannia. They were the normal weapon of later Roman archers, both infantry and cavalry units (although Vegetius recommends training recruits [...] "arcubus ligneis", with wooden bows).|$|E
