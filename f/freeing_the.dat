5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made <b>freeing</b> <b>the</b> slaves a war goal.

During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to as}} the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1633, the relief force, led {{personally}} by the king and numbering about 25,000 (20,000 in the Polish-Lithuanian army, according to Jasienica), arrived near Smolensk; they reached Orsha on 17 August 1633. By {{the first days of}} September, {{the main body of the}} relief forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines, <b>freeing</b> <b>the</b> Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E
5|$|Castelli was {{appointed}} a Committee {{member of the}} Primera Junta and was sent to Córdoba to end Santiago de Liniers's counter-revolution.

He then commanded {{the establishment of a}} revolutionary government in Upper Peru (today's Bolivia) with the aim of <b>freeing</b> <b>the</b> indigenous peoples and African slaves. In 1811 Castelli signed a truce with the Spanish in Upper Peru, but they betrayed him and caught the Northern Army unprepared. As a result, the Argentines suffered a major loss in the Battle of Huaqui on June 20, 1811. When Castelli returned to Buenos Aires, the First Triumvirate imprisoned him for losing the battle, and Castelli died shortly afterwards from tongue cancer.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and geologist Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) have taken the TARDIS deep below the ground to the Silurian city where the Doctor's companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), a local man named Mo (Alun Raglan), and Mo's son, Elliot (Samuel Davies), are being held hostage.

50|$|In January 2011, Portman {{became an}} {{ambassador}} of <b>Free</b> <b>the</b> Children, an international charity and educational partner, spearheading their Power of a Girl campaign.

5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to get a message to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but <b>freeing</b> <b>the</b> kids in the process.|$|E
5|$|Still in Oriente, Castro was furious. Recognizing the {{establishment}} of a military junta, he ended the ceasefire and continued on the offensive.

Accompanying widespread celebrations as news of Batista's downfall spread across Cuba on 1 January 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to take responsibility for policing the country, in order to prevent widespread looting and vandalism.|$|E
5|$|The Jaguar was {{to replace}} the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 in the close air support, {{tactical}} reconnaissance and tactical strike roles, <b>freeing</b> <b>the</b> Phantom {{to be used for}} air defence. Both the French and British trainer requirements had developed significantly, and were eventually fulfilled instead by the Alpha Jet and Hawker Siddeley Hawk respectively. The French, meanwhile, had chosen the Jaguar {{to replace the}} Aeronavale's Dassault Étendard IV, and increased their order to include an initial 40 of a carrier-capable maritime version of the Jaguar, the Jaguar M, for the Aeronavale. From these apparently disparate aims would come a single and entirely different aircraft: relatively high-tech, supersonic, and optimised for ground-attack in a high-threat environment.|$|E
