5|$|During a Friday night performance, Tony is drunk as {{he comes}} {{backstage}} during the interim between his part in Acts IV and V. Felicity is angry that Tony, a recovering alcoholic, got drunk again; she has had to issue several refunds because of his drunken behaviour on stage. She sends him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go. Laura berates Jim for his lack of ambition. She is left alone in the dressing room and hears noises coming from the shower; but when she goes to look, it is empty. A scream is then heard from the stage.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button in the hollow of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
25|$|At the Institute, one of {{his aides}} was a Jamaican man named Glenn Miller, nicknamed Juice, who helped him learn how to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> {{and how to use}} a powered wheelchair, which was {{activated}} by blowing air through a straw. Miller and Reeve would watch the film Cool Runnings and joke about Reeve directing the sequel, Bobsled Two.|$|E
5000|$|Defying Burns' {{authority}} as usual, Pierce ignores the assembly ceremony, mockingly [...] "checks {{in with the}} commanding officer" [...] with the line [...] "Hello, honey, I'm home" [...] and presenting Frank with a doll of General Douglas MacArthur. Ignoring Frank's orders as usual, he walks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> fully clothed {{in an attempt to}} shake off the hangover he acquired while in Tokyo. After dismissing the assembled camp, Radar follows Hawkeye <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> to inform him of Captain Trapper John McIntyre's military discharge during Hawkeye's R&R; he has left the camp only hours before Hawkeye's return, without leaving a written goodbye.|$|R
50|$|The Leafs {{celebrated their}} second {{consecutive}} Stanley Cup by throwing Imlach, Harold Ballard and Stafford Smythe <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> fully clothed. <b>The</b> team {{was given a}} victory parade along Bay Street with a reception at Toronto City Hall.|$|R

25|$|With {{the reason}} for the late arrival of help {{explained}} (the surveillance team got bored and watched the football instead), and Edna removed, Maurice has mixed reactions about the outcome – he got the suspect and the drugs, but he does not relish the prospect of explaining the missing money. He, Tracy and Tommy leave, and then Sam retrieves the real briefcase full of money from the extra secret compartment in the table that Maurice didn't know about. He promises Rosie a tomorrow richer in every way, and they disappear <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower.</b> Then Maurice and Tracy return and take the money, with Tracy giving Maurice a kiss. They depart, with Maurice quietly wishing Rosie the luck she'll need.|$|E
500|$|Following the sacking of Roeder as Norwich {{manager in}} January 2009, Gunn {{was asked to}} take {{temporary}} charge of the first team. In an interview with BBC Radio Norfolk, he revealed that he [...] "told the players that they've let people down." [...] In his first match as caretaker manager, he received [...] "a euphoric reception" [...] from the fans, and Norwich beat Barnsley 4–0. The players were equally supportive: according to Scotland on Sunday, [...] "in the dressing room afterwards, [...] midfielder, Darel Russell, dragged the chairman, Roger Munby, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower,</b> and demanded that Gunn be appointed permanently." [...] Momentum gathered, and a Facebook group called [...] "Bryan Gunn for manager", created by his then 17-year-old daughter, Melissa, soon attracted about 3,000 members. Gunn considered applying for the role on a longer-term basis; he had previously applied without success to be Norwich manager in 1998. On 19 January 2009 he phoned the directors and requested to be considered. He was interviewed that afternoon and [...] "by 10.30 am the next day had been appointed manager {{until the end of}} the season".|$|E
500|$|... "Ironic" [...] {{was covered}} in 2007 by Mexican duet Jesse & Joy for their album Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones, and the pop punk band Four Year Strong for their 90's cover album Explains It All (2009). In the 1996 novel Naïve. Super by Norwegian author Erlend Loe, the protagonist watches the video for the song on {{television}} and dreams about [...] "meeting an Alanis-girl {{and living in a}} house together with her". In the Jay and Silent Bob comic Chasing Dogma (1998), the character Tricia Jones is singing [...] "Ironic" [...] before Jay steps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower.</b> In 2003, Ji-In Cho covered the song for the German version of the Fame Academy talent show, which became a success in the German charts. In September 2001, [...] "Ironic" [...] was listed as [...] "one of the songs deemed inappropriate due to its lyrics" [...] by American mass media company Clear Channel Communications, after the September 11 attacks occurred. The music of the song was featured in the romantic comedy film I Could Never Be Your Woman (2007), where Saoirse Ronan, as Izzie Mensforth, sings an altered version of the lyrics in a talent show. It also made a predominant appearance as the opener to 2013 comedy film The Internship, starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, as they sing along to it. [...] More recently, the song was briefly on an episode of Castle when the titular character laments about the song's title being subjected to misuse since it was first released. In 2015, Morissette appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden and sang a version of the song with new lyrics [...] "updated" [...] for the technology era, and an homage to the linguistics of the original mentioned above.|$|E

50|$|On June 16, 2013 {{following}} the {{game against the}} Seattle Mariners, the Coliseum experienced a severe sewage backup. This led to pipes leaking out puddles of sewage <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> offices, visitor training room and storage areas on the clubhouse level of the stadium, {{all of which are}} 3 feet (1 m) below sea level. After the game, the A's and Mariners were forced to share the Oakland Raiders locker room, located on the stadium's second floor. According to Coliseum officials, the stadium's aging plumbing system was overtaxed after a six-game homestand that drew close to baseball capacity crowds totaling 171,756 fans.|$|R
2500|$|Elle {{heads to}} the Hair Affair {{to say goodbye to}} Paulette, but before she can leave, Vivienne and Enid {{convince}} Elle otherwise. Elle discards her lawyerly navy suits, dons a pink dress and leads a parade back to the courtroom. They meet Kyle on the way, who takes a liking to Paulette, and reveals himself to be the Irish man of her dreams, prompting to Irish Dance among the ensemble. Back at the trial, Brooke fires Callahan and hires Elle ("Legally Blonde Remix"). Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney goes to the witness stand and her testimony is damning, stating after {{she got out of the}} shower she saw Brooke covered in her father's blood. After Chutney states she received a perm the day of the murder, Elle realizes a flaw in Chutney's alibi and suggests that the entire court should be moved to the scene of the crime - the bathroom where the murder took place ("Scene of the Crime"). As a demonstration, Elle asks Paulette to give Enid a perm, and asks Enid to step <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> upon entering the crime scene. Relying on her knowledge of hair maintenance, Elle's demonstration is successful as Enid walks out of the shower with completely flattened hair—revealing that Chutney could not have possibly showered immediately after getting a perm because her perm was still intact. Under Elle's intense questioning, Chutney accidentally confesses that she killed her father, thinking that it was Brooke ("Omigod You Guys (Reprise)"). Chutney is arrested and Brooke is set free.|$|E
6000|$|And he will {{wonder why}} still there seems {{reason for this}} outcry. Still, after what {{analysis}} and proof of his being right have as yet been given, the reader may perhaps be saying to himself: [...] "All this reasoning is of no use to me. Turner does not give me the idea of nature; I do not feel before one of his pictures as I should in the real scene. Constable takes me out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower,</b> and Claude into the sun; and De Wint makes me feel as if I were walking in the fields; but Turner keeps me in the house, and I know always that I am looking at a picture." ...|$|E

5000|$|As work on {{the time}} capsule continues, Houlihan grows {{increasingly}} frustrated with Hawkeye's suggestions. While Houlihan wants to include {{a copy of a}} Zane Grey novel from Col. Potter, Hawkeye proposes that Potter throw in some xeno pads. Things reach a head when Houlihan decides to throw Hawkeye off the project. Undaunted, Hawkeye soldiers on with his own time capsule. [...] Rizzo decides to carry out his revenge when he goes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> where B.J. is currently washing up. Rizzo begins fidgeting with the dummy grenade, when he pretends to accidentally pull the pin. Fearing for his life, B.J. runs naked out of <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> building. When B.J. learns that the grenade was a dummy and this was all a prank, he vows to get back at Rizzo.|$|R
2500|$|Alec remembers one {{occasion}} in Adelaide in 1947 {{when he had}} to bowl for most of one day in 102-degree heat. After his last over, he was completely befuddled and had to be led from the ground by his team mates. Not knowing where he was, he stumbled up the steps through the Father and Son Enclosure, past the Press Box and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> England dressing room. There the team physiotherapist took him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers,</b> sat him down on a wooden chair, clothed and still wearing his boots, and turned on the cold tap. It took almost three quarters of an hour for the big Surrey bowler to come round from his heat exhaustion! ...|$|R

2500|$|Another long-standing {{tradition}} is the playing of Wagner's [...] "Ride of the Valkyries" [...] at 7:00 each morning during finals {{week with the}} largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed {{at any other time}} (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of The Ring Cycle), and any offender is dragged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>showers</b> to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. The playing of the Ride is such a strong tradition that the music was used during Apollo 17 to awaken Astronaut Harrison Schmitt, a Caltech alumnus. Unfortunately, the tradition arose at different times in different Houses, so Schmitt did not react as expected. Instead, he just became confused.|$|R
