5|$|The Ottoman {{blockade}} quickly {{reduced the}} inhabitants to near starvation, and led {{many of them}} to flee the city. When coupled with the restrictions placed on them by the siege, the inability of Venice to properly supply and guard the city, and the violations of their customary rights and rampant profiteering by Venetian officials, a pro-surrender party was formed and gained strength among the inhabitants. The city's Metropolitan, Symeon, encouraged his flock to resist, but by 1426, with Venice's inability to secure peace on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> evident, {{a majority of the}} local population had come to prefer a surrender to avoid the pillage accompanying a forcible conquest. Venice's efforts to find allies against the Ottomans also failed, as the other regional potentates either pursued their own course, were themselves antagonistic to the Venetians, or were defeated by the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E

25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also have found in it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the Protestant Reformation (c. 1517), {{studies of}} Paul’s {{writings}} have been {{heavily influenced by}} Lutheran and Reformed views that {{are said to have}} been ascribed to the negative attributes that they associated with sixteenth-century Roman Catholicism to Second Temple Judaism. These Lutheran and Reformed views on Paul's writings are called “the old perspective” by adherents of the “new perspective on Paul”. The “new perspective” is an attempt to lift Paul's letters out of the Lutheran-Reformed framework and interpret them based on what is said to be an understanding of first-century Judaism, taken on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E
50|$|Elections in Lebanon are {{allotted to}} occur every four years. Every citizen {{is allowed to}} vote, but the {{positions}} are constitutionally allocated by religious affiliation. In 2014, the Parliament failed to elect a president and extended <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>term.</b>|$|R
25|$|In an {{unprecedented}} move, the Lebanese parliament has extended <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>term</b> twice amid protests, the last being on 5 November 2014, an act which comes in direct contradiction with democracy and article #42 of the Lebanese constitution as no elections have taken place.|$|R

25|$|Murphy concludes that,"Just as the Son of God limited {{himself by}} taking human form and dying on a cross, God limits divine {{action in the}} world to be in accord with {{rational}} laws which God has chosen. This enables us to understand the world on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> but it also means that natural processes hide God from scientific observation."For Murphy, a theology of the cross requires that Christians accept a methodological naturalism, meaning that one cannot invoke God to explain natural phenomena, while recognizing that such acceptance does not require one to accept a metaphysical naturalism, which proposes that nature is all that there is.|$|E
25|$|In 1878–9 Hughes {{began writing}} The Manual for Co-operators (1881), with Vansittart Neale, for the Co-operative Congress. As a side-product he {{developed}} {{an interest in}} the model village. In 1880, he acquired the ownership of Franklin W. Smith's Plateau City and founded a settlement in America—Rugby, Tennessee—which was designed as an experiment in utopian living for the younger sons of the English gentry. It followed closely on the failed colony Buckthorn (existing about 1872 to 1879), established by another Englishman Charles Lempriere, in western Virginia; this settlement had supposedly been suggested by Hughes. Rugby was also unsuccessful on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> but it still exists and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|AMC Networks {{responded to}} Dish's {{announcement}} of its pending {{removal of the}} channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, {{in which it is}} seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite this revamped {{effort at}} {{fighting}} the enemy on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> U.S. operations remained insufficient at eliminating the tunnels completely. In 1967, General William Westmoreland tried launching a larger assault on Củ Chi and the Iron Triangle. Called Operation Cedar Falls, it {{was similar to}} the previous Operation Crimp, however on a larger scale with 30,000 troops instead of the 8,000. On January 18, tunnel rats from the 1st BN 5th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Infantry Division uncovered the Viet Cong district headquarters of Củ Chi, containing half a million documents concerning all types of military strategy. Among the documents were maps of U.S. bases, detailed accounts of PLAF movement from Cambodia into Vietnam, lists of political sympathizers, and even plans for a failed assassination attempt on Robert McNamara.|$|E
25|$|A {{provisional}} Protocol 14bis {{had been}} opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised {{to allow the}} Court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its raison d'être and according to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010.|$|E

Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states and {{are not part of the}} Constitution. Four of these amendments are still technically open and pending, one is closed and has failed by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it.

25|$|Hieroglyphs {{continued}} to be used under Persian rule (intermittent in the 6th and 5th centuries BC), and after Alexander the Great's conquest of Egypt, during the ensuing Ptolemaic and Roman periods. It appears that the misleading quality of comments from Greek and Roman writers about hieroglyphs came about, at least in part, {{as a response to}} the changed political situation. Some believed that hieroglyphs may have functioned as a way to distinguish 'true Egyptians' from some of the foreign conquerors. Another reason may be the refusal to tackle a foreign culture on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> which characterized Greco-Roman approaches to Egyptian culture generally. Having learned that hieroglyphs were sacred writing, Greco-Roman authors imagined the complex but rational system as an allegorical, even magical, system transmitting secret, mystical knowledge.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the century the Christchurch City Council was {{strongly}} in favour of bringing the tramways under municipal control but only on <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> This ignited suspicion amongst Christchurch City's neighbouring boroughs – through whose territory such a system would have to be built even if only to replace the existing private network – that they would have no control over the running of such a system. A series of tramway conferences were held from the mid-1890s for the local bodies involved to advance the cause of municipalisation but it was not until March 1902 that the City Council acquiesced to the demands of its neighbours for a tramway board with elected members. The Tramway Conference had received an offer to construct and operate an electric tramway system from the British Electric Traction Company (the same company that had the contract for the Auckland system) in February but, despite public support for the proposal, declined as they were already in favour of municipal control.|$|E
25|$|Had the war {{continued}} {{for a longer}} period of time, Germany or the Allies might have had no choice but to invade Sweden in order to thwart enemy advances. If Germany had been able to sustain its successes on the battlefield beyond 1943, and been capable of bringing the war to an end favorable to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms,</b> Sweden would have had no choice but to join the new order of Europe, a new order under the domination of Nazi Germany. Germany would not have allowed a country to exist on the sidelines in the new order of Europe, and Sweden would have had to abandon its policy of neutrality. However, German domination of Europe did not succeed and Sweden was left on its own. Sweden's ability to maintain its policy of neutrality until the war's end was due in large part to luck, since events out of its control played the largest part in the fate of Sweden's policy of neutrality.|$|E

25|$|In November 2013, Humble Bundle, Inc. {{implemented}} a system on redemption of bundles that, for Steam games, {{would not give}} the user the alphanumeric key but instead automatically redeemed the key within Steam through Steam account linking {{as a means to}} avoid abuse of the key system. Despite this, Ed Key, one of the developers from Proteus which was featured in Humble Indie Bundle 8, has found by checking his game's key redemption logs that some third-party sites, like 7 Entertainment, have been offering keys to his and other games from other Humble Bundles for profit. The price these sites offer undercut the current price of such games on digital marketplaces and without reciprocating sales back to the developers or charity organizations. Such resales are against both Humble Bundle's and Steam's terms of service, and currently Humble Bundle, Inc. is working with affected developers to help stop this abuse. 7 Entertainment has responded to these issues by changing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms</b> of service to the marketplaces that use it to prevent and deal with these key sales.|$|E
