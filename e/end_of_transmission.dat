5000|$|In electronics, {{electrical}} termination is the practice <b>of</b> <b>ending</b> a <b>transmission</b> {{line with a}} device that matches the characteristic impedance of the line. This is intended to prevent signals from reflecting off the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> line. Reflections at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> unterminated <b>transmission</b> lines cause distortion which can produce ambiguous digital signal levels and mis-operation of digital systems. Reflections in analog signal systems cause such effects as video ghosting, or power loss in radio transmitter transmission lines.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The icing <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> lines {{threatens the}} {{security}} of power system. This paper proposes a novel anti-icing method based on reducing voltage <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> lines. The line voltage can be reduced by regulating {{the ratio of the}} transformers which install the both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> lines. The line current can be increased and the power loss <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> lines can also be increased, which means the heat generated by power loss increases and the icing process <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> lines can be restrained. When the icing may occur in the atrocious weather, the anti-icing transformers installed the both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> line are put into operation. The ratios of transformers are regulated to the appropriate value.

30|$|Two-end {{algorithms}} {{estimate the}} location of fault using voltage and current form both the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a line. Based on this technique, transient fault data must be collected and synchronized from both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a <b>transmission</b> line. The transient data faults can be reported by the protection relays or Digital Fault Recorders (DFRs) which is installed in substations. In order to have an accurate fault location, the data from both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a <b>transmission</b> line should be analyzed [8]. Therefore, in this technique, microprocessor relays (or digital fault recorders), communication facility, and analysis software are required.|$|R

50|$|When a {{transmission}} medium is half duplex (that is, it can transmit {{in only one}} direction at a time), there is usually a master station that can transmit at any time, and one or more slave stations that transmit when they have permission.

A slave station indicates that it has completed its transmission by sending the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> character (EOT).|$|E

5000|$|The initial {{sequences}} are {{the same}} as that of the single transmission. In the idle state the CLOCK and DATA lines are high but with the arrival of the first falling edge the transmission mode is evoked and the similarly the data bits are transmitted sequentially starting with the MSB with every rising edge. The transmission of the LSB means that the transmission of the data is completed. An additional rising edge pushes the data line to LOW signifying the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> of the particular data.|$|E

Existing measures set the shunt reactors at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>transmission</b> lines {{to weaken the}} effect of distributed capacitances. But this approach shows some drawbacks when it is applied to distributed power plants. On the one hand, the shunt reactors reduce the power factor at the export side of distributed power plants. On the other hand, the variation of the output active and reactive power of distributed power plants may cause large voltage fluctuations {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC).|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor the {{development}} of reliable electric and electronic systems, a promising technology for transmission line fault diagnosis is the reflectometry, which consists in analyzing the reflection and the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> electric waves observed at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a <b>transmission</b> line. For hard fault (open or short circuits) diagnosis, efficient reflectometry-based methods have been reported. However, the diagnosis of soft faults (spatially continuous variations of distributed characteristic properties) remains an open problem. Reflectometry-based soft fault diagnosis can be formulated as an inverse problem: given the reflectometry measurements made at the <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a <b>transmission</b> line, what are the distributed characteristic properties <b>of</b> the <b>transmission</b> line? In this paper, {{the application of the}} inverse scattering transform (IST) to this inverse problem for lossy transmission lines is studied...|$|R
