5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>tilefish</b> has {{a unique}} {{burrowing}} behavior and habitat preference. In addition to their unique habitat choice, golden tilefish display sexually dimorphic growth with males growing to larger sizes and are behaviorally dominant over their female counterparts. The <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>tilefish</b> is not a migratory fish; it stays in one local area that fits its needs all year round. Seasonal migration may occur with changes in the water temperatures around the Nantucket Shoals and Georges Bank during the winter or spring, but this theory has no definitive evidence. A competing theory suggests that tilefish may instead reduce their activity or hibernate within their burrows during times of cold temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>tilefish</b> {{has been}} subject to {{regulation}} to prevent overfishing.

5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton.

5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>tilefish</b> population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity {{were observed in}} 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

After hatching from eggs, the larvae are found in plankton. As they grow into juveniles, the individuals seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. As adults, the tilefish continue to expand their burrows in the sediment throughout their lives. The diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans, and fish. After reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.|$|E

500|$|The <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>tilefish</b> {{is known}} to dig and occupy burrows along the outer {{continental}} shelf, and on the flanks of submarine canyons in malleable clay substrate. Due to their long life expectancy, slow growth, complex breeding system, and habitat specificity, they are vulnerable to overexploitation, and they are susceptible to mass mortality events due to cold-water intrusion and overfishing. Their abundance is strongly correlated with presence of silt-clay substrate, because the soft clay enables the fish to create the burrow itself by simply digging away the clay substrate. The minimum temperature threshold for golden tilefish is [...] Temperature observations and measurements are obtained by interpolated observations. Temperature plots indicate that 9Â°C is the norm for the area around Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
