5|$|MLS teams {{also play}} in other competitions. Every year, {{up to five}} MLS teams play in the CONCACAF Champions League against other clubs from the CONCACAF region (Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean). Two U.S.-based MLS teams qualify based on MLS regular-season results: {{the winner of the}} Western conference and the winner of the Eastern conference. The third U.S. team to qualify is the winner of the MLS Cup. A fourth U.S.-based MLS team can qualify via the U.S. Open Cup, where U.S. based teams compete against lower {{division}} U.S. clubs. If a team qualifies through multiple berths, or if any of the MLS berths are taken by a Canada-based MLS team, the berth is reallocated to the best U.S.-based team in the Supporters' Shield table which has failed to otherwise qualify. Canadian MLS clubs play against lower division Canadian clubs in the Canadian Championship <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> Champions League spot allocated to Canada. No MLS club has won the Champions League since it began its current format in 2008, with Mexican clubs dominating the competition, but MLS teams have twice reached the final: Real Salt Lake in 2011 and the Montreal Impact in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Serjeant's Inn was an Inn of Court {{restricted}} to Serjeants-at-Law.

5|$|The airline was by September {{again in}} need of new capital. The {{contracts}} with Britannia ended on 1 November. While there was a high demand for 737-300 aircraft, aviation regulations hindered Norway Airlines from wet leaseing the aircraft (with full crew) and limited them to dry leaseing (without crew), which jeopardized the jobs of 86 employees. There were speculations in mid-October that Air Europe was planning to purchase Norway Airlines. Lyng had by then bought Ansett's share and held a 55-percent ownership. Norway Airlines announced on 25 October that they would lease both their aircraft to Air Europe on a five-year contract, one aircraft from November 1988 and one from March 1989. The airline would have to continue with ad-hoc charters <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> aircraft until March.

According to model with 5 variables created as a result of the logistic regression analysis, probability of performing GAP <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> whose share of cherry production is higher than % 50 of their total income is 5. 21 fold more than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> whose share is less than % 50; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who have business building is 6. 06 fold more than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who do not have; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who are informed by means of exporters is 5. 71 fold more than who are not informed; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who choose formal information source as a fertilization information source is 2. 09 fold more than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who do not choose.
