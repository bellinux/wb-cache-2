50|$|The native {{range of}} the bank myna is almost {{restricted}} to the Indian subcontinent from the Indus valley in the West, to the Gangetic delta in the East {{and south of the}} lower foothills of the Himalayas, only rarely being found in sheltered valleys. They are found mainly in the vicinity of open water and their usual habitat is cultivated farmland and open country but flocks will often live within cities, in markets and railway stations. They make use of <b>food</b> <b>scrap</b> disposed by humans, even following catering vehicles at airports to standing aircraft.The distribution was formerly noted to be restricted north roughly of a line between Bombay and Balasore in Orissa, but the species may be expanding its range. They are also common in Pakistan in the districts of Sind and Punjab. A specimen from Kandahar was earlier considered the westernmost record a vagrant, but the birds have since established in the region. Although mainly resident, they make movements in response to food and weather. The species name of the bird is based on the name given by Latham from a description by Pierre Sonnerat who described Le petit Martin de Gingi in 1782, referring to Gingee near Pondicherry in southern India. Thomas C. Jerdon noted in 1863 that the species did not occur in southern India however the species was recorded in the region in 1914 at Vandalur near Madras. Records from further south in India are however increasing. Breeding colonies have been found in Assam.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-billed babbler {{lives in}} flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the {{presence}} of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. One member often perches high and acts as a sentinel while the remaining members of the flock forage on or close to the ground. They feeds mainly on insects, but also eat fruit, nectar and human <b>food</b> <b>scrap.</b> They have been known to take Calotes versicolor lizard and whip-scorpions. They do not fly long distances, the maximum distance flown non-stop was about 180 m and prior to flying, they usually gain height by moving up a tree or tall shrub. Black drongos, rufous treepies and Indian palm squirrels are often seen foraging near these babblers.Birds wake up before dawn around 6 AM and begin foraging. They are relatively inactive in the hot hours of the day from 1330 to 1630. They assemble in groups around 1900 hrs and preen themselves before going to roost. Members of a group roost next to each other with some juveniles wedging themselves {{in the middle of the}} group. When foraging the sentinel bird calls with wing fluttering and hopping. Allopreening is a common activity, particularly in winter, and members may beg for food from other members.Yellow-billed babblers particularly like to take baths, and may visit birdbaths in their general territories, usually around late afternoon to evening time. Sometimes these birds have been observed visiting birdbaths at around 18:30hours, after sunset, when darkness is beginning to set in.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} microaerobic {{composting}} (MC) {{can be used}} to decompose vegetal matter with a short turnover time and large carbon (C) recycling potential. We used a novel method for measuring the degree of fragmentation of water-insoluble acid-soluble (WIAS) polysaccharides as a proxy in tracking their relative degree of degradation (i. e., fragmentation endpoint index). Oak leaves and <b>food</b> <b>scrap</b> processed by MC reached a fragmentation end point within 2  weeks. After amending the MC products into soil, the half-life of the polysaccharide residues was ~ 6 – 7 times longer (~ 100 – 110  days) than that measured during MC. The main products given up during MC were volatile organic acids (VOAs), alcohols and soluble carbohydrates in the compost tea, and CO 2. These products accounted for about 2 % of the initial carbon in the feedstock. Very small amounts of VOAs, particularly butyric acid, were formed in the amended soil. Based on a residence time of materials in fermentors of 2  weeks, a ~ 100 -m 3 capacity MC facility could process 2, 000 – 4, 000 metric tons of vegetable matter amended in ten hectares of arable land per year...|$|E

Socio-demographic data were evaluated with anthropometry through the index of body mass, personal and family history, behaviors and habits of food, diet and physical activity. Frequency distribution boxes with absolute values and percentages and required parametric and non-parametric tests, were used for statistical analysis. It was found that the eutrophic received more exclusive and less artificial breastfeeding (p< 0, 05). The family history of obesity was most common in the obese (p< 0, 05). Obese had a speed to eat faster and more preferred <b>food</b> <b>scrap</b> to the eutrophic (p< 0, 05).

40|$|For many people, {{recycling}} is a habitual environmental action. In recent years, however, critics {{have shown that}} municipal recycling programs are not always environmentally beneficial. Municipal waste management programs are, nevertheless, a key lever through which cities can influence material consumption, which is a driver of ecological overshoot and greenhouse gas emissions. Through transformation of municipal waste management, including and beyond the adoption of expanded recycling programs, cities can potentially reduce their environmental footprints. In the U. S., some cities {{seem to have been}} able to do this, and while most have not. This dissertation asks why. Specifically, I ask if Seattle, a city known for its progressive waste programming, is substantially different from Boston, a city with relatively average waste and recycling programs-beyond the superficial metric of diversion rate. If so, how? Further, what enabled Seattle to fundamentally change its complex, socio-technical waste system? I find that the cities do differ meaningfully. Seattle's high diversion rate is a signal of deeper institutional changes to its waste system that position the city in opposition to dominant regimes of waste generation and management in the U. S. To compare the two cities, I use a combination of grounded theory and process tracing techniques to analyze archival data, interviews with system actors, and local press from 1980 to 2016. Building on Zsuzsa's Gille's theory of waste regimes, I argue that the U. S. is dominated by a "weak recycling waste regime" that prioritizes hygiene, sanitation, and efficiency, while allowing limited post-consumer recycling of a few materials-paper, glass, metal, and plastic-regardless of the environmental efficacy of doing so. This regime is a product of the sanitary engineering discipline, the demands of a consumption-driven capitalist economy, and the influence of manufacturers seeking to avoid more invasive environmental regulation; it depends on rapid disposal and relatively invisible garbage. Boston operates well within the parameters of this regime. Seattle, on the other hand, has fundamentally reoriented its waste system towards goals of waste reduction and resource stewardship. Seattle and Boston's waste systems differ in many ways, but the key difference lies not in organizational or infrastructural distinction, but in how each city responded to a disposal crisis in the early 1980 s. Seattle's crisis led to a wide open public dialogue about garbage, through which the problem of waste in the city was redefined. Traditional problem frames of sanitation and disposal gave way to new problem frames about the value of the materials in the waste stream and the environmental costs of squandering them through incineration or burial in a landfill. The inclusive, public redefinition process led to a new set of institutions for governing waste, from legislated waste reduction goals, to autonomy for programmatic experimentation, to-slowly over time-new roles for citizens and state. Instead of being locked in a service-provider-client relationship, Seattle's waste programs treat residents as partners in a project of resource stewardship, and cast the city government as both a responsible consumer and a programmatic innovator. Through this process, Seattle has achieved a remarkable recycling rate, but more importantly, has instituted curbside <b>food</b> <b>scrap</b> composting, nudged residents towards deeper engagement with their discards, and experimented successfully with restricting the use of toxic and hard-to-recycle materials. In Boston, on the other hand, from the moment of crisis through 2016, the city's waste managers retained traditional views of garbage and the project of waste management. Limited planning and limited input have served to maintain focus on conventional concerns about cleanliness, sanitation, and efficient disposal. As predicted by the waste regime, the city has a minimal recycling program that conforms to industry standards. I conceptualize the key differences between Seattle and Boston through a framework of wasteways. The term is borrowed from sewer engineering and redefined to provide a framework for understanding how unique municipal waste systems relate to dominant waste regimes. The transformation that took place in Seattle during the 1980 s gave rise to an alternative wasteway [...] a system that is institutionally organized to resist the waste regime. Within Boston's mainstream wasteway, on the other hand, the city's waste system has operated, from the disposal crisis moving forward, as we would expect given the dominant regime. Analyzing municipal wasteways-a framework that can be applied to any city in any context, and could be expanded to include other urban systems-draws attention to the institutional changes that support infrastructural change. Recycling alone may not be sufficient to achieve sustainable materials practice, but the underlying institutional evolution in Seattle suggests that cities can achieve bold-even radical-changes to material practices at the urban scale. 4 by Lily Baum Pollans.
