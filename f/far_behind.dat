In a poll from 22 November 2008, the Social Democratic Alliance led with 33.6%, {{followed}} by the Left-Green Alliance at 27.8% and the Independence Party at 24.8%; the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party were <b>far</b> <b>behind,</b> with only 6.3% and 4.3%, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's victory {{made him}} a {{favorite}} for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao. Yet, despite his result in the Interzonal, Fischer only finished fourth out of eight with 14/27 (+8−7=12), <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> Tigran Petrosian (17½/27), Efim Geller, and Paul Keres (both 17/27). Tal fell very ill during the tournament, and had to withdraw before completion. Fischer, a friend of Tal, was the only contestant who visited him in the hospital.|$|E

5|$|In 2005 India {{enacted the}} National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). Some of its primary goals were to reduce infant {{mortality}} {{and also the}} maternal mortality ratio. Additionally, the NHRM aimed to create universal access to public health services and also balance the gender ratio. However, a 2011 research study conducted by Nair and Panda found that although India was able to improve some measures of maternal health since {{the enactment of the}} NHRM in 2005, the country was still <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> most emerging economies.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels {{built in the}} interim, so {{by the turn of}} the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, {{exhausted}} North Korean {{troops were}} caught unaware by the landings at Inchon, <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> their lines. Those forces that remained after 15 days of fighting {{were forced to}} retreat in a total rout or risk being completely cut off. Isolated North Korean resistance continued until September 18, but on that date UN troops were mounting a full-scale breakout offensive and pursuing retreating North Korean units to the north, ending the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

He received 203,639 more votes than the Bergland/Lewis ticket four years prior. The largest percentage won by Paul came in Alaska, where he received 2.74%. In Washington, he missed his goal of 5% with a 0.92% showing. In Utah, Paul received 1.16%.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, {{held back}} by their closed economies, {{the lack of any}} {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E
5|$|The attacks caught UN {{planners}} and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops {{believed they had}} destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> North Korean lines {{at the port of}} Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the North Koreans would mount a serious offensive before then.|$|E

5|$|The paper, first {{owned by}} the Reid family, {{struggled}} financially {{for most of its}} life and rarely generated enough profit for growth or capital improvements; the Reids subsidized the Herald Tribune through the paper's early years. However, it enjoyed prosperity during World War II {{and by the end of}} the conflict had pulled close to the Times in ad revenue. A series of disastrous business decisions, combined with aggressive competition from the Times and poor leadership from the Reid family, left the Herald Tribune <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> its rival.|$|E
5|$|The {{subspecies}} of {{this bird}} {{can usually be}} distinguished by their difference in size and plumage. The subspecies Phaethon aethereus mesonauta can be differentiated by its slightly rosy tinge when its plumage is fresh, the bolder look of the black barring on the upperwing, and the more solid look of the black on the outer wing. The subspecies P. a. indicus can be distinguished by its smaller size, its smaller mask on the face, which often does not extend <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> the eye, and its more orange bill with black cutting edge.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. This situation is commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E

5|$|At 14:00 on 8 February, {{four days}} after leaving the Îles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the {{approaching}} ship to halt and prepare for boarding. Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> during the night. At 08:00 {{on the morning of}} 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.|$|E
5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. <b>Far</b> <b>behind</b> on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Australia also formed {{small-scale}} raiding and reconnaissance forces, most {{of which}} were grouped together as the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Z Special Unit conducted raids <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> the front line, including a successful raid on Singapore in September 1943. M Special Unit, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often used to support Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate tasks such as tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially-equipped unit (No.200Flight) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} the general {{election}} were Democratic nominee, Attorney General Martha Coakley, and independent Joseph L. Kennedy (no relation to the Kennedy family). At the outset, he faced overwhelming odds because he was relatively unknown compared to Coakley, he was running as a Republican in a very Democratic state, and much of his campaigning had to be done during the Christmas and New Year's season when citizens do not generally pay much attention to politics. No Republican had been elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. He polled <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> Coakley for several months, but closed the gap in the early weeks of January.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{continued}} west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; {{he hoped}} to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not <b>far</b> <b>behind.</b> Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day-by-day they gathered new supporters Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from Chepstow, probably aiming first for Lundy and then for Ireland, where the King hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and they landed at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged <b>far</b> <b>behind</b> the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
