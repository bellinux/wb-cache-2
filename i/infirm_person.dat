The provision for the maintenance and support of all dependents of the community in any one year — whether children, helpless invalids, improvident persons., or the aged infirm — is purely an economic question, and depends, not upon an ideal State, but directly and entirely upon the products and services created or supplied by the independent active breadwinners of the community for the time being.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to ascertain how primary nursing care is perceived by both the elderly infirm living in the community and their district nurses. How the perceptions of needs for care were translated into action and the sort of expectations they had and results they achieved. The research also examined whether or not differences in nursing care patterns occurred between those nurses working within a primary health care team and those aligned to a number of single-handed general practices. The main research instrument was in the form of interview schedules. These contained structured and open ended questions as well as Likert assessment scales, and were administered by the researcher to patients, nurses and general practitioners at various stages of care. Over a period of 18 months a total of two-hundred patients and their district nurses and general practitioners from one health district participated. The results were analysed {{with the help of a}} computerised statistical package for social science. The findings indicate that district nurses' perception of patient needs is illness focused and, as such, prescribe and give nursing care on the basis of the medical model. The patients' perceive their state of health mainly in terms of discomfort and disability and their effects. As their problems manifest themselves to a great extent in multiple health as well as social issues as a legacy of past life events, a shift from the medical towards the social model of care seems, therefore, of prime importance. There is little doubt that where district nurses become involved with the elderly <b>infirm</b> <b>person</b> she becomes the focal health care professional support. It seems that this emphasis on the district nurse becoming the key member of the primary health care team produces a whole new set of values. This approach has implications not only for post basic nurse training but also demands a change of attitude towards organisational support. As the role of the district nurses as a fully participant health care team member in Attachment schemes has not been established conclusively in this research it is important to consider professional support by strengthening the peer reference group. These findings and their limitations are discussed and areas of further research identified...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to examine trends {{in the pattern of}} house {{survival}} during a bushfire by analysing data from 450 houses affected by the bushfire of 16 February 1983 at Mount Macedon, Victoria. The possible effects on house survival of fire intensity, house design and construction materials, garden and bushland vegetation, topography, the proximity of fuels and other buildings, and the fire-fighting activities of residents and others, were evaluated. Literature concerning plant flammability was reviewed in terms of the "physical" and "chemical characteristics of live foliage. Flammability was found to decrease with increasing moisture and mineral content, with decreasing extractive content, and with decreases in the product of sample density, specific heat, and thickness. The influence on house survival of garden plants was, however, considered to depend on more than just foliage flammability: other factors, such as the degree of maintenance of the garden complex, might also be important. A logit model fitted to the house survival data established a relationship between the probability of house survival and the following variables:- fire intensity, attendance during a fire by householders and others, wall material, roof material and pitch, the proximity of flammable materials (such as heaps of fire-wood), and the height of garden vegetation. Fire intensity was considered {{to be the most important}} determinant of house survival, and fuel reduction was considered to be the major priority for the protection of houses against bushfires. The results of the survey suggested that able-bodied residents who are threatened by a bushfire should remain in their houses rather than flee in the hope of escaping the fire. Widespread adoption of this strategy may result in fewer deaths and a marked reduction in the loss of houses. Provision should, however, be made to evacuate - at least temporarily - disabled or <b>infirm</b> <b>persons</b> and the residents of houses surrounded by exceptionally high fuel loads.

It is known that the Bedesmen entered the Hospital: [...] ".. separate from the world of all worldly imployments and relations ….(professing) to betack themselves to Godlivership …" [...] They were distinguished by a russet gown and an identifying badge. They received new clothes annually and were banned from asking for alms outwith the Hospital.

A reference to their life in the archives of Aberdeen Council records that they spent: [...] " [...] … their days in prayer, reading mortification conference and other suchlike Christian exercises.." [...] What is also known is that tensions grew between the Merchants and the Craftsmen or Tradesmen over entry to the Hospital. [...] In practice the Merchants monopolized the use of the Hospital.
