A perfect tense is one which carries an implication {{that the result}} of a past action still holds at the present time; for example, wabwera [...] "he has come" [...] implies that the person <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>here.</b> The past tenses in Chichewa carry exactly the opposite implication, namely that the result of the past action no longer holds; for example the Recent Past tense anabwéra [...] "he came" [...] implies that the person has now gone. This kind of tense is known in modern linguistics as discontinuous past. It differs from the English Past Simple, which is generally neutral in implication.|$|E
