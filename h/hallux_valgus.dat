40|$|Objectives: To get {{insight into}} medical {{opinions}} {{about the use of}} orthopaedic footwear and the medical and social factors related to the prescription of orthopaedic footwear by orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners. Methods: In this study 85 orthopaedists and 96 rehabilitation practitioners filled out a questionnaire measuring perceived desirability of prescribing orthopaedic footwear in specific medical conditions, the perceived advantages of orthopaedic footwear, the perceived disadvantages of orthopaedic footwear, the attitude to orthopaedic footwear and satisfaction with the co-operation with the pedorthist. Clinicians were asked to estimate their referral rate of orthopaedic footwear. Results: Orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners agree that the prescription of orthopaedic footwear should be considered in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, amputation of the foot and diabetic foot and not be considered in the case of sprain and back pain. In the case of <b>hallux</b> <b>valgi,</b> dermatological problems and clavus (severe corn) a reticent prescription policy seems to be the optimal choice. In the other medical conditions studied no unequivocal prescription policy could be derived. Respondents who prescribed orthopaedic footwear more than the median (more than 50 prescriptions per year) were more often rehabilitation practitioner, perceived more advantages of prescription footwear, perceived less disadvantages of prescription footwear and were more satisfied about the co-operation with the pedorthist. Conclusion: In some medical conditions orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners agree about the optimal use of orthopaedic footwear. In some other medical conditions orthopaedists and rehabilitation practitioners are divided about the use of orthopaedic footwear.

Root described HAV has a progressive subluxation of the first metatarsoªphalangeal joint in which the first metatarsal inverts relative to the hallux, followed by subluxation of the <b>hallux</b> into <b>valgus.</b> Abduction of the hallux is followed by subluxation of the first ray and adduction of the first metatarsal, increasing the inter metatarsal angle Mann and Coughlin described HAV as a static subluxation of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, with medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the great toe. Gerbert defined HAV as a hallucal relationship to the first metatarsal head, encompassing deviations of the entire MPJ, in all three planes. HAV is, in fact, a triplanar deformity lying on the frontal, transverse and sagittal planes. • Frontal plane: valgus rotation of the hallux rotated so that its plantar aspect is more prominent laterally. • Transverse plane: hallux is laterally deviated toward lesser toes. • Sagittal plane: hallux is rotated with dorsal or plantar deviation. It is characterized by abduction of the hallux from the midline of the body, progressive rotation of the hallux at the first MPJ and adduction of the first metatarsal with prominence of the head medially.

Methods: A review of literature was conducted using MEDLINE, MANTIS, Science Direct, Index to Chiropractic Literature, and PEDro from March 2008 to May 2011. Inclusion criteria required peripheral diagnosis and MT with or without adjunctive care. Clinical trials were assessed for quality using a modified Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) ranking system. Results: In addition to the citations used in a 2009 systematic review, an additional 399 new citations were accessed: 175 citations in Medline, 30 citations in MANTIS, 98 through Science Direct, 54 from Index to Chiropractic Literature, and 42 from the PEDro database. Forty-eight clinical trials were assessed for quality. Conclusions: Regarding MT for common lower extremity disorders, there is a level of B (fair evidence) for short-term and C (limited evidence) for long-term treatment of hip osteoarthritis. There is a level of B for short-term and C for long-term treatment of knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and ankle inversion sprain.

40|$|Context <b>Hallux</b> abducto <b>valgus</b> (HAV) is a {{frequent}} cause of great toe pain and disability, yet common treatments are only supported by mixed or equivocal research findings. Surgery often only provides modest improvement and post-surgery complications may significantly hamper outcomes, implying the need for trials testing conservative treatment, such as manual and manipulative therapy, particularly in cases where surgery may be contraindicated or premature. The purpose of this exploratory trial was to test an innovative protocol of manual and manipulative therapy (MMT) and compare it to standard care of a night splint(s) for symptomatic mild to moderate HAV, with a view gather insight into the effectiveness of MMT and inform {{the design of a}} definitive trial.

40|$|<b>Hallux</b> Abducto <b>Valgus</b> (HAV) is {{a common}} cause of foot pain causing {{deformity}} and often disability. The female population is more frequently affected by HAV than the male population with the two main causative factors being congenital and inappropriate footwear. Surgery is the most prevalent treatment, {{but it does not}} take into consideration the biomechanical effects on the biomechanical chain and therefore the deformity frequently reoccurs and complications after surgery are many. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the efficacy of the Brantingham protocol versus the HAV Night Splint in the treatment of painful HAV. Thirty participants were selected to participate in the study and certain criteria had to be met. Participants were randomly divided into two groups, Group 1 was treated using a chiropractic protocol. The Brantingham Protocol that consisted of mobilization and specific adjustment of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was used. Group 2 was treated by the use of a HAV Night Splint. Patients were treated over a 2 -week period, twice a week with a 1 -week follow up and a 1 -month follow up. The lasting effect of the individual treatments was determined by the follow-up periods. Objective and subjective measurements were taken at each visit. Subjective measurements consisted of the McGill pain questionnaire (Melzack, 1975) (Appendix D), visual analogue scale (Masarsky and Todres-Masarsky, 2001) (Appendix B) and the foot function index pain scale (Saag et al., 1996) (Appendix C). Objective measurements consisted of passive Plantar and Dorsiflexion of the First metatarsophalangeal joint. The results indicated a statistical and numerical significance within and between each group both subjectively and objectively. Group 1 proved to be superior to Group 2 in the treatment of painful HAV. In conclusion, both the Brantingham Protocol and the HAV Night Splint proved to be effective in the treatment of painful HAV.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a {{systematic}} review on manipulative therapy for lower extremity conditions and expand on a previously published literature review. Methods: The Scientific Commission of the Council on Chiropractic Guidelines and Practice Parameters (CCGPP) was charged with developing literature syntheses, organized by anatomical region, to evaluate and report on the evidence base for chiropractic care. This article is the outcome of this charge. As part of the CCGPP process, preliminary drafts of these articles were posted on the CCGPP Web site www. ccgpp. org (2006 - 8) to allow for an open process and the broadest possible mechanism for stakeholder input. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; PubMed; Manual, Alternative, and Natural Therapy Index System; Science Direct; and Index to Chiropractic Literature were searched from December 2006 to February 2008. Search terms included chiropractic, osteopathic, orthopedic, or physical therapy and MeSH terms for each region. Inclusion criteria required a diagnosis and manipulative therapy (mobilization and manipulation grades I-V) with or without adjunctive care. Exclusion criteria were pain referred from spinal sites (without diagnosis), referral for surgery, and conditions contraindicated for manipulative therapy. Clinical trials were assessed using a modified Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network ranking system. Results: Of the total 389 citations captured, 39 were determined to be relevant. There is a level of C or limited evidence for manipulative therapy combined with multimodal or exercise therapy for hip osteoarthritis. There is a level of B or fair evidence for manipulative therapy of the knee and/or full kinetic chain, and of the ankle and/or foot, combined with multimodal or exercise therapy for knee osteoarthritis, patellofemoral pain syndrome, and ankle inversion sprain.

Conclusions The diabetic subject with <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus</b> has the following feature: (1) It showed a larger width than the one of group diabetic without <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus,</b> although significant difference only showed in the normal level; (2) A lager pressure value were existing on the group diabetic <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus</b> group under all of foot region, in comparison with that of group diabetic without <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus,</b> and average distinction was more than 20 %; (3) The same condition happened on the comparison with normal subjects with <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus</b> and also the difference could reach the average of 20 %, while diabetic <b>hallux</b> <b>valgus</b> had a smaller value on the regions of second and third metatarsal head;(4) A special attention need to be paid to this group in correct footwear wearing in order to avoiding the foot damage.
