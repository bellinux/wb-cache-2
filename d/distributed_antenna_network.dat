40|$|Abstract—Single-carrier <b>distributed</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>network</b> (SC-DAN), {{in which}} a group of {{multiple}} antennas are distributed in a cell serve a user, can mitigate adverse impacts of path loss, shadowing loss and multipath fading. Frequency-domain space-time block coded-joint transmit/ receive diversity (FD-STBC-JTRD) is attractive for downlink transmission since an arbitrary number of distributed transmit antennas can be used. FD-STBC-JTRD requires the channel state information (CSI) only at the transmitter side and therefore, the complexity problem of mobile terminals can be alleviated. In this paper, we investigate, by computer simulation, the bit error rate (BER) distribution of the SC-DAN downlink. We discuss {{the impact of the}} number of distributed antennas involved in FD-STBC-JTRD on the BER outage probability.

According to the modified scheme, known as interference-aware CS-DCA (IACS-DCA), the average CCI is computed for the available channels and a CCI table attached to each antenna is created {{with the first}} channel to have the lowest CCI value. Hence, before a transmission attempt, the user selects the closest <b>distributed</b> <b>antenna</b> and the first channel of the corresponding table is assigned to him. In the simulation analysis, the performance improvement due {{to the existence of}} DAN is confirmed. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to a fixed channel allocation (FCA) mechanism is proven. Based on this mechanism, the authors in [11] examine several metrics such as the autocorrelation function, the fairness index of channel reuse pattern and the minimum co-channel distance among the BSs. From their analysis, {{it can be seen that}} the proposed scheme forms a CCI minimized channel reuse pattern that ameliorates the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) compared to other channel assignments schemes.|$|R

30|$|Energy {{supply is}} a major design {{constraint}} for conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the lifetime {{is limited by the}} total energy available in the batteries. Some specific sensors in WSNs may consume more energy than the radio during a long acquisition time [1]. Replacing the batteries periodically may prolong the lifetime but not be a viable option when the replacement is considered to be too inconvenient, too dangerous, or even impossible when sensors are deployed in harsh conditions, e.g., in toxic environments or inside human bodies. Therefore, harvesting energy from the environment is a promising approach to cope with battery supplies and the increasing energy demand [2]. The energy that can be harvested includes solar energy, piezoelectric energy, or thermal energy, etc. and is theoretically unlimited. Besides, background radio-frequency (RF) signals radiated by ambient transmitters can also be a viable new source for wireless power transfer (WPT) [3, 4] and (Ng et al.:Secure and Green SWIPT in <b>Distributed</b> <b>Antenna</b> <b>Networks</b> with Limited Backhaul Capacity, submitted). Unlike the conventional WSNs that are subject to a power constraint or sum energy constraint, each sensor with energy harvesting capabilities is, in every time slot, constrained to use the most amount of stored energy currently available, although more energy may be available in the future slot. Therefore, a causality constraint is imposed {{on the use of the}} harvested energy. Current researches on the energy harvesting issues mostly have focused on wireless communication systems. Gatzianas et al. [5] considered a cross-layer resource allocation problem to maximize the total system utility, and Ho and Zhang [6] studied the throughput maximization with causal side information and full side information for wireless communication systems. Ng et al. [3] studied the design of a resource allocation algorithm minimizing the total transmit power for the case when the legitimate receivers are able to harvest energy form RF signals for a multiuser multiple-input single-output downlink system. Energy management policies were studied for energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) in [7], where sensor nodes have energy-harvesting capabilities, aiming at maximizing the system throughput and reducing the system delay.|$|R

A few major issues of the L-DAS, such as high latency, energy consumption, computational complexity, and large feedback (signaling) overhead, are identified. The potential capability of the L-DAS is illuminated in terms of an energy efficiency (EE) throughout the paper. We firstly and gener-ally model the power consumption of an L-DAS, and formulate an EE maximization problem. To tackle two crucial issues, namely the huge computational complexity and large amount of feed-back (signaling) information, we propose a channel-gain-based antenna selection (AS) method and an interference-based user clustering (UC) method. The original problem is then split into multiple subproblems by a cluster, and each cluster’s precoding and power control are managed in parallel for high EE. Simu-lation results reveal that i) using all antennas for zero-forcing multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) is energy inefficient if there is nonnegligible overhead power consumption on MU-MIMO processing, and ii) increasing the number of antennas does not necessarily result in a high EE. Furthermore, the results validate and underpin the EE merit of the proposed L-DAS complied with the AS, UC, precoding, and power control by comparing with non-clustering L-DAS and colocated antenna systems.

The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an optimization problem {{taking into account}} the antenna circuit power consumption of the BSs and the quality of service (QoS) requirements of both uplink and downlink users. We minimize the total network power consumption by jointly optimizing the downlink beamformer, the uplink transmit power, and the antenna selection. To overcome the intractability of the resulting problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem with decoupled binary selection variables and non-convex constraints. The reformulated problem facilitates the design of an iterative resource allocation algorithm which obtains an optimal solution based on the generalized Bender's decomposition (GBD) and serves as a benchmark scheme. Furthermore, {{to strike a balance between}} computational complexity and system performance, a suboptimal algorithm with polynomial time complexity is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based iterative algorithm converges to the global optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance. Our results also demonstrate the trade-off between power efficiency and the number of active transmit antennas when the circuit power consumption is taken into account. In particular, activating an exceedingly large number of antennas may not be a power efficient solution for reducing the total system power consumption. In addition, our results reveal that FD systems facilitate significant power savings compared to traditional half-duplex systems, despite the non-negligible self-interference.

40|$|Abstrac 1 —Composite fading {{takes place}} in several {{communication}} channels due to the random variations of the local average power of the received multipath-faded signal. The generalized-K (Gamma–Gamma) probability density function (PDF) has been proposed recently to model composite fading in wireless channels. However, further derivations using the generalized-K PDF have shown to be quite involved due to the computational and analytical difficulties associated with the arising special functions. In this paper, the approximation of the generalized-K PDF by a Gamma PDF using the moment matching method is explored. As expected, matching positive and negative moments leads to a better approximation in {{the upper and lower}} tail regions, respectively. However, due to arising limitations for small values of the multipath fading and shadowing parameters, and the higher level of accuracy sought, the use of an adjustable form for the expressions of the approximating Gamma PDF parameters, obtained by matching the first two positive moments, is devised. The optimal values of the adjustment factor for different integer and non-integer values of the fading and shadowing parameters are given.
