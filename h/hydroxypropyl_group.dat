50|$|The {{class of}} eldecalcitol is a vitamin D3 derivative. This {{molecule}} has a molecular weight of 490.71 grams per mole. The eldecalcitol analog of calcitriol, contains a <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>group</b> {{in the lower}} cyclohexane ring. The synthesis of eldecalcitol incorporates two units assembled together. The IUPAC names include (3S, 4S, 5R)-oct-1-en-7-yne-3,4,5-triol that is fused to a bicyclic system, (R)-6-((1R, 3aR, 7aR, E)-4-(bromomethylene)-7a-methyloctahydro-1H-inden-1-yl)-2-methylheptan-2-ol. The assembly process includes a Diels-Alder reaction to give the fully protected eldecalcitol. In {{order to get the}} parent molecule, the hydroxyl groups have to be deprotected. The chemistry of eldecalcitol allows for its binding 2.7-fold more potently than calcitriol. In addition, some vitamin D derivatives have been known to inhibit the serum parathyroid hormone. Eldecalcitol only weakly inhibits the serum parathyroid hormone, making it an even more appealing medicinal drug for its physiological uses in the treatment of osteoporosis. Animal studies of eldecalcitol, in ovariectomized rats, show improvements in bone mass while lowering bone reabsorption to demonstrate its effectiveness in osteoporosis treatment.|$|E

40|$|Revealing the substituents {{distribution}} within starch {{can help}} to understand the changes of starch properties after modification. The distribution of substituents over cross-linked and hydroxypropylated sweet potato starch was investigated and compared with modified potato starch. The starches were cross-linked with sodium trimetaphosphate and/or hydroxypropylated with propylene oxide. The native and modified starches were gelatinized and hydrolysed by pullulanase, ß-amylase, a-amylase and a combination of pullulanase, a-amylase and amyloglucosidase. The hydrolysates were analysed by HPSEC, HPAEC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Cross-linking had only a slight effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis, where hydroxypropylation evidently limited the enzymatic hydrolysis. The results obtained suggest that the hydroxypropyl substituents are not distributed regularly over the starch chains. Although the average substitution was around 2 <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> per 10 glucose units, in the enzyme digests of hydroxypropylated starches, oligomer fragments of 10 – 15 glucose units, carrying 5 – 8 <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups,</b> were identified. It is hypothesised that higher levels of substituents {{are present in the}} amorphous regions and periphery of clusters of starch granules.

As a result, it may be possible that different lots of macromolecular excipients that nominally conform to certain set specifications (degree of substitution, molar substitution, % content of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups)</b> may yet contain subpopulations, whose chemical attributes may differ widely from the average, and also differ widely from subpopulations in other lots.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of phosphorus and hydroxypropyl groups within granules of cross-linked and hydroxypropylated sweet potato starches were investigated. Chemical surface peeling of starch granules was performed after sieving of native and modified starches into large-size (diameter = 20 µm) and small-size (diameter < 20 µm) fractions. Starch granules were surface gelatinized in a 4 M calcium chloride solution at different levels. After the peeling step, the remaining starch granules were analysed for {{the content of}} phosphorus and hydroxypropyl groups. The phosphorus level of the parental starch gradually decreased from periphery to core of the granules. The increase in phosphorus content after cross-linking in periphery was higher than that in core. The subsequent hydroxypropylation reaction resulted in lower phosphate levels.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{experiments}} was twofold: (1) {{to determine if the}} location of chemical reactions within starch granules can be controlled by altering reaction conditions; and (2) to investigate channels in starch granules and determine the implication of their presence. To address the first objective, a rapid, valid method was needed to locate granular reaction sites. A reflection confocal laser scanning microscopy (R-CLSM) method was developed to locate anionic substituents within granules. The method was applied to two types of derivatizing groups: mono- and distarch phosphate ester groups and the 2 -hydroxy- 3 -sulfonylpropyl ether group, the latter being an anionic analog of the <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>group.</b> The method revealed native anionic sites in granules, presumably due to proteins, ionic lipids, and/or phosphate ester groups. To determine the degree to which location of reaction sites is a function of reaction conditions, a constant level of an anionic propylene oxide analog was used and temperature, pH, and swelling inhibiting salt type and concentration was varied during reactions with waxy maize starch granules. Reaction sites were located utilizing the RCLSM method. Results indicated that reaction conditions controlled both uniformity of reaction on a granule basis and molar substitution (MS) levels (in granules reacted with propylene oxide under similar conditions). ^ Channels were discovered {{for the first time in}} transitory starch granules of potato, sweet potato, horse chestnut, oak, and hickory leaves. Channels were not observed in storage starch granules in those same plants, except for starch granules from hickory nuts. The fact that channels were observed for transitory granules but not in most storage granules is indicative of the different roles of the two types of granules. Channels were found for the first time in granules of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Channels in maize and hl sorghum endosperm starch granules were found to be lined with proteins (including F-actin) and phospholipid. A hypothesis for a biosynthetic role for channels in starch granules is presented. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Thermoresponsive {{polymers}} {{were successfully}} synthesized {{by a combination}} of atom transfer radical poly-merization (ATRP) and Cu(I) -catalyzed 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of azide and alkynes (click chemistry). Poly(2 -hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) was synthesized by ATRP, followed by introduction of alkyne groups using pentynoic acid, leading to HEMA-alkyne. Homopolymers having secondary amine groups, tertiary amines with hydroxyethyl and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> were synthesized by adding 2 -azido-N-ethyl-ethanamine, 2 -[(2 -azidoethyl) amino]ethanol, and 2 -[(2 -azidoethyl) amino]propanol, respectively, to the PHEMA-alkyne backbone using click chemistry. Molecular weight (MW), molecular weight distribution (MWD), and click reaction efficiency were determined by gel permeation chro-matography (GPC) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|Hydroxypropylation {{was carried}} out on heat-moisture treated (HMT) wheat, potato and waxy maize starches. Hydroxypropylation {{increased}} swelling factor and amylose leaching of both native and HMT starches. Hydroxypropylation of HMT starches reduced enthalpies of gelatinization and amylopectin retrogradation more than for the corresponding non-HMT hydroxypropylated starches. This indicates that heat-moisture treatment increases the derivatization of amylopectin. Disruption and reorientation of amylopectin double helices during heat-moisture treatment could facilitate the access of reaction reagent to the highly ordered crystalline regions resulting in greater derivatization. Cold paste viscosity was greatly increased with high pasting stability when <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> were introduced to HMT wheat and potato starches. Alkaline treatment increased gelatinization temperature of all the starches but enthalpy was unaffected. Amylose leaching and swelling factor greatly increased in wheat but decreased in potato and waxy maize starches with alkaline treatment. This increased amylose leaching and swelling factor along with greater reduction of amylose-lipid complex endotherm of wheat starch by alkaline treatment {{is consistent with the}} disruption of amylose-lipid complex. The amylose-lipid complex is susceptible to hydrolysis in alkaline conditions. Heat-moisture treatment had no influence on transition parameters of amylose-lipid complex. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Native {{potato starch}} was {{physically}} modified by heat-moisture treatment (100 °C, 16 h, 30 % moisture) and defatting (75 %, n-propanol water, 7 h). The changes in structure and physicochemical properties on heat-moisture treatment and defatting were monitored by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM), X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Brabender viscosities, swelling factor (SF) and amylose leaching (AML). SEM showed that neither defatting nor heat-moisture treatment altered the size, shape or the surface appearance of the native starch granule. Heat-moisture treatment decreased X-ray diffraction intensities and altered the 'B' type X-ray diffraction pattern to 'A+B'. The decrease in X-ray intensities on heat-moisture treatment is indicative of crystallite disruption and/or rearrangement of double helices. The gelatinization enthalpy (∆H), Brabender viscosity (at 95 °C), SF and AML decreased on heat-moisture treatment, whereas gelatinization transition temperatures (GTT), and thermal stability increased. Defatting increased the X-ray diffraction intensities and altered the X-ray pattern from 'B' to 'A+B'. The increased X-ray intensities on defatting is indicative of interactions between amylose - amylose (AM-AM), amylopectin - amylopectin (AMP-AMP) and amylose - amylopectin (AM-AMP) chains. These interactions in turn, increased GTT, ∆H and thermal stability. However, SF, AML and Brabender viscosity (at 95 °C) decreased on defatting. [...] The reagents (NaOH and Na₂SO₄) used during hydroxypropylation did not alter granule morphology and AML in native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starches. X- ray diffraction patterns of native and defatted starches changed on alkaline treatment, whereas that of heat-moisture treated starch remained unaltered. These changes reflected double helical disruption (within the amorphous regions), and altered crystallite orientation. In all three starches, alkaline conditions decreased ∆H and Brabender viscosity (at 95 °C), and increased SF. The extent of the above changes followed the order : native > defatted > heat-moisture treated. Gelatinization transition temperatures remained unchanged on alkaline treatment. [...] Native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starches were converted {{to a range of}} hydroxypropyl derivatives using propylene oxide (at concentrations ranging from 2 - 25 %v/w). At 2 %(v/w) propylene oxide, all three starches showed similar molar substitution (MS 0. 05). However, at 5 - 25 %(v/w) propylene oxide, the accessibility of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> into the starch granule followed the order: heat-moisture treated > native > defatted. This showed that the degree of accessibility of <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> into the granule interior is dependent upon granule crystallinity. In all three starches, an increase in MS progressively decreased GTT, ∆H and AML. The influence of MS on SF of hydroxypropylated native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starches was due to the interplay that occurs between hydrogen bond disruption (due to <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups)</b> within the amorphous regions, and the increased interactions that occur between starch chains during defatting and heat-moisture treatment. Pasting temperatures of all starches decreased with increased MS. In defatted starch, Brabender viscosity (at 95 °C) progressively increased with increase in MS. However, in native and heat-moisture treated starches, Brabender viscosity (at 95 °C) began to decrease (due to granule disruption) at MS levels beyond 0. 18 and 0. 20, respectively. [...] Enzyme digestibility studies showed that both defatting (hot 75 % n-propanol, 0 - 7 h) and heat-moisture treatment (100 °C, 30 % moisture, 0 - 16 h) increased the susceptibility of potato starch granules towards hydrolysis by porcine pancreatic α- amylase. These differences were attributed to structural changes that occurred within the amorphous and crystalline regions of the starch granule during defatting and heat-moisture treatment. However, hydrolysis decreased (due to formation of new crystallites) when heat-moisture treatment and defatting were continued beyond 8 h and 9 h, respectively. [...] Native, defatted (7 h) and heat-moisture treated (16 h) potato starches were hydroxypropylated (to different levels of MS) with propylene oxide (2 - 20 %). The results showed that the reagents (NaOH and Na₂SO₄) used during hydroxypropylation increased the susceptibility of the above starches (native > defatted > heat-moisture treated) towards hydrolysis by α-amylase. Addition of propylene oxide (hydroxypropylation) to alkali treated starches, further enhanced their susceptibility towards α-amylase. However, granule susceptibility towards α-amylase did not increase exponentially with increase in MS. The extent of hydrolysis began to decrease at MS levels of 0. 29 (native), 0. 28 (heat-moisture treated) and 0. 26 (defatted). The decrease in hydrolysis at higher MS levels is indicative of the steric effect imposed by bulky <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> on the accessibility of α-amylase towards the glycosidic bonds of amylose and amylopectin. [...] The retrogradation properties of potato starch gels (stored for 24 h at 4 °C and then for 34 days at 40 °C) before and after physical (defatting and heat-moisture treatment), and chemical (hydroxypropylation) modification were monitored using turbidity measurements, SEM, DSC, X-ray diffraction and enzyme susceptibility. Turbidity development in native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starch pastes during storage (4 °C for 24 h and then at 40 °C for 34 days) followed the order : native > defatted > heat-moisture treated. In all three starches, the highest rate of turbidity development was observed during the first 24 h of storage (at 4 °C). The above results in conjunction with SEM observations showed that turbidity development is influenced by the interaction between leached starch components (AM-AM, AM-AMP, AMP-AMP), and interaction between granule remnants and leached starch components (amylose and amylopectin). In alkali treated gelatinized native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starch pastes, turbidity development (native > defatted > heat-moisture treated) was influenced by aggregation of granule remnants. In native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starch pastes, both the rate and extent of turbidity development (on storage) decreased after hydroxypropylation. This decrease was due to the interplay of : 1) steric effects imposed by <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> on chain aggregation, 2) aggregation between small granule remnants, and 3) settling of large granule remnants beneath the path of the spectrophotometer beam. [...] The intensity (at 5. 2 A) of the 'B' type X-ray pattern of gelatinized pastes of native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starches increased during storage (native > defatted > heat-moisture treated). The same 'B' pattern was also evident (at the end of the storage period) after alkali treatment and hydroxypropylation of the above starches. However, the peak at 5. 2 A was reduced in intensity after alkaline treatment and hydroxypropylation. The extent of the decrease being greater in the latter. [...] Fresh pastes of gelatinized native, defatted and heat-moisture treated potato starches were hydrolyzed by porcine pancreatic α-amylase nearly to the same extent (75. 3 - 77. 2 %). Storage (at 4 °C for 24 h) of the above gelatinized pastes decreased (native > defatted > heat-moisture treated) their susceptibility towards α-amylase. However, storage times longer than 24 h did not seem to have any further influence on the enzyme susceptibility of the starch gels. Alkaline treatment increased the susceptibility of freshly gelatinized starch pastes (native > defatted > heat-moisture treated) towards hydrolysis by α-amylase. However, storage (24 h at 4 °C) of alkali treated starch gels, decreased their susceptibility towards hydrolysis by α-amylase. Hydroxypropylation decreased the accessibility of α-amylase towards the glycosidic linkages of freshly gelatinized pastes of native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starches (defatted > native > heat-moisture treated). However, the extent of this decrease was not altered during storage (at 4 °C for 24 h). [...] The retrogradation endotherm (monitored by DSC) of starch gels (native, defatted and heat-moisture treated) occurred after 2 days of storage (4 °C for 1 day and then at 40 °C for 1 day). A similar trend was also observed after alkaline treatment. However, hydroxypropylated native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starch gels [at nearly the same MS level (0. 10 - 0. 11) ], showed a measurable retrogradation endotherm only after 7 days (4 °C for 1 day and then at 40 °C for 6 days). This showed that <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> are effective in hindering starch chain realignment during gel storage. Both alkaline treatment and hydroxypropylation decreased the retrogradation enthalpies of native, defatted and heat-moisture treated starch gels...|$|R
40|$|Naringenin is a {{flavanone}} naturally {{present in}} grapefruit and tomato skin, {{which has been}} demonstrated to have health benefits. However, because of the low water solubility and bioavailability, naringenin applications are limited. Starch inclusion complexes {{have been shown to}} improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water soluble bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to prepare and characterize complexes of naringenin with starches, including potato starch and high amylose corn starch (Hylon VII), which were chemically (acetylation or hydroxypropylation) and enzymatically modified (debranched or debrahced/β-amylase treated). Soluble and insoluble complexes were recovered, and their physicochemical properties were characterized. The treatments did not affect overall recovery, but the introduction of acetyl and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> significantly increased the recovery of soluble complexes. Overall, acetylated starches exhibited greater complexation yields than hydroxypropylated counterparts; Hylon VII complexes comprised greater naringenin contents than potato starch complexes. The naringenin content generally was greater in insoluble complexes than in soluble complexes and increased when β-amylase treatment was incorporated. The X-ray diffraction patterns of both complexes revealed a mixture of amorphous and crystalline structure. FT-IR results confirmed the occurrence of molecular interaction between starch and naringenin in both complexes. Melting properties were significantly influenced by the type and degree of substitution. The present results demonstrate that the complexation of starch with naringenin can be improved by a combination of chemical and enzymatic modifications...|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) {{have become}} {{valuable}} new materials {{for a broad}} spectrum of applications including additives or components for new hydrophobic/hydrophilic polymer coatings. However, fundamental information surrounding IL molecular properties is still lacking. With this in mind, the microinterface between two immiscible electrolytic solutions (micro-ITIES), for example, water| 1, 2 -dichloroethane, has been used to evaluate the hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of 10 alkylphosphonium ILs. By varying the architecture around the phosphonium core, chemical differences were induced, changing the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of the cations. Ion transfer (IT) within the polarizable potential window (PPW) was measured to establish a structure–property relationship. The Gibbs free energy of IT and the solubility of their ILs were also calculated. For phosphonium cations bearing either three butyl or three <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> with a tunable fourth arm, the latter displayed a wide variety of easily characterizable IT potentials. The tributylphosphonium ILs, however, were too hydrophobic to undergo IT within the PPW. Utilizing a micro-ITIES (25 μm diameter) housed at the tip of a capillary in a uniquely designed pipet holder, we were able to probe beyond the traditional potential window and observe ion transfer of these hydrophobic phosphonium ILs for the first time. A similar trend in lipophilicity was determined between the two subsets of ILs by means of derived solubility product constants. The above results serve as evidence of the validation of this technique for the evaluation of hydrophobic cations that appear beyond the conventional PPW and of the lipophilicity of their ILs...|$|R

The level and position of phosphorus and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> within cross-linked and hydroxypropylated sweet potato starch was investigated by phosphorus and proton {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy (31 P, 1 H NMR). The cross-linking reaction produced monostarch monophosphate and distarch monophosphate in a molar ratio of 1 : 1. 03, indicating that {{only half of the}} introduced phosphorus resulted in a possible cross-link. One cross-link per approximately 2900 glucose residues was found. Phosphorylation leading to monostarch monophosphate mainly occurred at O- 3 and O- 6 (ratio 1 : 1). It was inferred {{that the majority of the}} cross-links formed in distarch monophosphate were between two glucose residues positioned in different starch chains, while a minor part of the cross-links may be formed between two glucose residues within the same starch chain. Hydroxypropylation under alkaline conditions resulted in the formation of intra-molecular phosphorus cross-links, subsequent hydroxypropylation following cross-linking lowered both the level of intra- and inter-molecular cross-linking. Using 1 H NMR the molar substitution of hydroxypropylation was determined to be 0. 155 – 0. 165. The hydroxypropylation predominantly occurred at O- 2 (61 %), and the level of substitution at O- 6 (21 %) was slightly higher than that at O- 3 (17 %).

40|$|Background: Phacoemulsification and {{intraocular lens}} (IOL) {{implantation}} {{has resulted in}} early visual rehabilitation, increased wound stability and improved refractive results. Viscoelastic substances (VES) are important adjuncts {{in this type of}} surgery. Use of VES in phacoemulsification can be associated with adverse effects, the most common and potentially dangerous of which is the transient rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) in post-operative period. To evaluate the effects of viscoelastic substances on post-operative IOP after phacoemuls ification with implantation of intraocular lens, a cross-sectional comparative, prospective study was conducted in the department of Ophthalmology, Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from October 2003 to March 2004. Methods: One hundred patients were randomized into two groups of 50 each. Phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens was performed in all the patients. 2 % Hydroxypropyl Methylcellulose (HPMC) was used in one group and 1 % Sodium Hyaluronate (NaHa) was used in the other group. IOP was measured pre-operatively as well as 24 hours and 7 days post-operatively. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the pre-operative intraocular pressure between the two groups (p= 0. 483). Twenty four hours after surgery, the mean IOP increased by 2. 84 ±SD 2. 12 mm Hg in 2 % <b>Hydroxypropyl</b> Methylcellulose <b>group</b> and 4. 54 ± 2. 07 mm Hg in 1 % Sodium Hyaluronate group.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of drugs into phosphorylcholine (PC) polymers coated onto coronary stent surfaces is one potential {{method of treatment}} for reducing restenosis, the reclosure of the artery after angioplasty treatment. This work on the characterisation of the swelling performance of thin PC polymer films represents a further extension of the study on biocompatible polymers. The broad aim of this work is to relate the PC polymer structure and film processing conditions to their swelling, drug loading and release kinetics. As the two highly sensitive and powerful techniques in film structure determination, both ellipsometry and neutron reflection {{have proved to be}} useful in characterising PC polymer films and drug release processes. Following an established ellipsometry measurement method, a two stage process consisting of diffusion and relaxation has been observed during the PC film swelling: this suggests an anomalous mechanism, and this performance is well described by the coupled diffusion and relaxation model developed by Berens and Hopfenberg. Furthermore, the swelling of PC polymer films was investigated as a function of cross-linking, annealing temperature, chemical composition, hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios, film thickness and environmental conditions by ellipsometry measurements, and their effects on swelling kinetics well quantified. The structures of the PC polymer films (PC 100 B) with cross-linking groups have been further characterised by neutron reflection. The segregation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains was found in the PC films with different dimensions. The PC 100 B with deuterated dodecyl chains was used to highlight the interfacial structures of the PC films. The hydrophilic segments, including phosphorylcholine <b>groups</b> and <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups,</b> are preferentially adsorbed at the polymer/substrate interface. The hydrophobic dodecyl chains are expelled away from the silicon oxide surface. The main part of PC 100 B films is the middle uniform region with 40 % of water in the sample annealed at 150 °C, and 55 % of water in the sample annealed at 50 °C. The combination of the ellipsometry results and the drug release profiles from UV measurements indicates that the drug release pattern is strongly affected by the film swelling kinetics when the drug molecules and polymer matrix interact weakly. Otherwise, a strong interaction between the drug and the polymer will dominate the drug release behaviour from the PC polymer films...|$|R

The host molecule being studied, (2 -hydroxypropyl) -β-cyclodextrin (2 HPBCD),is a modified version of BCD with <b>hydroxypropyl</b> (HP) <b>groups</b> substituted along the rims. Because this modification replaces some of the OH groups present in BCD, it removes their ability to hydrogen bond, while introducing new OH groups that are more flexible.

40|$|This work {{summarizes}} {{several studies}} that all concern cellulose ethers {{of the types}} methylcellulose (MC) hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and ethyl(hydroxyethyl) cellulose (EHEC). They share the feature of negative temperature response, as they are soluble in water at room temperature but phase separate and sometimes form gels at high temperatures. The different types of viscosity transitions occurring in these three cellulose ethers are well-known. However, earlier studies have not solved the problem of why both HPMC and EHEC, as the temperature increases, exhibit a viscosity decrease just before the viscosity increases, whereas MC only has one transition temperature where the viscosity increases. With our investigations we have aimed to compare the effect of temperature on bulk solutions and on adsorbed layers of the different polymers using a range of techniques. Light scattering and cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) was employed to study aggregation of MC, HPMC and EHEC in solution. The solvent quality of water is reduced for all three polymers in solution as the temperature increases, and this infers an onset of aggregation at a certain temperature. The aggregation rate follows the order EHEC > HPMC > MC. Cryo-TEM pictures of solutions frozen from high temperatures showed closely packed fibrils forming dense networks in MC solution. Some fibrils were also found in HPMC solution above the transition temperature, {{but they did not}} interconnect readily. This is explained by the bulky and hydrophilic <b>hydroxypropyl</b> <b>groups</b> attached to HPMC. EHEC has similar substituents, while MC only has short and hydrophobic methyl groups attached to the main chain. An amphiphilic liquid, diethyleneglycolmonobutylether (BDG) was used as an additive to change the properties of MC solutions in water. With 10 wt% BDG added, the effect was similar in viscosity and light scattering measurements as well as cryo-TEM pictures, inducing a temperature response resembling that of HPMC in pure water. 5 wt% of BDG was enough to change the aggregation type and induce a transition temperature with viscosity decrease. The effect of the additive is rationalized by BDG acting as a hydrophobic and bulky substituent in MC, similar to the large substituents in HPMC and EHEC. Two instruments, a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and an ellipsometer, were used in parallel to determine the changes with temperature on an adsorbed layer of MC and HPMC on silica kept in water and in polymer solution. The silica needed to be hydrophobized for significant adsorption to take place. Adsorption was similar for both polymers at low temperatures, whereas a sharp transition in several layer properties occurred for HPMC, but not for MC, close to the solution viscosity transition temperature. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure attractive and repulsive forces and also friction forces between MC layers in polymer solution. The small changes in normal forces with temperature infer that the hydrophobic groups in MC are mostly depleted from the surface. The surface–polymer interactions increase with increasing temperature and the layer becomes more cohesive, which induces a higher load bearing capacity and lower friction when measured at high loads. AFM imaging was employed to obtain the height distribution in MC adsorbed layers. These images indicate that fibril-like structures were formed at a lower temperature in the surface layer than in bulk solution. The different preferences for adsorption and for aggregation in MC and HPMC above the solution transition temperatures are explained by the fibril formation in MC shielding hydrophobic parts of the polymer from the solution, and thus counteracting adsorption, but also fast aggregation. The viscosity decrease in HPMC and EHEC is conferred to intra-chain contraction and aggregation into less extended structures. QC 20120523 </p...|$|R
30|$|Recent {{researches}} {{showed the}} possibility that small molecules such as phospholipid and gemini surfactant could be electrospun into nanofiber when the molecules have entangled micelle networking (Cashion et al. 2009; McKee et al. 2006). The strong hydrogen boding induced by many –OH groups in β-CD make the molecules possible to form networking structure similarly to phospholipid and gemini surfactant. However, comparing to α- and γ-CDs, β-CD has very poor solubility in conventional solvents due to the local water held in the cavity and around the molecules (Naidoo et al. 2004). The local water makes β-CD rigid macro-cyclic compound, which is not easily accommodated into conventional solvent system (Naidoo et al. 2004). This poor solubility of β-CD did not allow the direct dissolution for electrospinning. To improve the solubility, the external hydrophilic groups are chemically modified into hydrophobic <b>groups</b> such as <b>hydroxypropyl</b> and methyl <b>groups</b> (Celebioglu and Uyar 2010, 2011, 2012; Manasco et al. 2012). The modified CD showed better solubility and successfully electrospun into nanofiber. Recently our research group reported direct dissolution of unmodified β-CD using ionic liquid and successful electrospinning of the prepared solution (Ahn et al. 2013). However, the electrospun β-CD was mechanically weak and brittle for further applications.|$|R
