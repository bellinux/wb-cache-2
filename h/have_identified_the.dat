5|$|A {{series of}} almost-collisions in 2005 in similar {{circumstances}} {{in the tunnel}} between Foggy Bottom and Rosslyn stations led to a new test procedure which would <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> faulty circuit after installation. However, by 2009, Metro engineers were unaware of this incident or the tests developed to detect the failure condition.|$|E
5|$|Diptera were {{traditionally}} {{broken down}} into two suborders, Nematocera and Brachycera, distinguished by the differences in antennae. The Nematocera are recognized by their elongated bodies and many-segmented, often feathery antennae as represented by mosquitoes and crane flies. The Brachycera have rounder bodies and much shorter antennae. Subsequent studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> Nematocera as being non-monophyletic with modern phylogenies placing the Brachycera within grades of groups formerly placed in the Nematocera. The construction of a phylogenetic tree {{has been the subject}} of ongoing research. The following cladogram is based on the FLYTREE project.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating {{it among}} {{a movement of}} pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in rhetoric that valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|Vladislav : The Times {{stated that}} the police <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> man they believe may have {{poisoned}} Litvinenko with a fatal polonium dose in {{a cup of tea}} on the fourth-floor room at the Millennium Hotel to discuss a business deal with Dmitry Kovtun and Andrey Lugovoy before going to the bar. These three men were joined in the room later by the mystery figure who was introduced as Vladislav, a man who could help Litvinenko win a lucrative contract with a Moscow-based private security firm.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the mythical Sarasvati of the Vedas with physical rivers. Many think that the Vedic Sarasvati river once flowed east of the Indus (Sindhu) river. Scientists, geologists as well as scholars <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> Sarasvati with many present-day or now defunct rivers.|$|E
25|$|Some studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> {{degree of}} IQ {{variance}} as {{a difference between}} males and females.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory is}} that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in Drosophila germarium <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> signals decapentaplegic and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.|$|E

25|$|Two {{theories}} are {{popular in the}} attempts to identify the Sarasvati. Several scholars <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> river with the present-day Ghaggar-Hakra River or dried up part of it, which is located in Northwestern India and Pakistan. A second popular theory associates the river with the Helmand river or an ancient river in the present Helmand Valley in Afghanistan. Others consider Sarasvati a mythical river.|$|E
25|$|In {{ancient times}} {{the region of}} Krujë was {{inhabited}} by the Illyrian tribe of the Albani, while the town is located near the Iron Age Illyrian site of Zgërdhesh. Some scholars <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> site with the main settlement of the Albani, Albanopolis, while others identified Albanopolis with Krujë itself. During the Illyrian Wars the area of Krujë was captured by the Roman Republic.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression did not {{strongly}} affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was {{the first}} to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> fiscal stimulus as especially effective.|$|E

25|$|Peak {{claimed that}} {{he lowered his voice}} to {{disguise}} it. Alternately, in his February 4, 1971 deposition, he claimed to have shouted and raised his voice to sound like he was excited.

In the weeks after the bombing, Peak's brother was said to <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> voice as Peak's.|$|E
25|$|Transgenes {{may soon}} be used for {{xenotransplantation}} from pig organs. Through the study of xeno-organ rejection, {{it was found that}} an acute rejection of the transplanted organ occurs upon the organ's contact with blood from the recipient due to the recognition of foreign antibodies on endothelial cells of the transplanted organ. Scientists <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> antigen in pigs that causes this reaction, and therefore are able to transplant the organ without immediate rejection by removal of the antigen. However, the antigen begins to be expressed later on, and rejection occurs. Therefore, further research is being conducted.|$|E
25|$|The liberal {{philosophical}} {{tradition has}} searched for validation and justification through several intellectual projects. The {{moral and political}} suppositions of liberalism {{have been based on}} traditions such as natural rights and utilitarian theory, although sometimes liberals even requested support from scientific and religious circles. Through all these strands and traditions, scholars <b>have</b> <b>identified</b> <b>the</b> following major common facets of liberal thought: believing in equality and individual liberty, supporting private property and individual rights, supporting the idea of limited constitutional government, and recognising the importance of related values such as pluralism, toleration, autonomy, bodily integrity and consent.|$|E
