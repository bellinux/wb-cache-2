500|$|The Ballymun {{area was}} still so {{associated}} with [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] {{and the drug}} problem of the time, that local backers of the regeneration went to pains {{to point out the}} recent progress. [...] A Bono remark that it was dangerous to walk in Ballymun at night found a good deal of publicity. [...] A fansite listing U2-related Dublin area sights in 2004 mentioned Ballymun's connection to the song, cautioning, [...] "do not <b>go</b> <b>here</b> on foot – this is a bad area". U2's official website noted that the area was much changed now; Bono himself said [...] "he's very proud to come from the Ballymun area"; the fansite subsequently modified its listing and said an on-foot visit to Ballymun was warranted.|$|E
500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could <b>go</b> <b>here</b> or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E
500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was {{familiar}} with from {{his work at the}} Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to <b>go.</b> <b>Here</b> he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero that you should not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, before stabbing and strangling Pesce to death and killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] hand against one of her breasts and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E

2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan for the song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. In an interview for MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go in. Go for the kill. I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try to go into... It was just like me telling her, you sure you wanna <b>go</b> <b>here</b> with me? I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|E
