40|$|Functionality {{of natural}} fibre-reinforced {{composites}} continually attracts attention {{and offers a}} unique possibility. We fabricated several types of unidirectional and random bamboo <b>fibre</b> green composites, and examined their damping properties {{as a function of}} bamboo <b>fibre</b> content, <b>fibre</b> length, and <b>fibre</b> morphology. The loss factors of the bamboo <b>fibre</b> green composites decreased with increasing bamboo <b>fibre</b> content. However, the loss factors gradually decreased in the composites reinforced with <b>fibre</b> content higher than 40 mass%. The loss factors of random short <b>fibre</b> (10 mm) reinforced green composites were higher than those of unidirectional ones. It can be seen that the damping factor of bamboo <b>fibre</b> green composites depended on <b>fibre</b> length and <b>fibre</b> content, and that vibration damping properties of the bamboo green composites were better than those of glass <b>fibre</b> reinforced plastics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> {{flexibility}} is often anticipated {{to play a}} role in <b>fibre</b> flocculation phenomena. In this study, 3 thermomechanical pulps (TMPs) were sampled along a post-refining line. The only <b>fibre</b> morphological property that varied was <b>fibre</b> flexibility. These TMP samples were then tested for <b>fibre</b> flocculation and sheet formation tendency. The measurements clearly showed that <b>fibre</b> flocculation decreased and sheet formation uniformity increased with increasing <b>fibre</b> flexibility. The beneficial effect of <b>fibre</b> flexibility was larger at high consistency. These results support the elastic energy storage theory within flocs, which states that the more rigid the <b>fibre,</b> the stronger the flocs. Papermakers may take advantage of the beneficial effect of <b>fibre</b> flexibility on sheet formation through a careful tuning of post-refining...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Different {{compositions}} {{of carbon}} <b>fibre</b> (Cf) - basalt <b>fibre</b> (Bf) / Epoxy Resin (EP) Composites were fabricated. The mechanical properties were investigated and the microstructure was observed by SEM. The results showed that, the mechanical properties would be improved when suitable content (10 - 20 vol. % of total <b>fibre)</b> of basalt <b>fibre</b> added into carbon <b>fibre</b> / epoxy composites. It was because that elasticity modulus of basalt <b>fibre</b> {{was larger than}} carbon <b>fibre,</b> and for existing of more hydroxyl groups and other active groups, the bonding between basalt <b>fibre</b> and epoxy resin was also better than the bonding between carbon <b>fibre</b> and epoxy resin...|$|R
40|$|Abaca <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced}} PP composites were fabricated {{with different}} <b>fibre</b> loadings (20, 30, 40, 50 wt% {{and in some}} cases 35 and 45 wt%). Flax and jute <b>fibre</b> reinforced PP composites were also fabricated with 30 wt% <b>fibre</b> loading. The mechanical properties, odour emission and structure properties were investigated for those composites. Tensile, flexural and Charpy impact strengths were found to increase for <b>fibre</b> loadings up to 40 wt% and then decreased. Falling weight impact tests were also carried out and the same tendency was observed. Owing to the addition of coupling agent (maleated polypropylene -MAH-PP), the tensile, flexural and falling weight impact properties were found to increase in between 30 to 80 % for different <b>fibre</b> loadings. When comparing jute and flax <b>fibre</b> composites with abaca <b>fibre</b> composites, jute <b>fibre</b> composites provided best tensile properties but abaca <b>fibre</b> polypropylene composites were shown to provide best notch Charpy and falling weight impact properties. Odours released by flax <b>fibre</b> composites were smaller than jute and abaca <b>fibre</b> composites...|$|R

This work investigates the impact of ultrasonic scouring on <b>fibre</b> entanglement caused during the scouring process. Levels of <b>fibre</b> entanglement were quantified by measuring <b>fibre</b> length using OFDA 4000 after carding. A significant reduction in <b>fibre</b> entanglement after ultrasonic scouring was observed and this was due to a reduced <b>fibre</b> migration in the wash bath when compared with the mechanical agitation seen in conventional scouring process. <b>Fibre</b> cuticle scale damage resulting from the ultrasonic irradiation may also have contributed to the reduction in <b>fibre</b> entanglement. A reduced level of <b>fibre</b> entanglement from ultrasonic wool scouring leads to a reduction in <b>fibre</b> breakage during carding...|$|R

A wing consists of an upper and lower membrane which are connected by minute <b>fibres</b> and strengthened by a system of thickened hollow ribs, popularly but incorrectly referred to as 'veins', as they may also contain tracheae, nerve <b>fibres</b> and blood vessels. The membranes are covered with minute scales which have jagged ends or hairs and are attached by hooks. The wings are moved by the rapid muscular contraction and expansion of the thorax.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic <b>fibres</b> such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic <b>fibres</b> and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

40|$|Effect of bond on {{compressive}} behaviour of flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer tube–confined coir <b>fibre</b> {{reinforced concrete}} Libo Yan 1, Anne Duchez 1, 2 and Nawawi Chouw 1 This {{study investigated the}} effect of flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer and concrete bond on the compressive behaviour of flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer–confined plain concrete and coir <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete. Three types of bond were considered, i. e. concrete confined by (1) flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer tube, (2) flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer tube with internal flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer rings and (3) flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer wrapping. They were termed as naturally, mechanically and adhesively bonded, respectively. A total of 18 flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer–confined plain concrete and coir <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete cylinders were tested under axial compression. The test results indicated that all the three flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer confinements increased the ultimate compressive strength and ductility of the concrete significantly compared to the unconfined concrete. It {{was found that the}} type of flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer and concrete bond has a significant effect on the ultimate strength and axial strain of the confined cylinders. The composite cylinder with naturally bonded offered the largest ultimate strength and axial strain. In all cases of flax <b>fibre</b> reinforced polymer–confined coir <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete, the coir <b>fibre</b> inclusion reduced the numbers and widths of the cracks in the concrete. Additionally, existing confinement stress and strain models were used to predict the experimental results of the confined plain concrete and coir <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete cylinders...|$|R
40|$|In this review, {{the methods}} used to measure <b>fibre</b> and soluble <b>fibre</b> {{fractions}} are briefly presented {{and the effects of}} the soluble <b>fibre</b> content in diets for growing rabbits reviewed by a meta-analysis of studies available in literature, with the aim of elucidating the relationships with other dietary nutrients. Soluble <b>fibre</b> was assumed as the difference between total dietary <b>fibre</b> (TDF) and neutral detergent <b>fibre</b> (NDF), as it is simple to obtain and has been measured in numerous studies. Dietary soluble <b>fibre</b> content affects the digestive utilisation of soluble and insoluble <b>fibre</b> fractions and its increase is associated with reduced mortality in growing rabbits affected by epizootic rabbit enteropathy. This effect could be attributed to the high fermentability of soluble <b>fibre,</b> the consequent changes in the intestinal microbiota and an enhanced gut barrier function just after weaning. A supply of 12 - 14 % of soluble <b>fibre</b> (as-fed) is recommended in diets for post-weaning and growing rabbits containing around 30 % NDF and 18 % acid detergent <b>fibre.</b> The positive effects of increasing dietary soluble <b>fibre</b> are linked to the use of sugar beet pulp as primary source of soluble <b>fibre</b> and should be confirmed with other sources of soluble <b>fibre.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular <b>fibres</b> to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The <b>fibres</b> support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a secondary glaucoma can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen <b>fibres</b> rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the <b>fibres</b> formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It calls into question the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fibres</b> of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These <b>fibres</b> join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E

Data on yield, yield components and <b>fibre</b> properties were collected. Genotypic and phenotypic correlations between yield components and <b>fibre</b> characteristics were then determined. Seed cotton yield showed significant positive correlations with <b>fibre</b> fineness and <b>fibre</b> maturity ratio, while it had non-significant negative correlations with <b>fibre</b> length and strength. Positive correlations were also obtained {{for each of}} <b>fibre</b> fineness and maturity ratio with lint yield, lint index and ginning out-turn. On the other hand, <b>fibre</b> length and <b>fibre</b> strength exhibited negative correlations with lint yield and lint index. <b>Fibre</b> length and strength were positively associated {{with each other and}} negatively correlated with <b>fibre</b> fineness and maturity ratio.
