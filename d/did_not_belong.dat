5|$|At {{the request}} of Natalee's father, Alabama judge Alan King {{declared}} Holloway legally dead in absentia on January 12, 2012. On August 16, 2017, Holloway's father announced that he and a private investigator had recently discovered human remains {{and that they were}} being DNA-tested to determine whether they belonged to his daughter.

5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the revision by Lucas and Sobus, a 2003 paper by Chinese researchers suggested that Indricotherium and Dzungariotherium were valid genera, and that P. prohorovi <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> in Paraceratherium. They also recognised the validity of species such as P. lipidus, P. tienshanensis, and P. sui. A 2004 paper by Chinese paleontologist Tao Deng and colleagues also recognised three distinct genera. Some western writers have similarly used names otherwise considered invalid since the 1989 revision, but without providing detailed analysis and justification.|$|E
5|$|The FBI {{announced}} that Aruban authorities had provided its agency with documents, suspect interviews, and other evidence.

40|$|For {{a set of}} {{positive}} and relatively prime integers A, let Γ(A) denote the set of integers obtained by taking all nonnegative integer linear combinations of integers in A. Then there are finitely many positive integers that <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to Γ(A).

5|$|The commentaries of Ramayana {{suggest that}} it would be right for Sugriva to marry the widowed Tara. Amritakataka of Kataka Madhava Yogindra says that this was right as they were animals. The Tilaka by Nahesh Bhatt(Ramavarma) justifies Sugriva's {{marriage}} to Tara since Sugriva was her dead husband's brother. It further states that Tara should remarry as she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to the first three castes and was young. Tara's action of taking Sugriva as her husband after Vali's death is seen as her attempt to secure the futures of Angada and the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Exile was {{received}} well by critics; The Daily Telegraph {{called it the}} best game in the Myst series.

Following the award, several government officials jumped to congratulate him for winning such a 'prestigious' award. The International Monetary Fund said the newspaper <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to it and was an independent publication. It was noted that five Pakistani state-owned firms funded the Emerging Markets edition, which carried a supplement on Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|R

5|$|On 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Drašković {{were held}} in the city against Slobodan Milošević. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were {{deployed}} onto the streets to restore order. Further protests {{were held in}} Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud at local elections.

5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections.

In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Skopje, as the Republic of Macedonia as a whole, is characterised {{by a large}} ethnic diversity.

Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century, when large number of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2002 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 338,358 inhabitants, or 66.75% of the population. Then came Albanians with 103,891 inhabitants (20.49%), Roma people with 23,475 (4.63%), Serbs (14,298 inhabitants), Turks (8,595), Bosniaks (7,585) and Vlachs (2,557). 8,167 people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to any of these groups.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that one piece of bone was human but it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|When Deinocheirus {{was only}} {{known from the}} {{original}} forelimbs, its taxonomic relationship was difficult to determine, and several hypotheses were proposed. Osmólska and Roniewicz initially concluded that Deinocheirus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> in any already named theropod family, so they created a new, monotypic family Deinocheiridae, placed in the infraorder Carnosauria. This {{was due to the}} large size and thick-walled limb bones, but they also found some similarities with Ornithomimus, and, to a lesser extent, Allosaurus. In 1971, John Ostrom first proposed that Deinocheirus belonged with the Ornithomimosauria, while noting that it contained both ornithomimosaurian and non-ornithomimosaurian characters. In 1976, Rhinchen Barsbold named the order Deinocheirosauria, which was to include the supposedly related genera Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus. A relationship between Deinocheirus and the long-armed therizinosaurs was supported by some later writers, but they are not considered to be closely related today.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Sihanouk built a {{personal}} residence at Chamkarmon District {{where he lived}} {{over the next ten}} years as the Head of State. Following his overthrow in 1970, Sihanouk took up residence in Beijing, where he lived at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in the first year of his stay. In 1971 Sihanouk moved to a larger residence in the city that once housed the French embassy. The residence was equipped with a temperature-adjustable swimming pool, cinema and seven chefs to cook his meals. In 1974 North Korean leader Kim Il-sung built Changsuwon, a 40-room mansion, for Sihanouk. Changsuwon was built near an artificial lake, and Sihanouk spent time taking boat trips there and also shot a few films within the compound. In August 2008 Sihanouk declared his assets on his website, which according to him consisted of a small house in Siem Reap and 30,000 Euros of cash savings stored in a French bank. He also stated that his residences in Beijing and Pyongyang were guesthouses owned by the governments of China and North Korea, respectively, and that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> to him.|$|E
