50|$|To {{remove and}} manage the {{infestation}} of larvae in the host, the larvae may be removed with forceps. This removal process should take place daily or as often as needed until the infestation is clear. These larvae can also be killed by applying proper insecticides to the infected areas and making sure the wounds are properly dressed. Organophosphorus insecticides like coumaphos, dichlofenthion, and fenchlorphos {{can be applied to}} wounds with fly larvae. These cause the larvae to leave the wound and fall to the ground, and the larvae will die without a host to feed on. Castration wounds in cattle that have insect growth regulators, such as <b>dicyclanil,</b> have high success rates of preventing the establishment of C. bezziana.|$|E
40|$|Objective To test {{strategies}} {{for the application of}} <b>dicyclanil</b> and mid-season crutching to maximise protection of unmulesed sheep against breech strike. Procedure Three hundred and eighty unmulesed Merino weaners were randomly allocated to four groups either left untreated or treated by different strategies with 50 g/L <b>dicyclanil.</b> Treatments included breech treatment alone and breech plus body treatment, with two application times, immediately after shearing and 6 weeks after crutching or shearing. To assess protection, larval implants with newly hatched Lucilia cuprina larvae were applied to 10 different sheep from each group at 3, 4, 5 and 6 months after crutching and shearing and assessed for the development of strike at 48 hours. The concentration of <b>dicyclanil</b> was measured in wool samples clipped from the breeches of the test sheep. Results All <b>dicyclanil</b> treatments gave significant reduction in strike in comparison to controls up until 4 months after crutching but protection in the sheep treated immediately after shearing had waned at 5 months. Treating at 6 weeks after crutching provided significant reduction (P < 0. 05) in strike for 6 months. Results for strike incidence immediately after shearing and concentration of <b>dicyclanil</b> in the breech wool also suggested improvements in protection by delaying treatment for 6 weeks. Conclusion In most environments {{it should be possible to}} protect unmulesed sheep against breech strike with a carefully planned integrated control program incorporating strategically timed crutching, shearing and <b>dicyclanil</b> application. Delaying treatment with <b>dicyclanil</b> to at least 6 weeks after shearing or crutching increased the protection provided in comparison to treatment immediately after shearing...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe solar photolytic {{behavior}} of the pesticide 4, 6 -diamino- 2 -cyclopropyl-pyrimidine- 5 -carbonitrile, currently known as <b>dicyclanil,</b> has been mimicked in a, photoreactor operating with. an artificial light,flux. The rate and pathway of degradation were performed An additional study, using TiO 2 photocatalysis, has been achieved {{in order to determine}} the efficiency of photocatalysis to degrade the molecule. The Catalyst was titania Degussa P- 25. The aim of this article was the identification of the intermediate products formed during the irradiation, to establish the degradation pathway of <b>dicyclanil.</b> The kinetics of the,reactions were followed by liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (LC-DAD). Most of the organic compounds occurring during,the, photodegradation, have been identified by means of liquid chromatography and mass,spectrometry coupled techniques (HPLC-MS). Additional analyses were carried out to evaluate the mineralization rates into nitrate and ammonium ions...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of Australian-registered insecticide formulations against Old World screwworm (OWS) myiases for potential use in screwworm containment and eradication programs. Methods: The longevity of protection provided by six insecticidal formulations (subcutaneous ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin, a topically applied aqueous formulation of spinosad, ivermectin controlled-release capsule and a <b>dicyclanil</b> spray-on formulation) {{was tested using}} implants of 1 st-instar OWS larvae on Javanese thin-tail sheep. Therapeutic efficacy of four formulations (topical ivermectin, chlorfenvinphos/cypermethrin mixture, aerosol spinosad formulation and a formulation containing propetamphos and eucalyptus oil) was tested against 2 - and 4 -day-old OWS strikes. Results: Both the ivermectin capsule and <b>dicyclanil</b> spray-on formulation gave 100 % protection against screwworm implants for the full 12 weeks of the study. Ivermectin, doramectin and abamectin administered SC all gave 100 % protection at 3 days post-treatment, but at 2 weeks the protection had become incomplete. Spinosad dipping did not give complete protection at any time. All four therapeutic treatments gave complete resolution of 2 -day-old strikes and topical ivermectin, spinosad and chlorfenvinphos/cypermethrin, but not the propetamphos/eucalyptus oil formulation, gave complete resolution of all 4 -day-old strikes. Conclusion: <b>Dicyclanil</b> spray-on and ivermectin capsule formulations, both registered for use in sheep, but not for cattle or other livestock species, gave much longer protection against screwworm implants than the currently recommended SC ivermectin. Pre-emptive action to facilitate rapid deployment of these formulations {{in the event of}} a screwworm incursion is urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a ready-to-use 5 %dicyclanil pour-on formulation as a preventative of natural flystrike on Merino lambs {{was investigated in}} a field trial involving 5 sites in the southern Cape Province. A total of 1804 lambs treated with <b>dicyclanil</b> were compared with 882 untreated control lambs for up to 25 weeks after treatment. Efficacy was assessed by calculating the weekly cumulative strike rate at each site and aggregated for all sites, {{as well as by}} calculating the percentage reduction achieved in treated lambs. Cumulative strike rates for the untreated controls aggregated for all sites at Weeks 9, 14 and 19 after treatment reached 6. 2, 12. 8 and 17. 8 %, respectively, compared with 0. 4, 1. 7 and 3. 6 %for the <b>dicyclanil</b> treated lambs. Percentage control aggregated for all sites at Weeks 9, 14 and 19 after treatment was 93, 87 and 80 %, respectively. Heavy rains during the 1 st half of the trial did not substantially reduce the {{efficacy of}} the product...|$|E

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies showed {{the possibility that}} oxidative stress, including oxidative DNA damage, {{is involved in the}} mechanism of <b>dicyclanil</b> (DC) -induced hepatocarcinogenesis at the preneoplastic stage in mice. In this study, the expression analyses of genes, including oxidative stress-related genes, were performed on the tissues of hepatocellular tumors in a two-stage liver carcinogenesis model in mice. After partial hepatectomy, male ICR mice were injected with N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and given a diet containing 0 or 1500 ppm of DC for 20 weeks. Histopathological examinations revealed that the incidence of hepatocellular tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) significantly increased in the DEN + DC group. Gene expression analysis on the microdissected liver tissues of the mice in the DEN + DC group showed the highest expression levels of oxidative stress-related genes, such as Cyp 1 a 1 and Txnrd 1, in the tumor areas. However, no remarkable up-regulation of Ogg 1 —an oxidative DNA damage repair gene— was observed in the tumor areas, but the expression of Trail—an apoptosis-signaling ligand gene—was significantly down-regulated in the tumor tissues. These results suggest the possibility that the inhibition of apoptosis and a failure in the ability to repair oxidative DNA damage occur in the hepatocellular DC-induced tumors in mice...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 CYP 6 G 1 {{has been}} implicated in the {{resistance}} of Drosophila melanogaster to numerous pesticides. While in vivo and in vitro studies have provided insight to the diverse functions of this enzyme, direct studies on the isolated CYP 6 G 1 enzyme have not been possible due {{to the need for}} a source of recombinant enzyme. In the current study, the Cyp 6 g 1 gene was isolated from D. melanogaster and re-engineered for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Approximately 460 nmol L− 1 of P 450 holoenzyme were obtained in 500 mL cultures. The recombinant enzyme was located predominantly within the bacterial cytosol. A two-step purification protocol using Ni-chelate affinity chromatography followed by removal of detergent on a hydroxyapatite column produced essentially homogenous enzyme from both soluble and membrane fractions. Recombinant CYP 6 G 1 exhibited p-nitroanisole O-dealkylation activity but was not active against eleven other typical P 450 marker substrates. Substrate-induced binding spectra and IC 50 values for inhibition of p-nitroanisole O-dealkylation were obtained for a wide selection of pesticides, namely DDT, imidacloprid, chlorfenvinphos, malathion, endosulfan, dieldrin, <b>dicyclanil,</b> lufenuron and carbaryl, supporting previous in vivo and in vitro studies on Drosophila that have suggested that the enzyme is involved in multi-pesticide resistance in insects.
