40|$|For many years, {{attorneys}} and estate planners have been cautious of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> where substantial wealth is involved. A jointly owned estate poses {{a number of}} tax problems and ownership difficulties which often frustrate {{the intentions of the}} creator. The primary advantage of holding property <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is that the cost and publicity of probate are avoided. To secure this benefit, the owner loses many rights to the property and may suffer disastrous tax consequences. Basically, the use of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> prevents the contributing tenant from efficiently planning the disposition of his property. If he should die first, the surviving tenant has uncontrolled power over the property. Thus, the property may be diverted from the contributing tenant 2 ̆ 7 s intended beneficiaries. The second major objection to the creation of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> is the adverse estate tax consequences which may result. If the contributing tenant dies first, the entire value of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> will be included <b>in</b> his <b>estate</b> and probably taxed again <b>in</b> the <b>estate</b> of the surviving joint tenant. Because many potential tax and nontax disadvantages of joint ownership may be alleviated through a proper severance of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> this article discusses the voluntary and involuntary acts which will constitute a severance of real and personal property in Nebraska...|$|R
5000|$|A {{jointure}} is of two kinds, {{legal and}} equitable. A legal jointure was first {{authorized by the}} Statute of Uses. Before this statute a husband had no legal seisin in such lands as were vested in another to his [...] "use", but merely an equitable estate. Consequently, it was usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being the settlement by deed of an estate {{to the use of}} the husband and wife for their lives <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> (or [...] "jointure") so that the whole would go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a joint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the word extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only.|$|R
5000|$|Realty, or {{heritable}} property, on {{the other}} hand, was originally inherited <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> termed gavelkind, and {{passed on to the}} kin group as a whole. However, after the household superseded the kin group in importance in the late Middle Ages, preference was given to the deceased's immediate family, specifically any surviving sons, and none could be favored over his siblings. However, gavelkind inheritance gave rise to inter-family rivalries, so primogeniture laws arose in some areas of feudal Europe giving preference to the eldest son in order to stem feuding. Nevertheless, under medieval communal society, family land could not be sold except for cause, and the family essentially had a right of first refusal (laudatio parentum) in any such sale; in some places, this restriction also applied to gifts.|$|R
50|$|Morning gifts, {{which might}} also be {{arranged}} by the bride's father rather than the bride, are given to the bride herself; the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them {{the morning after the}} wedding night. She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband, but is entitled to it when widowed. If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement, it may be called dower. Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement, she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death, and may lose the property if she remarries. Morning gifts were preserved for centuries in morganatic marriage, a union where the wife's inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble's titles or <b>estates.</b> <b>In</b> this case, the morning gift would support the wife and children. Another legal provision for widowhood was jointure, in which property, often land, would be held <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband's death.|$|R
50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> common and <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies,</b> and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|R

For example, types of joint ownership (title) may include <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common, <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship, or <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> by the entireties.

40|$|It’s been a perplexing {{problem for}} years {{but it seems}} to be {{increasing}} as more of the situations come to light – years ago, grandparents conveyed property owned <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> (or tenancy by the entirety) to an irrevocable inter vivos trust with retained life estates for each of the grandparents and with a remainder interest to the children. As a variation, the grandparents in setting up the trust gave life estates to the children with a remainder interest to grandchildren. The grandparents are now deceased and the questions are two fold – (1) what is included <b>in</b> the gross <b>estates</b> of each of the grandparents and (2) what is the basis {{in the hands of the}} children (or grandchildren) ? 1 The problem is drawing attention, partly because of the rapid escalation of farmland values (many of the trust situations involve farmland or vacation property) and partly because income tax considerations are now viewed as more significant than federal estate tax problems with the $ 5 million applicable credit amount available, at least for 2011 and 2012. ...|$|R
40|$|In Hein v. W. T. Rawleigh Co. {{a husband}} and wife {{acquired}} real property <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with the wife furnishing all the consideration. However, prior to this acquisition there had been a judgment entered against the husband in another action. The husband conveyed his rights to his wife who later died. Held: The wife’s devisee was entitled to have title to the property quieted subject to the judgment creditor’s lien on an undivided half. This decision presents the alternative questions: (1) whether a judgment lien on one joint tenant’s rights continues undisturbed after a severance caused by release of the debtor’s rights or (2) whether after severance the lien attaches to his severed interest and ceases as to the <b>joint</b> tenant’s rights. <b>In</b> conclusion, this case changes no existing rule of law. Liens may attach to a joint tenant’s rights and may become liens against the whole estate or be lost completely depending on who takes by the right of survivorship.

In some jurisdictions, the specific words [...] "with right of survivorship" [...] must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights of survivorship. The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property.|$|R

40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's interest in real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> common. It will only arise where there is a unity of time, title, possession and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common). The <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes. Anderson v Peldan concerned the severance by an insolvent of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> held by the insolvent and his elderly spouse and whether the severance before death is capable of being a “transfer of property” in terms of s 121 of the Bankruptcy Act...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the higher}} courts in Queensland {{have had the}} {{opportunity}} to revisit the effect of severance on a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> The cases allow for the opportunity to examine in more depth the nature of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> itself, and the concept of alienation as a means of severance of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> This article provides an analysis of these decisions to ascertain the contemporary 'state of play' in the law applying to severance of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> A <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is characterised by the four unities - of possession, interest, title and time! – together with the right of survivorship. Given this characterisation, severance of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> represents a fundamental change in the nature of the co-ownership. In particular, the destruction of the right of survivorship through severance will by definition change the potential of each co-owner to hold the whole of the <b>estate</b> <b>in</b> severalty upon the death of the other co-owners. The nature of the common ownership of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> and the potential that it carries, can be adjusted by converting, or severing, the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> to create a tenancy in common.

40|$|A mother, her daughter, and her {{son-in-law}} received {{title to}} a North Carolina home as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Little did the mother {{know that she}} was almost instantly destroying the newborn <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> when, <b>in</b> order to finance the purchase price, she alone executed a mortgage note and deed of trust at the closing. When she died several years later with that mortgage loan in default, a legal dispute arose centered on whether 2 ̆ 2 severance 2 ̆ 2 of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> had occurred. Following traditional <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> law theory, the Court of Appeals decided somewhat reluctantly that the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> was indeed severed at the very closing during which it was successfully created; for by executing the deed of trust, the mother had conveyed 2 ̆ 2 title 2 ̆ 2 according to North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s title theory of mortgage law. Under a common law 2 ̆ 2 four unities 2 ̆ 2 analysis, her execution of the deed of trust unilaterally destroyed the unity of title required for a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> and automatically converted it into a tenancy in common. Contrary to what was most likely intended as part of an informal family estate and eldercare plan, her fifty percent undivided interest in the home remained <b>in</b> her <b>estate</b> at her death and did not pass by survivorship to her daughter and son-in-law. 2 ̆ 7 This article addresses key real property and public policy issues triggered by the 1990 legislative reincarnation of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship in North Carolina with a special emphasis on creation and severance issues. It also focuses on piecemeal statutory amendments and revisions to North Carolina <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> law since 1990. The authors 2 ̆ 7 analysis leads to the following conclusions: First, because <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> creation is now intent-based, not unities-based, <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> termination should likewise be intent-based, not unities-destruction-based. Second, unilateral 2 ̆ 2 stealth 2 ̆ 2 severances of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> are contrary to public policy, unless accompanied by effective prior notice to the other joint tenant or tenants.

50|$|Four main ways of {{acquiring}} land are through a gift, trust, succession and by contract, {{all of which}} involve express or at least presumed consent. In {{the case of an}} ordinary gift during a person's life, the Law of Property Act 1925 section 52(1) requires a deed (itself defined in the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 section 1) before any transfer is effective. Subsequently, a transfer must be registered. The Land Registration Act 2002 section 27(2) makes registration compulsory for all transfers of land, leases over seven years and any charges. Under LRA 2002 section 27, the consequence of a failure to register one's interest is that it will not bind another person in law who is transferred the property and does register. If the transfer of land takes place through a will, the Wills Act 1837 section 9 requires in similar terms that the will be signed in writing and have two witnesses. The beneficiary under the will must then take steps to register the interest in land in her name. In the case of a person who dies without leaving a will, their property, including land will succeed in passing by operation of law to the next of kin, {{or in the case of}} jointly owned property <b>in</b> a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> to the co-owner/s.|$|R

40|$|What is {{the true}} {{nature and extent of}} the {{interest}} of the joint tenant, as distinct from their <b>joint</b> interest <b>in</b> the property itself? Can the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> itself constitute property? And, will the extent of a joint tenant’s interest always be an undivided moiety? This paper reviews two recent decisions: Peldan v Anderson (2006) 80 ALJR 1588 and Cummins v Cummins [2006] HCA 7. At first instance, the court in Peldan v Anderson conceptualised the severance of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as a transfer of property. This was discussed also in the Federal Court decision and in the High Court on appeal. The Federal Court analysed the severance of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> terms of the alienation of a bundle of rights, indicating an understanding of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as itself a property interest. This paper uses Penner’s challenge to the ‘bundle of rights’ theory of property as a framework to reject this. Having determined the nature of a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as other than property, the paper refers to Cummins to examine the extent of the joint tenant’s property interest. This case shows a contemporary application of equitable rules that result in the deconstruction of the joint tenant’s undivided moiety. Together, these cases highlight the challenges associated with finding the true extent of ‘ownership’ and ‘property’ where a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is involved...|$|R
