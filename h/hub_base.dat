5000|$|As {{shown by}} image 6, the ASA {{proposal}} {{was based on}} creating an international passenger terminal totally separate from the existing Tijuana passenger terminal and east of the Matrix aircraft maintenance center which {{was similar to the}} TwinPorts proposal (image 5). The difference between the ASA and TwinPorts proposals laid in the fact that ASA opposed north side runways on Otay Mesa and connecting the Tijuana and San Diego airports through a cross-border aircraft taxiway to service their respective terminals. While the Tijuana airport's ILS (Instrument Landing System) 09 approach required the use of U.S. airspace and coordinating operations with Brown Field Municipal Airport on Otay Mesa and the U.S. Naval Outlying Landing Field Imperial Beach, ASA opposed any San Diego airport development that would require the use of Mexican airspace. Instead, ASA proposed a 387,000sq.ft. (36,000 square meters) Tijuana international terminal to be built on the disputed former Ejido Tampico that would have been linked to San Diego through a bridge/tunnel connected directly to a U.S. 258,000sq.ft. (24,000 square meters) passenger terminal and parking facility on Otay Mesa. A 30-page report written by Ralph Nieders for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce titled [...] "Key Issues TwinPort/ASA Proposals" [...] compared both proposals and highlighted issues such as airspace, routes, slots (landing rights), U.S. airline interest and support, and was prepared in anticipation of President Carlos Salinas' visit to California which began in San Diego on September 28, 1991. In San Diego, President Salinas did not endorse the Twinports concept and instead announced Mexico would proceed with ASA's $300 million U.S. dollar expansion plan for the Tijuana airport and that private investors would provide $700 million U.S. dollars to build a state of the art Boeing 747 and jumbo aircraft maintenance center to make the Tijuana airport into “one of the most important airports not only in Mexico but in the whole region". This position was bolstered by the uncertainty over the Hong Kong transition from British to Chinese rule that had led to the exodus of people and capital from Hong Kong and the belief that Cathay Pacific would relocate or reflag part of its aircraft fleet to Mexico making the Tijuana airport its North and Latin American <b>hub</b> <b>base.</b>|$|E

For the analysis of complex systems, simulation is often used prior to {{the operation of the}} system as a mediator for a dynamic situation. This chapter presents the issue of complex systems simulation through Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD) techniques. The Authors original approach stands in the combined employ of the two SD and DES simulation techniques to solve real logistic problems. In the course of the chapter, examples of real world issues regarding logistics are explained.

40|$|Abstract—The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{precoding}} and feedback strategies for a radio backhaul link between an access base station (ABS) and the <b>hub</b> <b>base</b> station (HBS) in the presence of mobile stations (MSs). In this paper it is assumed that the access and the backhaul links are simultaneous and use the same frequency band. Two feedback links are exploited at the ABS in order to optimize the communication through the radio-backhaul link: the MSs feed back the channel state information (CSI) of the channels between the ABS and the MSs, and the HBS feeds back the statistics of the received interference. Using this information, a transmission strategy is proposed for the ABS in order to transmit to the HBS without interfering to the MSs {{and at the same time}} minimizing the effect of the interference received at the HBS.

In order to gain insights on the impact of CCI to this scenario we consider an HBS with two highly directional antennas communicating with two MSs via two interfering two-way RNs. We investigate the average maximum sum-rate of a cooperative strategy based on Decode-and-Forward (DF) with network coding and a strategy based on Amplify-and-Forward (AF) with Network MIMO. Furthermore we devise some cooperative protocols that utilise two, three or four time slots. It is shown that the 2 -slot schemes perform generally better and that the DF strategy achieves superior performance when CCI is low while AF with Network MIMO is superior when CCI is high.

40|$|The BuNGee project (Beyond Next Generation Mobile Broadband) aims {{to improve}} the overall {{infrastructure}} capacity density provided by cellular networks to an ambitious goal of 1 Gbps/km 2. Its innovative architecture relies on a <b>Hub</b> <b>Base</b> Station (HBS) connected to the operator back-haul {{on one side and}} to a large number of distributed Access Base Stations (ABSs) or fixed relays on the other side (self-backhaul links), the HBSABS links being implemented by means of narrow-beamwidth dual-polarized antennas. ABSs are then connected to Mobile Subscribers (MSs), forming access links. In this contribution, the small-scale statistics of the HBS-ABS relay links are characterized by means of an advanced ray-tracing tool to reflect the peculiarities of such architecture. In particular, the dependency of small-scale statistics upon the antenna beamwidth is critically investigated. Results are simultaneously compared with the reported parameters of existing models in the literature, e. g. WINNER II and IEEE 802. 16 channel models. We focus on the spatial K‐factor, spatial correlation coefficients, Cross Polarization and Co-Polar Ratios (XPR, CPR), in a dense urban deployment scenario. Furthermore, a tapped delay line model for fixed relay links with 20 MHz bandwidth is developed and analyzed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of learning and cognition to self organisation of ad hoc and green small cell networks {{in order to improve}} performance in terms of throughput, delay and the network energy consumption to achieve ‘green communication’. Initially, an attempt is made to improve the spatial re-use of the network by dividing it into disjoint sets of nodes through a clustering process. A novel distributed clustering algorithm is developed that exploit cognitive radio based principles in that they have the ability to learn from received signal strength indicator (RSSI) beacons, to form clusters which reduce the average distance between nodes, as well as reducing the level of overlap between clusters. By making nodes repeatedly learn about their environment through RSSI, nodes effectively compete to become a cluster head, with the winning nodes being those that are located in an area of locally high node density. It is demonstrated that the resulting cluster formation through repeated learning is better than with no learning and node degree. The benefit of applying a hierarchical architecture to ad hoc and green small cell networks via two-hop backhauling is examined with respect to its energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is investigated in terms of the energy consumption ratio (ECR) and the energy reduction gain (ERG). The results are compared to that of a traditional single hop architecture with no hierarchical formation. It is shown that under certain conditions, dual hop clustered networks can potentially be more energy efficient that single hop transmission, but care needs to be taken to ensure that the backhaul links within the network do not become bottlenecks at high offered traffic levels. The application of directional antennas at a <b>Hub</b> <b>Base</b> Station significantly helps to reduce the total energy consumption of the network as well the backhaul connectivity of a dual-hop clustered network. Introducing Reinforcement Learning to channel assignment on the first hop reduces end to end delay and thus minimises the amount of time and energy for the nodes in the network to be in transmission or reception mode. The reinforcement learning schemes can exploit the spectrum in which it perceives as a good option based upon individual channel historical information and thereby further improve the network spatial re-use...|$|E
