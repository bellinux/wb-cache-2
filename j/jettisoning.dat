5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often <b>jettisoning</b> their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|USAF F-105s were {{escorted by}} F-4s {{to protect them}} against enemy fighters. However, the Thunderchief was officially {{credited}} with 27.5 air-to-air victories against North Vietnamese aircraft {{at the cost of}} 17 aircraft lost to enemy fighters (North Vietnamese pilots claimed to have shot down an additional 23 F-105s but none have been confirmed by USAF). All victories were against MiG-17s. Of these 24.5 were shot down with cannon fire (one victory was shared with an F-4), and three with AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. One F-105F is unofficially credited with downing three MiGs—one by air-to-air missile, the second by cannon fire and the third by <b>jettisoning</b> the centerline rack full of bombs directly into the path of a surprised MiG.|$|E
40|$|In space, the {{controlled}} release of certain cargoes {{is no less}} useful than the maritime <b>jettisons</b> from which they take their name but is also much more dangerous. Experience has shown that <b>jettisons</b> can be performed safely, but the process is complicated with the path to performing a <b>jettison</b> taking months or even years. In the background, time is also required to write procedures, train the crew, configure the vehicle, and many other activities. This paper outlines the current process used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for manual <b>jettisons,</b> detailing the methods used {{to assure that the}} <b>jettisons</b> and the <b>jettisoned</b> objects are as safe as achievable and that the crew is adequately trained to be able to affect the safe <b>jettison.</b> The goal of this paper is not only to capture what it takes to perform safe <b>jettisons</b> in the near Earth environment but to extrapolate this knowledge to future space exploration scenarios that will likely have Extravehicular Activity (EVA) and International Partner (IP) interfaces...|$|R

5|$|On 25July, Phillipps {{was leading}} the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armentières when he spotted a patrol of seven Fokkers. <b>Jettisoning</b> his bombs to lighten his load, he {{attacked}} one of the German fighters and shot away its wing; the others retreated. During the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive, on 12August, he joined fellow No.2 Squadron ace Adrian Cole and No.4 Squadron aces Harry Cobby and Roy King to lead their combined forces {{in support of the}} British Fourth Army, Phillipps accounting for a Fokker that broke up in mid-air. He was credited with two other victories in August to bring his tally to fifteen, making him No.2 Squadron's second most successful ace after Captain Francis Smith, who finished the war with sixteen. Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with Royal Air Force policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. In October, he was promoted to major and posted to command No.6 (Training) Squadron at Minchinhampton; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No.2 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|The next day, after final checks were completed, the {{expended}} LM {{ascent stage}} was jettisoned. Because of a failure by {{the crew to}} activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly {{a year after the}} mission. The crew's next task, after <b>jettisoning</b> the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a subsatellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM's orbit to that desired for the subsatellite had been cancelled; as a result, the subsatellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.|$|E

40|$|Measurement of the <b>jettisoned</b> object {{departure}} trajectory {{and velocity}} vector in the International Space Station (ISS) reference frame {{is vitally important}} for prompt evaluation of the object s imminent orbit. We report on the first successful application of photogrammetric analysis of the ISS imagery for the prompt computation of the <b>jettisoned</b> object s position and velocity vectors. As post-EVA analyses examples, we present the Floating Potential Probe (FPP) and the Russian "Orlan" Space Suit <b>jettisons,</b> {{as well as the}} near-real-time (provided in several hours after the separation) computations of the Video Stanchion Support Assembly Flight Support Assembly (VSSA-FSA) and Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS) <b>jettisons</b> during the US astronauts space-walk. Standard close-range photogrammetry analysis was used during this EVA to analyze two on-board camera image sequences down-linked from the ISS. In this approach the ISS camera orientations were computed from known coordinates of several reference points on the ISS hardware. Then the position of the <b>jettisoned</b> object for each time-frame was computed from its image in each frame of the video-clips. In another, "quick-look" approach used in near-real time, orientation of the cameras was computed from their position (from the ISS CAD model) and operational data (pan and tilt) then location of the <b>jettisoned</b> object was calculated only for several frames of the two synchronized movies.

40|$|Altitude <b>jettison</b> tests, at a {{pressure}} of 20 torr (0. 39 psia), {{were performed on}} the Centaur Standard Shroud (CSS) in a 100 -foot diameter vacuum chamber. These <b>jettison</b> tests {{were part of a}} series of flight qualification tests which were performed on the new CSS system in preparation for the Helios and Viking missions. The first two tests subjected the CSS to a thermal cycle which simulated aerodynamic heating during ascent flight and the third test was performed at altitude pressure and in ambient temperature conditions. The purpose of the ambient temperature test was to provide base line data by which the separate machanical and thermal factors that influence <b>jettison</b> performance could be evaluated individually. The CSS was successfully <b>jettisoned</b> {{in each of the three}} tests. Also, thermal, stress, and structural deflection data were obtained which verified the analytical predictions of CSS response to flight environmental conditions and performance during <b>jettison.</b> In addition, much important information was obtained on critical CSS-to-payload clearance losses due to shell motions prior to and during <b>jettison.</b> The effectiveness of the separation system was successfully demonstrated at maximum flight temperatures...|$|R
50|$|A {{special feature}} of the XP-55 was a {{propeller}} <b>jettison</b> lever located inside the cockpit to prevent the pilot from hitting the propeller during bailout. The <b>jettison</b> device was invented by W. Jerome Peterson {{while working as a}} design engineer for Curtiss-Wright.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to verify the functional and structural capability of the Centaur D- 1 A nose fairing. A full-scale flight-type nose fairing was <b>jettisoned</b> at the Lewis Research Center Space Power Chamber at simulated altitude. Two complete <b>jettisons</b> of the nose fairing were performed, one without aft helper springs and one with aft helper springs. A ''static'' rotation test was also performed to verify capability of the helper springs and to allow clearance measurements between the nose fairing and spacecraft envelope mock-up at certain discrete nose fairing rotation angles. Nose fairing trajectories, structural deflections, clearances, and hinge forces during <b>jettison</b> are presented. Data from subsequent Centaur D- 1 A flights, relative to nose fairing <b>jettisons,</b> are compared with the experimental results...|$|R

5000|$|All current {{vehicles}} stage, that is, <b>jettison</b> hardware {{on the way}} to orbit.

25|$|It was {{proposed}} that a He 111 bomber would carry either {{one or two}} Reichenbergs beneath its wings, releasing them close to the target. The pilots would then steer their aircraft towards the target, <b>jettisoning</b> the cockpit canopy shortly before impact and bailing out. It was estimated that {{the chances of a}} pilot surviving such a bailout were less than 1% due to the proximity of the pulsejet's intake to the cockpit.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Jettison</b> Engineering Trajectory Tool (JETT) {{performs}} the <b>jettison</b> analysis function for any orbiting asset. It provides {{a method to}} compute the relative trajectories between an orbiting asset and any <b>jettisoned</b> item (intentional or unintentional) or sublimating particles generated by fluid dumps to assess whether an object is safe to <b>jettison,</b> or {{if there is a}} risk with an item that was inadvertently lost overboard. The main concern is the interaction and possible recontact of the <b>jettisoned</b> object with an asset. This supports the analysis that <b>jettisoned</b> items will safely clear the vehicle, ensuring no collisions. The software will reduce the <b>jettison</b> analysis task from one that could take days to complete to one that can be completed in hours, with an analysis that is more comprehensive than the previous method. It provides the ability to define the <b>jettison</b> operation relative to International Space Station (ISS) structure, and provides 2 D and 3 D plotting capability to allow an analyst to perform a subjective clearance assessment with ISS structures. The developers followed the SMP to create the code and all supporting documentation. The code makes extensive use of the object-oriented format of Java and, in addition, the Model-View-Controller architecture was used in the organization of the code, allowing each piece to be independent of updates to the other pieces. The model category is for maintaining data entered by the user and generated by the analysis. The view category provides capabilities for data entry and displaying all or a portion of the analysis data in tabular, 2 D, and 3 D representation. The controller category allows for handling events that affect the model or view(s). The JETT utilizes orbital mechanics with complex algorithms. Since JETT is written in JAVA, it is essentially platform-independent...|$|R

25|$|The fire left 134 men {{dead and}} 161 more injured. Many {{aircraft}} {{and a large}} amount of ordnance were jettisoned to prevent them from catching fire or exploding. Twenty-one aircraft also sustained enough damage from fire, explosions and salt water, to be stricken from naval inventory, including seven F-4B Phantom IIs (BuNos 153046, 153054, 153060, 153061, 153066, 153069 and 153912); eleven A-4E Skyhawks (149996, 150064, 150068, 150084, 150115, 150118, 150129, 152018, 152024, 152036 and 152040); and three RA-5C Vigilantes (148932, 149284 and 149305). The fire also revealed that Forrestal required a heavy-duty, armored forklift for use in the emergency <b>jettisoning</b> of aircraft (particularly heavier types such as the RA-5C Vigilante) as well as heavy or damaged ordnance.
