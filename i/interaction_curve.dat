40|$|Fire, {{as one of}} {{the most}} severe load conditions, has an {{important}} impact on concrete structures. It does not only affect the material strength, but also the structural stiffness and stability. A concrete column, compared to other structural members, has most often to cope both with vertical forces and bending moments transmitted by slabs and beams. Consequently, it is essential to find a reliable and practical way to establish <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> for the overall structural behaviour of concrete columns subjected to fire. In this paper, a cross-section calculation method based on the material models of Eurocode 2 is explained and adopted to calculate <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> for a typical rectangular column exposed to the ISO 834 standard fire. Subsequently, an iterative approach is introduced to develop <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> taking into account second order effects in case of four-side heated fire exposure. The maximum permitted slenderness ratios of columns under different fire durations are obtained and compared with Eurocode 2 provisions. Finally, this method is applied to calculate the maximum permitted slenderness ratios for columns exposed to hydrocarbon fires and natural fires...|$|R

40|$|The hull girder {{ultimate}} {{strength of a}} typical bulk carrier is analyzed using a simplified method based on an incremental-iterative approach. First, vertical bending moment is examined by seven different methods. The moment versus curvature curves and {{the values of the}} ultimate longitudinal moments at collapse states are determined for both hogging and sagging cases. Second, the {{ultimate strength}} under coupled vertical and horizontal bending moment is accounted. An <b>interaction</b> <b>curve</b> is obtained, which corresponds to the results of series of calculation for the ship hull subject to bending conditions with different angles of curvature. It is found that the <b>interaction</b> <b>curve</b> is asymmetrical because the hull cross section is not symmetrical with respect to the horizontal axis and the structural response of the elements under compression is different from that under tension due to nonlinearity caused by buckling. The angles of the resultant bending moment vector and that of the curvature vector are different in investigated cases.

Specific attention is directed towards developing an understanding of pile-soil behavior to torsional loads and dissipation of torsional stresses with depth. Another important aspect of this study is the formulation of criteria for describing the torsional pile-soil interaction in sand by families of curves from the standpoint of utilization of basic non-linear soil shear stress-strain relationships. The above objectives were accomplished by studying the interaction of a 1. 9 -inch diameter circular pile and a square pile of 2 -inch outside dimensions. These piles were embedded in air dried sand, in loose and dense environments and deposited under controlled density conditions. Instrumentation was provided on the piles to measure the torque distribution along the pile shaft. Based on the measured torque distributions, torsional <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> were developed and correlated with the measured soil properties. From the correlations criteria for describing the torsional <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> were formulated.

40|$|Buckling of {{concrete}} columns {{is a major}} issue in fire design, since heating of the columns will result in loss of stiffness and strength in the outer concrete layers. In the Dutch concrete code NEN 6720 (NEN, 1995), a quasi-linear theory of elasticity (KLE) method is provided for columns at ambient temperature. However, no literature is available showing whether this method could be adopted for elevated temperatures. Hence, an efficient calculation tool is needed to validate the applicability of this method in case of fire. As a first step, a cross-sectional calculation tool is introduced to calculate <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> of columns at ambient temperature. Further, the interaction diagrams obtained with this numerical method as well as the stiffness method provided in (Eurocode, 2004) and the KLE method are compared. Then, an assumed formula in the KLEmethod for the nominal stiffness calculation is discussed considering <b>interaction</b> <b>curves</b> of columns in case of an ISO 834 fire. Finally, parameters like the fire duration and the slenderness ratio are investigated...|$|R

Under different assumptions with respect to the distribution of the stresses across the thickness, different yield curves are found.

Nevertheless, due to accidental eccentricities, additional loads, boundary conditions or imperfection factors, glass beam-columns are frequently subjected to in-plane compressive actions combined with bending moments. Because of this reason, the paper focuses on the buckling resistance of glass elements subjected to eccentric compressive loads. Based on large experimental numerical results available in literature for monolithic and laminated glass columns or beams in out-of plane bending, verification criteria for these simple loading conditions are firstly recalled from previous contributions. Subsequently, numerical static incremental simulations are performed with a finite-element model able to predict the buckling strength of imperfect glass elements eccentrically compressed. In it, also the effects of various geometrical imperfection shapes are deeply investigated.
