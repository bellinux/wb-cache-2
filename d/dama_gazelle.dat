50|$|Human {{threats are}} the most {{dangerous}} of threats to the <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b> The main reason this species of gazelle is endangered is because of mechanized hunting; hunters using vehicles increase their decline. Civil unrest, for instance in Sudan, also negatively affects {{the life of the}} <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b> Since the gazelle is already having a hard time surviving, these conditions have made its habitat unsuitable.|$|E
50|$|African Plains: Features a white rhinoceros, <b>Dama</b> <b>gazelles,</b> red river hogs, {{reticulated}} giraffes, Chapman's zebras, and hippos.|$|R
50|$|The Round Barn {{is home to}} gerenuks, {{which are}} known by their {{extremely}} long necks. Keepers encourage their foraging behavior by placing tall bamboo stems in their exhibit. This exhibit also houses Abyssinian ground-hornbills, warthogs, red river hogs, nyalas, yellow-backed duikers, dik diks, klipspringers, and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelles.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Dama</b> <b>gazelles</b> do {{not need}} a lot of water, but they need more than other desert animals. They are not as {{resistant}} and perish from a lack of water during the drought season. The environment has become ill-suited for them. Habitat pressure from pastoral activity is another reason for decline, as are introduced diseases from livestock.|$|R

50|$|The {{wildlife}} of Tunisia {{is composed}} of its flora and fauna. It has 84 species of mammals and 375 species of birds. Tunisia is well documented for its addax and <b>Dama</b> <b>Gazelle</b> population.|$|E
50|$|The zoo is {{involved}} in breeding a number of endangered species including black rhino, leopard, golden lion tamarin, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> Attwater's prairie chicken, black mangabey, African lion, black-footed ferret, Komodo dragon, Andean condor, and Caribbean flamingos.|$|E
50|$|White Oak has {{maintained}} a breeding herd of addra gazelles since 1983, and since then, more than 280 have been born at the center. White Oak participates in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' <b>Dama</b> (Addra) <b>Gazelle</b> Species Survival Plan.|$|R
2500|$|This is {{an outdoor}} exhibit {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} African savanna and educate visitors about cheetahs and {{what is being done}} to preserve them in the wild. The main part of the Cheetah Conservation Station consists of two enclosures separated by a fence. One enclosures houses two South African cheetahs (both males; Gat [...] and Bakari), while the other houses two male Grevy's zebras. Other animals on display in the area include scimitar-horned oryxs, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelles,</b> Rüppell's vultures, sitatungas, red river hogs, maned wolves (a species native to South America), an Abyssinian ground hornbill and three lesser kudu. A female tammar wallaby named Maji had been on display until December 2013, when she was euthanized at the very old age of 18 (most do not live beyond 10).|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{habitat is}} isolated, {{conditions}} which have {{helped create the}} rich congregation of desert fauna. Many IUCN Red Listed endangered species such as addax, <b>dama</b> and Dorcas <b>gazelles,</b> Sudan cheetah, Barbary sheep and striped hyena survive in large numbers. Bustards, of both the Nubian and Sudan species, and also tortoise (desert-adopted spurr type) are also found in large numbers; vultures, small carnivorans, including canids (such as fennec, pale fox, Rüppell's fox and golden wolf) and small cat species (Saharan sand cat and African wild cat), are also reported in the reserve.|$|R
50|$|Relatively few {{actions have}} been taken in the {{conservation}} of the <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b> The few measures that {{have been taken}} are reserves so the animal can live in peaceful environment and captive breeding to help rebuild the populations.|$|E
50|$|Located at a dozen {{kilometers}} {{south of}} the city of Saint-Louis, this reserve has an area of 7 square kilometres and shelters birds and endangered species such as the <b>Dama</b> <b>Gazelle,</b> the Patas monkey and the African Spurred Tortoise.|$|E
50|$|Souss-Massa {{also holds}} captive-breeding {{programmes}} for four threatened North African ungulates: scimitar oryx, addax, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> and dorcas gazelle, that {{are kept in}} separate enclosures within the park. The reintroduction of the North African ostrich - which is extinct north of the Sahara - is also underway.|$|E
50|$|The Sahel was {{formerly}} home to large populations of grazing mammals, including the scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah), <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons), the giant prehistoric buffalo (Pelorovis) and Bubal hartebeest (Alcelaphus busephalus buselaphus), along with large predators like the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), the Northeast African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus soemmeringii), the West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis) and the East African lion (Panthera leo nubica). The larger {{species have been}} greatly reduced in number by over-hunting and competition with livestock, and several species are vulnerable (Dorcas gazelle, cheetah, lion and red-fronted gazelle), endangered (<b>Dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> and African wild dog), or extinct (the Scimitar-horned oryx is probably extinct in the wild, and both Pelorovis and the Bubal hartebeest are now extinct).|$|E
50|$|About 25 {{species are}} rated by the IUCN as endangered, {{such as the}} <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> and {{mountain}} nyala. A number of subspecies are also endangered, including the giant sable antelope and the mhorr gazelle. The main causes for concern for these species are habitat loss, competition with cattle for grazing, and trophy hunting.|$|E
50|$|The main prey of the Northwest African cheetah are antelopes {{which have}} adapted to an arid environment, such as the addax, Dorcas gazelle, rhim gazelle, and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b> It may also take smaller animals such as hares. These cheetahs can subsist without direct access to water, obtaining water {{indirectly}} from the blood of their prey.|$|E
50|$|The Zakouma National Park is an {{important}} habitat with {{the highest number of}} large mammals. Scimitar horned oryx are seen in the reserves of Chad in significant numbers, mostly in the Ouadi Rime Ouadi Achin Faunal Reserve. Also reported to survive in this reserve are the large population of addax (nasomaculatus) and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> Gazelle dama.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} fox {{live in the}} Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and Rüppell's fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly {{a year in the}} desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|SCI {{counters}} hunting can be {{an integral}} part of management of these species and provides needed funds for habitat preservation and enhancement. [...] SCI, along with other hunting and non-hunting organizations, intervened in a federal suit where HSUS challenged regulations that allow hunting of captive scimitar-horned oryx, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> and addax. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) found that, “captive breeding in the United States has enhanced the propagation or survival of the scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> worldwide by rescuing these species from near extinctions and providing the founder stock necessary for reintroduction. Sport hunting of surplus, captive-bred animals generates revenue that supports these captive-breeding operations and may relieve hunting pressure on wild populations.” As of February 2008, this case is still pending. [...] In the case of the black rhino, 83% of those countries represented at the 2004 CITES meeting approved sport hunting of the species in very limited numbers.|$|E
5000|$|Like the Asian Forest, the African Savanna is also {{a result}} of the zoo's Master Plan of 1980. [...] Completed in 1987, this section of the zoo is modeled to give the viewer the {{impression}} {{that he or she is}} walking along a river in an African savanna. This section of the zoo contains lions, African bush elephants, giraffes, zebras, black rhinos, flamingos, ostrich, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> and nyala.|$|E
50|$|The Niger {{national}} football team represents Niger in international association football through the Fédération Nigerienne de Football (FNFB), {{a member of}} Confederation of African Football (CAF). Niger plays in {{the colors of the}} flag of Niger, white, green and orange. Their nickname comes from the <b>Dama</b> <b>Gazelle,</b> native to Niger, the Hausa name of which is Meyna or Ménas The Dama appears on their badge in the colors of the national flag.|$|E
50|$|Water from {{mountain}} streams {{makes the}} area an important habitat for wildlife {{such as a}} numbered of threatened antelope species such as addax (Addax nasomaculatus), <b>Dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and Red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons). Endemic species include the Arid Thicket Rat (Grammomys aridulus) from Jebel Marra. The mountains are home to birds of both Eurasia and Africa, species include Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) and Cinereous Vulture (Aegypius monachus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> addra gazelle, or mhorr gazelle (Nanger dama, {{formerly}} Gazella dama) is {{a species}} of gazelle. It lives in Africa in the Sahara desert and the Sahel. This critically endangered species has disappeared from most of its former range due to overhunting and habitat loss, and natural populations only remain in Chad, Mali, and Niger. Its habitat includes grassland, shrubland, semi-deserts, open savanna and mountain plateaus. Their diets includes grasses, leaves (especially Acacia leaves), shoots, and fruit.|$|E
5000|$|Gadabedji Total Reserve {{was planned}} to protect Sahelo-Saharan antelopes, mainly the Scimitar-horned Oryx and <b>Dama</b> <b>Gazelle</b> populations which have largely {{disappeared}} due to local population pressures. In the 1940s, {{the area was}} along an important migration route for the animals from the Tenere desert to the Adar {{in the south of}} the country. It remains a transhumance route for domesticated cattle and camels, as well as some wild Dorcas and Ménas Gazelles [...] The reserve is a proposed site of future Oryx reintroduction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ecoregion}} supports, or supported, {{populations of}} several important Saharan large mammals. One, the scimitar-horned oryx Oryx dammah is now {{believed to be}} extinct in the wild, while the addax Addax nasomaculatus is critically endangered. Other species include dorcas gazelle Gazella dorcas which is assessed as vulnerable, <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> Nanger dama which is endangered, Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia which is vulnerable and cheetah Acinonyx jubatus which is vulnerable. In 2000 Barbary sheep and dama gaxelle were recorded in the Jebel Uweinat portion of the ecoregion.|$|E
50|$|As late as 2000, {{the basin}} has {{remained}} home to large populations of wildlife. In the Sahel these include antelopes {{such as the}} addax and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> and in the savannah there are korrigum and red-fronted gazelle. The black crowned crane and other waterbirds {{are found in the}} wetlands. There are populations of elephants, giraffes, and lions. The western black rhinoceros was once common but is now extinct. Elephants almost became extinct {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century due to European and American demand for ivory, but stocks have since recovered.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{features}} 100,000 planted {{flora and}} trees, & more than 45 species of animals, 82 {{species of birds}} and 25 species of flora. [...] Species present in the park include the Arabian oryx, which is extinct in the wild, Persian gazelle, springbok, saluki dogs, impala, fallow deer, Chapman's zebra and desert hares. [...] Arabian species such as the scimitar-horned oryx, addax (which is rare in the wild), <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> giraffes, Nubian ibex, wild goat, barbary sheep and Asiatic onager are also present. [...] The park also employs a captive breeding policy of endangered species.|$|E
50|$|The West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) is {{the most}} {{prominent}} fauna species in the lake which is reported as its last habitat in the world. Hippos (Hippopotamus amphibius) are also reported from the lake (the hippo population is estimated at 40 to 60 individuals). Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is also reported from the flood plains. Within the basin area {{of the lake and}} the delta the faunal species reported are: roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus), dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dama), red-fronted gazelle(Gazella rufifrons) (VU), and reptile species Nile monitor (Varanus nilotica) and African rock python (Python sebae).|$|E
50|$|The {{wildlife}} of Niger {{is composed}} of its flora and fauna. The wildlife protected areas in the country total about 8.5 million hectares (21 million acres), which is 6.6% of the land area of the country, a figure {{which is expected to}} eventually reach the 11% percent target fixed by the IUCN with addition of more areas under the reserve category. The <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> (Gazella dama or Nanger dama) has become a national symbol. Under the Hausa name meyna or ménas the dama appears on the badge of the Niger national football team, who are popularly called the Ménas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> is {{generally}} {{divided into three}} subspecies based on the colour of the animal's back, flanks and haunches. These three subspecies occupied three blocks running along the east-west axis of the gazelle's range. The easternmost is the N. dama ruficollis (common name addra gazelle) whose historical range was {{to the east of}} 15°E. The westernmost is the N. dama mhorr (common name mohor or mhorr gazelle) whose historical range was to the west of 7°E. Between the two was the historical range of the N. dama dama. Genetic studies have raised questions over the validity of these subspecies and the variation in colour (phenotype) appears to be clinal.|$|E
50|$|While {{details are}} {{difficult}} to establish, some researchers believe Termit may be home to the last self-sustaining population of the critically endangered addax, which at one time made regular migrations from {{what is now the}} Aïr and Ténéré Addax Sanctuary {{on the edge of the}} Ténéré desert. Several hundred <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> are noted here. Though the slender-horned gazelle had previously been reported here, it was unknown by 1999 if it was still found in the area. The Saharan cheetah is reported to be very few in number, about 10. They have adopted to the searing heat of the Saharan Desert and can survive without a perennial source of water.|$|E
50|$|The Termit Massif {{reserve is}} now, since 2012, {{under a new}} decree. It {{encloses}} an area of 100000 km2 area, {{which is the largest}} single reserve in Africa. It is also a Saharan antelopes conservation area since 1998 as it has a combination of desert and mountain habitats covering the Saharan and Sahelian zones in the country. The whole area of Termit Massif and Tin Toumma desert is considered a biodiversity hotspot. Its arid land fauna consists of addax, dama and dorcas gazelles, cheetah, Barbary sheep and striped hyena, bustards (Nubian and Sudan) and spurred tortoise. It is also the habitat for the Critically Endangered <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the larger}} mammal species have been extirpated from Mauritania. Among the antelopes the Scimitar-horned oryx, addax, korrigum and <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle</b> are extinct, the bohor reedbuck, Buffon's kob, Dorcas gazelle and red-fronted gazelle are extinct and the {{bushbuck}} and slender-horned gazelle are of indeterminate status. In the area of Diawling National Park the last lion was shot in 1970 {{and there have been}} no sightings of manatees or hippopotamus in recent years. The Mediterranean monk seal has one of its last strongholds in the world in the coves along the Cap Blanc Peninsula near Nouadhibou. Common extant mammals include fennec fox, golden jackals, warthogs, African wildcats, Cape hares and patas monkeys.|$|E
50|$|The {{topographic}} and {{climatic conditions}} {{of the country has}} resulted in faunal species dominated by rare species such as African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), striped hyena, Northwest African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus hecki), waterbuck, African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), West African lion (Panthera leo senegalensis), antelope, common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), scimitar oryx (Oryx dammah), hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) in the Niger River, crocodiles, horned vipers, lizards, pythons, manatee, the endemic Nigerian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) which is endangered, the Critically Endangered <b>dama</b> <b>gazelle,</b> which is the national symbol of Niger (named meyna or ménas in the Hausa language) as well as Soemmerring's gazelle (Nanger soemmerringii), Grant's gazelle (Nanger granti) and slender-horned gazelle (Gazella leptoceros).|$|E
