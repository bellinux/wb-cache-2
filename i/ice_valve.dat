40|$|A low-cost, {{disposable}} card for rapid {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) was developed in this work. Commercially available, adhesive-coated aluminum foils and polypropylene films were laminated with structured polycarbonate films to form microreactors in a card format. Ice valves [1] were employed to seal the reaction chambers during thermal cycling and a Peltier-based thermal cycler was configured for rapid thermal cycling and <b>ice</b> <b>valve</b> actuation. Numerical modeling was conducted to optimize {{the design of the}} PCR reactor and investigate the thermal gradient in the reaction chamber in the direction of sample thickness. The PCR reactor was experimentally characterized by using thin foil thermocouples and validated by a successful amplification of 10 copy of E. coli tuf gene in 27 min. close 151...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: The {{objective}} was to implant a stented decellularised tissue-engineered heart valve (sdTEHV) percutaneously in an animal model, to assess its in vivo functionality and to examine the repopulation and remodelling of the valvular matrix by the recipient's autologous cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prototypes of sdTEHV were cultured in vitro, decellularised and percutaneously implanted into the pulmonary position in 15 sheep. Functionality was assessed monthly by intracardiac echocardiography (<b>ICE).</b> <b>Valves</b> were explanted after eight, 16 or 24 weeks and analysed macroscopically, histologically and by electron microscopy. Implantation was successful in all animals. Valves showed normal pressure gradients throughout the study. Due to a suboptimal design with small coaptation area, stent ovality led to immediate regurgitation which continuously increased during follow-up. Analyses revealed complete endothelialisation and rapid cellular repopulation and remodelling of the entire matrix. Valves were free from endocarditis, calcification and graft rejection. CONCLUSIONS: sdTEHV can be safely implanted percutaneously. The fast autologous recellularisation and the extensive matrix remodelling demonstrate the valve's potential as a next-generation percutaneous prosthesis with the capacity for tissue self-maintenance and longevity. Regurgitation may be prevented by valve design optimisation...|$|R
50|$|All {{refrigeration}} equipments {{are made}} of four key components; the evaporator, the condenser, the compressor and the throttle <b>valve.</b> <b>Ice</b> machines all work the same way. The function of compressor is to compress low-pressure refrigerant vapor to high-pressure vapor, and deliver it to the condenser. Here, the high-pressure vapor is condensed into high-pressure liquid, and drained out through the throttle valve to become low-pressure liquid. At this point, the liquid is conducted to the evaporator, where heat exchanging occurs, and ice is created. This is one complete refrigeration cycle.|$|R
50|$|For {{portable}} earth bound applications, {{the heat}} exchanger for cooling the liquid {{can be very}} low-tech, consisting simply of a container for holding ice, and an electric pump to circulate water from the container through the tubing. The return water is cooled by the melting ice, and again pumped through the tubes. Regulation of flow is done by varying pump speed or using an adjustable flow <b>valve.</b> <b>Ice</b> storage can be achieved using a belt-pack, a backpack, or a duffel bag, depending {{on the length of}} time needed for the cooling system to operate between refilling the ice storage.|$|R
