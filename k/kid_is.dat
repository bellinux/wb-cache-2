40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> homogeneous or heterogeneous.

If the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it is optimal whenever the <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R

25|$|The game {{contains}} {{a total of}} 45 playable characters. While some join automatically as the plot progresses, others only become playable depending on {{the actions of the}} player. For example, early in the game, the player is tasked with breaking Serge into a heavily guarded manor. The player must explore the town outside of the manor in order to find assistance with breaking in. The player may choose to ask Guile, Pierre, or Nikki for help on different approaches to breaking into the manor. The player may only choose one, and only that respective character will join the party. At other times, characters will not join if other characters are present. Early in the game, Leena will only join if the player opts to have Serge traveling alone at the time; if <b>Kid</b> <b>is</b> already with him, she no longer feels the need to help, and will not join. As such, it is impossible for all characters to join {{over the course of a}} single game. However, the game employs a New Game + system, where, upon starting a second game, characters who had been recruited on the prior play through will become available towards the latter part of the game. As such, the player can retain characters from the first game, while taking alternate paths to recruit characters missed the first time.|$|E

500|$|Malathi Rangarajan, in her {{review of}} Deiva Thirumagal (2011) said, [...] "Probably because {{the scene of}} action is Ooty, the main {{character}} is mentally challenged, and the story-telling sequence with Vikram and the <b>kid</b> <b>is</b> familiar, at times [...] reminds you of Balu Mahendra's inimitable Moondraam Pirai." [...] Baradwaj Rangan compares a scene in Barfi! (2012), where Barfi (Ranbir Kapoor) goes after Shruti (Ileana D'Cruz) and stumbles, to that of Moondram Pirais climax scene.

500|$|By early April, most NBA draft analysts {{thought he}} would be {{selected}} in the second round, but Larry Butler, his former AAU coach with the Illinois Warriors, thought he might go late in the first round.

The <b>Kid</b> <b>is</b> thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in Limelight (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents, and A King in New York references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. Stephen M. Weissman has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} comparatively the slaughter and carcass characteristics of Gokceada, Maltese and Turkish Saanen suckling kids.
