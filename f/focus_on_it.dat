The academic Jeremy Black points to the 1951 defections of two members of MI6—Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean—to the Soviet Union as having a major impact on how Britain was poorly viewed in US intelligence circles; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but he did not <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> too strongly, and Bond and Leiter's warm relationship did not reflect the reality of the US-UK relationship.|$|E

500|$|The Bond novels also {{dealt with}} the {{question}} of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West. In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating [...] "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action". Author and journalist Christopher Hitchens observed that [...] "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans". Although Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, he did not <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> strongly. Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier, pointed out that [...] "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he".|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

Stephen Fleming, who captained the New Zealand side, later said that [...] "it feels very tentative with the batting unit – there's {{been a lot of}} <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> the performances haven't been great and with that comes a certain amount of tension." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the establishments {{are legally}} {{responsible}} for irrigation and wastewater treatment, {{they are not}} engaged in these activities. There is no strategic or business planning, nor a focus on performance. There is a limited <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>IT</b> and on asset management; customer service is fragmented. By law Lebanese water utilities should have 4,050 employees, but they actually had only 1,342 as of 2010. This {{is due to a}} hiring freeze imposed by the government. The number of employees has thus declined during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. The gaps at the lower levels were partially filled with temporary laborers. But there are also important gaps in managerial positions. [...] The average number of staff is less than 2 per 1000 connections, much below the regional average. The Beirut-Mount Lebanon utility has only 1.6 staff per 1000 connections. Utilities are thus unable to perform some of their basic functions. The Board members of the Water Establishments are nominated by the Cabinet upon the proposition of the Minister of Energy and Water. Municipalities have no say in the nomination of Board members. There have been only limited attempts to involve the private sector in operating water and sewer systems. A management contract for the city of Tripoli with a French firm has not been renewed after it expired (see history section).|$|E

[...] Her grandmother, Eleanor Sudds, and her grandfather, Clyde Sudds, raised Gloria Foster on a farm. [...] As Gloria {{continued}} her education {{she returned to her}} hometown of Chicago and attended the University of Illinois, where she participated in plays, but did not <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> [...] She took many different classes, including forensics, which she enjoyed a lot. [...] Gloria Foster was not sure what occupation to pursue, until her godmother introduced her to the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. [...] After she auditioned and was accepted, she knew {{that this was going to}} be her passion in life, the theater. [...] She was one of the few African Americans at the Goodman School of Drama, but focused on her study of acting. [...] During her studying at the Goodman School she also, [...] "learned professional acting skills in the Court Theater at the University of Chicago". [...] One of her most influential instructors was Bella Itkin, who cast Gloria in many classical roles. [...] Her next step in life was to move to New York to pursue a career on Broadway.|$|E
60|$|It's a {{world of}} surprises. The king brooded; this was natural. What would he brood about, should you say? Why, about the prodigious nature of his fall, of course--from the loftiest {{place in the world}} to the lowest; from the most illustrious station in the world to the obscurest; from the grandest {{vocation}} among men to the basest. No, I take my oath that the thing that graveled him most, to start with, was not this, but the price he had fetched! He couldn't seem to get over that seven dollars. Well, it stunned me so, when I first found it out, that I couldn't believe it; it didn't seem natural. But as soon as my mental sight cleared and I got a right <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> I saw I was mistaken; it was natural. For this reason: a king is a mere artificiality, and so a king's feelings, like the impulses of an automatic doll, are mere artificialities; but as a man, he is a reality, and his feelings, as a man, are real, not phantoms. It shames the average man to be valued below his own estimate of his worth, and the king certainly wasn't anything more than an average man, if he was up that high.|$|E
