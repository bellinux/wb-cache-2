5|$|As {{originally}} planned, the fee {{to enter}} or exit at Howard Beach and Jamaica {{would have been}} $5, with airport and airline employees receiving a discounted fare of $2. Trips within the airport terminals would be <b>free,</b> <b>as</b> is currently the case. On July 25, 2008, to celebrate the airport's 60th anniversary, the Port Authority let riders use the AirTrain for free for one day.|$|E
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of the occupant. Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was <b>free,</b> <b>as</b> was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E
5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo {{need to use the}} interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are <b>free.</b> <b>As</b> of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E

5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once. However, traffic only traveling between Føyno to Bømlo {{does not have to}} pay. Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo need to use the interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are <b>free.</b> <b>As</b> of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount.|$|E

25|$|Also in the 1960s, Stewart Brand filmed a {{demonstration}} of a networked computer system with a graphics display, mouse and keyboard that he believed would save the world by empowering people, {{in a similar way}} to the communes, to be <b>free</b> <b>as</b> individuals.|$|E

25|$|In {{the border}} states, slavery was already dying out {{in urban areas}} and the regions without cotton, {{especially}} in cities that were rapidly industrializing, such as Baltimore, Louisville, and St. Louis.

25|$|There {{is always}} a graded {{polynomial}} subring A ⊂ R (with generators in various degrees) such that R is finitely generated as an A-module.
