50|$|A denshi block (or <b>electronic</b> <b>block)</b> is a {{small plastic}} box {{containing}} an electronic component. Each block has conductive metal strips on its sides, and when two blocks are placed side-by-side, their metal strips touch allowing electricity to flow between them. The top of each block is labelled with a schematic representation of the component it contains.|$|E
50|$|Note: Any {{nonlinear}} <b>electronic</b> <b>block</b> {{driven by}} two signals with frequencies f1 and f2 would generate intermodulation (mixing) products. A multiplier (which is a nonlinear device) will generate ideally only the sum and difference frequencies, whereas an arbitrary nonlinear block would generate also signals at e.g. 2·f1-3·f2, etc. Therefore, normal nonlinear amplifiers or just single diodes {{have been used}} as mixers, instead of a more complex multiplier. A multiplier has usually the advantage of rejecting - at least partly - undesired higher-order intermodulations and larger conversion gain.|$|E

By placing <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks</b> {{on top of one}} another young children build “computer programs ” – each stack of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks</b> is capable of a different function. Significantly, the blocks programming input and program output are based in the physical world, with the digital implementation completely hidden from the children. Preliminary studies have found that children aged between four and six are capable of using the blocks to create robots that crash into each other, remote control cars, and lights that flash when you clap.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks,</b> a new robot {{construction element}} {{designed to allow}} {{children as young as}} age three to build and program robotic structures. The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks</b> encapsulate input, output and logic concepts in tangible elements that young children can use to create a wide variety of physical agents. The children are able to determine the behavior of these agents by the choice of blocks {{and the manner in which}} they are connected. The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks</b> allow children without any knowledge of mechanical design or computer programming to create and control physically embodied robots. They facilitate the development of technological capability by enabling children to design, construct, explore and evaluate dynamic robotics systems. A study of four and five year-old children using the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Blocks</b> has demonstrated that the interface is well suited to young children. The complexity of the implementation is hidden from the children, leaving the children free to autonomously explore the functionality of the blocks. As a consequence, children are free to move their focus beyond the technology. Instead they are free to focus on the construction process, and to work on goals related to the creation of robotic behaviors and interactions. As a resource for robot building, the blocks have proved to be effective in encouraging children to create robot structures, allowing children to design and program robot behaviors...|$|R
50|$|The early {{sets were}} {{sophisticated}} and were often used by engineers {{to teach and}} simulate industrial robotics. This use was advanced {{by the addition of}} electrical and electronic components such as microswitches, magnetic-sensing reed switches, and photocells, which sensed position and provided input to motors. With the basic <b>electronic</b> <b>block</b> (Grundbaustein), which contained an operational amplifier, Schmitt trigger and delay line circuits could be built. In the late 1970s, electronic binary-logic modules (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, flip-flops) were introduced, so that models could make some branching decisions. Pneumatic devices were made available to provide gripping ability. By the late 1980s, process control CPU modules were added, so that sequences movements could be preprogrammed and executed, first using “Lucky Logic” (LLWIN) software.|$|E

According to it, express analysis of the discovered substance made by detectors [...] "Exprei" [...] и [...] "М-02" [...] showed controversial results. To resolve the controversy, three 3 kg samples were taken from the sacks and ignited at the testing area; in all cases no explosion followed.

40|$|A {{transverse}} susceptibility (TS) measurement {{system based on}} a simple inverter CMOS cell oscillator cross-coupled to a LC tank is presented. The system has been implemented to operate at a Quantum Design Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS). We introduce several improvements with respect to similar currently operating TS measurement equipments. The electronics have been redesigned to use CMOS transistors as active devices, which simplifies the circuit design and enlarge the tuning range, thus making the proposed <b>electronic</b> <b>block</b> more feasible, predictable, and precise. Additionally, we propose a newly designed sample holder, which facilitates the procedure to change a sample and improves reproducibility of the circuit. Our design minimizes the thermal leak of the measuring probe by one order of magnitude, allowing to measure from 1. 8 K in standard PPMS systems, thanks {{to the use of}} a low temperature beryllium-copper coaxial cable instead of the conventional RG 402 Cu coaxial cable employed in the insert for the PPMS in similar systems. The data acquisition method is also simplified, so that the measuring sequences are implemented directly in the PPMS controller computer by programming them in the Quantum Design MultiVu software that controls the PPMS. We present the test measurements performed on the system without sample to study the background signal and stability of the circuit. Measurements on a Gd 2 O 3 calibrating sample yield to the estimation of the system sensitivity, which is found to be on the order of 10 - 6 emu. Finally, measurements on a TmCo 2 Laves phase sample with a ferrimagnetic transition temperature around 4 K are described, demonstrating that the developed system is well suited to explore interesting magnetic phenomena at this temperature scale. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the impact of aging on the {{electromagnetic}} susceptibility level of a CMOS operational amplifier (opamp). The aging impact can be modelled by the variation of several parameters of the MOSFET model, to predict the evolution of electromagnetic susceptibility (EMS) of the opamp block during the aging process. I. INTRODUCTION The increasing use of high speed and complex electronic systems makes the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) an important issue for the electronic manufacturers [1]. Some experimental results show the significant reduced EMC evolution after aging stress [2]. Thus how to ensure EMC during the whole lifetime of IC products, which is called electromagnetic robustness (EMR), becomes a new study in the recent years. As presented in only few works, the simulation can be used to predict the long-term EMC behaviour. For example, in [3], the increase of the electromagnetic emission of a DC-DC converter after thermal stress is modeled, which is associated to the degradation of filtering passive devices. In [4], the simulation results confirm the evolution of the EMS of a phase-locked loop (PLL) before and after aging. The aging affects the threshold voltage and the mobility of the MOSFET of the PLL. However, in these case studies only two statuses (the device before and after a period of aging) are measured and simulated. Thus {{there is a lack of}} more precise insight about the evolution of the different phases during the whole aging time. As a common <b>electronic</b> <b>block,</b> the operational amplifier is very susceptible to the external electromagnetic interference (EMI). The coupling of EMI on opamp inputs and power supply leads to a distortion of the output voltage, especially the generation of a voltage offset on its output which is harmful and hard to remove [5], [6]. In this study, with the aging stress injected in several parts of the amplifier, a worse DC output offset value at several frequencies could be observed, that means the device becomes more susceptible to the EMI with the aging. So the prediction of EMS evolution becomes important to help the IC designers to prevent EMC failure during the ICs' lifetime...|$|E
