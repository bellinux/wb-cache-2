5|$|Two other partial skeletons, with skull material, {{were named}} Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis by Fernando Novas in 1986, but this species too is now {{thought to be}} a synonym. Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis was {{discovered}} in 1975, and was described by Novas (1986) who considered it a primitive saurischian, and possibly a theropod. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) examined the Frenguellisaurus remains and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> referable to Herrerasaurus. Ischisaurus cattoi was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) reviewed its remains and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be referable to Herrerasaurus.|$|E

The introduction of lifts in 2010 made the taxi rank and underground station accessible from the concourse, though customers <b>found</b> <b>them</b> unreliable and frequently broken down.

5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some <b>found</b> <b>them</b> important and scary, while others <b>found</b> <b>them</b> ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, rumours emerged of Theodosius's {{survival}} and spread far and wide. It was alleged that his father-in-law Germanus had bribed his executioner, a leading Phocas supporter named Alexander, to spare his life. In this story, Theodosius then fled, eventually reaching Lazica, where he died. Theophylact Simocatta {{reports that he}} thoroughly investigated these rumours and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> false.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be preachy.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be placid {{and that they could}} interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who <b>found</b> <b>them</b> had to breathe through his mouth since it burned his nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research <b>found</b> <b>them</b> to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

Publishing a report for officials on October 22, 1985, the scientists determined that the risk of lahars was unusually high. To prepare for the eruption, the report gave several simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. Another team gave the local officials seismographs, but no instructions on how to operate them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who <b>found</b> <b>them</b> unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving the Rodney King trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E
5|$|Bayern {{got off to}} a {{good start}} under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, they managed to clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that <b>found</b> <b>them</b> in third place.|$|E

5|$|Berlin {{surrendered}} on 2 May. Records in the Soviet archives obtained {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler, Braun, Joseph and Magda Goebbels, the six Goebbels children, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the Elbe. According to Kershaw, the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army <b>found</b> <b>them,</b> and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler's remains.|$|E
5|$|Concerning the {{development}} of the much-discussed final scene intended to show the friends Korra and Asami becoming a romantic couple, Bryan Konietzko explained that at first he and DiMartino did not give the idea much weight, assuming they {{would not be able to}} get approval for portraying their relationship. But during the production of the finale they decided to test that assumption, approached the network and <b>found</b> <b>them</b> supportive up to a certain limit. They decided to change the final scene from Korra and Asami only holding hands to also facing each other in a pose referencing the marriage scene a few minutes prior.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 <b>found</b> <b>them</b> guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
