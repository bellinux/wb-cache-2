5|$|Continuing eastward from Grantsville, Alt US40 intersects US 219 a short {{distance}} north of exit 22 on I-68, where US219 leaves the freeway. East of this intersection, traffic decreases, with an AADT of 1,681, the lowest traffic density along the entire route. The US219 intersection <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a hill known as Chestnut Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The site <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a Carboniferous Limestone ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone has been exposed because of erosion of the overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate. The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.|$|E

The {{top floor of the}} 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{remaining}} listed structures are in the listed historic landscape of Lever Park, created for William Lever by Thomas Mawson in the early 20thcentury or the country park. They include an unfinished replica of Liverpool Castle, overlooking the Lower Rivington Reservoir, and Rivington Gardens, the remains of Lever's private gardens, which include the Pigeon Tower, a large folly and former dovecote. The landmark tower built in 1733 for Robert Andrews <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Rivington Pike.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's statue {{at the end}} of Worcester High Street stands {{facing the}} cathedral, only yards from where his father's shop once stood. Another statue of the {{composer}} by Rose Garrard <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer {{in the shadow of the}} Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth. From 2007 the Elgar notes were phased out, ceasing to be legal tender on 30 June 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the gate, and pivots it when it <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|E

25|$|The typical {{location}} for VMS deposits <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the felsic volcanic sequence, within {{a sequence of}} volcaniclastic tuffaceous epiclastics, cherts, sediments or perhaps fine tuffs which are usually related to the underlying volcanics. The hangingwall to the deposit is broadly related to a more mafic sequence of volcanic rocks, either andesite (examples being Whim Creek & Mons Cupri, Western Australia or Millenbach, Canada), or basalt (Hellyer, Tasmania) or absent or sediments only (Kangaroo Caves, Western Australia).|$|E
25|$|The {{wood was}} likely much larger originally, as extracting iron from its ore {{required}} great quantities of charcoal. Metal extraction also {{requires a lot}} of water to wash the ore, a need fulfilled with the Branlin river flowing {{at the foot of the}} hill. The ore also needed to be crushed, and that was done in appropriate mills. Lastly, extracting iron required air to activate the bloomeries and the site <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a hill, well exposed to winds.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} bowling footwork styles {{use either}} a four- or five-step approach beginning 8 to 16 feet (2.4 to 4.8 meters) behind the foul line. In the typical four-step approach, {{the ball is}} {{pushed away from the}} body in step one; step two has the ball {{at the bottom of the}} backswing; in step three, the ball <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the backswing; finally, the ball is swung forward and delivered in conjunction with the fourth and final slide-step. In a five-step approach, the bowler takes an initial timing step before pushing the ball away from the body.|$|E
25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies {{will not be able}} to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit.|$|E
25|$|The line passes {{beneath the}} A39 road from Truro to Falmouth at Treluswell, Four Cross, and then shortly enters Penryn which grew {{up at the}} head of a large inlet of the River Fal. Penryn railway station <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the town, and we have views across the town to St Gluvias on the other side of the harbour. The station is eight and a quarter miles from Truro, and the {{platform}} shelter is identical to the one at Perranwell. Beyond the station the line passes over the Collegewood Viaduct. The last timber railway viaduct in Cornwall was here, but was replaced by this stone structure on 22 July 1934.|$|E

25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> this scale (hardness 10), {{as it is}} one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond nanorods, are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the microscope or loupe) by its highly lustrous facets (described as adamantine) which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond simulant to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|E
25|$|The Tilaco mission {{contains}} a choir area, baptistery, sacristy, cloister, chapels and gardens. The mission {{was built on}} a mostly leveled incline. Its bell tower is separate {{from the body of}} the church, but connected through the baptistery. Structurally, the tower functions as a buttress. It is the smallest and simplest of the five missions. The main doorway is guarded by sculptures of Saints Peter and Paul. There are two niches with Saint Joseph with the Child Jesus and one with an image of the Immaculate Conception. Between the two, there is a dove, which represents the Holy Spirit. Above this, there is a rhomboid choir window marked by curtains supported by two angels. An image of Francis of Assisi <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the portal surrounded by cherubs, some of which are reclined against pre-Hispanic style eagles. There are also four columns, each one supported by a mermaid. Mermaids are not often seen in colonial architecture and it is not known why they were included. Much {{of the rest of the}} portal is decorated with flowers and vines along with a representation of the cord Franciscans use to tie their habits.|$|E
