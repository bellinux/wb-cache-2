25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: fraud in the <b>factum</b> and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the <b>factum</b> focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

40|$|Prostitution, sex in {{exchange}} for consideration, has never been illegal in Canada; however, activities surrounding prostitution have been criminalized in the Criminal Code. These prohibited activities include: working indoors (s. 210 keeping a common bawdy house), providing services to sex workers (s. 212 (1) (j) living off of the avails of prostitution), and communicating in public {{for the purposes of}} prostitution (s. 213). In 2007 two former and one current sex worker, Terri Jean Bedford, Valerie Scott and Amy Lebovitch challenged the constitutionality of the above laws, arguing that they increased sex workers’ vulnerability to harm. Six years later on June 13 th, 2013 the Supreme Court of Canada heard the landmark case Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford. Prior to hearing the case, the Supreme Court Justices read the submitted <b>factums</b> outlining the arguments of the appellants, respondents, and their interveners. The final decision was released on December 22 nd, 2013 and the unanimous decision to strike down all three laws was made. Using a discourse analysis inspired by Michel Foucault, this study ‘unpacks’ the meanings that are constituted within the <b>factums</b> submitted to the Supreme Court regarding the people who engage in sex work and the institution of prostitution. The convergences and divergences within the discourses are presented. Drawing on these findings, while applying the work of Wedeking’s (2010) strategic legal framing alongside the governmentality perspective of risk, the tensions surrounding risk and choice are further explored. In doing so, the relationship between risk (taking/avoiding) and choice (making) is teased out. In this thesis I argue that risk and choice are strategically framed in the submitted <b>factums</b> to demonstrate the (un) constitutionality of Canada’s prostitution laws. Furthermore, I argue that both the appellants and respondents agree that risk avoidance is an acceptable self-governance strategy for sex workers, however they diverge on what they consider to be acceptable risk avoidance measures. The conclusion of this study discusses the decision of Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford to strike down the three prostitution laws and the subsequent introduction of the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act...|$|R

Because anthropomorphic representations of the Trinity were discouraged by the Church during the Middle Ages (Dennys, 95), the Shield of the Trinity quickly became popular. It was often used in decorating not only churches, but theological manuscripts and rolls of arms. An early example from William Peraldus' Summa Vitiorum (c. 1260) shows a knight battling the seven deadly sins with this shield. A variation included with the shields of arms in Matthew Paris' Chronica Majora (c.1250–1259) adds a cross between the center and bottom circles, accompanied by the words [...] "v'bu caro f'm est" [...] (verbum caro <b>factum</b> est, [...] "the word was made flesh"; [...] ) (Dennys, 94).|$|E

40|$|English {{abstract}} Legal and Criminological Aspects of Intentional Homicide JUDr. Jaromír Hořák The study explores selected {{problems on}} the subject of intentional homicide that has key importance in terms of differentiation of these delicts through the introduction of privileged and qualified <b>factums</b> of crime. Until recently, all cases of intentional homicide except of infanticide were considered "murder" under article No. 219 of the former Czechoslovak criminal code of 1961. The new Czech penal code passed in 2009 replaces this uniformed conception by a terminological bipartition of "murder" and a less grave crime of "manslaughter", defined as committed in an excusable state of sudden strong mental agitation or as motivated by previous damnable actions of the victim. Furthermore, the new penal code returns to the traditional distinction between "simple murder" and "murder committed with aforethought or after premeditation". The study endeavors to present a comprehensive commentary on the elements of this new system of homicide law. Therefore it examines the cases of intentional killings committed in a state of a strong non- pathological affect (agitation), further it deals with the issue of provocation of the offender by the victim and eventually it concentrates on the qualifying criteria of premeditation [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Extract: The {{principles}} of good advocacy {{do not change}} in terms of written submissions. It remains fundamental that your arguments be clear and concise. Lengthy and convoluted submissions will not impress the judge. Increasingly the courts are looking for written materials to augment any oral arguments. The courts in Australia {{for a long time}} resisted the move towards written argument. They followed the English practice. Sir Harry Gibbs described the practice in the High Court of receiving written outlines of argument, which were to be no more than three pages in length, {{at the start of the}} appeal hearing. 1 That has now changed. The practice in the High Court is now to receive written submissions in advance and these are to be no more than 20 pages in length. 2 Australia is moving towards the North American practice, which places far more emphasis on written material for all matter of hearings - not just appeals. It is common in North America for written briefs to be provided on motion hearings, written arguments to be provided at trials and written <b>factums</b> are required on appeals...|$|R
500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an express trust is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot create a trust of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to create a trust, it will be held voidable, and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est <b>factum</b> {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as they no longer have control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their memorandum of association or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E

For the literary Satanists, Satan was depicted as benevolent and sometimes heroic figure, with these more sympathetic portrayals proliferating in the art and poetry of many romanticist and decadent figures.

2500|$|At {{the diet}} of Besançon in October 1157, the legates {{presented}} to Frederick I {{a letter from}} Adrian IV which alluded to the beneficia or [...] "benefits" [...] conferred upon the Emperor, and the German chancellor translated this beneficia in the feudal sense of the presentation of property from a lord to a vassal (benefice). Frederick was infuriated by the suggestion that he was dependent on the Pope, and in the storm which ensued the legates were glad to escape with their lives, and the incident at length closed with {{a letter from the}} Pope, declaring that by beneficium he meant merely bonum <b>factum</b> or [...] "a good deed," [...] i.e. the coronation.

2500|$|Last Gospel. The celebrant usually {{goes to the}} Gospel side of {{the altar}} and reads the Last Gospel. Since the {{promulgation}} of the 1962 Missal, which lists under six headings the occasions when the Last Gospel is omitted, the only passage used, {{with the exception of}} Palm Sunday, is John 1:1-14, in the recitation of which all genuflect at [...] "Et Verbum caro <b>factum</b> est". At low Masses said on Palm Sunday (when palms are not distributed, as they should not be, unless perhaps this is the only Mass on that day) the Last Gospel is the one that is appointed for the ceremony of the blessing of the palms. [...] When earlier editions of the Roman Missal were in use, a Last Gospel was read at every Mass, usually John 1:1-14. When there were two coinciding liturgical days (feasts, ferias or vigils) that each had a proper Gospel (one not found in the common Masses used for the various categories of saints' feast days, such as [...] "common of confessors"), the Gospel appointed for the liturgical day being commemorated was read as the Last Gospel, just as the collect, secret, and postcommunion prayers are commemorated for that day. The exit procession then forms in the following order: crucifer between the two acolytes, the master of ceremonies, and the sacred ministers.|$|E
2500|$|When a {{contract}} is written down, {{there is a}} basic presumption that the written document will conterms of an agreement, and when commercial parties sign documents every term {{referred to in the}} document binds them, unless the term is found to be unfair, the signed document is merely an administrative paper, or under the very limited defence of non est <b>factum.</b> The rules differ in principle for employment contracts, and consumer contracts, or wherever a statutory right is engaged, and so the signature rule matters most in commercial dealings, where businesses place a high value on certainty. If a statement is a term, and the contracting party has not signed a document, then terms may be incorporated by reference to other sources, or through a course of dealing. The basic rule, set out in Parker v South Eastern Railway Company, is that reasonable notice of a term is required to bind someone. Here Mr Parker left his coat in the Charing Cross railway station cloakroom and was given a ticket that on the back said liability for loss was limited to £10. The Court of Appeal sent this back to trial for a jury (as existed at the time) to determine. The modern approach is to add that if a term is particularly onerous, greater notice with greater clarity ought to be given. Denning LJ in J Spurling Ltd v Bradshaw famously remarked that [...] "Some clauses which I have seen would need to be printed in red ink {{on the face of the}} document with a red hand pointing to it before the notice could be held to be sufficient." [...] In Thornton v Shoe Lane Parking Ltd a car park ticket referring to a notice inside the car park was insufficient to exclude the parking lot's liability for personal injury of customers on its premises. In Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v Stiletto Ltd Bingham LJ held that a notice inside a jiffy bag of photographic transparencies about a fee for late return of the transparencies (which would have totalled £3,783.50 for 47 transparencies after only a month) was too onerous a term to be incorporated without clear notice. By contrast in O'Brien v MGN Ltd Hale LJ held that the failure of the Daily Mirror to say in every newspaper that if there were too many winners in its free draw for £50,000 that there would be another draw was not so onerous on the disappointed [...] "winners" [...] as to prevent incorporation of the term. It can also be that a regular and consistent course of dealings between two parties lead the terms from previous dealings to be incorporated into future ones. In Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd the Court of Appeal held that Mr Hollier, whose car was burnt in a fire caused by a careless employee at Rambler Motors' garage, was not bound by a clause excluding liability for [...] "damage caused by fire" [...] on the back of an invoice which he had seen three or four times in visits over the last five years. This was not regular or consistent enough. But in British Crane Hire Corporation Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd Lord Denning MR held that a company hiring a crane was bound by a term making them pay for expenses of recovering the crane when it sunk into marshland, after only one prior dealing. Of particular importance was the equal bargaining power of the parties.|$|E

Nam Divus Augustinus libro [...] quinto Genes, ad liter, cap. 4 et 5 et libro 8, cap. 3, [...] posteriorem partem tradit, dicens, terram in hoc die accepisse [...] virtutem germinandi omnia vegetabilia quasi concepto omnium [...] illorum semine, non tamen statim vegetabilia omnia produxisse. [...] Quod primo suadet verbis illis capitis secundi. In die quo [...] fecit Deus coelum et terram et omne virgultum agri priusquam, [...] germinaret. Quomodo enim potuerunt virgulta fieri antequam [...] terra germinaret nisi quia causaliter prius et quasi in [...] radice, seu in semine facta sunt, et postea in actu producta? [...] Secundo confirmari potest, quia verbum illud germinet terra [...] optimè exponitur potestativè ut sic dicam, id est, accipiat [...] terra vim germinandi. Sicut in eodem capite dicitur crescite [...] et multiplicamini. Tertio potest confirmari, quia actualis [...] productio vegetabilium non tarn ad opus creationis, quam ad [...] opus propagationis pertinet, quod postea <b>factum</b> est. Et hanc [...] sententiam sequitur Eucherius lib. 1, in Gen. cap. 11, et illi [...] faveat Glossa, interli. Hugo. et Lyran. dum verbum germinet [...] dicto modo exponunt. NIHILOMINUS CONTRARIA SENTENTIA TENENDA [...] EST: SCILICET, PRODUXISSE DEUM HOC DIE HERBAM, ARBORES, ET [...] ALIA VEGETABILIA ACTU IN PROPRIA SPECIE ET NATURA. Haec est [...] communis sententia Patrum.--Basil, homil. 5; Exaemer. Ambros. [...] lib. 3; Exaemer. cap. 8,11, et 16; Chrysost, homil. 5 in Gen. [...] Damascene, lib. 2 de Fid. cap. 10; Theodor. Cyrilli. Bedae, [...] Glossae ordinariae et aliorum in Gen.

6000|$|A greater {{quantity}} of historical error has seldom been comprised [...] {{in a single}} sentence. With regard to Thales, the assertion that he [...] considered water as a mere material {{in the hands of}} νοῦς rests on [...] a passage of Cicero de Naturâ Deorum; and whoever will refer to [...] any of the accurate historians of philosophy, will find that they [...] treat this as a mere fancy of Cicero, resting on no authority, [...] opposed to all the evidence; and make surmises as to the manner in [...] which Cicero may have been led into the error. (See Rutter, vol. [...] i., p. 211, 2d ed.; Brandis, vol. i., pp. 118-9, 1st ed.; Preller, [...] Historia Philosophiæ Græco-Romanæ, p. 10. “Schiefe Ansicht, [...] durchaus zu verwerfen;” “augenscheinlich folgernd statt zu [...] berichten;” “quibus vera sententia Thaletis plane detorquetur,” [...] are the expressions of these writers.) As for Anaximenes, he even [...] according to Cicero, maintained, not that air was the material out [...] of which God made the world, but that the air was a god: [...] “Anaximenes aëra deum statuit;” or, according to St. Augustine, [...] that it was the material out of which the gods were made; “non [...] tamen ab ipsis [Diis] aërem <b>factum,</b> sed ipsos ex aëre ortos [...] credidit.” Those who are not familiar with the metaphysical [...] terminology of antiquity, must not be misled by finding it stated [...] that Anaximenes attributed ψυχὴ (translated soul, or life) to [...] his universal element, the air. The Greek philosophers [...] acknowledged several kinds of ψυχὴ, the nutritive, the sensitive, [...] and the intellective.(129) Even the moderns, with admitted [...] correctness, attribute life to plants. As far as we can make out [...] the meaning of Anaximenes, he made choice of Air as the universal [...] agent, on the ground that it is perpetually in motion, without any [...] apparent cause external to itself: so that he conceived it as [...] exercising spontaneous force, and as the principle of life and [...] activity in all things, men and gods inclusive. If this be not [...] representing it as the Efficient Cause the dispute altogether has [...] no meaning.|$|E

In Germany, two witches who kept an inn made an ass of a young actor,--not always a very prodigious transformation it will be thought by those familiar with the stage. In his new shape he drew customers by his amusing tricks,--voluptates mille viatoribus exhibebat. But one day making his escape (having overheard the secret from his mistresses), he plunged into the water and was disasinized to the extent of recovering his original shape. [...] "Id Petrus Damianus, vir sua aetate inter primos numerandus, cum rem sciscitatus est diligentissime ex hero, ex asino, ex mulieribus sagis confessis <b>factum,</b> Leoni VII. Papae narravit, et postquam diu in utramque partem coram Papa fuit disputatum, hoc tandem posse fieri fuit constitum." [...] Bodin must have been delighted with this story, though perhaps as a Protestant he might have vilipended the infallible decision of the Pope in its favor. As for lycanthropy, that was too common in his own time to need any confirmation. It was notorious to all men. [...] "In Livonia, during the latter part of December, a villain goes about summoning the sorcerers to meet at a certain place, and if they fail, the Devil scourges them thither with an iron rod, and that so sharply that the marks of it remain upon them. Their captain goes before; and they, to the number of several thousands, follow him across a river, which passed, they change into wolves, and, casting themselves upon men and flocks, do all manner of damage." [...] This we have on the authority of Melancthon's son-in-law, Gaspar Peucerus. Moreover, many books published in Germany affirm [...] "that one of the greatest kings in Christendom, not long since dead, was often changed into a wolf." [...] But what need of words? The conclusive proof remains, that many in our own day, being put to the torture, have confessed the fact, and been burned alive accordingly. The maintainers of the reality of witchcraft in the next century seem to have dropped the werwolf by common consent, though supported by the same kind of evidence they relied on in other matters, namely, that of ocular witnesses, the confession of the accused, and general notoriety. So lately as 1765 the French peasants believed the [...] "wild beast of the Gevaudan" [...] to be a loupgarou, and that, I think, is his last appearance.|$|E
