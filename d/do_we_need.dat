And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E

We do not need pity, nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." ...|$|E

500|$|When Mears went to {{audition}} for the role, he was asked, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> an actor {{as opposed to just}} a guy in a mask?" [...] Mears said portraying Jason is similar to Greek Mask Work, in which the mask and the actor are separate entities, and depending on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance. Mears said the energy from the actor's thoughts will be picked up by the camera. He compared his experience behind the camera to a stock car race: he is the driver and the effects team is his pit crew. As he performs, the effects team subtly suggest ways he can give the character more life on camera.|$|E

Tierney stayed with Lewis Gilman & Kynett {{and by the time}} he turned twenty-nine he had become {{president}} and CEO of the public relations division. In 1989, he left Lewis Gilman & Kynett and founded Tierney Group, another public relations company, with just three people.

500|$|Tom Rothman, {{chairman}} of the film's co-financier Fox Filmed Entertainment, described the film's marketing strategy thus: [...] "How are we marketing it? It's Cruise and Spielberg. What else <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to do?" [...] The strategy made sense; coming into the film, Spielberg had made 20 films which grossed a domestic total of $2.8 billion, while Cruise's resume featured 23 films and $2 billion in domestic revenues. With their combined 30% take of the film's box office though, sources such as BusinessWeek's Ron Grover predicted the studios {{would have a hard}} time making the money needed to break even. Despite the outward optimism, as a more adult-oriented, darker film than typical blockbusters, the studio held different box office expectations for the movie than they would a more family friendly film. Entertainment Weekly projected the film would gross $40 million domestic in its opening weekend, and Variety predicted that the high concept storyline would not appeal to children and would render it a [...] "commercial extra-base hit rather than a home run." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{generally}} praised Storm of Zehirs {{use of the}} Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition rules {{with the}} exception of GameSpy, who expressed skepticism of the ruleset in a preview of the game. [...] The game's handling of character death was not well received, [...] despite being more faithful to the pencil and paper version than previous Dungeons & Dragons video games. [...] Unlike Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer where defeated characters would be automatically revived after a battle, Storm of Zehir requires a powerful spell or a [...] "Coin of Waukeen" [...] to resurrect dead allies. [...] Reviewers considered this requirement unforgiving; GameSpy said [...] "This merely forces the player to troop back to town through a zillion meaningless random encounters. This may be [...] "realistic" [...] (whatever that means in a world where players fight against newborn gods and sentient snakes), but it's simply not fun.

He said on his official website in 2007 that he liked portraying Santa's Little Helper because the dog was a [...] "sympathetic" [...] character. Welker has been praised by staff members for his performances on the show. David Mirkin has noted that [...] "he can do anything, and it fits perfectly. You forget you're listening to a guy, and he's a pleasure to work with." [...] Groening has commented that he was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] at doing animal noises. After 1995, Castellaneta voiced Santa's Little Helper on his own while Welker performed other animal noises until his full departure in 2002, when he was denied a pay raise. In the [...] "questions and answers" [...] section on his website, Welker revealed that the reason he stopped performing as Santa's Little Helper was because [...] "The producers thought... 'Hmmm, Dan barks pretty good, and we are already paying him and he seems to like doing the dog thing... why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to pay Welker who comes in here, spends less than an hour, eats all the doughnuts, refuses to come to rehearsals... let's just give the damn dog to Dan!'" ...|$|E
