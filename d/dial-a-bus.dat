The TTC operated its first <b>dial-a-bus</b> services under GO Transit in 1973. In 1975, the first paratransit service, Wheel-Trans, was established by a private operator.

50|$|Transit service {{began in}} Pickering with the Bay Shores <b>dial-a-bus,</b> {{which began in}} 1970-1973. In 2001 Pickering Transit merged with former Ajax Transit to form the Ajax-Pickering Transit Authority (APTA). In 2006, the {{regional}} transit system Durham Region Transit took over operations in the Durham Regional Municipality.|$|E
50|$|Wightbus also {{provided}} school buses, and transported disabled adults to various day care centres {{on behalf of}} the council's social services department. A <b>dial-a-bus</b> service was run over some parts of the island to residents who would be unable to leave their homes to catch a regular service bus.|$|E
5000|$|Regular public {{transport}} {{is limited to}} infrequent bus services to Ellon, New Deer and surrounding villages, though an on-demand <b>Dial-a-bus</b> service is also available.

The fixed route service was operated {{in partnership with}} Oakville Transit, although they never provided services connecting these municipalities.|$|E

50|$|Michigan City {{operates}} a bus service. Officially known as Michigan City Transit, {{it is made}} up of four routes that run on Monday-Saturday. All routes originate at Michigan City Public Library and travel around the city in (largely mono-directional) loops until they return to the library. Route 3 connects to Carroll Avenue South Shore Line station, while other routes connect to the 11th street station. In addition, Route 1 passes near the Amtrak station on the way to Washington Park. Michigan City also {{operates a}} <b>Dial-a-Bus</b> service.|$|E

5000|$|A Telebus , <b>Dial-a-bus</b> , or Dial-a-ride [...] {{service is}} a bus service that {{operates}} in a mode partway between a normal scheduled bus service and a taxi. The academic name for these services is demand responsive transport. Telebuses typically have a scheduled route, but passengers can ring and book a pick-up within an area served by the route, and the bus route is modified to make the pick-up. Drop offs anywhere within the area can also be accommodated. The aim is to extend public transport services {{to the front door}} of all residences, or from any place to any place.|$|E

40|$|New {{formulations}} {{are presented}} for the Travelling Salesman problem, {{and their relationship}} to previous formulations is investigated. The new formulations are extended to include a variety of transportation scheduling problems, such as the Multi-Travelling Salesman problem, the Delivery problem, the School Bus problem and the <b>Dial-a-Bus</b> problem. A Benders decomposition procedure is applied on the new formulations and the resulting computational rocedure is seen to be identical to previous methods for solving the Travelling Salesman problem. Based on the Lagrangean Relaxation method, a new procedure is suggested for generating lagrange multipliers for a subgradient optimization procedure. The effectiveness of the bounds obtained is demonstrated by computational test results. Research supported, in part, by the Office of Naval Research under Contract N 00014 - 75 -C- 0556...|$|E
40|$|In {{a modern}} city {{a wide variety}} of {{transport}} modes are possible, ranging from foot and bicycle, through conventional trains, buses and cars to complex electronic systems like <b>dial-a-bus</b> and personalised rapid transport. Yet in most cities a single mode, the private car, is dominant. This can be seen by comparing the number of trips made by car and public transport, and also by comparing the relative expenditures on and the geographical scope of the different modes. In 1971 the number of private and commercial trips by car in Sydney was 3, 400, 000 per day and the number of daily public transport trips was 1, 400, 000. (1) Total expenditure on public transport in New South Wales for the year 1971 - 72 was $ 307 million. (2) Total government expenditure (local, state and federal) on NSW roads in that year was $ 257 million (3), and private expenditure on cars was about 2. 5 times that amount. Most public transport services are radial, into the city centre, and throughout the whole metropolitan area nearly all cross travel is by car. The main object {{of this paper is to}} examine the causes of this dominance of the car in metropolitan transport. How was our transport system planned and developed? Who made the critical decisions and with what objectives? How did these decisions lead to the present condition of our transport? If we do not know the answers to such questions, it is very difficult to predict the way ahead for our tran sport system and to plan for any significant changes. I have not completed the intricate task of finding the answers. I hope, however, that this paper proves to be a beginning, and will open the way to further discovery...|$|E
