40|$|An {{improved}} interferometer {{is produced}} by modifying a conventional interferometer to include amplitude and/or frequency modulation of a coherent light source at radio or higher frequencies. The phase of the modulation signal can be detected in an <b>interfering</b> <b>beam</b> from an interferometer {{and can be used}} to determine the actual optical phase of the beam. As such, this improvement can be adapted to virtually any two-beam interferometer, including: Michelson, Mach-Zehnder, and Sagnac interferometers. The use of an amplitude modulated coherent tight source results in an interferometer that combines the wide range advantages of coherent interferometry with the precise distance measurement advantages of white light interferometry...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} {{to the details of}} the input variables used for constructing the input feature vector for training the random forests algorithm, Table  1 also shows the variable importance of each input feature obtained by applying the random forests’ property, to observe its dependence on the output variable in the training dataset. From the table, it can be observed that the index of the selected receive filter beam is the most important variable that influences the value of the output variable. This is because the output variable, the MCS selection, is tied to the SINR value of the given terminal n for a given time instance t, which is highly dependent on the receive filter selected to serve the user n. The terminal position is the next most important variable, which itself indicates the expected interference level seen by terminal n when served by a selected transmit beam and receive filter combination by an RRH. The <b>interfering</b> <b>beam</b> indices also considerably influence the output variable, since they are also important in deciding the level of interference seen by terminal n at time t. The assigned terminal ID is the least important parameter, since it only indicates the terminal considered for a given sample instance, and is loosely tied to the output variable, i.e., the MCS selected for serving the indicated terminal.|$|E
40|$|Periodic micro and nano {{structures}} {{are required for}} a variety of different products in micro optics, semiconductors and products with functional surfaces. Today the common approach is standard lithography with numerous processing steps including masking imaging, resist development and subsequent etching. Laser interference structuring is an appropriate solution to provide a manufacturing technology which is able to process polymers as well as semiconductors and metals in a single processing step without any subsequent etching. Based on the theory of interference superposition, the influence of different parameters is theoretically expressed and simulated. In this paper the influence of the phase and the polarization of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> upon the intensity distribution of the electrical fields of the three-beams are theoretically analyzed and experimentally demonstrated. It is demonstrated that in case of coplanar three-beam interference, the phase of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> has strong influence upon the intensity patterns of the interfering field. However, in case of non coplanar three-beam interference, the phase of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> has no influence upon the intensity patterns it just causes a lateral motion of the intensity pattern. By controlling the polarization arrangements of the laser beams, different intensity patterns, like circular holes, circular bumps or rectangular bumps can be generated.

We show that by manipulating the power distribution within the two <b>interfering</b> <b>beams,</b> the OPD value where maximum sensitivity is achieved can be conveniently tuned, as well as the sensitivity variation with OPD. Furthermore, creating a gap between the two beams leads to adjustment of the minimum detectable OPD value, while the widths of the beams determine the maximum detectable OPD value.

40|$|We {{report on}} a simple method to obtain surface {{gratings}} using a Michelson interferometer and femtosecond laser radiation. In the optical setup used, two parallel laser beams are generated using a beam splitter and then focused using the same focusing lens. An interference pattern is created in the focal plane of the focusing lens, {{which can be used}} to pattern the surface of materials. The main advantage of this method is that the optical paths difference of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> is independent of the distance between the beams.

40|$|For the {{fabrication}} of periodic microstructures, a high-precision and highly efficient polarization-controlled three-beam interference technology (PoTBI) has been developed.

An optical setup for PoTBI has been realized and used to generate microstructures in polyimide foil. Micro cavities, micro bumps, eye-like cavities and rectangular columns of hexagonal symmetry and one-dimensional lines are produced. Compared with other multi-beam interference technologies, different surface textures of hexagonal symmetry with the same periodicity can be obtained only by changing the polarization status of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> without changing the geometrical interference setup.

40|$|The {{high-order}} {{harmonic generation}} (HHG), if phase matched, opens {{a unique way}} to produce coherent ultrafast extreme-UV (XUV) or soft x-ray light sources. Here we describe a robust and tunable method for scaling and narrowing the bandwidth of high-order harmonics in different transversal modes based on femtosecond dynamic grating in a gas jet. This technique has potential of self-phase controlled XUV generation by adjusting the intersect angle and the intensity ratio of <b>interfering</b> fundamental <b>beams.</b> The limitations of using high intensity laser fundamental pulses in gas, such as non-negligible the magnetic field which prevents recombination with parent and self-focusing of laser and plasma creation in the generated harmonics beam path which prevents phase matching, can be solved by using dynamic grating generated by the fundamental pulse and/or its harmonic with small intersect angle. The grating pattern introduces a phase modulation in the dipole emission imprint such pattern in the gas medium. As the spatial and temporal behaviors of the grating are closely connected in harmonic generation, by shaping of the spatial profile of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> {{it is possible to}} create a more complex tunable beating pattern as harmonic sources to transfer desired optical information to XUV pulses. In this case, the phase mismatch can be completely compensate by tuning the gas pressure, adjusting the intersect angle as well as intensity ratio of the <b>interfering</b> <b>beams</b> to produce a bright XUV with desired transversal mode.
