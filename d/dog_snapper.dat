60|$|A little <b>dog,</b> named <b>Snapper,</b> {{the same}} who stands on his hind legs, {{appears to be}} a roguish little dog, and the other day he stole one of the servant-girl's shoes, and ran into the street with it. Being pursued, he would lift the shoe in his mouth (while it almost dragged on the ground), and run a little way, then lie down with his paws on it, and wait to be pursued again.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus jocu) is {{a species}} of snapper native to the Atlantic Ocean. It is a commercially {{important}} species, and is popular for display in public aquaria. It {{is also known as}} the dogtooth snapper, pargue, or snuggletooth snapper.|$|E
50|$|The {{mangrove}} snapper can {{be confused}} with the Cubera snapper or black snapper, Lutjanus cyanopterus. Mangrove snapper are typically much smaller than Cubera, but when they are of similar size, the two species can only be distinguished by examining the tooth patch on the inside roof of the mouth. Many specimens caught in Florida, specifically Punta Gorda, are actually misidentified dogtooth or <b>dog</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus jocu. The best way to distinguish between the two species is <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> has a lighter triangle of color with a blue band under the eye and large, sharp fangs in the front (canines), hence its common name. These fangs can deliver a painful bite, even in a small fish. The mangrove snapper feeds mostly on small fishes and crustaceans. It was also observed as systematically waiting under maternal colony of Buffy flower bat for falling bats near the entrances of Lucayan cavern, Bahamas.|$|E
50|$|The band {{returns to}} a nearby motel, {{bringing}} along Rosamond, a young lady from the show. The next day, Maury visits his invalid mother and, along {{with a couple of}} the guys from the band, goes on a hunting trip. He gets into a fistfight with Bob Tally over Maury's <b>dog</b> <b>Snapper,</b> who is not being properly taken care of by Maury's sick mother. After the fight, Maury reluctantly gives Snapper away to Bob, but fires him from the band before returning to the motel.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} red snapper's body is {{very similar}} in shape to other snappers, such as the mangrove snapper, mutton snapper, lane snapper, and <b>dog</b> <b>snapper.</b> All feature a sloped profile, medium-to-large scales, a spiny dorsal fin, and a laterally compressed body. Northern red snapper have short, sharp, needle-like teeth, but they lack the prominent upper canine teeth found on the mutton, dog, and mangrove snappers.This snapper reaches maturity at a length of about 39 cm. The common adult length is 60 cm, but may reach 100 cm. The maximum published weight is 84 lb, and the oldest reported age is 100+ years.Coloration of the northern red snapper is light red, with more intense pigment on the back. It has 10 dorsal spines, 14 soft dorsal rays, three anal spines and eight to 9 anal soft rays. Juvenile fish (shorter than 30-35 cm) can also have a dark spot on their sides, below the anterior soft dorsal rays, which fades with age.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus jocu Bloch and Schneider 1801) and {{mahogany}} snapper (Lutjanus mahogoni Cuvier 1828) are infrequently caught snappers {{in the southeastern}} U. S. primarily occurring off of southern Florida. The species were opportunistically sampled from commercial and recreational fisheries in the southeastern U. S. from 1979 to 2015. Fish were aged (56 <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> and 54 {{mahogany snapper}}) by counting opaque zones on sectioned sagittal otoliths. Otoliths of both species were easily interpretable and agreement between readers was acceptable. Analysis of otolith edge-type revealed that annuli formed between May and July on both species. <b>Dog</b> <b>snapper</b> ranged from 200 – 837 mm total length (TL) and ages 2 – 33, while mahogany snapper ranged from 270 – 416 mm TL and ages 2 – 18.

40|$|AbstractLutjanus analis (Mutton snapper), Lutjanus jocu(Dog snapper) and Mycteroperca bonaci (Black grouper) are reef fishes of high {{commercial}} value, and {{are among}} the principal exploited reef resources on the eastern and northeastern coast of Brazil. These species share the habit of forming transient spawning aggregations, predictable in time and space, which leaves them particularly vulnerable. The present study aimed to obtain indirect indicators of periods and places of spawning aggregations for these species, based on the exploratory analysis of available data on commercial catches and fishing efforts in Southern Bahia. Line fishery landings data were monitored in 12 locations in the region, and catch records of Mutton snapper (1320 landings), <b>Dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (654) and Black grouper (1162) were analyzed. A strategy was developed for exploratory analysis of monthly CPUE variation and individual distribution of CPUE per trip. The results showed the occurrence of aggregations in 26 specific sites, with values of relative abundance far above the annual mean, during spring/summer and autumn/winter. The occurrence of these anomalous catches was validated with the fishermen responsible for respective fishing trips. Additional {{studies are needed to}} confirm spawning activity at these sites. Analysis of inter-annual variation suggests a decreasing trend in relative abundance of Black grouper and Mutton snapper, possibly associated with unregulated fishing of spawning aggregations...|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} a {{comparative study of}} the inhibitory effect of several plant protein sources on digestive proteases of two snappers: yellow snapper (Lutjanus argentiventris) and <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus novemfasciatus). Seed extracts did not affect gastric proteases whereas they significantly inhibit intestinal proteases. Inhibition of alkaline proteases showed that pancreatic proteases of L. argentiventris were more sensitive to seed protease inhibitors than those of L. novemfasciatus. Legume seeds showed the highest inhibitory capacity on alkaline proteases causing inhibition higher than 50 % in total proteolytic activity. Protease inhibition on digestive extracts was assessed using different relative concentration of seed extracts and represented by constructing dose response curves. In {{order to reduce the}} inhibitory effect, seed extracts were acid-treated before the inhibition assay. Results showed that acid treatment did not affect the inhibitory capacity of seeds on alkaline proteases in both species. However, when the action of gastric enzymes was simulated on seed extracts, the inhibitory capacity was reduced significantly, mainly in the case of L. novemfasciatus. The responses of fish enzymes to heat-treated seed extracts were also tested. Only higher temperatures were capable of reducing the inhibitory capacity of seed, with the specific response to the snapper species. The use of biochemical assays allows us to quantify the action of inhibitors on total proteolytic activity. In addition, zymograms obtained by substrate-SDS-PAGE provided qualitative information about th...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the age and}} growth of the <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus jocu), caught {{in the region of}} Abrolhos Bank, Bahia State, by the fishermen from coastal communities of Prado, Alcobaça, Caravelas, and Nova Viçosa. We examined 205 sectioned otoliths of fish caught by harpoon, longline, hand line, and gill nets (14. 5 to 79. 5 cm fork length). The formation of each ring was considered annual. The sectioned otoliths showed between 0 and 29 rings. Nearly half of the analyzed specimens had between 0 and 7 rings (88 of 205). Fish caught with nets in the estuarine region were the juvenile, while fish caught with lines and harpoons were the oldest. Two von Bertalanffy growth models were fitted to length-at-age data: one assuming constant variance of length-at-age (SVB) and another assuming constant coefficient of variation, i. e. variance increasing as a function of average size (CVVB). The SVB estimates were Loo = 87. 82 cm, K = 0. 10, and t 0 = - 1. 486 and the CVVB estimates were Loo = 117. 60 cm, K = 0. 06, and t 0 = - 2. 470. The largest Loo values estimated by the CVVB model are supported by reports from the literature of larger animals occurring in the deeper outer shelf of Abrolhos Bank. Growth parameters were also estimated for males and females separately (SVB model) (Loo = 92. 80 cm, K = 0. 099, and t 0 = - 1. 680 for males, and Loo = 82. 10 cm, K = 0. 105, and t 0 = - 1. 570 for females) ...|$|E

A distribuição batimétrica de cinco espécies de peixes do Nordeste Brasileiro foi examinada através da análise da composição da captura e e abundância relativa (CPUE) mostrou que, de uma maneira geral, o comprimento furcal aumentou com a profundidade e que algumas espécies dominaram a captura de acordo com a faixa de profundidade. A cioba, L. analis, a guaiúba, L. chrysurus, e o dentão, L. jocu foram principalmente pescados na zona intermediaria (20 - 80 m) enquanto ariocó, L. synagris e o pargo olho-de-vidro L. vivanus ocorreram respectivamente nas águas rasas e nas águas profundas. Cada tipo de embarcação do Nordeste do Brasil explota preferencialmente uma combinação particular de espécies e uma determinada amplitude de tamanho. A dinâmica da frota do nordeste do Brasil é tecnologicamente heterogênea e determina a composição da captura.

40|$|Quantitative {{evaluations}} of early-life connectivity in reef fish populations {{are critical to}} the effective identification and management of productive nearshore nurseries. The present study evaluates the use of natural markers in assessing both trophic and population connectivity for three species of snappers (Lutjanidae) utilizing back-reef nurseries in southern Belize: <b>dog</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus jocu), gray snapper (L. griseus), and schoolmaster (L. apodus). Juvenile snappers were collected from inner- and outer-shelf nurseries across two latitudinal regions in the Belize coastal lagoon in order to: (a) utilize tissue stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(15) N) as dietary tracers to characterize organic matter production across the continental shelf, and (b) evaluate the utility of otolith stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(18) O) as a marker of nursery origin. Isosource models (based on tissue ?^(13) C and ?^(15) N) revealed distinct differences in food web dynamics between pristine nurseries and those influenced by heavily impacted watersheds. Juvenile snappers at pristine sites were supported by organic matter derived from both benthic sources (seagrass/benthic diatoms) and the water column (phytoplankton), while sites impacted by anthropogenic runoff displayed significant decreases in water column-based production during the rainy season, accompanied by significantly decreased juvenile snapper condition (muscle lipid content) for all three species. These results emphasize the high land-sea connectivity in this system and indicate that runoff from impacted watersheds {{has the potential to}} disrupt trophic production in nurseries across the continental shelf. Otolith stable isotopes (?^(13) C and ?^(18) O) appeared to be strongly related to salinity gradients within the Belize coastal lagoon and, consequently, showed considerable promise in identifying juvenile snappers to shelf position. Both isotopes were both consistently enriched in snappers from outer-shelf nurseries, where freshwater influence was minimal, and ?^(18) O was enriched in the northern sampling region, which receives lower amounts of freshwater input compared to the south. Although individuals of each species were classified to specific study sites with varying success (58 - 81 %), discrimination to shelf position was consistently high for all species (74 - 92 %), indicating that otolith ?^(13) C and ?^(18) O may be useful in determining relative contribution rates of juvenile snappers produced at inner- and outer-shelf nurseries within tropical back-reef systems...|$|E
