40|$|Developing {{policies}} to address lake eutrophication {{requires an understanding}} of the relative contribution of different nutrient sources and of how lake and catchment characteristics interact to mediate the source–receptor pathway. We analysed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data for 101 New Zealand lakes and related these to land use and edaphic sources of phosphorus (P). We then analysed a sub-sample of lakes in agricultural catchments to investigate how lake and catchment variables influence the relationship between land use and in-lake nutrients. Following correction for the effect of co-variation amongst predictor variables, high producing grassland (<b>intensive</b> <b>pasture)</b> was the best predictor of TN and TP, accounting for 38. 6 % and 41. 0 % of variation, respectively. Exotic forestry and urban area accounted for a further 18. 8 % and 3. 6 % of variation in TP and TN, respectively. Soil P (representing naturally-occurring edaphic P) was negatively correlated with TP, owing to the confounding effect of pastoral land use. Lake and catchment morphology (zmax and lake : catchment area) and catchment connectivity (lake order) mediated the relationship between <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> and in-lake nutrients.

We {{study how}} endemic, native and {{introduced}} arthropod species richness, abundance, diversity and community composition vary between four different habitat types (native forest, exotic forest of Cryptomeria japonica, semi-natural pasture and <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture)</b> and how arthropod richness and abundance change with increasing {{distance from the}} native forest in adjacent habitat types in Santa Maria Island, the Azores. Arthropods were sampled in four 150 m long transects in each habitat type. Arthropods were identified to species level and classified as Azorean endemic, single-island endemic (SIE), native, or introduced. The native forest had the highest values for species richness of Azorean endemics, SIEs and natives; and also had highest values of Azorean endemic diversity (Fisher’s alpha). In contrast, the <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> had the lowest values for endemic and native species richness and diversity, but the highest values of total arthropod abundance and introduced species richness and diversity. Arthropod community composition was significantly different between the four habitat types. In the semi-natural pasture, the number of SIE species decreased with increasing distance from the native forest, and in the exotic forest the abundance of both Azorean endemics and SIEs decreased with increasing distance from the native forest. There is a gradient of decreasing arthropod richness and abundance from the native forest to the <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture.</b> Although this study demonstrates {{the important role of}} the native forest in arthropod conservation in the Azores, it also shows that unmanaged exotic forests have provided alternative habitat suitable for some native species of forest specialist arthropods, particularly saproxylic beetles...|$|E

40|$|International audienceForest {{ecosystems}} of Brazilian Amazonia are {{cleared to}} allow livestock production. Deforestation contributes significantly {{to climate change}} and losses of biodiversity. Degradation by scrubs reduces pasture productivity after a few years, thus leading farmers to deforest new areas. For this reason, sustaining cultivated pastures is of major importance for cattle farms. <b>Intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> management techniques have been proposed to the farmers, with little success so far. Our hypothesis is that these techniques are not implemented by farmers due to weak work organisation. Here, we assessed the diversity of forage system work of dairy farms in a municipality on the Transamazon Highway. We analysed factors explaining the adoption of <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> management techniques. We monitored seven dairy farms, with a specific work assessment approach to build synthetic qualification variables and an interview of 29 dairy farmers to characterise the diversity of forage system work. Our results show four tasks related to their technical content: pasture maintenance, renovation, land maintenance and exceptional work. The total duration of work is variable, from 17 to 278 days per year, depending on the technical management choices. Some farmers are autonomous in carrying out the work, but in several cases, wage workers may contribute significantly, from 33 to 100 %. We identified five types of forage system work. They oppose very simplified technical management carried out in autonomy by the family workforce to intensive techniques based on {{a high level of}} delegation to permanent wage workers. The results show that forage system work is related to the technical management choices and distribution of work between farmers and permanent wage workers. Forage system work also depends on the amount of work dedicated to the dairy herd, the role of milk in the farm, and the weight of other farming and non-farming activities. Finally, <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> management techniques are linked to a high quantity of work with pasture maintenance, hired permanent workers and specialised dairy farms...|$|E

The intensity of pasturing was different: 78 cattle on the first, 106 on the second and 162 on the third pasture. The beetles were collected using pitfall traps baited by 1. 5 litres of fresh cattle dung. The traps were located on each pasture. Altogether 3 traps were used per each pasture.

40|$|The tall-grass prairies, {{wetlands}} and forests {{that dominated the}} Iowa landscape {{have been replaced by}} annual row-crops and grass pastures that occupy more than 90 % of the landscape today. Because of these changes, water reaches streams and gullies much faster and has led to incised streams and an extensive growth of gully networks. Stream and gully banks are major contributors of non-point source sediment and phosphorus. Reducing these pollutants is a priority to maintaining healthy streams. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare stream and gully bank soil and phosphorus losses under different land-use practices in three Iowa regions. The hypothesis was that stream and gully bank erosion would decrease in the following order: annual row-cropped fields, continuous <b>pastures,</b> rotational <b>pastures,</b> <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>pastures,</b> pastures with cattle excluded from the stream, grass filters and riparian forest buffers. In rotational and intensive rotational grazing the pastures are divided into paddocks. One paddock is grazed at a time while the others are rested. To estimate soil losses for each treatment, erosion pins were used for stream and gully bank rates and all the severe eroding site areas were measured. Estimating soil total phosphorus concentrations from the stream and gully bank faces allowed us to estimate phosphorus losses. In addition phosphorus concentrations in riparian areas, stream and gully beds and loafing areas were measured. Riparian forest buffers, grass filters and pastures with the cattle excluded from the stream had the lowest soil and phosphorus losses from stream and gully bank erosion. Row-cropped fields had high soil and phosphorus losses, similar to the continuous pastures. There are some indications that moving to rotational and <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>pastures</b> soil and phosphorus losses could decrease bank soil and phosphorous losses compared to continuous pastures. The effectiveness of rotational and <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>pastures</b> will depend on the number of paddocks along the stream, stocking rates, grazing in the stream paddocks during wet periods and how well landowners follow the pasture system guidelines. Finally cow entry points and loafing areas should require special attention because they can be major sources of soil and phosphorus to streams...|$|R

However, the processes through which it acts on pollinator diversity and composition are still poorly understood, especially in highly vulnerable island ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the distribution, abundance, richness {{and composition of}} flower-visiting insects to assess their response to land-use change in Terceira Island (Azores). Flower-visiting insects were sampled over 2 years using a standardised protocol along 50 transects across five different habitats corresponding to a land-use gradient. Insect species were classified as indigenous or exotics. We assessed changes across habitats using multiple diversity indices, species abundance distribution models (SAD) and species composition metrics (β-diversity), along with plant species composition. We observed that indigenous flower-visiting insects were dominant, both in abundance and species richness, across the entire land-use gradient. Species diversity varied only slightly across the gradient. SADs were lognormal in all habitats, with very few truly common and rare flower-visiting insects and a prevalence of species of intermediate abundance. Species replacement was significantly higher mainly between the two most contrasting habitats (i. e. natural forests and <b>intensive</b> <b>pastures)</b> but was significantly correlated with species replacement of host plant species across the gradient. Our results revealed that the Azorean flower-visiting insect communities were highly simplified across the entire gradient with little difference between habitats.

A period of <b>intensive</b> <b>pasturing</b> during the ‘Little Ice Age’ between ad 1346 and ad 1595 is suggested by coprophilous fungal spores, {{as well as by}} pollen indicators of grazing, by the diatom-inferred total phosphorus, by geochemistry and by documentary data. The subsequent re-oligotrophication of the lake took about 88 years, as determined by the timelag between the decline of coprophile fungal spores and the restoration of pre-eutrophic nutrient conditions. According to previous studies of latewood densities from the same region, cold summers around ad 1600 limited the pasturing at this altitude. This demonstrated the socio-economic impact of a single climatic event. However, the variance partitioning between the effects of land use and climate, which was applied for the whole core, revealed that climate independent of land use and time explained only 1. 32 % of the diatom data, while land use independent of climate and time explained 15. 7 %.

Fertiliser application rates during the winter rye grass season (April-October) frequently surpass 300 kg N ha - 1 year - 1 yet the fate of much of the applied N is uncertain. The high (> 1200 mm year - 1) and intensive rainfall and the proximity to environmentally sensitive areas such as the Great Barrier Reef make losses in surface water run-off of particular interest to the industry. Two run-off plots (416 m 2) were installed on an intensively irrigated and fertilised rye-grass/kikuyu pasture rotation near Gympie, Queensland and monitored over three (1 June to 31 May) measurement years. Runoff was measured using a tipping bucket and nutrients collected via an automated sampler. Runoff and losses were largest during the 2012 - 13 season when five of the nine runoff events over the measurement period occurred and total runoff exceeded 480 mm, corresponding to 37 % of the annual rainfall. Total N load was dominated by NO 3 –, with largest losses during a four day, 448 mm rain event in January 2013 following an extended dry period resulting in 280 mm of runoff and 16. 5 kg ha - 1 of N losses.

The bulk density of fresh casts was higher (+ 17 %, P 0. 05) to that of the surrounding soil, in the savanna and the pasture, respectively. Fresh cast aggregates were of larger size than bulk soil aggregates (about + 70 % in both systems, P< 0. 05).

However, integration of data from the range of scales has been limited. This paper presents a conceptual model of P transfer that incorporates landscape effects and reviews the research relating to P transfer at a range of scales {{in light of this}} model. The contribution of inorganic P sources to P transfer is relatively well understood, but the contribution of organic P to P transfer is still relatively poorly defined. Phosphorus transfer has been studied at laboratory, profile, plot, field, and watershed scales. The majority of research investigating the processes of P transfer (as distinct from merely quantifying P transfer) has been undertaken at the plot scale. However, there is a growing need to integrate data gathered at a range of scales so that more effective strategies to reduce P transfer can be identified. This has been hindered by the lack of a clear conceptual framework to describe differences in the processes of P transfer at the various scales. The interaction of hydrological (transport) factors with P source factors, and their relationship to scale, require further examination. Runoff-generating areas are highly variable, both temporally and spatially. Improvement in the understanding and identification of these areas will contribute to increased effectiveness of strategies aimed at reducing P transfers in runoff. A thorough consideration of scale effects using the conceptual model of P transfer outlined in this paper will facilitate the development of improved strategies for reducing P losses in runoff.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the coupling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, it is necessary to understand C and N-use efficiencies of microbial soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. While important controls of those efficiencies by microbial community adaptations have been shown at the scale of a soil pore, an abstract simplified representation of community adaptations is needed at ecosystem scale. Therefore we developed the soil enzyme allocation model (SEAM), which takes a holistic, partly optimality based approach to describe C and N dynamics at the spatial scale of an ecosystem and time-scales of years and longer. We explicitly modelled community adaptation strategies of resource allocation to extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM decomposition. Using SEAM, we explored whether alternative strategy-hypotheses can have strong effects on SOM and inorganic N cycling. Results from prototypical simulations and a calibration to observations of an <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> site showed that the so-called revenue enzyme allocation strategy was most viable. This strategy accounts for microbial adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount of different SOM resources, and supported the largest microbial biomass under a wide range of conditions. Predictions of the holistic SEAM model were qualitatively similar to precitions of the SYMPHONY model, which explicitly represents competing microbial guilds. With adaptive enzyme allocation under conditions of high C/N ratio of litter inputs, N that was formerly locked in slowly degrading SOM pools was made accessible, whereas with high N inputs, N was sequestered in SOM and protected from leaching. The findings imply that it is important for ecosystem scale models to account for adaptation of C and N use efficiencies in order to represent C-N couplings. The combination of stoichiometry and optimality principles is a promising route to yield simple formulations of such adaptations at community level suitable for incorporation into land surface models...|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} marsh plants, {{the numbers of}} this species have been dwindling for quite some time. The main causes are the entry of {{nitrogen}} via fertilizer, drying out of the habitat, and <b>intensive</b> conversion to <b>pasture.</b> The western marsh orchid does not react so sensitively to changes in its habitat as for example the early marsh orchid, Dactylorhiza incarnata. It is usually {{the last of the}} native orchids to disappear. This tolerance makes it a still relatively common species.|$|R

There is considerable interest {{in the loss of}} these complex ecosystems and the associatedbiodiversity, due to <b>intensive</b> agriculture, <b>pasture</b> abandonment, pollution, and climate change. Thesehabitats can constitute models, in terms of landscape management and plant community composition,that can be successfully duplicated in anthropized areas in order to mitigate the adverse effects of humanactivities in the city and enhance the biotic component. The idea is to revegetate urban degraded soilwith aesthetically pleasing wildflower meadows, while increasing biodiversity, creating a habitat andconserving the local flora, with low management cost. In urban sites seed mixtures containing a highpercentage of native and exotic herbaceous flowering plants have been successfully used. We review thefactors affecting the ecological aspects of species-rich herbaceous communities in disturbed environ-ments and urban landscape design. The review addresses the use of these communities in urban greenareas for recreation, socialization and environmental education...|$|R

40|$|Three teams {{consisting}} of 2 to 5 persons each play the game. Each team represents a farm. Each team decides jointly on its strategy. In annual meetings in winter, the farm teams jointly discuss, evaluate and decide {{on how to}} proceed and actions to be taken. The farms make use of three different pasture areas (village pasture, <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture</b> and summer pasture) for grazing their livestock. The carrying capacity of each pasture area is different and varies according to the season. In each season, the farms have to decide on how many livestock units to graze on which pasture. Overgrazing and pasture degradation occur if {{the total number of}} livestock units exceeds the carrying capacity of a specific pasture area. Overgrazing results in a reduction of pasture productivity. To diversify and improve their livelihood strategy farms can make individual investments to increase productivity at the farm level, eg. in fodder production or in income generating activities. At the community level, collective investments can be made which may influence livestock and household economy, e. g. rehabilitate and improve pasture productivity, improve living conditions on remote pastures etc. Events occurring {{in the course of the}} game represent different types of (risk) factors such as meteorology, market, politics etc. that may positively or negatively influence livestock production and household economy. A sustainable management of pastures requires that farms actively regulate the development of their herds, that they take measures to prevent pasture degradation and to improve pasture productivity, and that they find a balance between livestock economy and other productive activities. The game has a double aim: a) each farm aims at its economic success and prosperity, and b) the three farm teams jointly have to find and implement strategies for a sustainable use of pasture areas...|$|E
40|$|Planting the {{perennial}} biomass crop Miscanthus in the UK could offset 2 – 13 Mt oil eq. yr− 1, contributing up to 10 % of current energy use. Policymakers need assurance that upscaling Miscanthus production {{can be performed}} sustainably without negatively impacting essential food production or the wider environment. This study reviews {{a large body of}} Miscanthus relevant literature into concise summary statements. Perennial Miscanthus has energy output/input ratios 10 times higher (47. 3 ± 2. 2) than annual crops used for energy (4. 7 ± 0. 2 to 5. 5 ± 0. 2), and the total carbon cost of energy production (1. 12 g CO 2 -C eq. MJ− 1) is 20 – 30 times lower than fossil fuels. Planting on former arable land generally increases soil organic carbon (SOC) with Miscanthus sequestering 0. 7 – 2. 2 Mg C 4 -C ha− 1 yr− 1. Cultivation on grassland can cause a disturbance loss of SOC which is likely to be recovered during the lifetime of the crop and is potentially mitigated by fossil fuel offset. N 2 O emissions can be five times lower under unfertilized Miscanthus than annual crops and up to 100 times lower than <b>intensive</b> <b>pasture.</b> Nitrogen fertilizer is generally unnecessary except in low fertility soils. Herbicide is essential during the establishment years after which natural weed suppression by shading is sufficient. Pesticides are unnecessary. Water-use efficiency is high (e. g. 5. 5 – 9. 2 g aerial DM (kg H 2 O) − 1, but high biomass productivity means increased water demand compared to cereal crops. The perennial nature and belowground biomass improves soil structure, increases water-holding capacity (up by 100 – 150 mm), and reduces run-off and erosion. Overwinter ripening increases landscape structural resources for wildlife. Reduced management intensity promotes earthworm diversity and abundance although poor litter palatability may reduce individual biomass.

A group of seven dairy cows kept on an <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>pasture</b> system and machine milked twice a day by two familiar handlers were exposed to a thorough clinical examination for three consecutive days. Behavioural data {{before and after the}} procedure were analyzed by ANOVA. The behaviour of all the cows during the procedure indicated strong aversiveness.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} biochar incorporation into the soil on the soil-atmosphere exchange of the greenhouse gases (GHG) from an <b>intensive</b> subtropical <b>pasture.</b> For this, we measured N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 emissions with high temporal resolution from April to June 2009 in an existing factorial experiment where cattle feedlot biochar had been applied at 10 t ha- 1 in November 2006. Over the whole measurement period, significant emissions of N 2 O and CO 2 were observed, whereas a net uptake of CH 4 was measured. N 2 O emissions {{were found to be}} highly episodic with one major emission pulse (up to 502 µg N 2 O-N m- 2 h 1) following heavy rainfall. There {{was no significant difference in}} the net flux of GHGs from the biochar amended vs. the control plots. Our results demonstrate that intensively managed subtropical pastures on ferrosols in northern New South Wales of Australia can be a significant source of GHG. Our hypothesis that the application of biochar would lead to a reduction in emissions of GHG from soils was not supported in this field assessment. Additional studies with longer observation periods are needed to clarify the long term effect of biochar amendment on soil microbial processes and the emission of GHGs under field conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from traditional to intensive farming, aimed at large–scale production, has rapidly altered agricultural landscapes, {{leading to the}} reduction and fragmentation of natural habitats and to the consequent loss of biodiversity. Herpetofauna is seriously threatened by agriculture intensification worldwide, but less is known about its distribution in agro–ecosystems, especially at field scale. We analysed reptile abundance and diversity in eight agricultural and semi–natural land uses, and inside vegetated buffer strips interspersed among fields. Interestingly, most reptiles were recorded in the buffer strips while <b>intensive</b> crops and <b>pastures</b> hosted just one lizard species. Richness of individuals and species increased when strips were connected to semi–natural areas, independently of their width and vegetation structure. In view of our results, that highlight the role of minor landscape features {{for the presence of}} vertebrates in intensive agro–ecosystems, we recommend the implementation of buffer strips among the measures for vertebrate conservation in agricultural landscapes...|$|R
