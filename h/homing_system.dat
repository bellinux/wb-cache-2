2500|$|The IAI Harop (or IAI Harpy 2) is a {{loitering}} munition {{developed by}} the MBT division of Israel Aerospace Industries. It is an anti-radiation drone that can autonomously home in on radio emissions. Rather than holding a separate high-explosive warhead, the drone itself is the main munition. This SEAD-optimised loitering munition is designed to loiter the battlefield and attack targets by self-destructing into them. [...] The drone can either operate fully autonomously, using its anti-radar <b>homing</b> <b>system,</b> or it can take a man-in-the-loop mode. If a target is not engaged, the drone will return and land itself back at base.|$|E
2500|$|With its Ford-produced PJ31 pulsejet powerplant, the JB-2 {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{attempts}} at a powered cruise missile for potential usage in America's arsenal. The JB-2 had nothing more advanced than what the Germans had already placed aboard their V-1 for guidance, while the indigenously-designed, unpowered U.S. Navy's Bat anti-ship glide bomb already had an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>system</b> in its nose to locate its intended maritime targets. The first launch of a JB-2 took place at Eglin Army Air Field in Florida by the 1st Proving Ground Group on 12 October 1944. [...] In addition to the Eglin group, a detachment of the Special Weapons Branch, Wright Field, Ohio, arrived at Wendover Field, Utah, in 1944 with the mission of evaluating captured and experimental systems, including the JB-2. Testing was from a launch structure just south of Wendover's technical site. The launch area is visible in aerial imagery (...) [...] [...] Parts of crashed JB-2s are occasionally found by Wendover Airport personnel.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as high-thrust solid-fuel rockets {{became a}} reality in the mid-1950s, the USAF began {{to develop a new}} solid-fueled Bomarc variant, the IM-99B Bomarc B. It used a Thiokol XM51 booster, and also had {{improved}} Marquardt RJ43-MA-7 (and finally the RJ43-MA-11) ramjets. The first IM-99B was launched in May 1959, but problems with the new propulsion system delayed the first fully successful flight until July 1960, when a supersonic KD2U-1/MQM-15A Regulus II drone was intercepted. Because the new booster took up less space in the missile, more ramjet fuel could be carried, increasing the range to [...] The terminal <b>homing</b> <b>system</b> was also improved, using the world's first pulse Doppler search radar, the Westinghouse AN/DPN-53. All Bomarc Bs were equipped with the W-40 nuclear warhead. In June 1961, the first IM-99B squadron became operational, and Bomarc B quickly replaced most Bomarc A missiles. On 23 March 1961, a Bomarc B successfully intercepted a Regulus II cruise missile flying at 100,000ft, thus achieving the highest interception in the world up to that date.|$|E

2500|$|The IAI Harop has a loiter (flying) time of 6 {{hours and}} a range of 1000km both ways. It is a larger version of the IAI Harpy and is {{launched}} from ground- or sea-based canisters, but can be adapted for air-launch. The Harop can either operate fully autonomously, or it can take a man-in-the-loop mode, being controlled by a remote operator. The Harop features two guidance modes: it can either home in on radio emissions by itself with its anti-radar <b>homing</b> <b>system,</b> or the operator can select static or moving targets detected by the aircraft's electro-optical sensor. This latter mode allows the Harop to attack radars that are presently shut down and therefore not providing emissions for the aircraft to automatically home in on. [...] If a target is not engaged, the drone will return and land itself back at base. [...] The small drone (with a Radar Cross Section similar to a large bird) can evade SAMs and radar detection systems which are designed to target much larger aircraft or to intercept fixed-trajectory missiles.|$|E

Such {{missiles}} have several advantages over other missile guidance techniques; they do not trigger radar warning receivers (conferring a measure of surprise), and {{they can have a}} longer range (since the battery life of the seeker head is the limiting factor to the range of most active radar <b>homing</b> <b>systems).</b>|$|R

5000|$|There {{are other}} {{variants}} under development. One has an upgraded motor to boost range at high altitudes {{to as much}} as 120-160 km; it is known as the RVV-AE-PD. The 'PD' stands for Povyshenoy Dalnosti, which in Russian means [...] "improved range". This variant has been test-fired and uses a solid-fuel ramjet engine. Its range puts it in the long-range class and is equivalent in range to the AIM-54 Phoenix. In another version of the R-77, a terminal infrared homing seeker is offered. This is in line with the Russian practice of attacking targets by firing pairs of missiles with different <b>homing</b> <b>systems.</b> This complicates end-game defensive actions for the target aircraft, as it needs to successfully defeat two <b>homing</b> <b>systems.</b> This method of attack may not always be available as IR seekers typically have less range and less resistance to poor weather than radar seekers, which may limit the successful use of mixed seeker attacks unless the IR missile is initially directed by radar or some other means.|$|R
5000|$|Infrared <b>homing</b> <b>systems</b> can be decoyed with flares {{and other}} {{infrared}} countermeasures. Acoustic <b>homing</b> and detection <b>systems</b> used for ships are also susceptible to countermeasures. United States warships use Masker and PRAIRIE (PRopellor AIR Ingestion and Emission) systems to create small air bubbles around a ship's hull and wake to reduce sound transmission. [...] Surface ships tow noisemakers like the AN/SLQ-25 Nixie to decoy homing torpedoes. [...] Submarines can deploy similar acoustic device countermeasures (or ADCs) from a 3-inch (75-mm) signal launching tube. [...] United States ballistic missile submarines could deploy the Mark 70 MOSS (MObile Submarine Simulator) decoy from torpedo tubes to simulate a full size submarine. Most navies additionally equip surface ships with decoy launchers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>homing</b> <b>systems</b> for torpedoes are {{generally}} acoustic, though {{there have been}} other target sensor types used. A ship's acoustic signature is not the only emission a torpedo can home in on: to engage U.S. supercarriers, the Soviet Union developed the 53-65 wake-homing torpedo. As standard acoustic lures can't distract a wake homing torpedo, the US Navy has installed the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense on aircraft carriers that uses a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo to home in on and destroy the attacking torpedo.|$|R

5000|$|The great {{advantage}} of an active radar <b>homing</b> <b>system</b> is that it enables a [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] mode of attack, where the attacking aircraft is free to pursue other targets or escape the area after launching the missile.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-active <b>homing</b> <b>systems</b> {{combine a}} passive radar {{receiver}} on the missile {{with a separate}} targeting radar that [...] "illuminates" [...] the target. Since the missile is typically being launched after the target was detected using a powerful radar system, {{it makes sense to}} use that same radar system to track the target, thereby avoiding problems with resolution or power, and reducing the weight of the missile. Semi-active radar homing (SARH) {{is by far the most}} common [...] "all weather" [...] guidance solution for anti-aircraft systems, both ground- and air-launched.|$|R
5000|$|Targeting radars use {{the same}} {{principle}} but scan a much narrower area far more often, usually several times a second or more, where a search radar might scan more widely and less frequently. Missile lock-on describes the scenario where a targeting radar has acquired a target, and the fire control can calculate a path for the missile to the target; in semi-active radar <b>homing</b> <b>systems,</b> this implies that the missile can [...] "see" [...] the target that the targeting radar is [...] "illuminating". Some targeting radars have a range gate that can track a target, to eliminate clutter and electronic countermeasures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A missile <b>system</b> {{employed}} with <b>homing</b> guidance {{can sense}} and detect the target, guide itself to steer towards the target by generating commands {{to its own}} control surfaces. Proportional Navigation (PN) as an effective guidance law is implemented in most of all the <b>homing</b> guidance <b>systems.</b> Since its inception PN {{is one of the}} best proven techniques which has been used extensively in past and present <b>homing</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper presents overall survey of the performance evaluation of the Proportional Navigation which is very effective for the missile to intercept the low-maneuvering target. Here two simulation examples are presented. In the first one, even though if the missile is launched in the wrong direction by a heading error of 50 deg, the PN can enable missile to hit the target. The second is to observe how PN was effective to hit a maneuvering target. Also it is explained why linearization of engagement model results in performance projections with consistent accuracy to make it worthwhile for developing design relationships. In order to show how Proportional Navigation work fairly well against maneuvering and constant velocity target, this paper presents a simulation of a two-dimensional missile target engagement geometry in LabVIEW for a point mass missile and target...|$|R
