In a “Light on”, the signal is recorded as soon as the excitation pulse is switched on, allowing to observe the build-up of charges on the electrode after the start of excitation. “Light off” measurements show how the charges decay after the pulse is switched off.|$|R

40|$|The {{existing}} {{temperature sensors}} using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{are limited by}} low sensitivity, complicated processes, or dependence on microscopy to observe the experimental results. Here we report the fabrication and successful testing of an ionization temperature sensor featuring non-self-sustaining discharge. The sharp tips of nanotubes generate high electric fields at relatively low voltages, lowering the work function of electrons emitted by CNTs, and thereby enabling the safe operation of such sensors. Due to the temperature effect on the electron emission of CNTs, the collecting current exhibited an exponential increase with temperature rising from 20 °C to 100 °C. Additionally, a higher temperature coefficient of 0. 04 K− 1 was obtained at 24 V voltage applied on the <b>extracting</b> <b>electrode,</b> higher than the values of other reported CNT-based temperature sensors.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the combined effects of grain morphology and electron trapping on the transient response of photoelectrons moving through the TiO 2 grains in a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline solar cell using a multitime-scale random walk Monte Carlo model. Our use of a multi-time-scale approach enables us to simulate transport for electrons moving through spherical connected grains in a three-dimensional (3 D) voided network {{and look at the}} effect of the size of interparticle boundaries on carrier dynamics. We can also address similar times to those over which measurements are taken, namely, 0. 1 ins. These times are long because of deep traps in the TiO 2 grains. The grains have 2 -fold connectivity in one dimension (linear chains) or 4 -fold or 6 -fold connectivity in three dimensions and traps with an exponential distribution of energies. Photoelectrons are generated by a light pulse of short duration. The spatial distribution of the photogenerated electron density from this pulse either has a uniform profile or is peaked on the electrolyte side. We show that the constrictions at the grain necks slow the electrons, making trapping more likely and hence further delaying their passage to the <b>extracting</b> <b>electrode.</b> By comparing our results for 4 -fold and 6 -fold coordinated particles on a cubic lattice with 2 -fold coordinated particles on linear chains, we show that transport is slowed in the former case due to the additional paths available to the electrons in the 3 D network. We also find that the charge and current transients cannot be fit to an analytical solution of the continuum equations with an effective diffusion coefficient even at long times. Therefore, caution must be exercised when attempting to fit experimental transient data with an effective diffusion coefficient...|$|E

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} focuses on the {{development}} of electrodes for top-illuminated organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and studies how their complex interactions with other layers affect the device. The development of a novel substrate electrode based on an Al | Cu bilayer capped with an ultra-thin Al layer is initially shown. This electrode offers the rare combination of high reflectivity, a very low work function of ~ 3. 2 eV, and high stability towards oxidation. Photoelectron spectroscopy studies shows that an Al capping layer of ~ 1 nm in thickness is sufficient to block oxidation of the underlying Cu, which is remarkable given that the self-limiting oxide thickness for bulk Al is ≥ 2 nm. This promising substrate electrode is used to elucidate a new design rule for top-illuminated bulk-heterojunction OPVs. It is shown that for OPVs utilising high performance donor-type organic semiconductors in conjunction with a low work function electron <b>extracting</b> <b>electrode,</b> a barrier to hole-extraction spontaneously forms at the donor | electron-extracting electrode interface, blocking unwanted hole-extraction and negating the need for a hole-blocking layer, which simplifies the device architecture. This electrode design rule is underpinned by studies of the interfacial energetics with five widely used solution processed organic semiconductors as well as device based investigations. A novel organo-molybdenum oxide bronze is also developed which combines the function of wide band-gap interlayer for efficient hole-extraction with the role of a metal electrode seed layer, enabling the fabrication of highly transparent, low-sheet-resistance silver window electrodes for top-illuminated OPVs. Additionally, preliminary results relating to the fabrication of a model nanostructured reflective electrode are shown. This is designed to investigate the extent to which absorption of light can be enhanced in a top-illuminated OPVs by texturing the reflective substrate electrode...|$|E

Because the exciton diffusion length in PCBM is too small, excitons generated in PCBM decay before reaching the donor-acceptor interface. This result has implications for most {{state of the art}} organic solar cells, since all of the most efficient devices use fullerenes as electron acceptors.

30|$|One of {{the methods}} to provide MNs {{electric}} function is to coat the MN with electrochemical components. As {{a result of the}} development in micro fabrication technology, MN configurations of biocompatible materials are typically achieved using relatively simple methodologies such as mold casting [34 – 37] and drawing lithography [38, 39]. However, these methods are not suitable for conductive materials including metals compared to removal machining including MEMS processes. Furthermore, an electrochemical interface should be realized at the interface between MN-based electrodes and biological fluids. For this reason, many studies focus on the coating of MNs with conductive materials represented by Au, Pt, and Ag/AgCl as the WEs, counter electrodes (CEs), and reference electrodes (REs), respectively, in order to enable an MN to function as an electrochemical electrode. In this methodology, metal [40 – 46], epoxy [47 – 49], SU- 8 [50 – 53], and polymer [53 – 59] MNs are coated with metal layers using electroplating or vapor deposition.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that if two metal {{electrodes}} are immersed in a microwave induced plasma, under certain conditions, a DC potential difference develops across the electrodes, and a DC current flows through a resistor externally connected to the electrodes. This phenomenon suggests a method of microwave-to-DC energy conversion. Experimental investigations were made using mainly a commercial neon indicator lamp inserted into a waveguide and irradiated by a microwave signal of frequency 2. 45 GHz. It was found that the magnitude of extracted current and its polarity could be changed by adjusting the impedance of the RF load of the lamp. Under optimal conditions, the lamp was ignited at about 0. 5 W of incident microwave power, and 2 mA DC current into 500 Ohms DC load was obtained at 10 W of incident microwaves. A theoretical model of the process consistent with the experimental data is proposed. It is based on the existence of a nonuniform microwave electric field distribution between <b>extracting</b> <b>electrodes</b> and the formation of unequal plasma sheaths around electrodes. Numerical computation of the microwave electric field distribution for the particular structure of the NE- 2 lamp is presented in the dissertation. The resultant field {{has been found}} to be highly nonuniform, and the position of its maximum has been determined to vary while adjusting the RF load reactance. Such a nonuniform field produces a gaseous plasma characterized by an adequately nonuniform distribution of particle temperature and concentration. If the microwave electric fields at electrode surfaces are not equal, charged particles of the plasma diffuse toward the electrodes at different rates. This gives rise to different plasma sheaths around the electrodes, and when the external DC circuit is open, a difference in plasma sheath potentials appears across the electrodes. When the DC circuit is loaded, there is a flow of electrons through the external circuit from the high field electrode to the low field electrode. This process explains the origin of the extracted DC current. The value of the extracted current is determined by the microwave electric field distribution, geometry of the electrodes and discharge chamber, and properties of the gas used. The conclusion of this work is that microwave-to-DC conversion by a microwave induced plasma is possible. Although the power handling capacity and the energy conversion efficiency of the NE- 2 lamp and other laboratory-built structures were not satisfactory, some design criteria have been developed to improve both of them...|$|R

The field of organic photovoltaics has developed rapidly over the last 2 decades, and small solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 13 % have been demonstrated.

40|$|Organic {{photovoltaic}} (OPV) devices {{based on}} semiconducting polymers and small molecules {{allow for a}} low cost alternative to inorganic solar cells. Recent developments show power conversion efficiencies as high as 10 - 12 %, highlighting the potential of this technology. Nevertheless, further improvements are necessary to achieve commercialization. To a large extent the performance of these devices is dictated by their ability to extract the photo-generated charge, which {{is related to the}} charge carrier mobility. Various time-resolved and steady-state techniques are available to probe the charge carrier mobility in OPVs but often lead to different mobility values for one and the same system. Despite such conflicting observations it is generally assumed that charge transport in OPV devices can be described by well-defined charge carrier mobilities, typically obtained using a single steady-state technique. This thesis shows that the relevance of such well-defined mobilities for the charge separation and extraction processes is very limited. Although different transient techniques probe different time scales after photogeneration, they are mutually consistent as they probe the same physical mechanism governing charge motion – gradual thermalization of the photo-generated carriers in the disorder broadened density of states (DOS). The photo-generated carriers gradually lose their excess energy during transport to the <b>extracting</b> <b>electrodes,</b> but not immediately. Typically not all excess energy is dissipated as the photo-generated carriers tend to be extracted from the OPV device before reaching quasi-equilibrium. Carrier motion is governed by thermalization, leading to a time-dependent carrier mobility that is significantly higher than the steady-state mobility. This picture is confirmed by several transient techniques: Time-resolved Terahertz Spectroscopy (TRTS), Time-resolved Microwave Conductance (TRMC) combined with Transient Absorption (TA), electrical extraction of photo-induced charges (photo-CELIV). The connection between transient and steady-state mobility measurements (space-charge limited conductivity, SCLC) is described. Unification of transient opto-electric techniques to probe charge motion in OPVs is presented. Using transient experiments the distribution of extraction times of photo-generated charges in an operating OPV device has been determined and found to be strongly dispersive, spanning several decades in time. In view of the strong dispersion in extraction times the relevance of even a well-defined time-dependent mean mobility is limited. In OPVs a continuous ‘percolating’ donor network is often considered necessary for efficient hole extraction, whereas if the network is discontinuous, hole transport is thought to deteriorate significantly, limiting device performance. Here, it is shown that even highly diluted donor sites (5. 7 - 10 %) in a buckminsterfullerene (C 60) matrix enable reasonably efficient hole transport. Using transient measurements it is demonstrated that hole transport between isolated donor sites can occur by long-range hole tunneling (over distances of ~ 4  nm) through several C 60 molecules – even a discontinuous donor network enables hole transpor...|$|R

It is defined as the countering of the traction on the lead by a sheath. A sheath of slightly larger diameter is passed over the lead to a point about 1 cm from the heart wall. Traction is applied on the lead, pulling the myocardial wall {{to the edge of the}} sheath, which counters the traction. Because only the scar tissue is present between the sheath and the heart wall, cardiac tissue is not in jeopardy...|$|R
