40|$|Decommissioning of {{a nuclear}} {{facility}} comprises not only actual dismantling but also, above all, management of the resulting residual materials <b>and</b> waste. Siemens <b>Decommissioning</b> Projects (DP) in Hanau {{has been involved in}} this task since 1995 when the decision was taken to <b>decommission</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantle</b> the Hanau Fuel Fabrication Plant. Due to the decommissioning, large amounts of contaminated steel scrap have to be managed. The contamination of this metal scrap can be found almost exclusively in the form of surface contamination. Various decontamination technologies are involved, as there are blasting and wiping. Often these methods are not sufficient to meet the free release limits. In these cases, SIEMENS has decided to melt the scrap at Siempelkamp's melting plant. The plant is licensed according to the German Radiation Protection Ordinance Section 7 (issue of 20. 07. 2001). The furnace is a medium frequency induction type with a load capacity of 3. 2 t and a throughput of 2 t/h for steel melting. For safety reasons, the furnace is widely operated by remote handling. A highly efficient filter system of cyclone, bag filter and HEPA-filter in two lines retains the dust and aerosol activity from the off-gas system. The slag is solidified at the surface of the melt and gripped before pouring the liquid iron into a chill. Since 1989, in total 15, 000 t have been molten in the plant, 2, 000 t of them having been contaminated steel scrap from the decommissioning of fuel fabrication plants. Decontamination factors could be achieved between 80 and 100 by the high affinity of the uranium to the slag former. The activity is transferred to the slag up to nearly 100 %. Samples taken from metal, slag and dust are analyzed by gamma measurements of the 186 keV line of U 235 and the 1001 keV line of Pa 234 m for U 238. All produced ingots showed a remaining activity less than 1 Bq/g and could be released for industrial reuse...|$|R
40|$|Decommissioning and dismantlement {{of nuclear}} power plants (NPP) present a final phase of the nuclear power plant {{lifetime}} and essential part of an effective nuclear safety culture. While some countries are implementing nuclear exit strategies and other building new nuclear power plants or prolonging their lifetimes, decommissioning of facilities is imminent. This paper gives a short overview on <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantling</b> strategies and techniques as {{an introduction to the}} applicability of radioactive metal waste recycling and reuse. General estimations suggest that majority of the waste mass resulting from <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantling</b> is radiologically unrestricted material. Remaining one-third is the radioactive material with different ranges of radioactivity. To present radioactive metal scrap recycling in practice, paper addresses estimations on metal waste amounts resulting from decommissioning, use of melting as a possible recycling method (with regard to secondary waste generated) and aspects of environmental and health impacts. Additionally, a best practice example of decommissioning process in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology NPP is given to provide context for possible future decommissioning of NPP Krško. After consideration of available data on decommissioning waste management, the conclusion is that while the decision on decommissioning strategies and technologies is not straightforward but unique to each country, current experiences give important context to complexity and potential of decommissioning and provide a basis for future actions...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aging}} of the nuclear park, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantling</b> of nuclear {{installations}} after their service life is becoming an important issue for the nuclear industry. The radiological characterisation of the equipment and structures present in the reactor and its environment is an essential stage in a decommissioning project since it permits to define and optimize the decommissioning strategy and the disassembling operations. In addition, correct activation estimates are essential for determining the quantity {{and the nature of the}} radiological waste generated during decommissioning. The adoption of efficient dismantling procedures and the optimization of the mass flow going to different waste repositories might reduce substantially the total cost of decommissioning. The present work has been done in the framework of the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> <b>dismantling</b> of the experimental reactor of the University of Strasburg (RUS). A methodology that combines theoretical calculations and direct measurements has been developed for determining the long-term induced activity in the graphite, concrete and materials present in the reactor. After characterisation of the different elements present in the reactor, it is then possible to plan efficiently the disassembling and dismantling of the system and to optimise the mass flow going to different waste repositories. From a scientific perspective, the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental values validates the approach and the methodology used in the present study and tests the consistency and the reliability of the nuclear data used for activation analysis...|$|E

The VEK is scheduled to vitrify approx. 70 m 3 of the highly radioactive liquid waste (HLW) resulting from reprocessing. Site preparation, civil work and component manufacturing began in 1999. The building will be finalized by mid of 2002, hot vitrification operation is currently scheduled for 2004 / 2005. Provisions against damages arising from construction and operation of the VEK {{had to be made}} in accordance with {{the state of the art}} as laid down in the German Atomic Law and the Radiation Protection Regulations. For this purpose, the appropriate analysis of accidents and their external and internal impacts were investigated. During the detailed design phase, a failure effects analysis was carried out, in which single events were studied with respect to the objectives of protection and ensuring activity containment, limiting radioactive discharges to the environment and protecting of the staff. Parallel to the planning phase of the VEK plant a cold prototype test facility (PVA) covering the main process steps was constructed and operated at the Institut fuer Nukleare Entsorgung (INE) of FZK. This pilot operation served to demonstrate the process technique and its operation with a simulated waste solution, and to test the main items of equipment, but was conducted also to use the experimental data and experience to back the safety concept of the radioactive VEK plant. This paper describes the basis of the safety concept of the VEK plant and results of the failure effect analysis. The experimental simulation of the failure scenarios, their effect on the process behavior, and the controllability of these events as well as the effect of the results on the safety concept of VEK are discussed.

In addition, <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> remediation programs have common resources needs that, when identified and fully utilized in an integrated framework, can result in optimizing the use of available resources to achieve radiological risk-based results faster and at lower costs. To achieve this, {{it is necessary that}} the goals of individual <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> remediation activities are aligned and not conflict with each other while costs are minimized and net health, safety, security and environmental benefits are maximized. Managing the <b>decommissioning</b> <b>and</b> remediation activities in an integrated program can result in enhanced environmental conditions, and/or reduced requirements for additional remediation work, both of which impact the effort to achieve the ultimate site remediation objectives. The most important step in this process is the establishment of the site remediation objectives, which principally involves selecting the best re-use option for the site.
