40|$|The Journal of Supply Chain Management (JSCM) is a {{hallmark}} {{in the academic}} field of operations and supply chain management. During the past 50 years, it has contributed substantially to the recognition and adoption of purchasing and supply management (PSM) as an academic and strategic business domain. Having been invited by the JSCM editors to provide some ideas on the future directions of PSM research, the authors discuss {{what can be done}} to further increase both its relevance and rigor. Rigor and relevance in academic research are interconnected. To improve its relevance, the authors argue that <b>future</b> PSM <b>research</b> <b>should</b> better reflect the strategic priorities raised in the contemporary strategic management literature. Next, <b>future</b> PSM <b>research</b> <b>should</b> be much better embedded in a limited number of management theories. Here, stakeholder theory, network theory, the resource-based view of the firm, dynamic capabilities theory, and the relational view could be considered as interesting candidates. Rigor is connected with robustness of academic research designs and projects. To foster its rigor, <b>future</b> PSM <b>research</b> <b>should</b> allow for an increase in the number of replication studies, longitudinal studies, and meta-analytical studies. <b>Future</b> PSM <b>research</b> designs <b>should</b> reflect a careful distinction between informants and respondents and a careful sample selection. When discussing the results of quantitative studies, <b>future</b> PSM <b>research</b> <b>should</b> report on effect sizes and confidence intervals, rather than p-values. Adoption of these ideas would have some important implications for both the academic PSM community and academic journal editors. Keywords: purchasing; supply managemen...|$|R
50|$|Another area of {{potential}} <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> {{delve into the}} notion of silence as the absence of speech (a non-behavior, essentially). The absence of such a behavior is difficult to study than more overt and obvious behavior (Johannesen, 1974). This act has many implications for employee and organizational performance.|$|E
50|$|Gemma Murphy, a {{staff nurse}} at the {{neonatal}} unit of University College London Hospital, suggested that <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> investigate types of passive distraction other than cartoons and movies. Murphy suggested studies comparing {{the effect of}} books, guided imagery, music, and virtual reality video glasses as other forms of passive distraction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> {{be devoted}} {{to the study of}} one’s {{professional}} position in a company and whether this has any effect on the decision to remain silent.

30|$|Considering all the above, <b>future</b> <b>research</b> {{directions}} <b>should</b> include {{extending the}} time horizon {{of the analysis}} as well as devising an experimental method to assess {{the economic impact of}} copyright-intensive industries.|$|R
30|$|To gain {{further insight}} into the {{physiological}} effect of Botox® on the injected gastrocsoleus and Achilles tendon unit, <b>future</b> clinical <b>research</b> <b>should</b> implement a validated 3 -D ultrasound technique [42, 43].|$|R
30|$|Finally, our {{research}} did {{not focus on}} the family and the patient’s perceptions. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> efforts <b>should</b> be directed towards evaluating the impact that an OVP has on patient outcomes and family members.|$|R
50|$|Verschaffel et al. {{explain that}} “adaptive {{expertise}} {{is not something}} that can be trained or taught but rather something that has to be promoted or cultivated.” They further these thoughts by suggesting that <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> be conducted {{over a long period of}} time in order to analyze the results of developing adaptive expertise.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{in support}} of PMT {{has not always been}} rigorously examined; [...] <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> examine the {{effectiveness}} of PMT on the families most at risk, address parental psychopathology as a factor in outcomes, examine whether gains from PMT are maintained in the long-term, and better account for variability in outcomes dependent on practices under [...] "real-world" [...] conditions.|$|E

30|$|Once nation-wide data on {{displacement}} become available, <b>future</b> <b>research</b> thus <b>should</b> try {{to better}} capture the dualistic nature of urban labor markets {{and to identify}} the channels through which institutions impact {{on the behavior of}} displaced workers.|$|R
30|$|Another {{limitation}} in {{this study}} is the use of single item to measure police trust. Although this was not rare in previous literature and is supported by recent findings that Chinese people’s police trust is a single dimension (Sun et al. 2013 a, b), measuring in a single dimension risks simplifying social phenomenon and misunderstanding (Hudson & Kuhner 2010). <b>Future</b> <b>researches</b> <b>should</b> take a multi-dimensional view, such as trust on the basis of procedures and on the basis of results (Tyler & Huo 2002), employing integrated and comprehensive index to measure police trust in China.|$|R
30|$|These {{questions}} are left as open <b>research</b> questions for <b>future</b> <b>research.</b> It <b>should</b> be noted, however, that, {{due to the}} small information gain for the smart meters and the limited usefulness, their interest in revealing template load profiles can be considered small.|$|R
50|$|More {{research}} is needed to find the most effective way of screening for gestational diabetes. Routine screening of women with a glucose challenge test appears to find more women with gestational diabetes than only screening women with risk factors.

50|$|A 2012 study {{identifying}} individual chimpanzees that consistently performed highly {{on cognitive}} tasks found clusters of abilities {{instead of a}} general factor of intelligence. This study used individual-based data and claim that their results are not directly comparable to previous studies using group data that have found evidence for g. The authors propose a <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> test multiple individuals of multiple species {{on a variety of}} tasks to investigate this discrepancy.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} certain {{weaknesses}} and inadequacies of drive theory explanation, social facilitation is argued {{to be in}} need for a more cognitive approach. A more cognitive model constructed in an expectancy theory framework is shown as a plausible alternative explanation for employee performance {{and the effects of}} social facilitation. While there is not much evidence presented by this controversy it is recommended that direction of <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> test this model.|$|E
30|$|<b>Future</b> <b>research</b> work <b>should</b> use post- 2014 input–output data, {{gradually}} {{include all}} the Eurozone (or even the European Union) economies, incorporate explicitly both the direct and indirect taxation sides of the fiscal system and explore {{the effects of the}} actual internal devaluation policies on the multiplier processes.|$|R
30|$|However, the Centre Berlin for <b>Futures</b> <b>Research</b> {{learned from}} these problems. A policy paper from 1975, {{composed}} {{by the new}} deputy chairperson Rainer Mackensen, a sociologist, regarded the task of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> as doing the spadework for political decision-making {{in the interests of}} the people. It conducted research, he continued, on possible developments, the extent to which they could be evaluated vis-à-vis various objectives and the extent to which they could be influenced by public decisions. Improving the life of many seemed to be much more important than the “impressive demonstration of technical capacity”. For this, <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> use tangible social scientific, systems analytical and technical processes. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> helped to utilise the potential for a “more comprehensive consideration of public decisions” [68 Mackensen]. The distancing from the phase of model simulation is very apparent here. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> was now aimed at integrating systems analysis and modelling into a mixture of methods under the banner of a reflected, socially-orientated understanding of the “discipline”. This understanding was pragmatic because it balanced the possibilities and limits of <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> and realistically assessed them.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} certain {{limitation}}s. The first limitation {{is that it}} covers only one sector from knowledge intensive services i.e. IT firms, while knowledge intensive firms have big scope and operate in many areas e.g. consultancy, audit services, accountancy services, marketing consultancy, law firms (Anxo & Storrie 2001; Hislop 2005). Resources limitation restricted us to work on only 25 IT firms, which is a small number within a huge sector. Future researchers should focus on these limitations and overcome it. Future researchers should also focus on all the constructs i.e. organizational entrepreneurial orientation, leaders’ entrepreneurial orientation and individual’s entrepreneurial orientation. <b>Future</b> <b>researches</b> <b>should</b> find out which of them comes first and how these are related.|$|R
50|$|<b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> seek to link persuasion {{more closely}} with {{impression}} formation, which has previously focused on impressions based on agents' behaviors. An example would be to test if perceived expertise of a communicator is more stable over time and more resistant to counter-factual evidence if {{it is based on}} systematic processing than when it is based on a short description. Research has revealed that two-sided messages might not only be more persuasive but might also enhance the perceived credibility of a communicator.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{although}} behavioural criteria for mental time travel have been put forward and nonverbal tests have been proposed, current research has not yet provided a sufficient demonstration of mental time travel in animals that demonstrates flexibility. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> focus on this component of episodic-like memory in order to demonstrate that animals are not only able to form what-where-when memories, but that they can bring together these components into an integrated framework and then modify this information later on.|$|E
50|$|Measuring {{usability}} of web authentication {{systems will}} allow for formal evaluation of a web authentication system and determine the ranking of the system relative to others. While {{a lot of research}} regarding web authentication system is currently being done, it tends to focus on security and not usability. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> be evaluated formally for usability using a comparable metric or technique. This will enable the comparison of various authentication systems, as well as determining whether an authentication system meets a minimum usability benchmark.|$|E
30|$|The case example {{illustrates}} {{why it is}} {{not acceptable}} that some futures studies simply present a selection of recent facts (developments, trends, weak signals…) that justify a particular future without taking into account similar facts that point in another direction. According to our interpretation, these types of one-sided justifications do not deserve the name ‘futures research’ and even less the name ‘scientific <b>futures</b> research’. <b>Futures</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> always {{be based on the}} ‘whole picture‘of relevant futures. The validation of the ‘whole picture’ is also {{a solution to the problem}} mentioned by Grienitz et al. [15]. According to them “regarding all possible developments that may be relevant for a problem, each development has an infinitesimal probability of coming true”.|$|R
30|$|In {{this review}} {{we have shown}} that the {{vectorial}} charge transfer within the photosynthetic organisms initiated by light is assured in a system organized hierarchically from molecules to molecular complexes. The energy of light which is captured in the form of redox free energy of cofactors can be used for useful work either wiring out the electron in electric circuits or reducing chemical equivalents. This can be a basis of constructing artificial light-energy converting molecular devices like sensing element of bio-hybrid device for biosensor and/or for opto-electronic applications. <b>Future</b> <b>researches</b> <b>should</b> aim to find the most efficient energy converter system (the biological and the inorganic parts), the highest reproducibility and stability of the function.|$|R
30|$|Some {{problems}} in this direction deserve further investigation. It is interesting to study other kinds of high-dimensional impulsive stochastic Lotka-Volterra systems, such as predator-prey system and cooperation system, or introduce a Markov process or Lévy jumps into the impulsive stochastic environment. This our <b>future</b> <b>research</b> work <b>should</b> continue to be concerned about.|$|R
5000|$|Cheek and Schwartz (2016) {{reviewed}} {{the literature on}} the measurement of maximization and proposed that researchers interested in studying individual differences in maximization should measure two constructs: the maximization goal and the maximization strategy. They recommended that researchers use the 7-item Maximizing Tendency Scale published by Dalal et al. (2015) to measure the maximization goal. They also tentatively recommended that researchers use the alternative search subscale of the Maximization Inventory, but noted that <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> continue to refine the measurement of the maximization strategy given psychometric concerns.|$|E
50|$|Based {{on current}} literature, one can {{conclude}} that parental involvement is an extremely important aspect of Mexican American students’ education. The studies demonstrated that parental involvement {{is not limited to}} participating in school activities at the school; instead, parental involvement can be displayed through various forms. There are numerous studies that suggest that parental expectations are associated with the achievement level of Mexican American students. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>should</b> continue to study the reasons why Mexican American students perform better when their parents expect them to do well in school. Furthermore, future research can also look into whether gender influences parental expectations.|$|E

40|$|Based {{on recent}} developments, hydrogen-based {{combustion}} systems have received wide attention, mainly due to increasing awareness of enduring environmental pollutants and restricted access to fossil fuel usage. In the relevant literature, there are evidences {{of the possibilities}} on the partial or total replacement of hydrocarbon fuels with hydrogen in power plants and vehicle engines. However, some challenging issues particularly on hydrogen storage are remained to be resolved. This paper reviews and comments on addressing the effectiveness of hydrogen-enrichment on the engines and burners' performance includes the chemical kinetic analysis, the flame propagation structures {{and the effects of}} inhibitors on global burning velocity of hydrogen-hydrocarbon mixtures in different combustion bombs, chambers and vessels. It is recommended that <b>future</b> <b>researches</b> <b>should</b> aim towards the different application of hydrogen-hydrocarbon i. e. transportation and clean energy carrier...|$|R
