40|$|Abstract. Computational {{modelling}} of {{dissolved gas}} bubble formation and growth in supersaturated solution {{is essential for}} various engineering applications, including <b>flash</b> <b>vaporisation</b> of petroleum crude oil. The common mathematical modelling of bubbly flow only caters for single liquid and its vapour, which is known as cavitation. This work aims to simulate the bubble nucleation and growth of dissolved CO 2 in water across a cavitating nozzle. The dynamics of bubble nucleation and growth phenomenon will be predicted based on the hydrodynamics in the computational domain. The complex interrelated bubble dynamics, mass transfer and hydrodynamics was coupled by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and bubble nucleation and growth model. Generally, the bubbles nucleate at the throat of the nozzle and grow along with the flow. Therefore, only the region after the throat of the nozzle has bubbles. The bubble nucleation rate is significant in between normalised position of 3 and 4, with highest rate at about 1. 2 × 1026 nuclei/m 3 ·s. Similarly, the bubble growth rate is significant in normalised position of 2 and 4, with highest rate recorded at about 0. 09 m/s. This approach {{is expected to be}} useful for various types of bubbly flow modelling in supersaturated condition...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} a new method for estimating the equilibrium <b>flash</b> <b>vaporisation</b> (EFV) distillation curve for petro-leum fractions by using commercial simulators. A commercial simulator {{was used for}} implementing a stationary mo-del for flash distillation; this model was adjusted by using a distillation curve obtained from standard laboratory ana-lytical assays. Such curve {{can be one of}} many types (eg ASTM D 86, D 1160 or D 2887) and involves an experimental procedure simpler than that required for obtaining an EFV curve. Any commercial simulator able to model petroleum can be used for the simulation (HYSYS and CHEMCAD simulators were used here). Several types of petroleum and fractions were experimentally analysed for evaluating the proposed method; this data was then put into a process si-mulator (according to the proposed method) to estimate the corresponding EFV curves. HYSYS- and CHEMCAD-estimated curves were compared to those produced by two traditional estimation methods (Edmister’s and Maswell’s methods). Simulation-estimated curves were close to average Edmister and Maxwell curves in all cases. The propo-sed method has several advantages; it avoids the need for experimentally obtaining an EFV curve, it does not de-pend on the type of experimental curve used to fit the model and it enables estimating several pressures by using just one experimental curve as data...|$|E
40|$|In general all the {{domestic}} aerosol products use hydrocarbon propellants (i. e. butane and propane) {{in which a}} high <b>flash</b> <b>vaporisation</b> provides a good atomisation. However, according to the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference agreed in Paris, these propellants have the adverse climatic effects due {{to the level of}} VOC’s (Volatile Organic Compound) which can lead to greenhouse gases. The agreement has given an impetus to industry to significantly reduce these harmful gases by 2020. Therefore, an alternative energy is required to replace the corresponding hydrocarbon compositions by utilising safer propellant such as compressed gas (i. e. Nitrogen or air). Although the energy of the compressed gas is about 70 times lower than the hydrocarbon propellants. The new valving arrangement which was used in this study, is however introducing the propellant into the valve stem to create ‘bubbly flow’ thus increasing the turbulence prior to the atomiser insert of the actuator. The domestic aerosol products are generally based on either spraying continuously (i. e. airfreshners, body spray, hairspray, insecticide, polish and disinfectant) or on spraying on metered liquid dosage. This investigation has focused on two different aerosol products: (i) Continuous spraying aerosol with matching valve_actuator using compressed gas propellant (ii) Metered aerosol product for airfreshners, using a specially design compressed gas valve with ‘L’ shape actuator and MBU (Mechanical Breakup Unit) inserts which are normally used as wall-mounted devise. The new valve design for continuous spray is performing similar to the current commercial products with hydrocarbon propellants in terms of spraying discharge rate and drop size through the packlife. Nevertheless, {{due to the nature of}} the compressed gas which contains significant level of moistures, as the main propellant, the applied sprays could inevitably be wetter with an increase dryness time which are not acceptable by the consumers. The challenge of this study therefore was to identify a robust solution to reduce the discharge rate to about 0. 30 g/s to 0. 50 g/s and average particle size, Dv 50, 30 µm to 40 µm through the can life. The results found here showed that the low discharge rates with conforming droplet sizes are achievable and thus providing substantive reduction in the wetness of approximately 50...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the pathology of human trauma associated with lightning’s pressure blast wave. Within what range {{is a human}} at risk {{and what are the}} risks? Two theories for the trauma currently exist: the <b>flash</b> moisture <b>vaporisation</b> theory and the sixth mechanism theory. We performed a simple proof-of-concept experiment in a high-voltage laboratory to determine which theory makes for better predictions. The experiment confirmed the existence of a non-discriminant pressure blast wave around a spark in air. The lightning data were compared with the known medical data. Findings may now help explain some of the more curious lightning injury patterns seen on lightning-strike victims. [URL]...|$|R
