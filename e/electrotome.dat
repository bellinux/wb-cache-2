40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} risk factors of fat {{necrosis}} in pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps. METHODS: From May 1998 to December 2005, 82 patients underwent reconstruction of oral and maxillofacial defects with pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps in our hospital. Postoperative fat necrosis of the flaps was occurred in 10 cases. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} investigate {{the risk factors}}. RESULTS: (1) Logistic univariate regression analysis indicated that there was a significant correlation between fat necrosis of pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the following risk facoars: obesity, subcutaneous tissues dissection performed by <b>electrotome,</b> the design of skin island beyond the seventh costal cartilage and smoking. (2) Logistic multivariate regression analysis suggested that there was a significant correlation between fat necrosis of pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and obesity, subcutaneous tissues dissection performed by <b>electrotome,</b> the design of skin island beyond the seventh costal cartilage, whereas there was no significant correlation between fat necrosis of flap and smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, subcutaneous tissues dissection performed by <b>electrotome</b> and the design of skin island beyond the seventh costal cartilage were the risk factors of fat necrosis in pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Rhinophyma is a {{deforming}} {{disorder of}} the nose and considered the most severe stage of rosacea. Since 1950, a large variety of surgical and non-surgical treatments have been adopted to treat it. From January 2014 to June 2016, we treated ten patients (average age: 58 years) affected by moderate (4) and severe (6) degrees of rhinophyma. A nasal skin decortication was performed with a loop-shaped <b>electrotome</b> (Valleylab E 1560 15 x 12 mm) in order to excise the hypertrophic tissue and restore a pleasing appearance to the nose...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} value of {{bronchoscopy}} in the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} primary tracheobronchial amyloidosis (TBA), in order to reduce misdiagnosis rates and improve prognosis. Methods. Clinical data of 107 patients with TBA reported from 1981 to 2015 in China were retrospectively analyzed for clinical features, bronchoscopic manifestations, pathologies, treatments, and outcomes. Results. 105 of 107 TBA patients were pathologically confirmed by bronchoscopy. Main bronchoscopic manifestations of TBA were single or multiple nodules and masses within tracheobronchial lumens; local or diffuse luminal stenosis and obstruction; luminal wall thickening and rigidity; rough or uneven inner luminal walls; congestion and edema of mucosa, which was friable and prone to bleeding upon touch; and so forth. 53 patients were treated with bronchoscopic interventions, like Nd-YAG laser, high-frequency <b>electrotome</b> cautery, freezing, resection, clamping, argon plasma coagulation (APC), microwaving, stent implantation, drug spraying, and other treatments. 51 patients improved, 1 patient worsened, and 1 died. Conclusion. Bronchoscopic biopsy is the primary means of diagnosing TBA. A variety of bronchoscopic interventions have good short-term effects on TBA. Bronchoscopy has important value in the diagnosis, severity assessment, treatment, efficacy evaluation, and prognosis of TBA...|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{detection of}} the effective values of electric {{voltage and current}} from high frequency power generators is a precondition {{for the development of}} smart <b>electrotomes.</b> In this light, an energy detection system based on personal computer (PC) is developed hereby. It senses voltage and current in isolation from generators with transformers, and then the measured values are amplified, filtered, transformed into single-ended signals and converted to RMS. The detected signals are transformed into digital signals through Data Acquisition Card (DAQ) and the data are processed with quadratic fit in Labview. Finally, the controller completes constant power output. The experiment results indicate that the energy detection system can measure the output parameters precisely and the controller can achieve constant power control.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. Treatment of tracheostenosis after {{tracheostomy}} in pediatric {{patients is}} often difficult. Mucopolysaccharidosis is a lysosomal storage disease that may induce obstruction of the airways. Case Presentation. A 16 -year-old male patient underwent long-term follow-up after postnatal diagnosis of type II mucopolysaccharidosis. At 11 years of age, tracheostomy was performed for mucopolysaccharidosis-induced laryngeal stenosis. One week prior to presentation, he {{was admitted to}} another hospital on an emergency basis for major dyspnea. He was diagnosed with tracheostenosis caused by granulation. The patient was then referred to our institution. The peripheral view of his airway was difficult because of mucopolysaccharidosis-induced tracheomalacia. For airway management, a mediastinal tracheostoma was created with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. To maintain the blood flow, the skin incision for the mediastinal tracheal hole was sharply cut without an <b>electrotome.</b> The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was weaned from the ventilator on postoperative day 19. He was discharged 1. 5 months postoperatively. Although he was referred to another institution because of respiratory failure caused by his primary disease 6 months postoperatively, his airway management remained successful for 1. 5 years postoperatively. Conclusion. Mediastinal tracheostomy was useful for treatment of tracheostenosis caused by granulation tissue formation after a tracheostomy...|$|E
40|$|Thoracoscopic segmentectomy is {{technically}} much more meticulous than lobectomy, {{due to the}} complicated anotomical variations of segmental bronchi and vessels. Preoperative three-dimensional computed tomography bronchography and angiography, 3 D-CTBA) could reveal the anatomical structures and variations of the segmental bronchi/vessels and locate the pulmonary nodules, which is helpful for surgery planning. Preoperative nodule localization is of vital importance for thoracoscopic segmentectomy. Techniques involved in this procedure include dissection of the targeted arteries, bronchus and intra-segmental veins, retention of the inter-segmental veins, identification of the inter-segmental boarder with the inflation-deflation method and seperation of intra-segmental pulmonary tissues by <b>electrotome</b> and/or endoscopic staplers. The incision margin for malignant nodules {{should be at least}} 2 cm or the diameter of the tumor. Meanwhile, sampling of N 1 and N 2 station lymph nodes and intraoperative frozen section is also necessary. The complication rate of thoracoscopic segmentectomy is comparatively low. The anatomic relationship between pulmonary segments and lobes is that a lobe consists of several irregular cone-shaped segments with the inter-segmental veins lies between the segments. Our center has explored a method to separate pulmonary segments from the lobe on the basis of cone-shaped principle, and we named it “Cone-shaped Segmentectomy”. This technique could precisely decide and dissect the targeted bronchi and vessels, and anatomically separate the inter-segmental boarder, which ultimately achieve a completely anatomical segmentectomy...|$|E
40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{clinical}} use of Er:YAG laser in the preparation of the teeth with subgingival wedge-shape defects. Methods The data of twenty patients were collected. All patients had at least two teeth with similar subgingival wedge-shape defects. In the control group, cavities were prepared with bur, gingiva was removed by high frequency <b>electrotome.</b> On the contrast, the cavities' preparation and gingivectomy were performed by the laser in the experimental group. The degree of the patients' uncomfortable feel was recorded with VAS, and all patients were followed up for 12 months after surgery. Results The average VAS value of the experimental group (42. 3 ± 12. 1) was statistically lower than that of the control group (61. 1 ± 17. 0) (P＜ 0. 01). One week later, one case in the control group suffered from gingival recession and dental hypersensitiveness. Twelve months later, the margins of two and three cases were unsealed and stained respectively in the experimental group and the control group (P＞ 0. 05). Conclusion Using Er:YAG laser irradiation in cavities' preparation and gingivectomy for the teeth with subgingival wedge-shape defects can significantly reduce the uncomfortable feel during the treatment process, and doesn't adversely affect the qualities of restorations. 目的 评价Er:YAG激光在治疗龈下楔状缺损中的应用. 方法 选择有两个洞缘位于龈下 1 mm～ 2 mm的楔状缺损患牙的患者共 20 例. 对照组以车针预备窝洞,电刀切除牙龈的方法进行牙体预备,实验组以Er:YAG激光预备窝洞并同时切除牙龈的方法完成预备. 以VAS评分记录术中不舒适程度,术后随访 12 个月检查充填体情况. 结果 试验组VAS平均值为 42. 3 ± 12. 1,对照组VAS平均值为 61. 1 ± 17. 0,两组间差异有显著性(P＜ 0. 01). 术后 1 周,对照组有 1 例发生龈退缩. 12 个月,试验组和对照组分别有 2 例和 3 例出现边缘不密合和边缘着色(P＞ 0. 05). 结论 激光行龈下楔状缺损牙体预备的方法可以有效减轻术中不适,对充填体质量无副作用...|$|E
