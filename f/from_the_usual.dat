Fixed positioning means that the element is placed relative to the browser window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> {{tactical}} {{aspects of}} racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered {{the chance to}} eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E

5|$|In Goddess-oriented worship, Vimala (Bimala) is {{regarded}} as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha. Jagannath, a form of the god Vishnu/Krishna (Krishna is generally regarded as an avatar of Vishnu), is worshipped as the Pitha's Bhairava. This is a departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> tradition of Bhairava as a form of Shiva. So, in this temple complex, Vishnu–one of the Hindu trinity–is equated with Shiva, another of the trinity; this is interpreted to convey the oneness of God. In this regard, Vimala - generally associated with Shiva's consort - is also considered as Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. In these cases, a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} protease activity. This differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E
5|$|Moman {{moved away}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> Presley pop {{recordings}} aimed at an established audience. A developer of the Stax Records sound, he incorporated a Memphis sound integrating soul, country, gospel and rural and electric blues. Many arrangements lean {{heavily on the}} rhythm section, with lesser contributions from strings, brass and woodwinds. Arrangers Green Spreen and Mike Leech changed Presley's image on the tracks {{with the addition of}} violas, cellos and French horns. The arrangers intended to blend the tracks for a distinctive sound; the strings are used in counterpoint, rising when the track fades and vice versa. The violas play the same lines as the French horns, with cello used for darker tones. Syncopation was incorporated by bowing.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium in the δ (delta) form {{normally}} {{exists in}} the 310°C to 452°C range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with {{a small percentage of}} gallium, aluminium, or cerium, enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded. The δ form has more typical metallic character, and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium. In fission weapons, the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> δ phase plutonium to the denser α form, significantly helping to achieve supercriticality. The ε phase, the highest temperature solid allotrope, exhibits anomalously high atomic self-diffusion compared to other elements.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began on}} 14 August 1978. The main {{shooting}} was switched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 007 Stage at the Pinewood Studios to France, {{due to high}} taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets designed by Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average). They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in Épinay and Boulogne-Billancourt.|$|E
5|$|Question Time {{was held}} in BBC Television Centre in London, {{for the first time}} in four years, to enable the police to keep order for Griffin's appearance.

The episode featured guest performances by Richard Dreyfuss, Roy Scheider and George Wendt, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E

5|$|After year-long {{expectations}} that the ninth season {{would be the}} series' last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series' creative team {{did not want to}} extend negotiations into the next year, and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} to draw investment {{to the city}} after the hurricane, Galveston never returned to its levels of national importance or prosperity. Development was also hindered by {{the construction of the}} Houston Ship Channel, which brought the Port of Houston into competition with the natural harbor of the Port of Galveston for sea traffic. To further her recovery, and rebuild her population, Galveston actively solicited immigration. Through the efforts of Rabbi Henry Cohen and Congregation B'nai Israel, Galveston became the focus of an immigration plan called the Galveston Movement that, between 1907 and 1914, diverted roughly 10,000 Eastern European Jewish immigrants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> destinations of the crowded cities of the Northeastern United States. Additionally numerous other immigrant groups, including Greeks, Italians and Russian Jews, came to the city during this period. This immigration trend substantially altered the ethnic makeup of the island, as well as many other areas of Texas and the western U.S.|$|E
5|$|During her {{shows at}} the Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey sported a long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
