The antioxidant activity was estimated by DPPH free radical scavenging activity, the total phenolic compounds content, and flavonoid content in <b>freeze</b> <b>dried</b> maquiberry powder of pounds cakes.

25|$|Phase {{separation}} {{allows for}} three-dimensional sub-micrometre fiber scaffolds {{to be created}} {{without the use of}} specialized equipment. The five steps involved in phase separation are polymer dissolution, phase separation and gelation, solvent extraction from the gel, freezing and <b>freeze</b> <b>drying</b> in water. The final product is a continuous fiber network. Phase separation can be modified to fit many different applications, and pore structure can be varied by using different solvents, which can change the entire process from liquid–liquid to solid–liquid. Porosity and fiber diameter can also be modified by varying the initial concentration of the polymer; a higher initial concentration leads to less pores and larger fiber diameters. This technique can be used to create networks of fibers with diameters reaching type I collagen fiber diameters. The fibrous network created is randomly oriented and so far work has not been done to attempt to organize the fibers. Phase separation is a widely used technique for creating highly porous nanofibrous scaffolds with ease.|$|E

This protected the virus during the <b>freeze</b> <b>drying</b> process. After drying the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1–2 [...] days at ambient temperatures.

Freeze-dried P. putida allows easy, inexpensive shipping, handling and high stability of the product. This study was aimed to <b>freeze</b> <b>dry</b> P. putida cells with addition of lyoprotectant.

2500|$|In recent years, the aim {{has been}} to develop more {{permanent}} beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using [...] electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut. [...] There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and infrared. [...] The latter two methods usually remove {{only the tip of}} the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches {{such as the use of}} lasers, <b>freeze</b> <b>drying</b> and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use. [...] The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. [...] The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys. [...] The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate.
