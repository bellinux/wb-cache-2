6000|$|... "No, I do {{not think}} so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{probably}} some more tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes! There's {{never been}} any fal-lal between us about love, and duty, and all that. I think we {{understand}} each other, and that's everything. He knows the comfort of standing well with the heir, and I know the comfort of standing well with the owner." [...] It must be admitted, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a great deal of}} sound, common sense about Bernard Dale.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he remembered}} and walked away, and {{presently}} we marched forward {{as though nothing}} had happened. Only from that moment I {{do not think that}} any of us worried ourselves about the Kalubi and what might befall him. Still, looking back on the thing, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> this excuse to be made for the man. He was mad with the fear of death and knew not what he did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{we are not}} so unwise, after all," [...] she answered, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are more}} happy {{women in the world}} than men." ...|$|R

The affair has been hanging about for more than a year. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} said about it before Ray went abroad. Personally, I think that he is too old. I don't mind saying so to you, because that has been my opinion all along. However, I suppose it is all settled now." ...|$|E

'He {{does not}} remember, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an accident, {{and so he}} was not {{exchanged}} among the prisoners, but he was sent to another place--how do you say?--the country. So, he says, he came here. He does not know how he came. Eh? He was at Chepany'--the man caught the word, nodded, and shivered--'at Zhigansk and Irkutsk. I cannot understand how he escaped. He says, too, {{that he was in the}} forests for many years, but how many years he has forgotten--that with many things. It was an accident; done because he did not apologise to that our colonel. Ah!' ...|$|E

"He {{does not}} remember, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an accident, {{and so he}} was not {{exchanged}} among the prisoners, but he was sent to another place - how do you say? - the country.

6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Leo to me nervously in {{the silence}} that followed, and {{speaking}} in English, [...] "now I wish we were somewhere else, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|At length, {{everything}} being settled, we rode away, {{and reached}} the Bushman's River camp on a certain Saturday afternoon. Here, to my joy, we found all well. Nothing had been heard of Hernan Pereira, while the Zulus, if we might judge from messengers who came to us, seemed to be friendly. Marie, also, had now quite recovered from the fears and hardships which she had undergone. Never had I seen her look so sweet and beautiful as she did when she greeted me, arrayed no longer in rags, but in a simple yet charming dress made of some stuff that {{she had managed to}} buy from a trader who came up to the camp from Durban. Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> another reason for the change, since the light of dawning happiness shone in her deep eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Looking {{back now}} upon those of my {{proceedings}} in 1853 which related [...] to interest upon exchequer bills {{and to the}} reduction of interest [...] on the public debt, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing in the proposals [...] themselves which might not have taken full and quick effect, if [...] they had been made at a time which I may best describe as the time [...] that precedes high-water with respect to abundance of money and [...] security of the market. As respects exchequer bills, I am decidedly [...] of opinion that the rates of premium current for some years before [...] '53 were wholly incompatible with a sound state of things: and the [...] fluctuations then were even greater than since. Still I think that [...] I committed an error from want of sufficient quickness in [...] discerning {{the signs of the}} times, for we were upon the very eve of [...] an altered state of things, and any alteration of a kind at all [...] serious was enough to make the period unfit for those grave [...] operations. It is far from being the first or only time when I have [...] had reason to lament my own deficiency in the faculty of rapid and [...] comprehensive observation. I failed to see that high-water was just [...] past; and that although the tide had not perceptibly fallen, yet it [...] was going to fall. The truth likewise is this (to go a step further [...] in my confessions) that almost all my experience in money affairs [...] had been of a most difficult and trying kind, under circumstances [...] which admitted of no choice but obliged me to sail always very [...] near the wind, and this induced a habit of more daring navigation [...] than I could now altogether approve. Nor will I excuse myself by [...] saying that others were deceived like me, for none of them were in [...] a condition to have precisely my responsibility.|$|E
60|$|I {{am afraid}} {{it was late}} before Mrs. Ray went to sleep that night, and I almost doubt whether Rachel slept at all. It {{seemed to her that}} in the present {{condition}} of her life sleep could hardly be necessary. During the last month past she had envied those who slept while she was kept awake by her sorrow. She had often struggled to sleep as she sat in her chair, so that she might escape for a few moments from the torture of her waking thoughts. But why need she sleep now that every thought was a new pleasure? There was no moment that she had ever passed with him that had not to be recalled. There was no word of his that had not to be re-weighed. She remembered, or fancied that she remembered, her idea of the man when her eye first fell upon his outside form. She would have sworn that her first glance of him had conveyed to her far more than had ever come to her from many a day's casual looking at any other man. She could almost believe that he had been specially made and destined for her behoof. She blushed even while lying in bed as she remembered how the gait of the man, and the tone of his voice, had taken possession of her eyes and ears from the first day on which she had met him. When she had gone to Mrs. Tappitt's party, so consciously alive {{to the fact that he}} was to be there, she had told herself that she was sure she thought no more of him than of any other man that she might meet; but she now declared to herself that she had been a weak fool in thus attempting to deceive herself; that she had loved him from the first,--or at any rate from that evening when he had told her of the beauty of the clouds; and that from that day to the present hour there had been no other chance of happiness to her but that chance which had now been so wondrously decided in her favour. When she came down to breakfast on the next morning she was very quiet,--so quiet that her sister almost thought she was frightened at her future prospects; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no such fear. She was so happy that she could afford to be tranquil in her happiness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad, indeed, to {{hear you}} say so, Albert. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no reason to doubt that you will {{continue}} to gain strength, and will prove worthy of your name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The chances are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will {{be another}} dissolution. If they hold their own against Mr. Monk's motion, then they will pass an Irish Reform Bill. After <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they must dissolve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen to the drums!' said Wali Dad. 'That is {{the heart}} of the people--empty and making much noise. How, think you, will the Mohurrum go this year? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will be trouble.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Joe Boyd, {{responsible}} for the sound mixing at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, {{said in an interview}} with Richie Unterberger in 2007: [...] "I think there were a lot of people who were upset about the rock band, but I think it was pretty split. I think probably more people liked it than didn't. But there was certainly a lot of shouting and a lot of arguing, and a sound which, you can hear in a lot of ballparks. You used to get this confusion when Bill Skowron used to come up to the plate for the Yankees, 'cause his nickname was Moose. And everybody used to go, [...] "MOOSE!" [...] And it sounded like they were booing him. Because you don't get the articulation of the consonant, so that a crowd shouting [...] "more, more, more" [...] at the end of Dylan's three songs sounded very much like booing. I've heard recently a recording of that night, and it doesn't sound to me like booing so much as a roar, just a kind of general hubbub between songs, and during Yarrow's attempt to get Dylan back on stage... I really wouldn't be prepared to say it was 50-50, or two thirds/one third, or whatever. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a segment of the audience, somewhere between a quarter and a half, that was dismayed or horrified or varying degrees of unhappy about what he was doing." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gleeson's themes {{generally}} {{delved into}} the subconscious using literary, mythological or religious subject matter. He was {{particularly interested in}} Jung's archetypes of the collective unconscious.In 1944 Gleeson created The sower referencing Jean-François Millet’s [...] Rather than showing a landscape with a conglomerate main figure, Gleeson presents an eerie twentieth-century view of a desolated one. He commented on the work's genesis {{as a response to}} the trauma of longtime warfare: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> always the hope that it could influence the way people thought about war. That it could alert people to its horrors and prevent it occurring again. You see, I was born during the First World War in 1915, and my earliest experiences were with people who were in that war or remembered the war very vividly, and then, just when I was beginning to paint, the Second World War began. So war became a kind of lurking terror in my mind from infancy through to late adolescence, when it was all building up again for another one. [...] During the 1950s and '60s he moved to a more symbolic perspective, notions of human perfectibility. At this time he increasingly fashioned small psychedelic compositions made using the surrealist technique of decalcomania in the background, to suggest a landscape, and finished by adding a fastidiously painted male nude in the foreground. Many of his paintings had homoerotic undertones, something which reflected on Gleeson's own homosexuality. The ideas for these compositions also saw Gleeson move into collage with his Locus Solus series, where he produced a substantial body of work by placing dismembered photographs, magazine illustrations, diagrams and lines of visionary poetry against abstract pools of ink.|$|E
3000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> some {{customer}} we lost. We {{were looking}} for new projects and I don't know who gave us this contact but the Landkreis [a local government body], they decided to establish an office to (…) do public consulting for renewable energy. So they had {{people who want to}} build a house, and told them you can go to this company to get solutions (…). At the same time there came (…) this renewable energy door in Germany, (…) and then the people from the Landkreis, they thought, why not finance our consulting this way? So they said, we put money into PVPs and the money which we get back, we put into this renewable energy consulting. (…) {{this was the first time}} when in our environment somebody asked for a monitoring system. And we had done monitoring systems at this time in totally different area, in cleaner rooms (…) we came into contact with them, they asked: [...] "Couldn't you give us offer for monitoring PVPs?" [...] So at once, we {{were looking for}} projects, we had already experience with monitoring, they asked for a monitoring system for PVPs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your are right, Mrs. Doolan," [...] the Doctor said; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are some}} who must regret now {{the manner in which}} they have behaved to Bathurst since this siege began." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{has been}} some mistake about that. You {{suggested}} the appointment to him, and he felt unwilling to raise an objection without giving the matter very mature consideration. You can understand that." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Humphrey," [...] she {{answered}} gently. [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no death, and, having done no wrong, I dread no evil. I had dreams while I was asleep, O Humphrey, {{and it seemed}} to me that--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Arab-American comedian Ray Hanania has written, [...] "If {{there were}} a bit of humor in the Middle East, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{might not be so}} much fanaticism. Humor can be a counter to the {{environment}} that breeds fanaticism and terrorism." ...|$|R
