30|$|Among {{household}} characteristics, household composition is, as expected, one of {{the main}} determinants of both child care and <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b> The number of young children, aged 0 – 3 and 4 – 6, {{have a positive impact on}} fathers’ and mothers’ hours of child care, with a larger impact for younger children. The number of children aged 0 – 3 has an impact on <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks,</b> increasing husbands’ and reducing wives’ hours of <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b> This is a plausible results: when children are small, husbands may substitute for their wives in doing more <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b> Grandparents in the household clearly help with household production, reducing hours of <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> for both males and females, not reducing, however, parents’ child care. Finally, non-Russian parents dedicate less time to their children and non-Russian wives participate less to the labour market.|$|R

The husband/wife age ratio is significant and positive in determining wives’ <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks,</b> meaning that wives with a much older husband tend to do more <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b> This is to be expected, since this situation may be a proxy of a very traditional household type.|$|R

We study the possible correlation between the domestic time of parents and their young adult co-resident children using the French time-use survey conducted in 1999 - 2000 in which all family members aged above 14 years old were interviewed. Estimation results show a positive relationship between child and parental housework times.

This study examines the difference in job satisfaction between Dutch men and women. It examines the relationship between gender and job satisfaction by looking at different variables concerning the circumstances at home and the circumstances at work. Specifically, this study looks at the division of the <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> and child rearing, the family composition, the terms of employment, child care options and household income and their impact on the difference between men and women in their job satisfaction. The results show that there is no significant relationship between gender and job satisfaction. Women are not more satisfied with their jobs than men, in contrast to results from previous research. The results do show that people are more satisfied with their jobs when they enjoy a large household income and when their partner does more of the <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b> Specifically, women are less satisfied with their jobs because they take on more <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks...</b>|$|R

30|$|The individual’s and partner’s {{wage rate}} is {{positively}} and {{significantly associated with}} more child care for both spouses. This {{seems to suggest that}} child care has a positive value per-se and the time spent with children increases with the family’s social position (in terms of paid work status). Wages also significantly affect <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks,</b> and in particular the partner’s wage rate increases the hours of <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> - a result similar to Bloemen et al (2010). If the estimated model was a collective specification this would have been a sign of the increased bargaining power of the partner when he/she has a larger wage rate. Finally, the wage rate of the wife reduces husband’s hours of paid work, while the opposite effect is not observed.|$|R

To this end it identifies different positions on {{the issue in the}} literature and deploys some evidence from a survey in Greater Manchester in 1990 to try to discriminate between competing views. We report findings, regarding couple households, about the sex-stereotyping of <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> and about differences in the domestic labour contributions of wives, husbands and young people living in their parental home. The key determinants of variation among households are isolated. We explore attitudes towards sharing and fairness. The results suggest that, with some qualifications, gender stereotyping of specific <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> and unequal contributions between men and women cannot have shifted much in recent years...|$|R
5000|$|According to Hartmann, patriarchy {{is defined}} as [...] "controlling women's access to {{resources}} and their sexuality, which in turn, allows men to control women's labor power, both {{for the purpose of}} serving men in many personal and sexual ways and for the purpose of rearing children". Before capitalism, a patriarchal system was established in which men controlled the labor of women and children in the family, and that through this they learned the techniques of hierarchal control. Today, Hartmann argues the labor market perpetuates this hierarchal control. Low wages keep women dependent on men, encouraging them to marry. Married women must perform <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks</b> for their husbands, and thus men benefit—both from earning higher wages and by not having to participate in <b>domestic</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|R
