25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure <b>inlet</b> <b>opening</b> of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

40|$|In 2015, the Dutch {{government}} {{initiated the}} ‘longitudinal training dams pilot project’. With {{the help of}} longitudinal dams, a two-channel system is created in which the river is divided into a main and a side channel. A combination of an <b>inlet</b> and several <b>openings</b> between the dams allows water and sediment to be exchanged between the two channels. This is expected to influence the discharge (and sediment) distribution between the main and side channel. Understanding the hydraulic conditions {{and the impact of}} the regulatory <b>inlet</b> and <b>opening</b> crest heights is expected to improve the control strategy and future design of river interventions using the concept of longitudinal training dams. A one-dimensional (Matlab) and a two-dimensional (Delft 3 D-Flow) model are created for this research. Both schematize the two channels with dams and openings. The influence of several mechanisms, factors and dimensional design parameters on the discharge distribution is assessed. Additionally, using Delft 3 D-Flow, the detailed flow patterns around the <b>inlet</b> and <b>openings</b> are evaluated and the schematizing of the inlet as part of the local bed topography or by using subgrid weirs is compared. From the several model runs, the discharge distribution shows to be mainly controlled by differences in longitudinal water level slopes in both channels, caused by the combination of too short <b>inlet</b> and <b>opening</b> lengths. It is not influenced significantly by the placement of the longitudinal training dams in a river bend. For increased crest heights the flow conditions change from submerged to free-flowing. In submerged conditions the velocity magnitudes and flow angles atop the <b>inlet</b> and <b>opening</b> crests are shown to increase in downstream direction while for free-flowing conditions they remain nearly constant. The free-flowing conditions are well described by empirical relationships, while for submerged conditions an additional angle submergence coefficient is suggested to parameterize flow angles. After some modifications, which will be included in the new Delft 3 D-Flow software release, schematization as part of the bed topography and subgrid weirs both predict similar discharges (< 7 % relative difference). If interest is only given to water levels and discharge distributions, the use of subgrid weirs is recommended in Delft 3 D-Flow. For models assessing other river functions requiring local flow patterns or sediment transport, schematization as part of the bed topography is essential. However, by including the suggested parameterization for flow angles, the errors in flow angles for subgrid weir can be reduced significantly. From this research, the adjustable <b>inlet</b> and <b>opening</b> crest heights do not show a large influence on the discharge distribution (5 - 10 % difference). It mostly impacts the tipping point for submerged to free-flow conditions. In submerged conditions, the inlet crest height does reduce the specific discharge in the side channel, limits the transverse velocities in the main channel, and greatly influence the flow angles atop the crest. Besides the crest heights, the channel width and inlet length should also be included as adjustable parameters in the design or control strategy of new systems of longitudinal training dams...|$|R
