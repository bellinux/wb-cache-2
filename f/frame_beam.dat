These frames {{are referred to as}} ladder frames due to their resemblance to a ladder if tipped on end. The rails consist of a tall vertical section (two if boxed) and two shorter horizontal flanges. The height of the vertical section provides opposition to vertical flex when weight is applied {{to the top of the}} <b>frame</b> (<b>beam</b> resistance). Though typically flat the whole length on heavy duty trucks, the rails may sometimes be tapered or arched for clearance around the engine or over the axles. The holes in rails are used either for mounting vehicle components and running wires and hoses, or measuring and adjusting the orientation of the rails at the factory or repair shop.|$|E

The rib beams and the rib columns can share parts of the vertical and horizontal loads which the structure should bear and work together with the <b>frame</b> <b>beams</b> and the specially shaped columns, so make the lateral stiffness of the structure is increased and the ultimate strength, ductility and seismic performance of the structure are improved. Moreover, Phosphorus gypsum will be poured to enclose concrete beams and columns and become the filler wall among them.

It can be seen from Fig.  7 that the bottom reinforcement was in tension and the stress was almost linearly increased with increases in the vertical displacement of the removed column in the longitudinal and transverse beams at this stage. However, the values of the stress were lower than the corresponding yield values. The top reinforcement was in compression and the stress was very small in the longitudinal and transverse beams at this stage. As shown in Fig.  8, the stress of the slab bottom reinforcement was very small at this stage.

30|$|Progressive {{collapse}} resistance of RC buildings {{can be analyzed}} by considering column loss scenarios. Using finite element analysis and a static test, the progressive collapse process of a RC frame under monotonic vertical displacement of a side column was investigated, simulating a column removal scenario. A single-story 1 / 3 scale RC frame that comprises two spans and two bays was tested and computed, and downward displacement of a side column was placed until failure. Our study offers insight into the failure modes and progressive collapse behavior of a RC frame. It has been noted that the damage of structural members (beams and slabs) occurs only in the bay where the removal side column is located. Greater catenary action and tensile membrane action are mobilized in the <b>frame</b> <b>beams</b> and slabs, respectively, at large deformations, but they mainly happen in the direction where the <b>frame</b> <b>beams</b> and slabs are laterally restrained. Based on the experimental and computational results, the mechanism of progressive {{collapse resistance}} of RC frames at different stages was discussed further. With large deformations, a simplified calculation method for catenary action and tensile membrane action is proposed.|$|R
