5|$|Along with {{quadratic}} probing {{and double}} hashing, linear probing {{is a form}} of open addressing. In these schemes, each cell of a hash table stores a single key–value pair. When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new <b>key</b> to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another <b>key,</b> linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new <b>key</b> there. Lookups are performed in the same way, by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function, until finding a cell with a matching <b>key</b> or an empty cell.|$|E
5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list. Indexed files have one or more indexes which allow records to be randomly accessed and which can be sorted on them. Each record must have a unique <b>key,</b> but other, , record keys need not be unique. Implementations of indexed files vary between vendors, although common implementations, such as C‑ISAM and VSAM, are based on IBM's ISAM. Relative files, like indexed files, have a unique record <b>key,</b> {{but they do not}} have alternate keys. A relative record's <b>key</b> is its ordinal position; for example, the 10th record has a <b>key</b> of 10. This means that creating a record with a <b>key</b> of 5 may require the creation of (empty) preceding records. Relative files also allow for both sequential and random access.|$|E

5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} reappeared in September 2013 with a Trojan {{known as}} CryptoLocker, which generated a 2048-bit RSA <b>key</b> pair and uploaded {{in turn to}} a command-and-control server, and used to encrypt files using a whitelist of specific file extensions. The malware threatened to delete the private <b>key</b> if a payment of Bitcoin or a pre-paid cash voucher was not made within 3 days of the infection.

50|$|Almost every modern piano has 52 white <b>keys</b> and 36 black <b>keys</b> for a {{total of}} 88 <b>keys</b> (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8).

For example, the Imperial Bösendorfer has nine extra <b>keys</b> at the bass end, giving a total of 97 <b>keys</b> and an eight octave range. These extra <b>keys</b> are sometimes hidden under a small hinged lid that can cover the <b>keys</b> to prevent visual disorientation for pianists unfamiliar with the extra <b>keys,</b> or the colours of the extra white <b>keys</b> are reversed (black instead of white).

5|$|If a cell {{containing}} the <b>key</b> is found, the search returns the value from that cell. Otherwise, if an empty cell is found, the <b>key</b> cannot {{be in the}} table, {{because it would have}} been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched.

5|$|If {{a device}} <b>key</b> {{is to be}} revoked, the media <b>key</b> blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing <b>key.</b> Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised device or processing <b>key</b> could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique <b>key,</b> BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the <b>key</b> exchange and verification process.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting <b>Key</b> Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on <b>Key</b> Largo.

With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A {{sensor network}} is {{composed}} of large number of sensor nodes. Each sensor needs to securely communicate with the adjacent sensors in the network. To provide security between every pair of adjacent sensor each sensor in a network needs to store ‘n- 1 ’symmetric <b>keys</b> But The storage requirement of this <b>keying</b> protocol is very complex. In this paper, we propose a new <b>keying</b> protocol which reduces the number of <b>keys</b> to be stored in each sensor. we present a fully secure <b>keying</b> protocol here each sensor needs to store (n+ 1) / 2 <b>keys,</b> which {{is less than the}} n- 1 <b>keys</b> and symmetric <b>keys</b> are used to encrypt and decrypt the exchanged data for secure communication. At least (n- 1) / 2 <b>keys</b> are required to store in each sensor to secure an entire <b>keying</b> protocol. This new secure <b>keying</b> protocol is very secure against impersonation, eavesdropping and collision attacks.
