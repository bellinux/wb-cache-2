5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the Revolution was crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square</b> on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both pieces of legislation.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby hydrants. In addition, the water pressure at the hydrants was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square</b> in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E

5000|$|Peter preached to <b>the</b> people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>squares</b> of Florence and, {{during the}} {{lifetime}} of Savonarola and after his death, he propagated secretly some revolutionary doctrines. According to him, the Church must be renewed with the sword; until this was accomplished, {{there was no need}} to confess, since all priests, secular and regular, were unworthy.|$|R
25|$|Also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square</b> {{is one of}} Scales Mounds' many outbuildings. A {{gable roof}} shed within the park was {{declared}} neither contributing or non {{for the purpose of}} the historic district. The park has a pavilion/bandstand that was erected between c. 1900–25. It is of steel-frame construction, has a pyramidal roof and a concrete pier foundation. The pavilion was declared a contributing property to the district.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix {{issued the}} fourth {{edition of his}} guide, Catholics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Square.</b> In it, he {{suggested}} to politicians supporting abortion that {{they would need to}} repent and go to Confession before receiving Holy Communion, dissenting from most other bishops including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Cardinal Donald Wuerl who said the Church does not deny communion over issues of legislation.|$|E

Morrow died {{at the home of}} his son, W. Boyd Morrow, on August 25, 1913 after a long illness. He was buried in the city cemetery in Somerset.|$|E
50|$|EPAM (Unified Popular Front in English) {{has been}} {{established}} to help re-establish Greece's sovereignty as an independent state and responsible {{member of the community}} of nations.

25|$|Prince Faisal, who was {{captured}} directly after the attack, {{was at first}} officially declared insane, but following the trial a panel of Saudi medical experts decided that he was sane when he shot the king.

The public execution took place on 18June 1975 at 4:30pmthree hours before sundownbefore a throng of thousands at the AlHukm Palace (Palace of Justice).|$|E
25|$|They {{arrive in}} Gibeah just at nightfall. The Levite {{and his party}} wait <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square,</b> but no one offers to extend the {{customary}} hospitality. Eventually, an old man came in from {{working in the field}} and inquired as to their situation. He, too was from the mountains of Ephraim, but had lived among the Benjaminites for some time. He invited them to spend the night at his house rather than the open square. He brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys; they washed their feet, and ate and drank.|$|E
50|$|La Fête des Fleurs à Beckfayya or the Festival of Flowers has {{attracted}} tourists since 1934 when Maurice Gemayel started the festival {{to attract attention}} to the mountainous town.

25|$|On May 3, 1880, the City’s {{board of}} {{trustees}} (now city council) passed an ordinance to organize the first fire department, which was originally a hook and ladder company. The ordinance also authorized the digging of a well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>square,</b> and the department soon acquired a horse-drawn ladder truck for $1,600. The foreman of the Hook & Ladder Company requested the city council provide additional equipment in January 1894. Items requested included lanterns, a heavy iron hook, and axes with hooks on the pole, which was {{to add to the}} existing equipment that included the ladder truck and several hose carts.

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> mean time, {{panic and}} {{excitement}} reigned throughout the city. Nero doubled his guards; he garrisoned his palace; {{he brought out}} bodies of armed men, and stationed them {{on the walls of}} <b>the</b> city and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>squares,</b> or marched them to and fro about the streets. As fast as men were accused they were put to the question, and as each one saw that the only hope for safety to himself was in freely denouncing others, the names of supposed confederates were revealed in great numbers, and as fast as these names were obtained the men were seized and imprisoned or executed--the innocent and the guilty together.|$|R

2500|$|Having written {{extensively}} about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says [...] "When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about {{the identity of the}} designer.

Not even infants were spared, as the crowd ripped them to pieces or threw them against the walls. The crowd proceeded to loot the houses, stealing all the gold, silver and linens they could find.

Some accused their neighbours of heresy, and these unfortunates met the same fate as the New Christians.|$|R
