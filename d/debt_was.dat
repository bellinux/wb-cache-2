5|$|Cameroon has had {{a decade}} of strong {{economic}} performance, with GDP growing {{at an average of}} 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3billion. Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy), the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa (OHADA). Its currency is the CFA franc.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. Interest on the war <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} pile and some tents {{could be found}} {{at the site of the}} future bridge.

5|$|In 1985, the Argentine austral {{replaced}} the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina {{failed to pay}} the debt for several months, and the <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as ﬁscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again falling out of compliance with an IMF programme. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when a high percentage of <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The four {{credit rating}} {{agencies}} which monitor Iceland's sovereign debt all lowered their ratings during the crisis, and their outlook for future ratings changes became negative. The Icelandic government had a relatively healthy balance, with sovereign debt of 28% of GDP and a budget surplus of 6% of GDP (2007). More recently, the estimated 2011 <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> 130% of GDP {{with a budget}} deficit of 6% of GDP.|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} factor in applying the criteria is {{the classification of}} the debt (non-business or business). A business bad <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> defined as a debt created or acquired {{in connection with a}} trade or business of the taxpayer. Whereas, a non-business <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> defined as a <b>debt</b> that <b>is</b> not created or acquired in connection with a trade or business of the taxpayer. The classification is quite significant in terms of the deductibility. A non-business bad <b>debt</b> must <b>be</b> completely worthless in order to be deducted. However, a business bad <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> deductible whether it is partially or completely worthless.|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} the optimal sequential choice of monetary policy in economies with either nominal or indexed debt. In a model where nominal <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> {{the only source}} of time inconsistency, the (Markov-perfect) sequential optimal policy implies the depletion of the outstanding stock of debt progressively, until the time inconsistency disappears. There is a resulting welfare loss if <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> nominal rather than indexed. We analyze the more general case where monetary policy is time inconsistent even when <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> indexed. In this case, with nominal debt, the sequential optimal policy converges to a time consistent steady state with positive –or negative – debt, depending on the value of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Welfare can <b>be</b> higher if <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> nominal rather than indexed and the level of <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> not too high...|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5000|$|Technical <b>debt</b> can <b>be</b> {{compared}} to monetary debt. If technical <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> not repaid, it can accumulate 'interest', {{making it harder}} to implement changes later on. Unaddressed technical debt increases software entropy. Technical <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes (e.g., as a proof-of-concept) technical <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> required to move projects forward. On the other hand, some experts claim that the [...] "technical debt" [...] metaphor tends to minimize the impact, which results in insufficient prioritization of the necessary work to correct it.|$|R
50|$|In {{international}} legal thought, odious <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> <b>debt</b> that <b>is</b> incurred by a regime for purposes {{that do not}} serve {{the interest of the}} state. Such <b>debts</b> <b>are</b> thus considered by this doctrine to <b>be</b> personal <b>debts</b> of the regime that incurred them and not debts of the state. International Third World debt has reached the scale that many economists <b>are</b> convinced that <b>debt</b> relief or <b>debt</b> cancellation <b>is</b> the only way to restore global equity in relations with the developing nations.|$|R
5|$|Japan is {{the third}} largest {{national}} economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. , Japan's public <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline {{with the size of}} the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{contracted}} {{to finish the}} edition in 18 months but as the months passed, his pace slowed. He told Charles Burney in December 1757 {{that it would take}} him until the following March to complete it. Before that could happen, in February 1758 he was arrested again for an unpaid debt of £40. The <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> soon repaid by Tonson, who had contracted Johnson to publish the work; this motivated Johnson to finish the edition to repay the favour. Although it took him another seven years to finish, Johnson completed a few volumes of his Shakespeare to prove his commitment to the project.|$|E
5|$|Profits for the {{undertaking}} showed a steady rise, {{due in part}} to the low maintenance costs of the river. Income from tolls rose from £321 in 1712 to £1,137 by 1802. By this time, traffic consisted of about 11,500tons of coal carried from Bridgwater upstream out of a total tonnage of 14,000tons. Dividends for 1797 were 11.5%, but the capital debt had risen to £85,466 by 1800, when the auditors refused to examine the accounts, because the likelihood of the poor ever benefitting from the navigation was receding. After much negotiation, the capital <b>debt</b> <b>was</b> reduced to £13,000. An act of parliament dated 14 July 1804 enshrined this position, and ensured that interest was limited to six percent, with profits being used to reduce the debt. By 1828, the amount owing had reduced to £4,426.|$|E

40|$|This quick guide {{looks at}} the level of Australia’s foreign debt, the {{interest}} liability on foreign debt and how these have changed over time. It also looks at foreign debt as a component of net foreign investment, the other component being equity investment. Finally, given that Australia’s gross foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> now bigger than its annual gross domestic product (GDP), the quick guide also considers whether our foreign <b>debt</b> level <b>is</b> too high. What <b>is</b> foreign <b>debt?</b> Foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> the amount borrowed from non-residents by residents of Australia. It includes securities such as bonds, as well as loans, advances, deposits, debentures and overdrafts. Foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> a subset of the financial obligations that make up Australia’s foreign investment position.   It is distinguished from other forms of foreign investment capital inflow such as equity investment (foreign ownership) by the obligation to pay interest and/or repay capital. Foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> {{not to be confused with}} national <b>debt,</b> which <b>is</b> the total government debt. National debt comprises government borrowings from overseas residents and government borrowings from Australian residents and thus excludes overseas borrowings by the private sector. A distinction is made between gross and net foreign debt. Gross foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> the total amount of borrowing from non-residents. Net foreign <b>debt</b> <b>is</b> equal to gross foreign debt minus the sum of lending by residents of Australia to non-residents and official reserve assets held by the Reserve Bank...|$|R
