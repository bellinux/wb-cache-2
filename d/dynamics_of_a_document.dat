In turning my attention to this review, I decided to focus my attention on the third guiding question that argues education and training "are strongly interconnected with concerns that include citizenship and democratic participation, inequalities and social justice, cultural diversity and quality of life" (Millei, 2005). The Briefing Papers include recommendations on democracy and citizenship, social exclusion and equality, gender and dealing with mental illness in schools...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{analyzing}} the <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Z <b>document</b> describing <b>a</b> non-sequential system. First a formal operational semantics based on the chemical metaphor is given to Z. Then, some Unity-like temporal logic constructs are defined on such a formal operational semantics {{in order to allow}} the specification and analysis of dynamic and temporal properties of concurrent systems, such as safety and liveness properties. 1 Introduction The introduction of formal methods increased the usefulness of software specification documents by allowing to automatically check them and to formally reason on them. The Z notation [18] is currently widely used as a non executable specification language to formally describe and analyze the requirements and the architectures of software systems. However, Z has been mostly used for the specification of sequential systems. In fact, even if in the recent years it has been used for specifying concurrent, reactive, or even distributed systems, in gener [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Models where nodes {{represent}} parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> {{have been}} used in structured information retrieval, which was a particularly active research area when hypertexts and markup languages became popular (Kotsakis 2002). Text is often contained inside some structure (e.g., a title, sections, sub-sections, etc.) and queries can be tuned to return specific parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>document</b> instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full one. As an example, if the searched keyword is contained inside Subsections 3.1 and 3.3 <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>document,</b> <b>a</b> query may return either the two subsections, or the whole Section 3, depending on the method.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Controlling {{processes}} with unstable zero <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear {{system is}} a severe challenge. A effective method for solving the problem is presented by paper [1], namely, construct the requisite synthetic output maps to arbitrarily assign the zero <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear system. Specifically, the mathematical formulation {{of the problem is}} realized via <b>a</b> system <b>of</b> first-order nonlinear singular PDEs (partial differential equations). Until now, there are few articles about controlling processes with unstable zero <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear singular system, the present work applies the aforementioned way to the assignment <b>of</b> zero <b>dynamics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nonlinear singular system. Logistic increased SIR epidemic model can be looked as a nonlinear singular system, so take the state feedback synthesis control by above method, the ultimate aim is to eliminate the disease...|$|R
