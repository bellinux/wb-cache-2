5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} the <b>ebb</b> and flow of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American {{musician}} and magician. He {{is best known}} as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer <b>Ebb</b> and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ebbs</b> joined Embry-Riddle in 2012. <b>Ebbs</b> {{made the}} first team All-Conference {{selection}} in her first season and was named in the Embry-Riddle Athletics President’s Team. <b>Ebbs</b> played in all 23 contests, drawing 22 starts and was the team leader in assists with 11, contributed four goals.|$|R
50|$|Between 2012 and 2016, <b>Ebbs</b> had {{a stellar}} career with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University Women's Soccer in The Sun Conference in Daytona Beach, Florida. <b>Ebbs</b> made {{the move to}} play in the United States after playing two seasons with Australian W-League team Adelaide United FC W-League. <b>Ebbs</b> is also {{a former member of the}} South Australian Sports Institute squad.|$|R

5|$|The film {{comes to}} an end with Sue {{describing}} the impact of the boys on her life. As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the <b>ebb</b> of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy comes over the two surviving women.|$|E
5|$|After the Norse occupation, the {{toponymy}} of Orkney {{became almost}} wholly West Norse. The Norse language changed {{into the local}} Norn, which lingered {{until the end of}} the 18th century, when it finally died out. Norn was replaced by the Orcadian dialect of Insular Scots. This dialect is at a low <b>ebb</b> due to the pervasive influences of television, education, and the large number of incomers. However, attempts are being made by some writers and radio presenters to revitalise its use and the distinctive sing-song accent and many dialect words of Norse origin remain in use. The Orcadian word most frequently encountered by visitors is peedie, meaning small, which may be derived from the French petit.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the <b>ebb</b> and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low <b>ebb.</b> Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
5|$|By November, Victoria and Albert had {{returned}} to Windsor, and the Prince of Wales {{had returned}} to Cambridge, {{where he was a}} student. Two of Albert's cousins, King Pedro V and Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, died of typhoid fever. On top of this news, Albert was informed that gossip was spreading in gentlemen's clubs and the foreign press that the Prince of Wales was still involved with Nellie Clifden. Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy. Although Albert was ill and at a low <b>ebb,</b> he travelled to Cambridge to see the Prince of Wales on 25 November to discuss his son's indiscreet affair. In his final weeks Albert suffered from pains in his back and legs.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury {{returned}} to the theatre. Although cast in the lead role in the 2001 Kander and <b>Ebb</b> musical The Visit, she withdrew before it opened due to her husband's deteriorating health. Peter died in January 2003 {{of congestive heart failure}} at the couple's Brentwood, California home. Lansbury felt that after this event she would not take on any more major acting roles, and that instead might make a few cameo appearances but nothing more. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan, and in a 2014 interview noted that she also had homes in Ireland and Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|Electric blowbacks, {{also known}} as <b>EBBs,</b> are {{high-end}} AEGs which generally run from a rechargeable 9.6 volt battery. Most models utilizing this system are rifles. <b>EBBs</b> simulate the blowback action of a real pistol or rifle but generally have less of a kick. Essentially an AEG in design, <b>EBBs</b> are just as powerful. However, a drawback to having the blowback feature is that the battery is quickly depleted, additionally blowbacks can cause extra stress on the gear box which may result in the gearbox's shorter life span. The blowback system can be disabled with some tinkering.|$|R

5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer <b>Ebb</b> contributed electronic sequencing and sounds to eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E
5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the <b>ebb,</b> and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
5|$|When White {{took over}} as editor, Amazings {{circulation}} was about 38,500, only about 4% of which were subscribers (as opposed to newsstand sales). This was a very low <b>ebb</b> for subscriptions; Analog, by comparison, sold about 35% of its circulation through subscriptions. Cohen's wife mailed out the subscription copies from home, and Cohen had never tried to increase the subscriber base as this would have increased the burden on his wife. White worked hard to increase the circulation despite Cohen's lack of support, but met with limited success. One of his first changes was to reduce the typeface {{to increase the amount}} of fiction in the magazine. To pay for this he increased the price of both Fantastic and Amazing to 60 cents, but this had a strong negative effect on circulation, which fell about 10% from 1969 to 1970.|$|E

40|$|Gemes (2009) argued that, {{given that}} I believe that I have hands and I {{believe that it}} is not the case that I have a hand with a wart on it, it must be the case that at least one of my experience-based beliefs (<b>EBBs)</b> is true. This follows since the contradictions of those two propositions {{believed}} by me are jointly inconsistent. Gemes (2009) concluded that this refutes the sceptical claim that it is possible that all one's <b>EBBs</b> are false. The first section of this article addresses some objections to the argument of Gemes (2009). The second section develops new counter-examples to the claim that it is possible that all one's <b>EBBs</b> are false, and then argues that they are also counter-examples to the claim that it is possible that all one's direct, that is, perceptual, <b>EBBs</b> are false. The third section presents counter-examples to the claim that it is possible that all one's positive, that is, existential entailing, <b>EBBs</b> are false. Readers who are already convinced of the soundness of the argument of Gemes (2009) might skip the first section of this article...|$|R
5|$|Charles' abdication had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences in}} imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; they were even prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant <b>ebb</b> and flow of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low <b>ebb.</b> A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with little choice, as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low <b>ebb</b> in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Provençal contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E

5|$|From 1945 to 1947, {{eighteen}} human {{test subjects}} were injected with plutonium without informed consent. The tests {{were used to}} create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body {{in order to develop}} safety standards for working with plutonium. <b>Ebb</b> Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of Plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge. Other experiments directed by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Manhattan Project continued into the 1970s. The Plutonium Files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors. The episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the Hippocratic Oath.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{made three}} casts in 1894, each in {{partially}} glazed stoneware. Several other copies exist in plaster or bronze. His {{sale of the}} casts were not successful, and at a low financial and personal <b>ebb</b> he asked that {{for one of the}} reproductions to act as a marker for his grave. A cast was not placed there until 1973. There are only three other surviving comments of his on the figure: on an 1895 presentation mount of two impressions of a woodcut of the Oviri figure he made to Stéphane Mallarmé where he called the figure a strange and cruel enigma; in an 1897 letter to Ambroise Vollard where he referred to it as La Tueuse ("The Murderess"); and in a c. 1899 drawing where he appends an inscription referencing Honoré de Balzac's novel Séraphîta. Oviri was exhibited at the 1906 Salon d'Automne (no.57) where it influenced Pablo Picasso, who based one of the figures in Les Demoiselles d'Avignon on it.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to quantum entanglement between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building <b>ebb</b> away.|$|E
