5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of <b>illumination</b> in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio. Traditionally a {{dramatic}} light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. <b>Illumination</b> by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark <b>illumination</b> so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{mystery of}} Venus {{observations}} {{is the so-called}} ashen light—an apparent weak <b>illumination</b> of its dark side, seen when the planet is in the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made in 1643, but {{the existence of the}} <b>illumination</b> has never been reliably confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.|$|E

50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, Yankee Candle {{purchased}} <b>Illuminations,</b> a Petaluma, California-based, multi-channel retailer of high quality candles and home accessories. Although the two companies were similar, the names were separated, with <b>Illuminations</b> being aimed at a different demographic. The <b>Illuminations</b> brand and web store were phased out in early 2009.|$|R

5|$|The US Army {{had been}} {{managing}} {{a piece of}} equipment referred to as S-202, which combined four IR cameras, a display, and operator chains, an artificial <b>illumination</b> component (described as “covert – UV,” using Ultraviolet light to provide <b>illumination),</b> and a freeze display function. Under Project Night Life, the S-202 it was to be tested on a S-61 helicopter by early 1967. The project itself was being funded by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).|$|E
5|$|The {{energies}} {{between the}} Van Hove singularities {{depend on the}} nanotube structure. Thus by varying this structure, one can tune the optoelectronic properties of carbon nanotube. Such fine tuning has been experimentally demonstrated using UV <b>illumination</b> of polymer-dispersed CNTs.|$|E
50|$|The Arboretum {{held the}} Walsall <b>Illuminations,</b> a popular tourist attraction, which are held each Autumn for six weeks. The first show {{was held in}} 1951 by the Festival Committee, {{although}} <b>illuminations</b> have taken place at the park since 1875 when candles were placed in coloured jars. The <b>illuminations</b> were also held in 1975, despite a national energy crisis.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009 it was {{announced}} that the <b>Illuminations</b> would temporarily closed for the years 2009-2011 due to financial constraints, the event having run at a significant loss for a number of years. In March 2011 it was confirmed that the <b>Illuminations</b> would be scrapped permanently. The last <b>Illuminations</b> was held in 2008 with a record low attendance, making a loss of £167,000.|$|R
50|$|Every summer Mablethorpe hosts its <b>illuminations</b> event (know {{locally as}} the Switch On). Each year, a celebrity {{is invited to}} the town to switch on its <b>illuminations.</b> Celebrities that have {{attended}} the event in the past include Barbara Windsor, Timmy Mallett and Wolf and Hunter of Gladiators. In July 2011, Twist and Pulse of Britain's Got Talent led {{one of the most}} well-attended <b>illuminations</b> events.|$|R
5|$|The {{west side}} {{will have a}} large,tree-lined, {{pedestrian}} mall with a reflecting pool and new <b>illumination.</b> The reflecting pools will also work as a performance fountain, providing splash and spectacle at programmed moments during stadium events. Around the complex, granite flooring will have stripes evocative of the club's second uniform, in synchronisation with the external <b>illumination.</b> There will be benches and large gardens; the media centre will be housed in one of them. The landscaping was designed by John Loomis, who headed the Burj Khalifa project. Lighting was projected by the American firm T. Kondos.|$|E
5|$|The yellow {{stingray}} exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when {{illuminated by}} blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as green, and appears differently than under white light <b>illumination.</b> Biofluorescence potentially assists intraspecific communication and camouflage.|$|E

30|$|The {{works of}} Simon Marmion and the Master of the Houghton Miniatures are {{distinguished}} {{from each other}} by the artists’ preferences for different green pigments for foliage, by their different usages of red pigments and colorants for drapery, and blue pigments and colorants for rocks and shadows, by differences in color blending, and by their different sequences and manners of paint application. The observations and data generated by our technical study support the artistic attributions of <b>illuminations</b> in the Emerson-White Book of Hours to Simon Marmion and the Master of the Houghton Miniatures. Based on {{what we have learned}} from studying <b>illuminations</b> with strong attributions, {{it may be possible to}} categorize the data gathered from <b>illuminations</b> attributed to the Ghent Associates and from the unattributed <b>illuminations.</b> The results of this project also provide a basis for future study and analysis of <b>illuminations</b> likely removed from the manuscript, and for identifying the probable locations of their original sequence within it.|$|R
5|$|Chris Meledandri, CEO of <b>Illumination</b> Entertainment, said in July 2010 that {{a sequel}} {{was in the}} works. Release was {{tentatively}} scheduled for July 3, 2013.

5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef squids (particularly in jigging) are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to <b>illumination.</b> They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather.

5000|$|... (The <b>Illuminations),</b> Op. 18, {{is a song}} cycle by Benjamin Britten, first {{performed}} in 1940.

50|$|The <b>illuminations</b> are {{highlights}} of the Cologne school in the later phases of the Ottonian Renaissance.

KiBiSi designed the furniture for Ingels' Danish Pavilion at EXPO 2010.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt {{the temple}} of Amun-Re at Karnak {{has been the subject}} of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the {{obliquity}} of the ecliptic show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter sun. The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited <b>illumination</b> at other times of the year.|$|E
5|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, {{akin to the}} eye of tropical cyclones.

5000|$|Because {{the poems}} of <b>Illuminations</b> are so diverse and self-contained, they cover {{a wide range}} of themes. One theme evident {{throughout}} the text is protest. This theme permeates the first poem, [...] "Après Le Deluge", and continues throughout many of the poems in the work. In <b>Illuminations,</b> Rimbaud seems to protest almost everything the society in which he lives has to offer. [...] Another major theme in <b>Illuminations</b> is the city, most evident in the poem [...] "Ville". This theme features prominently in at least six of the poems of <b>Illuminations,</b> and is mentioned in many others. In these poems, Rimbaud expresses a simultaneous attraction and horror towards the modern city. [...] Other major themes include anguish, ecstasy, metamorphosis, nature, walking and travel, creation and destruction.|$|R
