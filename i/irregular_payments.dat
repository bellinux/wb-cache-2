25|$|Businesses {{having more}} {{informal}} connections {{within the government}} receive preferable treatment navigating through Egypt's cumbersome regulatory framework, providing a disincentive for competition. An inefficient and sporadically enforced legal system and a widespread culture of corruption leave businesses reliant {{on the use of}} middlemen (known as wasta) to operate, and well-connected businesses enjoy privileged treatment. Facilitation payments are an established part of 'getting things done', despite <b>irregular</b> <b>payments</b> and gifts being criminalised. Facilitation payments are regarded as bribery in many countries, which prevents many foreign entities from financial involvement with Egypt since they are a required part of doing business. Corruption makes the costs of both local goods as well as imports higher, decreasing the purchasing power of individuals which magnifies poverty.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to mention {{the relevance of the}} public unconditional cash transfer programme administered by the Social Welfare Fund (SWF). IPC-IG and UNICEF (2014) and UNICEF (2014 a) showed that the benefit is the only source of income for some families. Without the SWF, these families {{would not be able to}} buy even the most basic food items. However, the payment schedule of the benefits was not followed, with the transfers often made in a lump sum rather than quarterly. <b>Irregular</b> <b>payment</b> cycle seems to not allow households to smooth their consumption over the year, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of the cash transfers in helping families to cope with economic crisis. This may be one of the reasons why we found the SWF to be only marginally significant towards explaining stunting. Exploring the possibility of increasing transfer frequency or making the payment schedule more flexible would be strongly recommended.|$|R

Structured questionnaire made up of open and close ended questions; personal observation and interview were used to collect primary data. The secondary data were collected through textbooks, journals, newspapers, government and internet publications. Analysis of data was through descriptive statistics of pie charts, tables and simple percentages. The study revealed that Idah Local Government has averagely performed in service delivery. In spite of this, the study discovered that some of the factors affecting the discharge of service delivery in Idah Local Government in terms timeliness, satisfaction, adequacy and effectiveness are insufficient funds; <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of salaries and allowances; undue political interference and divided loyalty; poor observance of the principle of meritocracy in recruitment and promotion of staff and corruption. It was recommended among others that employment and promotion should be based on ability, high performance, experience, qualification and not patronage; intensification of the campaign against corruption at the local government level by bringing to book all corrupt public officials; regular payment of salaries and allowances and increase funding backed up by prudent management.

40|$|Colonization and sedentarization {{formed the}} same {{narrative}} in southwestern Panjab, writing {{the shift in}} discursive production from lineage to state over the spatial, material, and cultural transformation from herding to cultivating society. The dynamics of class among pastoralists in southwestern Panjab provided the framework for the variable pathways and outcomes of localized power transactions among Panjabis and British that produced the colonial state. The transition from <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> to regular taxation and from animal to land capital formed the most important mechanisms of social change in the nineteenth century. In both cases the ruling elites of the precolonial and the colonial states attempted to persuade pastoralists {{to participate in the}} discourses which produced the state. British efforts of sedentarization and state-building succeeded because the exclusionary character of property in land under British law allowed pastoral chiefs to make permanent claims for control of pasture and water. Poorer herders threw in their lot with the state as they became legally and physically excluded from pasture and as their leaders became functionaries of the state and powerful landlords. By according analytical primacy to power transactions at their most local level, this study allows scholars to detach colonialism from its metanarratives, of both the imperialist and nationalist varieties, and to explore a rich middle ground between studies that segregate social and cultural causation. ...|$|R

40|$|Forced truancy is a {{risk factor}} that {{influences}} juvenile behavior, requiring the joint efforts of school authorities, parents, and courts to address. It is a phenomenon where students desire attending school, but for reasons beyond their control, they are prohibited from attending classes. Some of these reasons are teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike action, students 2 ̆ 7 poverty, lack of educational infrastructures, and unsafe educational environment. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike is a frequent occurrence in southeastern Nigeria caused by <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of teachers 2 ̆ 7 wages, benefits, and other remunerations. This case study of 3 secondary schools in southeastern Nigeria sought to understand the impact of forced truancy by examining the relationship between forced truancy and youth delinquency. Although previous studies have explored the causes of truancy, few studies have addressed the effect of forced truancy created by incessant teachers 2 ̆ 7 strike. The theoretical framework that guided this study included Hirschi 2 ̆ 7 s social bond theory and Merton 2 ̆ 7 s social structure. Case studies were developed {{using data from the}} participants and review of documents.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} for {{the award}} {{of the degree}} of Masters in Business Administration Health Care Management (MBA-HCM) Introduction: Purchasing of healthcare services is a critical component of healthcare financing. The purchasing mechanism adopted is the key to making health providers deliver better quality, undertake prevention programs that {{have an impact on the}} health of a population and manage healthcare costs. With serious efficiency challenges facing health systems there has been a greater drive to practice strategic purchasing as an efficiency goal in the use of scarce resources. An emerging agenda is how healthcare services could be purchased more strategically to promote quality in service delivery, manage expenditure growth and promote efficiency in service delivery. The study explored the purchasing arrangements for the teacher‟s medical scheme. Methodology: This was an exploratory qualitative study utilizing purposive sampling for the fund managers of the teachers‟ medical scheme and convenience sampling for the beneficiaries of the scheme. Participants were consented and in-depth interview guides used to collect data. Four fund managers and six beneficiaries were interviewed to a point where data saturation was attained. Data was analyzed using thematic content approach with predetermined themes on purchasing. Purchasing elements were compared against the actions of an ideal strategic purchaser and other purchasing actions. Results: The teachers‟ medical scheme has a well-articulated benefit package, uses limited capitation and fee for service as the provider payment mechanisms, contracts providers based on their regional distribution and through accreditation process and utilizes private providers only. Key strategic actions implemented include use of drug formularies, fraud monitoring and providers performance monitoring. Other practices include <b>irregular</b> <b>payment</b> of providers and lack of benefit updates with changing trends and alignment to populations‟ needs. Conclusion: There is limited strategic purchasing being practiced within the teachers‟ medical scheme especially with regard to the design of the benefit package and provider payment mechanisms...|$|R

Studies on this focus are few and not really community based. To bridge this gap, current paper seeks to examine the factors retarding the operations of primary health care in Ado-Odo!Ota local government area in Ogzm State Nigeria in order to accelerate health care services especially at the grassroots among other PHC centres in the country. The methodology is based on survey work among all the 16 primary health care facilities within the 16 wards in Ado-Odo!Ota local government area (AOO), from which data were collected from the respondents. The respondents were health personnel available during the period of survey. Using a semi structured questionnaire. On the whole the total number of 16 PHCs was covered in the study. Descriptive and inferential analyses were carried out using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). The variables referred to are as given on tables 1 to 4. Six variables namely poor state of building, low community involvement, poor cold chain storage facility, irregularity of worker's payment, poor state of roads to PHC facility and state of vital equipment were regressed against the state of PHC using perceived service satisfaction of facility as the proxy dependent variable.
