25|$|The company {{differs from}} most other porn studios {{in that it}} {{contracts}} with in-house directors and permits them to own the films that they create, while Evil Angel handles the film's manufacture, distribution, promotion and sales and takes {{a percentage of the}} <b>gross</b> <b>sales.</b> Each director has his own particular style and is a star in his own right, with his own brand identity. Stagliano adopted this business model due to his previous experience selling his videos to other companies. He found it difficult to establish his reputation when someone else owned his content, and he didn't receive any more money if a film sold well.|$|E
25|$|The {{day after}} {{arriving}} in Portland, Ladd rented a small store at 42 Front Street and sent an order to Tilton for more liquor. At that time, Portland contained 6-8 saloons and retail liquor stores, with approximately 30 retail stores. One saloon had just received its first billiard table. Ladd only grossed $41.40 {{in the last two}} weeks of April and was unable to pay the $6 property tax, instead exchanging several nights and mornings to remove two stumps from the street in lieu of payment. Early May proved better for Ladd, selling a large amount of gin to Barrell, adding the local Skidmore's California House hotel and Ainsworth's Lot Whitcomb steamer as customers. Ladd began to branch out, adding eggs, chickens, and other local goods to his liquor store. He then earned $250 by selling goods from W. D. Gookin on consignment, adding shaving soap, tobacco, paper, farm tools, blasting powder to his store. In August 1851, Ladd's <b>gross</b> <b>sales</b> were $1000.|$|E

500|$|The caption to the {{published}} photograph {{referred to the}} group as solemn. It was true {{that many of the}} group had reservations at appearing in a mainstream media publication; Rothko especially. Yet none could have mistaken the consequences of Pollock's three-page spread in Life of August 8, 1949. Pollock's next show, opening November 21, 1949, at Betty Parsons Gallery, was an unmistakable triumph. Famously, Willem de Kooning was heard to say to Milton Resnick: [...] "Look around. These are the big shots. Jackson has finally broken the ice." [...] In the ensuing year, Betty Parsons sent Pollock checks totalling $6,508.23 on <b>gross</b> <b>sales</b> of over $10,000, at a time when more than two thirds of American families lived on less than $4,000 per year. Pollock seems to have been invited to sign the Studio 35 open letter, at least in part, because of his notoriety, almost entirely attributable to the Life article. In the end the sitting was an uncomfortable accommodation between the system of values under which the artists had laboured and their desire for career success.|$|E

Acclaim's analysts expected that the number of copies sold would reach at least 2.5 million within the first few weeks of release (at an average retail price of $60) and the sales to top $150 million by end of the year. First-week sales of over $50 million surpassed the initial box office results of that season's Hollywood film blockbusters, such as Forrest Gump, True Lies, The Mask and The Lion King. Mortal Kombat II became the world's best-selling video game (until it was eclipsed by Donkey Kong Country, released in November 1994) and the Genesis version sold 1.78 million copies in the United States alone, along with an additional 1.51 million American copies of the game for the SNES. By 2002, estimated <b>gross</b> <b>sales</b> of Mortal Kombat II home video games exceeded $400 million.
