40|$|AbstractVortex Induced Vibration (VIV) is {{a typical}} flow-structure {{interference}} phenomenon which causes an unsteady flow pattern due to vortex shedding {{at or near the}} structure's natural frequency leading to resonant vibrations. VIV may cause premature fatigue failure of marine risers and pipelines. A test model was carried out to investigate the role of a stationary fairing by varying the caudal horn angle to suppress riser VIV taking into account the effect of wake interference. The test results show significant reduction of VIV for risers disposed in tandem and side-by-side. In general, fairing with a caudal horn of 45 ° and 60 ° are efficient in quelling VIV in risers. The results also reveal fairing can reduce the <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> of risers arranged side-by-side.

40|$|This work {{pertains}} to the development effort involved in the deployment of an additional winglike aerodynamic surface {{referred to as a}} “mousche” for the naval version of a typical military aircraft. The mousche is attached to the forebody of the naval aircraft. It is deployed only during landing (and retracted at all other times) in order to improve the landing characteristics of the aircraft on the aircraft carrier. The mousche is designed and constructed out of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic to withstand the full load and is deployed using the actuator bank containing the arrays of shape memory alloy elements. The shape memory alloy actuator bank moves a distance of 15 mm while generating a net actuator force of over 2000 kg. This force is used to deploy the additional aerodynamic surface measuring 790 � 215 � 32 mmagainst a simulated lift and <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> acting simultaneously, i. e., a resultant lift load of 331. 6 kg and a <b>drag</b> <b>load</b> of 33. 16 kg acting at the center of gravity of the mousche. The shape memory alloy bank consists of 138 wires of about 1 mm in diameter and 650 mm in length. The actuation of these 138 wires is electronically and mechanically synchronized. The mousche has been analyzed using finite element method codes for the combined lift and <b>drag</b> <b>load.</b> Experimental and analysis values have matched well. The electronics circuit assembly of the smart actuator drive electronics that powers the shape memory alloy actuator bank has been designed and developed in the form of mother- and daughterboards. Each daughterboard has six miniaturized dc–dc converters, and the required power and control signals are routed to the motherboard. The smart actuator drive electronics have been integrated to carry out the full load test. The National Instruments 6009 data acquisition module along with graphical user interface software LabVIEW are used to conduct the experiments and to effect the closed-loop position control of the mousche...|$|R

In about 5000 BC, sleds developed, which are more difficult to build than travois, but are easier to propel over smooth surfaces. Pack animals, ridden horses and bullocks dragging travois or sleds require wider paths and higher clearances than people on foot and improved tracks were required. As a result, by about 5000 BC roads, including the Ridgeway, developed along ridges in England to avoid crossing rivers and bogging. In central Germany, such ridgeways remained the predominant form of long-distance road till the mid 18th century.|$|E

40|$|The Southeast Asia metocean {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} moderate wind and waves with relatively strong and persistent currents. The design of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) for Southeast Asia is strongly affected by the current and resulting <b>drag</b> <b>loads,</b> particularly if many risers are required. To reduce vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of offshore tubular members i. e. top tension risers (TTRs), vortex suppression devices such as helical strakes and fairings are used. This paper gives an insight into a set of riser VIV model tests which is carried out to study the effectiveness of an open-back "U"-shaped fairing in suppressing riser VIV.

40|$|As of today, Norway is {{the second}} largest seafood {{exporter}} in the world after China, and Norwegian seafood is currently exported to more than 130 countries (Laksefakta, n. d.). In conjunction with the present growth of the aquaculture industry in Norway, there is a rising skepticism regarding the sustainability of the industry. Major concerns are fleeing, fish welfare, salmon louse and impact onmarine life {{in close proximity to}} the fish farms. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the possibility of exchanging a fish net, at an operational fish farm, with a newly proposed closed fish cage concept without altering the existing mooring system. The benefit will be reduced downtime and expenditure during setup, since {{there is no need to}} install a new mooring system. A conventional fish net is analyzed to obtain comparable results to that of the fish cage, with identical mooring used by both systems. A numerical, and a simplified analytical method is used. AquaSim, which is a finite element analysis software, is used to perform the numerical comparison of both systems exposed to regular waves, while an analytical approach is used to derive static values, such as; wave and current forces, and static mooring line data. The focus is on mooring line loads, since these loads would be the governing factor regarding the interchangeability. <b>Drag</b> <b>loads</b> of the fish net with varying amounts of marine fouling are calculated. The results show that there is an approximately linear increase in <b>drag</b> <b>loads</b> for current velocities between 0 m/s and 1, 5 m/s. These <b>drag</b> <b>loads</b> are compared to the estimated loads of the fish cage, calculated by hand and through AquaSim. By introducing a combination of waves and current in the numerical analysis, the results shows that the wave loads are within the same range for both solutions. The results also show that the mooring line loads are dominated by current forces, even for the largest wave conditions. Additionally, the results related to the fish net are higher than that of the fish cage for all simulated conditions, suggesting that it would be possible to exchange the fish net with the closed fish cage. Although the simulations converge, there is some uncertainty related to the validity of the values obtained in the simulation of the fish cage, when exposed to the largest wave conditions. The fish cage picks up a slight rolling motion, and waves overtops the upper part of the structure on one side only, resulting in an unloading of the mooring lines, located in the direction opposite of the waves propagation. A comparison to experimental results obtained through model testing would be beneficial, but are not included since no experimental data is available...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the effects of body shape on the drag of a 45 deg sweptback-wing-body combination at Mach numbers from 0. 90 to 1. 43. Both the expansion and compression fields induced by body indentation were swept back as the stream Mach number increased from 0. 94. The line of zero pressure change was generally tangent to the Mach lines associated with the local velocities over the wing and body. The strength of the induced pressure fields over the wing were attenuated with spanwise distance and the major effects were limited to the inboard 60 percent of the wing semispan. Asymmetrical body indentation tended to increase the lift on the forward portion of the wing and reduce the lift on the rearward portion. This redistribution of lift had a favorable effect on the wave drag due to lift. Symmetrical body indentation reduced the <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> near the wing-body juncture at all Mach numbers. The reduction in <b>drag</b> <b>loading</b> increased in spanwise extent as the Mach number increased and the line of zero induced pressure became more nearly aligned with the line of maximum wing thickness. Calculations of the wave drag due to thickness, the wave drag due to lift, and the vortex drag of the basic and symmetrical M = 1. 2 body and wing combinations at an angle of attack of 0 deg predicted the effects of indentation within 11 percent of the wing-basic-body drag throughout the Mach number range from 1. 0 to 1. 43. Calculations of the wave drag due to thickness, the wave drag due to lift, and the vortex drag for the basic, symmetrical M = 1. 2, and asymmetrical M = 1. 4 body and wing combinations predicted the total pressure drag to within 8 percent of the experimental value at M = 1. 43...|$|R
