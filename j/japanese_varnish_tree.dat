5000|$|Lacquer tree or varnish tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum or Rhus verniciflua) {{grows in}} Asia, {{especially}} China and Japan. Growing up to 20 m tall, its sap produces an extremely durable lacquer. The leaves have 7-19 leaflets (most often 11-13). The sap contains the allergenic oil, urushiol. Urushiol gets {{its name from}} this species which in Japanese is called Urushi. Other names for this species include Japanese lacquer tree, <b>Japanese</b> <b>Varnish</b> <b>Tree</b> and Japanese Sumac (Note: the term [...] "varnish tree" [...] is also occasionally applied to the Candlenut, Aleurites moluccana, a southeast Asian tree unrelated to Toxicodendron).|$|E
50|$|Toxicodendron vernicifluum (formerly Rhus verniciflua), {{also known}} by the common name Chinese lacquer tree, is an Asian tree species of genus Toxicodendron (formerly Rhus) native to China and the Indian subcontinent, and {{cultivated}} in regions of China, Korea and Japan. Other common names include Japanese lacquer <b>tree,</b> <b>Japanese</b> sumac, and <b>varnish</b> <b>tree.</b> The trees are cultivated and tapped for their toxic sap, which {{is used as a}} highly durable lacquer to make Chinese, Japanese, and Korean lacquerware.|$|R
40|$|The {{damp and}} mild climate of East Asia {{provides}} the ideal environment for <b>varnish</b> <b>trees,</b> {{and it is}} no surprise that the art of lacquer originated in this region. Chinese and Japanese lacquer work represent the highest level of this art; however, when focusing on the interaction of lacquer technique between China and Japan, the role varnish played should not be ignored. Japan is famous for its lacquer work. From the Edo period, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>varnish</b> merchants actively sought Chinese varnish from the Chinese merchants trading in Nagasaki. With the expansion of the Japanese lacquer industry during Meiji period, the demand for varnish became increasingly urgent, a result of which was the importance attached to the importation of Chinese <b>varnish</b> by the <b>Japanese</b> lacquer industry...|$|R

5000|$|Yun-de is lacquerware in Burmese, {{and the art}} {{is called}} Pan yun (ပန်းယွန်း) [...] The lacquer is the sap tapped from the <b>varnish</b> <b>tree</b> Melanorrhoea usitata or Thitsee that grows wild in the forests of Myanmar (formerly Burma). It is straw-colored but turns black on {{exposure}} to air. When brushed in or coated on, it forms a hard glossy smooth surface resistant to a degree {{from the effects of}} exposure to moisture or heat.|$|R
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{descriptions of}} the tree of heaven were made shortly after it was introduced to Europe by the French Jesuit Pierre Nicholas d'Incarville. D'Incarville had sent seeds from Peking via Siberia to his botanist friend Bernard de Jussieu in the 1740s. The seeds sent by d'Incarville {{were thought to be}} from the economically important and similar looking Chinese <b>varnish</b> <b>tree</b> (Toxicodendron vernicifluum), which he had observed in the lower Yangtze region, rather than the tree of heaven. D'Incarville attached a note indicating this, which caused much taxonomic confusion over the next few decades. In 1751, Jussieu planted a few seeds in France and sent others on to Philip Miller, the superintendent at the Chelsea Physic Garden, and to Philip C. Webb, the owner of an exotic plant garden in Busbridge, England.|$|R
50|$|Dipterocarpus grandiflorus is a {{critically}} endangered common medium hardwood tree in South-East Asia and India. Its wood {{is used to}} produce good quality charcoal, paper pulp, and timber sold under the Keruing designation. Its gum is used locally as a waterproofing <b>varnish.</b> The <b>tree</b> itself is very useful for nitrogen fixing, erosion control, soil improvement, and watershed regulation.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the evolutionary {{history of the}} widely studied, cosmopolitan polymorphic species Dodonaea viscosa (hop bush, <b>varnish</b> <b>tree).</b> Location: All continents except Antarctica, extending from 44 ° S (in the South Island of New Zealand) to 33 ° N (in California and Arizona). Methods: For 50 samples across the worldwide distribution, Bayesian analyses of nuclear ribosomal transcribed spacers (ITS 1, ITS 2 and partial ETS) were performed. The alignment was partitioned by secondary structure and analysed using separate models of sequence evolution for each spacer's stem and loop partition. Bayesian relaxed-clock estimations of divergence times were used to investigate the tempo of the transoceanic dispersal history of Dodonaea viscosa. Results: The widely distributed Dodonaea viscosa evolved in Australia from its most recent common ancestor in the Late Pliocene to Early Pleistocene and subsequently split into two distinct, geographically based, intraspecific lineages. There {{are a number of}} regional subclades that are also supported by specific molecular elements. Main conclusions: Dodonaea viscosa is not an old lineage, as has often been speculated based primarily on its vast distribution. It diverged from its most recent common ancestor and subsequently dispersed and established around the world within the last 2 Myr. Two distinct lineages within Dodonaea viscosa, which have been shaped by Quaternary climatic change, have separate dispersal histories. The molecular investigations have identified that, although there are least two evolutionary lineages within the complex, they do not correlate with any distinct morphological subunits. It is proposed that Dodonaea viscosa (including D. biloba and D. procumbens) be recognized as an ochlospecies...|$|R

[235] All the {{degradation}} of art which was brought about, after {{the rise of the}} Dutch school, by asphaltum, yellow <b>varnish,</b> and brown <b>trees,</b> would have been prevented, if only painters had been forced to work in dead colour. Any colour will do for some people, if it is browned and shining; but fallacy in dead colour is detected on the instant. I even believe that whenever a painter begins to wish that he could touch any portion of his work with gum, he is going wrong.|$|R
5000|$|Hua's {{biography}} {{ends with}} accounts of his disciples Wu Pu 吳普 and Fan A 樊阿.Wu P'u of Kuang-ling and Fan Ah of P'eng-ch'eng both studied with Hua-t'o. Using Hua-t'o's methods of treatment, {{many people were}} completely cured by Wu P'u. [...] "The human body needs exertion." [...] Hua-t'o told Wu P'u, [...] "but it shouldn't be pushed to the limit. Movement of the limbs facilitates the absorption of nutrients in food and enable the blood in the arteries to flow freely, preventing sickness from occurring. It's like a door-pivot that never decays from bugs or worms because of the constant opening and closing. That's why, when the ancient transcendent practiced duction, they strode like a bear and turned their head backward like an owl. They elongated their waist and limbs and moved all of their joints, seeking to stave off old age. I have a technique called 'the exercise of the five animals'. The first is the tiger, {{the second is the}} deer, the third is the bear, the fourth is the ape, the fifth is the bird. They may also be used to get rid of illness and are beneficial for the legs and feet because they are a type of duction. If there is discomfort somewhere in your body, get up and do one of my animal exercises until you're soaking with sweat, then sprinkle powder on yourself. Your body will feel relaxed and you'll have a good appetite." [...] (tr. Mair 695-696) Fan A was skilled at acupuncture and inserted the needles to extraordinary depths. Mair (1994:695) notes this unusual name may indicate Fan A was a foreigner, and this area was around modern Tongshan County, Jiangsu, [...] "location of the first known Buddhist community in China".Fan Ah requested from Hua-t'o the recipe for an orally ingested medicine that would be beneficial to one's health, and Hua-t'o instructed him how to make a powder of varish tree leaves and herbe de flacq. The proportions are fourteen ounces of shredded herbe de flacq for each pint of shredded <b>varnish</b> <b>tree</b> leaves. Hua-t'o said that if one takes a long course of this medicine, it will get rid of the three worms of parasites, benefit the five viscera, make the body feel nimble, and prevent you hair from turning white. (tr. Mair 1994:696)These herbs are qiye (Wade-Giles: chi-yeh; 漆叶, [...] "Toxicodendron vernicifluum leaves") and qingdian (Wade-Giles: ching-tien;青黏, [...] "Sigesbeckia orientalis").|$|R
40|$|The Sapindaceae (soapberry family) is a {{large family}} of trees, shrubs and lianas {{comprising}} 133 genera (49 monotypic) and ca. 1450 species, most with a tropical to subtropical distribution. The circumscription of Sapindaceae has varied, {{particularly with regard to}} inclusion of genera from the closely related, predominantly temperate families Aceraceae and Hippocastanaceae. Sequence data from two plastid genes, analysed separately and together using parsimony and Bayesian analysis support a broadly defined Sapindaceae incorporating Aceraceae, Hippocastanaceae and Xanthoceras. A division into four subfamilies is proposed: Sapindoideae, Hippocastanoideae, Dodonaeoideae, and Xanthoceroideae. Tribal groupings are critically evaluated in light of the analyses. The evolutionary history of Sapindaceae is evaluated using a variety of Bayesian relaxed clock molecular estimates of divergence times, which either incorporate the dates implied by the fossil record, fossil constraints from outside Sapindaceae, and no fossil constraints. Analyses with fossil constraints from outside Sapindaceae imply a Pliocene-Miocene (6 - 28 Mya) origin for Acer and Aesculus rather than a Paleocene (ca 64 Mya) origin implied by the earliest attributed fossils of these genera, and an evolutionary rate for Acer and Aesculus consistent with the majority of other genera of Sapindaceae sampled. Including the fossil dated Paleocene origin of Acer and Aesculus as hard bound priors and using four constraints from outside Sapindaceae result in a potentially biologically implausible rapid change in the mean evolutionary rate on the stem branch leading to the split between Acer and Aesculus and their respective sister genera. These conflicting scenarios suggest the need for a substantial re-evaluation of our understanding of the tempo and mode of evolution of these lineages. Intergeneric relationships within Dodonaeoideae, Hippcastanoideae and Xanthoceroideae were also assessed by firstly, generating secondary structure predictions for ITS and partial ETS sequences, and then using these predictions to assist alignment of the sequences. Secondly, the alignment was analysed using RNA specific models of sequence evolution that account for the variation in nucleotide evolution in the independent loops and covariating stems regions of the ribosomal spacers. The phylogeny drawn from the analyses was compared with that from analyses using ‘traditional’ 4 -state models and the plastid analyses. To further our understanding of the origins of the Australian flora, and in particular plant adaptation and evolution in increasingly arid environments, the phylogeny and evolutionary history of Hopbushes (Dodonaea – Sapindaceae) and Pepperflowers (Diplopeltis – Sapindaceae) were evaluated based on nuclear ITS and partial ETS sequences and models of nucleotide evolution that incorporate secondary structure. The tempo and mode of evolution of these sister genera were evaluated using Bayesian relaxed clock molecular estimates of divergence times, Bayesian relative rates test, lineage through time plots and estimations of diversification rates (speciation minus extinction). The dry and temperate adapted genera of Sapindaceae (Diplopeltis species and Dodonaea including Distichostemon species) are relatively recent radiations in the Australian flora, and {{are most likely to be}} in response to increased aridity and seasonality from the late Miocene 14 Mya to Recent. There is evidence of long distance dispersal from northern Australia to Madagascar in the early Pliocene. The cosmopolitan, polymorphic species Dodonaea viscosa (hop bush, <b>varnish</b> <b>tree)</b> has been the subject of taxonomic and ecological enquiry for over 150 years. ITS and partial ETS sequences for 50 samples from across its worldwide distribution were used to evaluate the evolutionary and biogeographic history of this species complex. Dodonaea viscosa is not an old lineage as has often been speculated based primarily on it vast distribution, but diverged from its most recent common ancestor and subsequently dispersed around the world within the last two million years. Results also indicate that there are at least two evolutionary lineages within D. viscosa...|$|R
