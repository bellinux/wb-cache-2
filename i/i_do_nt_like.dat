40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} colony-stimulating factor (CSF) {{have recently been}} described in human tissues and cultured cell lines. Antisera to purified type I and II CSF were prepared in rabbits. Anti-CSF I antibody inhibits CSF I, but {{has no effect on}} CSF II. It cross-inhibits CSF I from several other human sources, but does not inhibit CSF from mouse lung or mouse L cells. Anti-CSF II antibody inhibits the activity of CSF II, but has no effect on CSF I. A radioimmunoassay for CSF I has been established. Competitive binding assay further demonstrated the immunological differences between CSF I and II. When CSF II is used to stimulate human marrow cells fractionated by sedimentation velocity, two populations of CFU-C are separated, one sedimenting at 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 7, and a second sedimenting at 6. 8 mm/h and forming colonies by day 13. In contrast, CSF <b>I</b> <b>does</b> <b>nt</b> stimulate colony growth by day 7 but does do so by day 13 in cells sedimenting between 7. 2 - 8. 5 mm/h. These results indicate that CSF I and II are distinct in their biochemical, immunological, and functional properties...|$|R

The paper motivates the need for a fine-grained, trace-based monitoring tool in order to support development of soft real-time applications on Windows <b>NT,</b> <b>like</b> the EIVIS interactive Video-on-Demand server. It also sketches the design of JewelNT that hooks in the NT kernel and provides full information about NTs thread-scheduling at system and application-level...|$|R
50|$|Despite {{its small}} size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a significant, and {{apparently}} global, magnetic field. According to measurements taken by Mariner 10, {{it is about}} 1.1% the strength of Earth's. The magnetic-field strength at Mercury's equator is about 300 <b>nT.</b> <b>Like</b> that of Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is dipolar. Unlike Earth's, Mercury's poles are nearly aligned with the planet's spin axis. Measurements from both the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER space probes have indicated that the strength {{and shape of the}} magnetic field are stable.|$|R
50|$|Windows NT 3.1, for {{the most}} part, comes with 32-bit {{versions}} of the components featured in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups. However, it also included applications specifically aimed at the needs of Windows <b>NT,</b> <b>like</b> the User Manager, the Performance Monitor, the Disk Administrator, the Event Viewer and the Backup application. The Advanced Server contained further, server-specific administration tools. Because Windows NT 3.1 is not DOS-based, a new 32-bit command-line processor, called CMD.EXE was included which was compatible with MS-DOS 5.0. For compatibility reasons, Windows NT 3.1 shipped with a few 16-bit applications, like Microsoft Write or EDLIN.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for the isogeometric Boundary Element analysis of domains that contain predefine dinclusions with material properties {{that are different}} {{to the rest of}} the domain and which also may exhibit inelastic behavior. The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required, in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The implementation is verifie <b>do</b> <b>ntest</b> cases by comparison with either exact solutions or ones computed by the Finite Element method...|$|R
