The results show a significant upstream shock excursion when the afterburner lights which {{is a result of}} the direct communication between the afterburner region and the inlet by means of the fan duct and fan stages. In addition results of a waveform analysis on the inlet pressure response to the afterburner light is presented. <b>Inlet</b> <b>unstarts</b> and their effect on operation of the propulsion system is also discussed...|$|R

In particular, the task of controlling a mixed-compression supersonic inlet is formulated as a linear optimal stochastic control and estimation problem. An inlet can exhibit an undesirable instability due to excessive inlet normal shock motion. For the optimal control formulation of the inlet problem, a non quadratic performance index, which is equal to the expected frequency of <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarts,</b> is used. This physically meaningful performance index is minimized for a range of inlet disturbance and measurement noise covariances...|$|R

50|$|The second {{difficulty}} {{occurs when}} the aircraft Mach number changes. The airflow {{has to be the}} same at the intake lip, at the throat and at the engine. This statement is a consequence the conservation of mass. However, the airflow is not generally the same when the aircraft's supersonic speed changes. This difficulty is known as the airflow matching problem which is solved by more complicated inlet designs than are typical of subsonic inlets. For example, to match airflow, a supersonic inlet throat can be made variable and some air can be bypassed around the engine and then pumped as secondary air by an ejector nozzle. If the inlet flow is not match, it may become unstable with the normal shock wave in the throat suddenly moving forward beyond the lip, known as <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart.</b> Spillage drag is high and pressure recovery low with only a plane shock wave in place of the normal set of oblique shock waves. In the SR-71 installation the engine would continue to run although afterburner blowout sometimes occurred.|$|E
40|$|Vehicle motions {{resulting}} from a supersonic mixed-compression <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> were examined {{to determine if the}} unstart constituted a hazard severe enough to warrant rejection of mixed-compression inlets on high-speed civil transport (HSCT) concepts. A simple kinematic analysis of an <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> during cruise was performed for a Mach 2, 4, 250 -passenger HSCT concept using data from a wind-tunnel test of a representative configuration with unstarted inlets simulated. A survey of previously published research on <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> effects, including simulation and flight test data for the YF- 12, XB- 70, and Concorde aircraft, was conducted to validate the calculated results. It was concluded that, when countered by suitable automatic propulsion and flight control systems, the vehicle dynamics induced by an <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> are not severe enough to preclude the use of mixed-compression inlets on an HSCT from a passenger safety standpoint. The ability to provide suitable automatic controls appears to be within {{the current state of the}} art. However, the passenger startle and discomfort caused by the noise, vibration, and cabin motions associated with an <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> remain a concern...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{propulsion}} system concepts {{to be considered}} for the High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) is an underwing, dual-propulsion, pod-per-wing installation. Adverse transient phenomena such as engine compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> could severely degrade the performance of one of these propulsion pods. The subsequent loss of thrust and increased drag could cause aircraft stability and control problems {{that could lead to a}} catastrophic accident if countermeasures are not in place to anticipate and control these detrimental transient events. Aircraft system engineers must understand what happens during an engine compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> so that they can design effective control systems to avoid and/or alleviate the effects of a propulsion pod engine compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart.</b> The objective of the <b>Inlet</b> <b>Unstart</b> Propulsion Airframe Integration test program was to assess the underwing flow field of a High-Speed Civil Transport {{propulsion system}} during an engine compressor stall and subsequent <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart.</b> Experimental research testing was conducted in the 10 - by 10 -Foot Supersonic Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. The representative propulsion pod consisted of a two-dimensional, bifurcated inlet mated to a live turbojet engine. The propulsion pod was mounted below a large flat plate that acted as a wing simulator. Because of the plate s long length (nominally 10 -ft wide by 18 -ft long), realistic boundary layers could form at the inlet cowl plane. Transient instrumentation was used to document the aerodynamic flow-field conditions during an unstart sequence. Acquiring these data was a significant technical challenge because a typical unstart sequence disrupts the local flow field for about only 50 msec. Flow surface information was acquired via static pressure taps installed in the wing simulator, and intrusive pressure probes were used to acquire flow-field information. These data were extensively analyzed to determine the impact of the unstart transient on the surrounding flow field. This wind tunnel test program was a success, and for the first time, researchers acquired flow-field aerodynamic data during a supersonic propulsion system engine compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> sequence. In addition to obtaining flow-field pressure data, Glenn researchers determined other properties such as the transient flow angle and Mach number. Data are still being reduced, and a comprehensive final report will be released during calendar year 2000...|$|E
40|$|This report details {{experimentally}} derived operational characteristics of numerous two-dimensional planar inlet-combustor isolator configurations at a Mach number of 4. Variations in geometry included (1) inlet cowl length; (2) inlet cowl rotation angle; (3) isolator length; and (4) utilization of a rearward-facing isolator step. To obtain inlet-isolator maximum pressure-rise data relevant to ramjet-engine combustion operation, configurations were mechanically back pressured. Results {{demonstrated that the}} combined inlet-isolator maximum back-pressure capability increases {{as a function of}} isolator length and contraction ratio, and that the initiation of unstart is nearly independent of inlet cowl length, inlet cowl contraction ratio, and mass capture.

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} (LES) {{have been}} performed for kerosene spray combustion with methane pilot flame in a model dual mode ramjet chamber with a cavity flame holder under the condition of incoming Mach number of 2 and inlet static temperature of 520 K. Three cases are compared with a constant equivalence ratio of methane pilot flame of 0. 08 but different equivalence ratios of kerosene of 0. 10, 0. 25 and 0. 6 respectively. It is found that the kerosene spray interacts strongly with the pilot flame in the near wall region {{and the depth of}} the spray penetration plays an important part in deciding the characteristics of the combustion process, its efficiency and the overall heat addition. When kerosene injection mass is small, spray droplets are close to the wall and are surrounded with the hot air generated by the pilot flame, the kerosene spray combustion can achieve higher efficiency due to nearly complete combustion in the separated boundary layer. However the resulting flame flashback in the boundary layer could induce engine <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarting.</b> When spray droplets penetrate further into the freestream but still interact intermittently with the pilot flame, the spray evaporation is enhanced by the pilot flame front. The heat consumption during this process results in rich fuel mixtures accumulating near the wall. Thus the combustion processes of both kerosene vapor and pilot gas have been suppressed, resulting the lowest heat releasing. As for the case of droplets fully penetrating into the freestream core, small amount of evaporated kerosene gradually diffuses and burns further downstream of the pilot flame, accompanied with the lowest combustion efficiency due to low evaporation rate but the relative higher additional heat releasing. Considering <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarting</b> is undesirable for ramjet engine under a relative low flight Mach number, unless the boundary layer separation can be controlled, the deep spray penetration is to be used to achieve a better overall kerosene combustion performance. However the spray combustion efficiency still needs to be improved...|$|R
40|$|A fixed-geometry {{diffuser}} {{system was}} designed for use in Mach 4 free-jet tests of a hydrogen-burning modular scramjet engine. The scramjet engine has a rectangular cross section that blocks up to 33 percent of the existing tunnel nozzle exit area and swept leading edges of the scramjet produce an asymmetric downward flow that sharply increases when the scramjet <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarts.</b> Effects of these conditions on {{the operation of the}} diffuser system are not accurately predictable. An experimental investigation has therefore been conducted in unheated air using a subscale model of the tunnel-scramjet-diffuser system to substantiate the design. Test results showed that the preliminary design had to be modified to obtain an acceptable configuration of the nozzle exit, test cabin, and diffuser that would provide shock-free flow at the scramjet inlet for simulated Mach 4 flight at altitudes from 16, 764 to 20, 422 meters...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of linear stochastic optimal control theory {{to the design}} of the control system for the air intake (inlet) of a supersonic air-breathing propulsion system is discussed.

40|$|Flight {{control of}} {{hypersonic}} vehicles is challenging {{because of the}} wide range of oper-ating conditions encountered and certain aspects unique to high speed flight. A particular safety concern in hypersonic flight is the risk of an <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart,</b> which not only produces a significant decrease in thrust but also results in a change to the aerodynamics and thus can lead to the loss of the vehicle. Previous work on control design for hypersonic vehicles often uses linearized or simplified nonlinear dynamical models of the vehicle, and very little work has been done on recovering from unstart events. Using a generic hypersonic vehicle as a control design and simulation model, this paper develops a nonlinear adaptive dynamic inversion control architecture with a control allocation scheme to track realistic flight path angle trajectories. A robustness analysis is performed on the initial control architecture de-sign, which shows that the control architecture is able to handle time delays, perturbations in stability derivatives, and reduced control surface effectiveness. The control architecture then is evaluated for its ability to handle <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart.</b> Simulation results presented in the paper demonstrate that the approach achieves desired tracking performance while being robust to the particular uncertainties and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> conditions studied.

40|$|The {{aircraft}} design engineer of today is tasked with satisfying {{an increasing number}} of conflicting requirements. The fact that conflict in these requirements may be technically, economically, or politically motivated usually compounds the difficulty of determining the best solution to a design issue. In this regard, propulsion/airframe integration for supersonic airplanes must rank {{as one of the most}} challenging aspects of airplane design. For the cruise Mach numbers currently being considered for High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) airplanes, the inlet requirements of low drag, low bleed flow, and high pressure recovery appear to be best met with a mixed-compression design. Unfortunately, these desirable attributes come with a highly undesirable companion: the <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> phenomenon. Concern over the effects of a mixed-compression <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> on the vehicle dynamics of large, high-speed aircraft is not new; a comprehensive wind-tunnel study addressing the problem was published in 1962. Additional investigations of the problem were made throughout the United States SST program and the follow-on NASA program into the late 1970 's. The current study sought to examine the magnitude of the problem in order to determine if an <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> posed a potential hazard severe enough to preclude the use of mixed-compression inlets on proposed HSCT concepts...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of a proposed configuration of a high-speed civil transport was conducted by using NASA and industry research pilots. The assessment was conducted to evaluate operational aspects of the configuration from a pilot's perspective, with the primary goal being to identify potential deficiencies in the configuration.

The Cooper-Harper rating scale was used to evaluate the flying qualities of the configuration. A summary flying qualities metric was also calculated. The assessment was performed in the Langley six-degree-of-freedom Visual Motion Simulator. The effect of a restricted cockpit field-of-view due to obstruction by the vehicle nose was not included in this study. Tasks include landings, takeoffs, climbs, descents, overspeeds, coordinated turns, and recoveries from envelope limit excursions.

40|$|Under the NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program, the Supersonics Project {{is working}} to {{overcome}} the obstacles to supersonic commercial flight. The supersonic inlet design that is utilized to efficiently compress the incoming air and deliver it to the engine has many design challenges. Among those challenges is the shock positioning of internal compression inlets, which requires active control {{in order to maintain}} performance and to prevent <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarts</b> due to upstream (freestream) and downstream (engine) disturbances. In this paper a novel feedback control technique is presented, which emphasizes disturbance attenuation among other control performance criteria, while it ties the speed of the actuation system(s) to the design of the controller. In this design, the desired performance specifications for the overall control system are used to design the closed loop gain of the feedback controller and then, knowing the transfer function of the plant, the controller is calculated to achieve this performance. The innovation is that this design procedure is methodical and allows maximization of the performance of the designed control system with respect to actuator rates, while the stability of the calculated controller is guaranteed...|$|R
40|$|Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) is a {{derivative}} {{of the classical}} schlieren technology, {{which is used to}} visualize density gradients, such as shock wave structures in a wind tunnel. Changes in refractive index resulting from density gradients cause light rays to bend, resulting in apparent motion of a random background pattern. The apparent motion of the pattern is determined using cross-correlation algorithms (between no-flow and with-flow image pairs) producing a schlieren-like image. One advantage of BOS is its simplified setup which enables a larger field-of-view (FOV) than traditional schlieren systems. In the present study, BOS was implemented into the Combined Cycle Engine Large-Scale Inlet Mode Transition Experiment (CCE LIMX) in the 10 x 10 Supersonic Wind Tunnel at NASA Glenn Research Center. The model hardware for the CCE LIMX accommodates a fully integrated turbine based combined cycle propulsion system. To date, inlet mode transition between turbine and ramjet operation has been successfully demonstrated. High-speed BOS was used to visualize the behavior of the flow structures shock waves during unsteady <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarts,</b> a phenomenon known as buzz. Transient video images of inlet buzz were recorded for both the ramjet flow path (high speed inlet) and turbine flow path (low speed inlet). To understand the stability limits of the inlet, operation was pushed to the point of unstart and buzz. BOS was implemented in order to view both inlets simultaneously, since the required FOV was beyond the capability of the current traditional schlieren system. An example of BOS data (Images 1 - 6) capturing inlet buzz are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} linear stochastic optimal control theory {{to the design of}} the control system for the air intake, the inlet, of a supersonic air-breathing propulsion system.

The quadratic equivalence principle is used to obtain a linear controller that minimizes the nonquadratic index. The two controllers are compared on the basis of unstart prevention, control effort requirements, and frequency response. It is concluded that while controls designed to minimize unstarts are desirable in that the index minimized is physically meaningful, computation time required is longer than for the minimum mean square shock position approach. The simpler minimum mean square shock position solution produced expected unstart frequency values which were not significantly larger than those of the nonquadratic solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} test program was {{conducted}} to acquire flow-field data during a supersonic propulsion system compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> sequence. The propulsion system consisted of a mixed-compression, two-dimensional bifurcated inlet coupled to a General Electric J 85 - 13 turbojet engine. The propulsion system was mounted beneath a large flat plate that simulated an underwing propulsion pod installation. Transient flow-field pitot pressure and wing simulator surface static pressure data were acquired during multiple compressor stall and <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> events at a free-stream Mach number of 2. 20. The experimental results obtained in this investigation indicate that a supersonic propulsion system compressor stall-inlet unstart transient event adversely affects the surrounding local flow field. The data show that the stall-unstart event affects the surrounding flow field on a millisecond time scale and causes a three-dimensional expanding wave front called a hammershock to propagate outward from the inlet. The flow nearest the wing simulator separates from the surface during the transient event. At {{the end of the}} transient event, a distinct process occurs wherein the affected flow field recovers to free-stream conditions and the wing simulator boundary layer reattaches to the flow surface...|$|E
40|$|<b>Inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> {{causes a}} {{disturbance}} akin to severe turbulence for a supersonic commercial airplane. Consequently, the current {{goal for the}} frequency of unstarts is a few times per fleet lifetime. For a mixed-compression inlet, there is a tradeoff between propulsion system efficiency and unstart margin. As the unstart margin decreases, propulsion system efficiency increases, but so does the unstart rate. This paper intends to first, quantify that tradeoff for the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) and second, to examine the benefits of using a sensor to detect turbulence ahead of the airplane. When the presence of turbulence is known with sufficient lead time to allow the propulsion system to adjust the unstart margin, then inlet un,starts can be minimized while overall efficiency is maximized. The NASA Airborne Coherent Lidar for Advanced In-Flight Measurements program is developing a lidar system {{to serve as a}} prototype of the forward-looking sensor. This paper reports on the progress of this development program and its application to the prevention of <b>inlet</b> <b>unstart</b> in a mixed-compression supersonic inlet.

40|$|The Mach 5 high {{enthalpy}} {{wind tunnel}} tests {{of a specific}} three-dimensional section controllable internal waverider hypersonic inlet are studied in this paper. The performance and static pressure distributions of the inlet at different back-pressure conditions (included free back-pressure) are obtained. The mass flow capture rate is 0. 99 0. 01 ± in all test statuses, which confirms the inlet’s high mass capture capacity. In the free back-pressure status, the mass-averaged total pressure recovery at the exit plane of the inlet is 0. 609 and the average Mach number is 2. 78, while the pressure rise reaches 13. 98. The inlet can work in the maximum back-pressure status (51. 4 times of upstream pressure) while its exit plane mass-average Mach number is close to 1. At that moment, the separation phenomenon could be identified near the ramp-side shoulder position. The inlet works unsteadily and becomes unstarted once the average Mach number is below 1 while the back-pressure keeps increasing. It is {{pointed out that the}} location where the reflection shock wave intersects with the ramp-side shoulder is the critical position and the shock wave/boundary layer interaction is the inducement of the <b>inlet</b> <b>unstarting</b> in back-pressure tests. Furthermore, for the elliptical exit inlet, the flow loss in the major axis direction is more remarkable, which slows the flow there into subsonic accompanying probable reversing flow.

Boundary layer separation is undesirable because it reduces mass flow to the engine and can lead to choking of the <b>inlet</b> or <b>unstart.</b> Current flow control methods are effective in reducing the separation, but are yet to significantly increase the inlet efficiency. Researchers at the Gas Dynamics and Turbulence Laboratory (GDTL) have proposed a new control technique using localized arc-filament plasma actuators (LAFPAs). The LAFPAs are to be tested in a supersonic blow down wind tunnel with a compression ramp shock generator. The characterization of the baseline flow of this facility is vital to researching control of the interaction. Several qualitative and quantitative flow diagnostics were used to characterize this Mach 2. 3 flow. The interaction generated in this tunnel was shown to be a separated SWBLI comparable with those studied in literature. It was also found to exhibit the expected low frequency unsteady behavior...|$|R
