5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, <b>inhibiting</b> proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins regulate the proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By <b>inhibiting</b> signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development. The table of human serpins (below) provides examples {{of the range of}} functions performed by human serpin, {{as well as some of}} the diseases that result from serpin deficiency.|$|E

5|$|While benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{short-term}} benefits for anxiety, sleep and agitation in some patients, long-term (i.e., greater than 2–4 weeks) use {{can result in}} a worsening of the very symptoms the medications are meant to treat. Potential explanations include exacerbating cognitive problems that are already common in anxiety disorders, causing or worsening depression and suicidality, disrupting sleep architecture by <b>inhibiting</b> deep stage sleep, withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms in between doses mimicking or exacerbating underlying anxiety or sleep disorders, <b>inhibiting</b> the benefits of psychotherapy by <b>inhibiting</b> memory consolidation and reducing fear extinction, and reducing coping with trauma/stress and increasing vulnerability to future stress. Anxiety, insomnia and irritability may be temporarily exacerbated during withdrawal, but psychiatric symptoms after discontinuation are usually less than even while taking benzodiazepines. Fortunately, for those with benzodiazepine-induced problems, functioning significantly improves within 1 year of discontinuation.|$|E

40|$|Blebbistatin, a cell-permeable {{inhibitor}} of class-II myosins, {{was developed}} to provide a tool for studying the biologic roles of myosin II. Consistent with this use, we find that blebbistatin <b>inhibits</b> three myosin II-dependent processes in Dictyostelium (growth in suspension culture, capping of Con A receptors, and development to fruiting bodies) and does not <b>inhibit</b> growth on plates, which does not require myosin II. As expected, macropinocytosis (myosin I-dependent), contractile vacuole activity (myosin V-dependent), and phagocytosis (myosin VII-dependent), none of which requires myosin II, are not <b>inhibited</b> by blebbistatin in myosin II-null cells, but, unexpectedly, blebbistatin does <b>inhibit</b> macropinocytosis and phagocytosis by cells expressing myosin II. Expression of catalytically inactive myosin II in myosin II-null cells also <b>inhibits</b> macropinocytosis and phagocytosis. Both blebbistatin-inhibited myosin II and catalytically inactive myosin II form cytoplasmic aggregates, which may be why they <b>inhibit</b> myosin II-independent processes, but neither affects the distribution of actin filaments in vegetative cells or actin and myosin distribution in dividing or polarized cells. Blebbistatin also <b>inhibits</b> cell streaming and plaque expansion in myosin II-null cells. Our {{results are consistent with}} myosin II being the only Dictyostelium myosin that is <b>inhibited</b> by blebbistatin but also show that blebbistatin-inactivated myosin II <b>inhibits</b> some myosin II-independent processes and that blebbistatin <b>inhibits</b> other activities in the absence of myosin II...|$|R
