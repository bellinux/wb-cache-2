I had a bakery in the 1990 's, took a chef's course, worked in restaurants, and went out on a routine issue that bothered me. I lived in Los Angeles for 2 years and {{followed}} the appearance of Food Trucks in 1997, as well as in other trips I made. After 2012, already in Brazil, I decided to return to the food sector and started to market pizzas. At this time, I went to a food event, which aroused my attention to the food trucks, this business was almost nonexistent here in the south of Brazil yet, and so I did a market research and {{thought it would be a}} profitable business. Therefore, I decided to make a hamburger food truck because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> this type of cuisine and saw a good profit opportunity” (FOOD TRUCK 5 OWNER).|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I have cut up and rearranged stories from my {{first attempt at}} writing and theorising sudden memoir. Here I discuss the ways that writing sudden memoir blurred the lines between how things were and how they became once they were forced into sentences. To do this I thread {{excerpts}} from those sudden memoirs in amongst the ideas of theorists I was reading {{at the time and}} my current thinking around nonfiction practice. The construction of this paper involved salvaging small fragments from the stories I wrote last year. In this work I trace the disintegration of my relationship with the person whose life was most tangled up in my writing. Here I have made new the writing that gave away too much. In the place of those short stories, I have sewn together a broken narrative which reflects the fragmentation <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> my writing practice. The argument is accumulative, it is just a shift, a twist in perception over time...|$|E

60|$|Martha had not {{forgotten}} us; a cheerful fire was burning, and a neat supper {{spread in the}} dining-room: we were glad of both. The winter dawn was actually breaking before we gained our chambers. I took off my pink dress and lace mantle with happier feelings than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> putting them on. Not all, perhaps, who had shone brightly arrayed at that concert could say the same; for not all had been satisfied with friendship--with its calm comfort and modest hope.|$|R

In this field, the world is still ruled by bilateral air transport agreements. Such bilateral agreements are even in force in Europe. This essay asks several questions. First, what does successful deregulation in Europe really mean? Would deregulation be successful if many low-cost carriers flew throughout Europe and carried mostly point-to-point traffic from point A to B? I personally think that very few routes are suitable for this point-to-point traffic...|$|R

60|$|The sound {{which had}} frightened them was not repeated, {{but it had}} been {{sufficient}} as it was to start me speculating on the possible horror which lurked in the shadows at my back. Fear is a relative term and so I can only measure my feelings at that time by what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> previous positions of danger and by those that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> passed through since; but I can say without shame that if the sensations I endured during the next few minutes were fear, then may God help the coward, for cowardice is of a surety its own punishment.|$|R

30|$|In his autobiography, Bowmer said that, “In {{coming to}} Ashland I faced the most bitter {{disappointment}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> my young life.

He convinced the Active Club, a community service group of businessmen and professionals in which he was a member, to propose including “The First Annual Shakespeare Festival” in the revival of Ashland’s Fourth of July “Independence Day” celebration. Started in 1935, the initial two Festival plays were cast from the School’s faculty, students and townspeople.|$|R

5000|$|Johannes Riis, {{publishing}} {{editor at}} the major Danish publishing house, Gyldendal, spoke at the funeral and said: [...] "Og nu står jeg så her, i en frysende klar og ubarmhjertig bevidsthed om, at jeg i løbet af det sidste års tid har været vidne til noget af det mest urimelige og meningsløse, jeg har oplevet i mit liv.

Det er ikke til at have med at gøre" [...] ("And here I stand, with a cold, clear and merciless thought in mind that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> witnessed something of the most unfair and meaningless <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> my life. To see so much originality, so much talent go to waste and never get a chance of letting it unfold. It is unbearable.").|$|R
40|$|To {{test the}} idea that unannounced quizzes {{improved}} performance on later hour exams, I collected test scores from 4 classes over 2 se-mesters. I compared course segments with quizzes to segments without quizzes in a counterbalanced design. Test scores following quizzes averaged half a letter grade higher than scores from seg-ments without quizzes. Mid-range students benefitted the most, with C students gaining 84 % of a letter grade. Attitude surveys re-vealed {{a high level of}} student acceptance for the quizzes. One of the problems <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> teaching un-dergraduate courses such as learning, cognition, physiologi-cal, neuropsychology, sensation, and perception is that many of my students seriously underestimate the difficulty of learn-ing the material and earn low grades. High failure rates are worrisome to some professors and, at universities where there is a concern about improving student retention, they may b...|$|R
60|$|On the 19th of January, I {{ascended the}} Tukvor spur to Dorjiling, and {{received}} a most hospitable welcome from my friend Mr. Muller, now almost the only European inhabitant of the place; Mr. Hodgson having gone down on a shooting excursion in the Terai, and Dr. Campbell being on duty on the Bhotan frontier. The place looked what it really was--wholly deserted. The rain <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> the valley, <b>had</b> here been snow, {{and the appearance of}} the broad snowed patches clear of trees, and of the many houses without smoke or inhabitant, and the tall scattered trees with black bark and all but naked branches, was dismal in the extreme. The effect was heightened by an occasional Hindoo, who flitted here and there along the road, crouching and shivering, with white cotton garments and bare legs.|$|R
40|$|Vermont was {{inspired}} by the great amount of time that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> spent in the state of Vermont visiting with my family. The state of Vermont has always been {{a very important part of}} my life and to an extent I consider it my second home. The initial theme played by the first cello is of great importance throughout the piece and is a chant that comes from the Catholic mass. This theme is reminiscent of the old, small town New England churches that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> attended with my family as well as a representation of the importance of Catholicism in my family. The music itself is not meant to be strictly programmatic; however it is meant to evoke images of the beautiful green mountains, the small picturesque New England towns, the farms, the wildlfe, as well as the people that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> Vermont...|$|R
60|$|I started eastward {{the next}} morning, {{arriving}} in New York {{in time to}} catch one of the big liners sailing for Havre. On my way across the continent I decided to send a cable to Maude at Paris, since it were only fair to give her an opportunity to reflect upon the manner in which she would meet the situation. Save for an impatience which at moments I restrained with difficulty, the moods that succeeded one another as I journeyed did not differ greatly from those <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> the past month. I was alternately exalted and depressed; I hoped and doubted and feared; my courage, my confidence rose and fell. And yet I was aware of the nascence within me of an element that gave me a stability <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hitherto lacked: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made my decision, and I felt the stronger for it.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify the meaning of {{understanding}} the child as a whole person in early childhood care and education through anthropological considerations. Anthropology tries to understand human being as a whole through practical situations. Therefore, I take up anger of the child who has been concerned with me in the practice of early childhood care and education. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> relationship with M as a practitioner of early childhood care and education, and tried to understand M's whole life through writing the episodes and considerations on M's anger which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> the practice. The anger in relationship within the early childhood care and education is understood as the child`s expression that he/she wants to grow. The understanding the child as a whole person in early childhood care and education is to understand that the child's conduct has his/her own meaning to the child's whole life who wants to grow for him-/herself...|$|R

40|$|Author and anthologist Herb Boyd’s {{recollection}} of Richard Wright’s tongue in cheek, ‘All {{you need to}} compile an anthology {{is a pair of}} scissors and a pot of glue’ (Boyd 2003 : 50), hints more than a little wryly at the trials and tribulations of anthologists’ struggle for recognition. It is also a struggle for affirmation that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>in</b> my own journey as children’s author, editor and anthologist and member of the broader children’s writing community - a struggle that gnaws at the creative heart of many involved in children’s writing and book creation, precipitating artistic and creative tension for children’s writing, picture books and anthologies as niche genres. In this paper I contend that writing courses within the Australian and globalised higher education sector, along with governments and funding bodies have a responsibility to the broader community to more actively recognise and support creators of children’s books as these books contribute to our literary lore...|$|R
