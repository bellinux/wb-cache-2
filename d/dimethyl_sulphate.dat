40|$|We report {{measured}} solubilities of five aminium (i. e., monomethyl, dimethyl, trimethyl, diethyl, and triethyl) sulphate salts {{in water}} at 24 °C, and the densities of their aqueous solutions. Using these results, we have converted hygroscopic growth factors determined by Qiu and Zhang (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2012, 46, 4474 - 4480) to a moles {{of water per}} mole of solute basis, and obtained the relationships between concentration and equilibrium relative humidity (water activity) for solutions of the five salts. The results are compared with values predicted using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) of Clegg and co-workers (J. Geophys. Res. 2002, 107, D 14, Art. No. 4207). It is assumed in this model that ion and water activities in the solutions {{are the same as}} those for aqueous (NH) SO at the same molality. The experimental and modelled growth factors agree well in all cases, within the uncertainties of the data, which supports this assumption. Equations for the apparent molar volumes of the aminium sulphate salts in aqueous solutions are presented (based upon the measured densities and literature data), and also activity products of the salts in saturated aqueous solutions (based upon the measured solubilities and assumption of similarity with (NH) SO). Simulations of the deliquescence curves of 1 : 1 and 1 : 9 mass ratio mixtures of monomethyl and <b>dimethyl</b> aminium <b>sulphate</b> with (NH) SO are shown to agree well with the measurements.

40|$|Measurements of {{dimethyl}} sulphide (DMS) and its oxidation products, methane {{sulphonic acid}} (MSA), <b>sulphate,</b> <b>dimethyl</b> sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulphone (DMSO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in the atmosphere have been made during all seasons of 1988 / 1990 at coastal sites in northwest Scotland and Eire. The annual average air concentration of DMS was estimated from results obtained on 92 days in 1989 / 1990 to be 58 ng (S) m− 3 and that of MSA to be 6 ng (S) m− 34. Backward air mass trajectories were used for each sampling period to explain the observed concentrations {{in terms of the}} origins of the sampled air. Seasonal and diurnal cycles were observed for DMS with maximum concentrations > 300 ng (S) m− 3 occurring at night and during the spring in air of oceanic origin. Maximum MSA concentrations (up to 120 ng (S) m− 3) were observed during the spring. Using a steady state approximation, the sea-to-air flux of DMS from the Atlantic north of 45 ° was estimated to be 0. 93 μmol m− 2 d− 1 or 96 Gg (S) yr− 1. Three methods were used to correct the observed air concentrations of the various sulphur species for anthropogenic emissions. The resultant flux of biogenic sulphur into the United Kingdom from the North Atlantic, net of any anthropogenic sulphur, was estimated to be 30 - 96 Gg (S) yr− 1, or 2 - 5 % of the total anthropogenic emission rate of sulphur from the U. K. A simple 10 -step model was used to describe the equilibria existing between the various sulphur species and CO 2 in cloud water at cloudwater concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 5, and 2. 5 g m− 3 and the resultantacidity calculated. Values of pH as low as 3. 4 were predicted, with MSA having a negligible effect and sulphate dominating. Biogenic sulphur species from the North Atlantic may therefore make a small but quantifiable contribution to the atmospheric sulphur budget of the U.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{introducing}} methyl groups into DNA substrates was studied {{by using the}} spleen exonuclease (EC 3. 1. 4. 1), an enzyme which hydrolyses oligonucleotides in a sequen-tial manner by splitting off 3 '-phosphomononucleotides starting from the 5 '-hydroxyl terminus. Analyses of oligodeoxyribonucleotide 3 '-phosphate substrates after reaction in vitro with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> demonstrated that the resultant methylation pattern differed from that previously found for native DNA, {{particularly with respect to}} the relative amounts of 1 - and 3 -methyladenine produced. Although after treatment with increasing amounts of <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> the substrate became progressively resistant to degradation by the exonuclease, the methylation products themselves were only partially responsible for the observed inhibition of enzyme activity. The incomplete degradation encountered was apparently due to the presence of apurinic sites, which arose as secondary lesions after the spontaneous release of the labile alkyl purines from the methylated substrate. Inhibition of enzyme activity appeared to be competitive, being characterized by constant values for apparent Vmax. and increased values for apparent Km. The interpretation of this, however, is complicated by the complex nature of the substrate...|$|E

In the present study we used the highly sensitive DNase I in vivo footprinting approach to delineate more precisely the functional domains of the BDKRB 1 gene promoter in human SMCs (smooth muscle cells). Human lymphocytes that do not express a functional BDKRB 1 were also studied as a reference using <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate,</b> UV light type C and DNase I treatments.

Gel-shift assays and expression studies pointed to the implication of the YY 1 and a TBP/TFIIB (TATA-box-binding protein/transcription factor IIB) transcription factor in the regulation of BDKRB 1 gene expression in SMCs and possible YY 1 involvement in the mechanisms of nuclear factor κB-mediated regulation of the receptor expression.

The protected regions on the continuous strands of the stacked helices were not located exactly at the junction, but were displaced towards the 3 ' side of the strand. This is the region of backbone that becomes located in the major groove of the opposed helix in the non-crossed, right-handed structure for the junction, and might therefore be predicted to be protected against cleavage by an enzyme.

With the DMS methylated template no wrong nucleotide incorporation was detectable, but with the MNU methylated polymer the incorporation of dGMP was observed. The amount of dGMP incorporated correlated with the level of O 4 -methylthymine in the template over the range of methylation studied. The results indicate that O 4 -methylthymine is capable of miscoding on a one-to-one basis while the products of DMS methylation (1 -, 3 - and 7 -methyladenines), and also possibly the phosphotriesters, do not lead to any misincorporation...|$|E

40|$|Important in {{understanding}} the regulation of gene transcription is the elucidation of specific protein-DNA interactions that occur in vivo. One strategy for such in vivo footprinting involves the treatment of whole cells with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (DMS), which leads to methylation of guanine residues in DNA at the N 7 position (1, 2). This N 7 atom lies in the major groove and its susceptibility to methylation in chromatin is affected by its proximity to bound non-histone proteins (3). Subsequent treatment with piperidine breaks the DNA backbone at methylated sites that can be mapped by various methods, including a sequence specific, radioactive primer extension assay, using a DNA polymerase (1, 4, 5).

In the present work, the ability of VM and VS to modify the accessibility of 23 S rRNA bases within ribosomes to chemical reagents has been explored. VM afforded a protection of rRNA bases A 2037, A 2042, G 2049 and C 2050.

The drug exhibits sequence selective binding and discriminates against runs of adenines or thymines. Binding is shown to occur at various sequences with a preference for GC rich regions of DNA. A large enhancement of DNAase I and of hydroxyl radical cleavage in regions rich in A's or T's is observed together with hyperreactivity of adenines towards diethylpyrocarbonate in the presence of drug. This indicates the occurrence of drug-induced changes in critical conformational features of DNA.

At moderate concentrations of each ligand, specific purine residues (mainly adenosines) exhibit enhanced reactivity towards the probe, and several sites of enhancement appear {{to be related to the}} sequence selectivity of drug binding. Further experiments were performed with echinomycin at pH 5. 5 and 4. 6 to facilitate the protonation of cytosine required for formation of Hoogsteen GC base pairs. No significant increase in reactivity was observed under these conditions. Additionally, no protection of deoxyguanosine residues from methylation by <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> was observed in the presence of echinomycin. We conclude that the structural anomaly giving rise to drug-dependent enhanced DEPC reaction is not simply the formation of Hoogsteen base pairs adjacent to antibiotic binding sites.

However, the difficulty lies in the fact that chitin in cell walls of fungi Aspergillus niger is covalently bonded with glucans, which can be completely separated by means of enzymes only. Chitin-glucan complex obtained contains about 15 - 20 % glucan, but its presence results in important changes of consumer product qualities in comparison with chitin shells of crustaceans. So, chitosan-glucan complex, produced by deacetylation of chitin-glucan, exhibits smaller solubility in weak organic acids. The aim of this work is to obtain soluble derivatives of chitin-glucan complex by means of chemical modifications of its hydroxyl groups. As a result of interactions of chitin-glucan complex with propylene oxide, alkyls halide, <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and acetic oxide, the derivatives of chitin-glucan complex and chitosan-glucan complex have been obtained.

The in vitro antiplasmodial was evaluated on strains of Plasmodium falciparum FCR- 3 resistant chloroquine and D 10 sensitive chloroquine. The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC 50) of the five compounds ranged from 2. 41 ± 1. 41 to 0. 07 ± 0. 01 μM. The {{results showed that the}} (1) -N-benzyl- 6 -nitro- 1, 10 -phenanthrolinium iodide had highest antiplasmodial activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{purified}} 3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase I from Escherichia coli to apparent physical homogeneity. The {{enzyme preparation}} produced a single band of Mr 22, 500 upon sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in good {{agreement with the}} molecular weight deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the tag gene (Steinum, A. -L. and Seeberg, E. (1986) Nucl. Acids Res. 14, 3763 - 3772). HPLC confirmed that the only detectable alkylation product released from (3 H) <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> treated DNA was 3 -methyladenine. The DNA glycosylase activity showed a broad pH optimum between 6 and 8. 5, and no activity below pH 5 and above pH 10. MgSO 4, CaCl 2 and MnCl 2 stimulated enzyme activity, whereas ZnSO 4 and FeCl 3 inhibited the enzyme at 2 mM concentration. The enzyme was stimulated by caffeine, adenine and 3 -methylguanine, and inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide and 3 -methyladenine. The enzyme showed no detectable endonuclease activity on native, depurinated or alkylated plasmid DNA. However, apurinic sites were introduced in alkylated DNA as judged from the strand breaks formed by mixtures of the tag enzyme and the bacteriophage T 4 denV enzyme which has apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity. It was calculated that wild-type E. coli contains approximately 200 molecules per cell of 3 -methyladenine DNA glycosylase I...|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} structure of mouse Ehrlich ascites 18 S, 5. 8 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA in situ was investigated by chemical modification using <b>dimethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> and 1 -cyclohexyl- 3 -(morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulphonate. These reagents specifically modify unpaired {{bases in the}} RNA. The reactive bases were localized by primer extension followed by gel electrophoresis. The three rRNA species were equally accessible for modification i. e. approximately 10 % of the nucleotides were reactive. The experimental data support the theoretical {{secondary structure}} models proposed for 18 S and 5. 8 / 28 S rRNA as almost all modified bases were located in putative single-strand regions of the rRNAs or in helical regions that {{could be expected to}} undergo dynamic breathing. However, deviations from the suggested models were found in both 18 S and 28 S rRNA. In 18 S rRNA some putative helices in the 5 '-domain were extensively modified by the single-strand specific reagents as was one of the suggested helices in domain III of 28 S rRNA. Of the four eukaryote specific expansion segments present in mouse Ehrlich ascites cell 28 S rRNA, segments I and III were only partly available for modification while segments II and IV showed average to high modification...|$|E
