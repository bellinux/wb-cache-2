5000|$|Agonists/positive {{allosteric}} modulators: ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, carisoprodol, chloral hydrate, <b>etaqualone,</b> etomidate, glutethimide, kava, methaqualone, muscimol, neuroactive steroids, z-drugs, propofol, skullcap, valerian, theanine, volatile/inhaled anaesthetics.|$|E
50|$|The dosage {{and effects}} are {{reported}} {{to be similar to}} those of methaqualone, but shorter acting and slightly weaker.Typical reports use between 50 and 500 mg of <b>etaqualone,</b> depending on desired effects. Old pharmaceutical formulations of Ethinazone were 350 mg tablets. <b>Etaqualone</b> is thought to act in a similar way to barbiturates and benzodiazepines by increasing the sensitivity of GABAA receptors. Recreational effects include euphoria, relaxation, increased sociability and sexuality, reduction of short-term memory, and loss of coordination. Combination with other depressants has a potentiating effect and can cause overdose. Tolerance to benzodiazepines or alcohol will also reduce effects.|$|E
5000|$|Positive {{allosteric}} modulators: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, certain carbamates (ex. carisoprodol, meprobamate, lorbamate), thienodiazepines, ethanol (alcohol), etomidate, glutethimide, kavalactones, meprobamate, quinazolinones (ex. methaqualone, <b>etaqualone,</b> diproqualone), neuroactive steroids, niacin/niacinamide, nonbenzodiazepines (ex. zolpidem, eszopiclone), propofol, stiripentol, theanine, valerenic acid, volatile/inhaled anesthetics, and lanthanum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etaqualone</b> (Aolan, Athinazone, Ethinazone) is a quinazolinone-class GABAergic {{and is an}} {{analogue}} of methaqualone {{that was}} developed in the 1960s and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and central nervous system depressant properties resulting from its agonist activity at the Î²-subtype of the GABAA receptor, and was used for the treatment of insomnia.|$|E
