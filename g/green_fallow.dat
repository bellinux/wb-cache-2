During the growing season (spring, summer and autumn aspects) the contents of ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and pH were measured. In each treatment the ammonium nitrogen predominated and with its ratio to total nitrogen ranged around 70 %. In studied variants the significance in nitrate nitrogen content was found only between 2 nd and 3 rd variant. However, statistically highly {{significant differences were found between}} spring and autumn sampling.

As a major trend, the amounts of soil organic C, microbial biomass –C and –N, Cmic to Corg ratio, and microbial activity increased in 0 - 15 cm depth in the order P –LP – LC while they decreased in 15 - 25 cm depth in the same order, both in <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> and winter rye plots. For example, in 0 - 15 cm depth soil microbial biomass –C concentration was significantly 21 % (LP) and 30 % (LC) greater in <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> plots or 15 % to 23 % greater in winter rye plots than in P. This was highly correlated {{with an increase in}} aggregate stability at these sites. Non-ploughing also resulted in a significant higher bulk density. In addition, there was much evidence that the microbial community changed towards fungi in 0 - 15 cm depth in reduced and conservation tillage plots. The abundance and fresh biomass of earthworms as well as species richness seemed to benefit from reduced soil tillage intensity. The highest amounts of abundance, fresh biomass and numbers of earthworm species in the current study were found in the plots with the layer cultivation treatment. No tillage effects were found for the amount of plant available P in soil. It can be concluded that reduced or conservation tillage in organic farming systems has beneficial effects on soil organic matter, microbial biomass and potential activity, as well as on earthworms...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the rationale of introduction and continuation of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping in large-scale upland farming. First, {{the decision on}} the introduction of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping depends {{on the scale of}} farming in terms of farming area and, if introduced, the acreage of such crops represents around 5 % of the total acreage. Second, although the introduction of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure, which is a non-cash crop, causes decline in direct profitability, overall costs are reduced. Therefore, few differences in income per unit area were found among the cases of continuous, non-continuous, and non-introduction of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping. In other words, there are few grounds for concern over a decline in profitability, for the halting or non continuation of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping because of the availability of crop subsidies.

40|$|In Hokkaido, the {{large-scale}} upland farming {{crop rotation system}} is in disorder, so its effect on land productivity is cause for concern. Therefore,the usefulness of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping is pointed out. But, {{from the fact that}} it is a non commodity crop, positioning in regard to crop selection farmers is low. So, bidding which is directed to its fixation is necessary. In this paper, we will explore the elucidation of introduction fixation conditions of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping in large-scale upland farming. The focus of this paper, Sarabetsu village in the Tokachi region, is a typical example of largescale upland farming. First, frequency and continuity of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping of upland farming were rearranged. As a result, we can see that similar types such as "continuation" "discontinuance" "non continuation", clearly showing the differences in cropping conduct. Second, based on field investigations, the primary factors of introduction fixation of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping are made clear; 1) The recognition of improvements for the crop rotation system, 2) The necessity of guaranteeing a yearly gross income, and, 3) Present scale and existence of scale enlargement conditions. Third, the crop selection of large-scale upland farming, making use of linear programming, was modeled and appraised. When obedience of the crop rotation system is designated as a purpose, <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping selection occurred according to the area. It was selected in the 5 - 10 % of the total area when it was present. Fourth, comparison of the profitability with <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping was conducted. Although it caused profit decreases, the cost decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, per area income showed the fact that there is little overall difference. From the results above, 3 points were given as a <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure introduction fixation conditions. First, introduction makes farm working adjustments possible, making the obedience of crop rotation possible. Under present conditions, recognition of the management for wheat repeated cultivation has influenced <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping introduction. Because of that, recognition improvement of the problems which occur with repeated cultivation is necessary. Second, it is important to consider,as clearly shown by analysis, that <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping does not always reduce profits, but that its overall impact is negligible. Third, it is large-scale farming with which <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping introduction has rationality, and the introduction ratio is 5 - 10 % of the cropping acreage. It is also necessary for such bidding to be done. When constructing the crop rotation system of large-scale upland farming, in the point where construction of a stable 4 year crop rotation system is made possible, the importance of <b>fallow</b> <b>green</b> manure cropping is great...|$|R

Depending on the fallowing practice, the total amount of agricultural nonpoint nutrient load can increase by 15 % or more, if fallowing is carried out by bare soil practices. If only <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> is used, the nutrient load remains approximately at the level of normal cereal cultivation.

40|$|The European Union {{has decided}} to reform its {{agricultural}} policy and decouple Common Agricultural Policy support partially from production. The {{aim of this study}} is to predict the diversity effects of agricultural policy reforms in which direct aid payments are disconnected from production, and compare the outcomes with the effects of a policy in which Common Agricultural Policy support is coupled to production. The study employs a dynamic regional sector model of Finnish agriculture. The sector model predicts regional agricultural land use, numbers of livestock, stocking densities, pesticide application areas, and nutrient balances. Diversity of agricultural land use is measured by Shannons diversity index. The results indicate that if agricultural support is independent from production, the amount of fallow land will increase considerably in the future. This will decrease the diversity of agricultural land use at landscape level, but may not be harmful at species level since <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> has some positive effects, especially on the densities and abundance of farmland birds. Instead, the decrease in bovine animals is likely to run down biological diversity, since it simplifies crop rotation and diminishes grazing. ...|$|E

Options for mechanical and cultural control of S. arvensis were studied {{in a field}} experiment on clay soil under organic production. The experiment consisted of different crop sequences: spring cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in 2001, oats, Avena sativa L., in 2002) with or without inter-row hoeing and/or stubble cultivation, bare fallow, fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), and ley with mowing. In 2003 the entire field was sown to spring wheat. Crop plant and Sonchus shoot density and dry mass prior to cereal harvest and crop yield were assessed.

40|$|Agricultural landscapes have crucial {{functions}} for biodiversity conservation. Contrary {{to the goals}} of biodiversity protection the habitat functions and the biological diversity are deteriorating, especially in arable areas. In this respect, the occurrence and abundance of bird species are important indicators for biological diversity and landscape quality. In order to gain precise information about the preferred habitats for indicator bird species in arable areas, we conducted field studies according to the territory mapping method combined with data of the agricultural land use. We studied 29 agricultural areas, each with a size of 1 km x 1 km in 2009 and 2010. In a hierarchical design we analyzed habitat characteristics on different spatial scales: agricultural landscape, sections of agricultural landscape, habitats, including crops, vegetation structure, and habitat matrix. The species diversity and the abundances were calculated for the various spatial scales {{in relation to the}} agricultural crops. For example, the abundances of the skylark pointed to a preference for a more open, light vegetation structure (height, coverage, density) of the crops. With help of vegetation matrix analysis the habitat configurations of the territories for skylark, corn bunting, yellowhammer, yellow wagtail, whinchat and redbacked shrike were analyzed. In comparison of this configurations to the habitat structures in the agricultural landscape, significant deficits of suitable habitats for farmland bird are evident. Especially, a need for natural and semi-natural grassland vegetation, e. g. self <b>greened</b> <b>fallow</b> fields and bird species specific minimum occurrence of semi-natural habitat structures like hedges or small water bodys become clear.

" Japanese economists have discussed regional development policy and an environmental policy mainly for paddy agriculture and livestock farming in Japan, however, upland agriculture plays as {{an important role in}} preserving natural resources and in providing rural amenities as paddy farming. On the other hand, there has been significant environmental stress caused by the application of large amounts of fertilizer and pesticides, and by specialized farming. Thus, upland agriculture is as damaging to the environment as livestock farming. The scale of upland farms in Hokkaido is larger than in other areas. They also have a crop rotation system that changes between potatoes, sugar beets, wheat and beans. This farming style began in the 1960 s and was later promoted by the "Agriculture Basic Law.

In this study,mineralization of C and N was investigated {{in a range of}} low temperatures,including thawing and freezing, that are characteristic to autumn green manureincorporation and its decomposition. The pre-crop effect of green manuring wasfurther tested with spring wheat under field conditions. We hypothesized thatdelaying green manure incorporation in the autumn would reduce the risk of Nlosses from the field and maximize the N transfer to a successive spring wheatcrop. To test the hypothesis, N mineralization was followed in alaboratory experiment where red clover (Trifoliumpratense L.) shoots were incubated at 4 ¿ 8 °Cfor 40 ¿ 80 days to simulate early autumn, delayed autumn and late autumnincorporation of a green manuring crop, followed by an incubation at¿ 2 °C or at ¿ 2 °C to+ 4 °C for 25 days to simulate winter conditions.

40|$|Fusarium head blight, {{caused by}} fungi from the genus Fusarium, {{is one of}} the most harmful cereal diseases, {{resulting}} not only in severe yield losses but also in mycotoxin contaminated and health-threatening grains. Fusarium head blight is caused by a diverse set of species that have different host ranges, mycotoxin profiles and responses to agricultural practices. Thus, understanding the composition of Fusarium communities in the field is crucial for estimating their impact and also for the development of effective control measures. Up to now, most molecular tools that monitor Fusarium communities on plants are limited to certain species and do not distinguish other plant associated fungi. To close these gaps, we developed a sequencing-based community profiling methodology for crop-associated fungi with a focus on the genus Fusarium. By analyzing a 1600 bp long amplicon spanning the highly variable segments ITS and D 1 –D 3 of the ribosomal operon by PacBio SMRT sequencing, we were able to robustly quantify Fusarium down to species level through clustering against reference sequences. The newly developed methodology was successfully validated in mock communities and provided similar results as the culture-based assessment of Fusarium communities by seed health tests in grain samples from different crop species. Finally, we exemplified the newly developed methodology in a field experiment with a wheat-maize crop sequence under different cover crop and tillage regimes. We analyzed wheat straw residues, cover crop shoots and maize grains and we could reveal that the cover crop hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) acts as a potent alternative host for Fusarium (OTU F. ave/tri) showing an eightfold higher relative abundance compared with other cover crop treatments. Moreover, as the newly developed methodology also allows to trace other crop-associated fungi, we found that vetch and <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> hosted further fungal plant pathogens including Zymoseptoria tritici.

Little {{is known about the}} interactive effects of soil fertility management and soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and SOM dynamics in tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed arable systems were compared to a long-term <b>green</b> <b>fallow</b> system representing a relatively undisturbed reference. Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters. Factor analysis showed that 35. 3 % of the total sample variation in aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was explained by earthworm parameters, and 25. 5 % by termite parameters. Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome. The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools than differences in termite populations. Highlights ¿ Application of farm yard manure + fertilizer improved aggregate stability and C and N stabilization in soil. ¿ Application of maize stover did not improve soil aggregation and C and N stabilization. ¿ Farm yard manure + fertilizer application enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass. ¿ Higher earthworm diversity and biomass enhanced aggregate and C and N stabilization. ¿ Earthworms were more important drivers of aggregate and C and N stabilization than termites...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} economic efficiency of nutrient abatement measures in agriculture, {{focusing on the}} case of Finland. The thesis consists of an introductory article and four separate studies, which consider the nutrient abatement problem from different angles. Nutrient abatement was put on the environmental policy agenda decades ago because of the adverse impacts of eutrophication in surface waters, and remains there as water quality, in Europe and elsewhere, has not reached satisfactory levels. In particular, the Water Framework Directive of the European Union requires the member states to reach a good surface water status. In Finland, agriculture accounts for a major share of nutrient loads and could {{play an important role in}} achieving the water quality targets. However, the current environmental policy, relying on subsidies paid to farmers, has not met the abatement targets set for agriculture. As the European farm subsidy regime is shifting, new environmental policies could be adopted. For identifying the policies that would reach water protection targets, more information on costs-efficient measures is required. The objective of this dissertation is to estimate nutrient abatement costs in agriculture and to rank the measures in terms of cost-efficiency. The focus is on the measures that have been considered in the agri-environmental support scheme. The dissertation relies on empirical numerical models that are based on microeconomic theory. Numerical representative farm models were developed for dairy and crop production. Abatement costs were found to fluctuate, depending on the target abatement levels, environmental and market conditions as well as production structure of agriculture. It is argued that reaching the national abatement targets, set by the government for 2015, is unlikely; extending the measures currently common in Finland is insufficient. For such a high abatement targets, policies should aim at increasing the share of <b>green</b> <b>fallow,</b> which can be effective in cutting down both nitrogen and phosphorus loads and increases biodiversity.

40|$|In two {{organically}} cultivated field trials, {{located in}} Germany and Greece, effects of reduced primary tillage systems on root and shoot growth of cereals were investigated. The field trial in Rommersheim near Mainz, Germany, {{was established in}} 1994. A similar experiment was established in 1995 located in Athens, Greece. Mouldboard plough, two-layer plough and layer cultivator were used in Germany. Mouldboard plough, rotary hoe and zero tillage were applied in Greece. The field experiment in Germany was performed on a clay loam soil with a 5 -year crop rotation (<b>green</b> <b>fallow,</b> winter wheat/catch crop, peas, winter rye/catch crop, spring barley) in a split-plot design. The investigated crop was spring barley and winter rye. Tillage systems were implemented after cereal harvests only. The field experiment in Greece was performed on a clay loam soil with a 3 -year crop rotation (cereal, green manure, cotton) and a split-plot design. The test crop was winter wheat. The parameters measured in both field trials were soil physical and chemical parameters, as well as root and shoot parameters of the cereals. In Germany higher tillage intensity implemented on spring barley on one hand reduced aggregate stability and decreased the penetration resistant, especially in lower depths. On the other hand, it increased rooting density, nutrient uptake and crop development. Dry matter production of weeds was significantly lower in the ploughed fields compared with those treated with the cultivator. Correspondingly, higher grain yields were positively correlated with tillage intensity. Positive effects of the cultivator on soil properties (e. g. significant higher aggregate stability compared to ploughing) became less significant. The two-layer plough used in Germany combines the effects of turning and mixing the soil in the upper plough depth, while loosening the soil in the deeper plough layer, resulting in a good soil structure. The differences between the tillage systems in the parameters measured became less when they were releated to the winter rye. This fact {{was due to the}} lack of tillage before the seeding of the crop. In the experiment field of Athens, under minimum and zero tillage, it was found that root and shoot parameters were significantly higher than those of ploughed plots. Physical and chemical soil properties were also improved compared to those of ploughed soil. Yields were found to be significantly correlated to the root parameters and the soil properties, and this was confirmed by the significant yield increase observed under minimum tillage. Concluding the results show that under conditions of temperate humid climate sufficient control of weed and optimized nutrient management in organic farming can only be ensured by turning and mixing the soil. Thus, a general renunciation of ploughing cannot be suggested. Under conditions of primary tillage becomes more important for the main soil properties and more Mediterranean climate and limited soil water availability, reduced profitable in the long term...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years, an {{increasing}} number of stockless farms in Europe converted to organic farming practice without re-establishing a livestock. Due to the lack of animal manure as a nutrient input, the relocation and the external input of nutrients is limited in those organic cropping systems. The introduction of a one-year <b>green</b> manure <b>fallow</b> in a 4 -year crop rotation, including clover-grass mixtures as a green manure crop is the classical strategy to solve {{at least some of the}} problems related to the missing livestock. The development of new crop rotations, including an extended use of catch crops and annual green manure (legumes) may be another possibility avoiding the economical loss during the fallow year. Modelling of the C and N turnover in the soil-plant-atmosphere system using the soil-plant-atmosphere model DAISY is one of the tools used for the development of new organic crop rotations. In this paper, we will present simulations based on a field experiment with incorporation of different catch crops. An important factor for the development of new crop rotations for stockless organic farming systems is the expected N mineralisation and immobilisation after incorporation of the plant materials. Therefore, special emphasise will be put on the simulation of N-mineralisation/-immobilisation and of soil microbial biomass N. Furthermore, particulate organic matter C and N as an indicator of remaining plant material under decomposition will be investigated. ...|$|R

Wheat grain and straw yield responded positively to fertilizers N and P, however all the variations observed in wheat yield are not correlated with extractable values of N and P. The polynomial correlation coefficient between NaHCO 3 -extractable soil P values and grain yield was fairly high.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{previous}} {{cultivation of}} green manures and mechanical soil decompression are options to minimize compaction of the topsoil in no-tilage system (NTS) set in different production {{systems in the}} Brazilian Savannah. In addition, {{it is essential to}} relate these agricultural practices with the economic benefits generated through the production cycles. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate economically the effect of sporadic mechanical decompression of the soil and previous cultivation of green manure in the production and net gain margin of upland rice and "winter" common bean, under sprinkler irrigation, in NTS in lowland Brazilian savannah. This study was developed in the 2012 / 13 harvest and 2013 winter in Selvíria, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in an clay texture Oxisol in the savanah in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, in a randomized block design arranged in a 5 x 2 factorial arrangement with four replications. The treatments were a combination of five <b>green</b> manures (<b>fallow</b> (control), Cajanus cajan, Crotalaria juncea, Pennisetum glaucum and Urochloa ruziziensis) with and without mechanical soil scarification. The yields of upland rice and common bean grains were not influenced by the previous green manure cultivation; the upland rice grown in succession to Cajanus cajan in the presence of mechanical soil scarification provided greater increase in grain yield and higher gross margin profit. Beans cultivated in succession to Crotalaria juncea and Pennisetum glaucum in the presence of mechanical soil scarification, followed by rice cultivation, provided greater increases in grain yield and gross profit margins...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) in soil and plants in agricultural land near an electronic waste recycling site in east China {{has become a}} great threat to the neighboring environmental quality and human health. Soil and plant samples collected from land under different utilization, including fallow plots, vegetable plots, plots with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as <b>green</b> manure, <b>fallow</b> plots under long-term flooding and fallow plots under alternating wet and dry periods, together with plant samples from relative plots were analyzed for six PAE compounds nominated as prior pollutants by USEPA. In the determined samples, the concentrations of six target PAE pollutants ranged from 0. 31 - 2. 39 mg/kg in soil to 1. 81 - 5. 77 mg/kg in various plants (dry weight/DW), and their bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranged from 5. 8 to 17. 9. Health risk assessments were conducted on target PAEs, known as typical environmental estrogen analogs, based on their accumulation in the edible parts of vegetables. Preliminary risk assessment to human health from soil and daily vegetable intake indicated that DEHP may present a high-exposure risk on all ages {{of the population in}} the area by soil ingestion or vegetable consumption. The potential damage that the target PAE compounds may pose to human health should be taken into account in further comprehensive risk assessments in e-waste recycling sites areas. Moreover, alfalfa removed substantial amounts of PAEs from the soil, and its use can be considered a good strategy for in situ remediation of PAEs...|$|R

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of green manure and composted cattle manure on the subsequent winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop in a semiarid environment. Dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) was seeded in early April and terminated at first flower in late June. Composted cattle manure was applied at 0, 11. 2 or 22. 5 Mgha− 1 just prior to pea termination. Winter wheat was planted in mid September following the green manure or tilled summer fallow. No positive wheat response to green manure or composted cattle manure was observed in any of the 3 years of the study. In 2 of the 3 years, wheat yields and grain test weight were reduced following green manure. Green manure reduced grain yields compared with summer fallow by 220 and 1190 kgha− 1 in 2009 and 2010, respectively. This may partially be explained by 40 and 47 mm less soil water at wheat planting following peas compared with tilled summer fallow in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Also, in 2008 and 2009, soil nitrate level averaged 45 kgha− 1 higher for black <b>fallow</b> compared with <b>green</b> manure <b>fallow</b> when no compost was added. Organic growers in the semiarid Central Great Plains will be challenged to supply N fertility to their winter wheat crop in a rapid and consistent manner as a result of the inherently variable precipitation.

40|$|Many {{examples}} can {{be given}} of biologically orientated working strategies that aim to increase farm soil fertility. One strategy with considerable biomass transfer potential is the gathering of green plant material from farm boundaries or outside the farm {{to add to the}} cropped area. Most of the plants used for <b>green</b> manure, improved <b>fallows,</b> and even for improved animal manure production are leguminous species. Under favourable conditions, they can provide a practical way of securing nitrogen supply via biological nitrogen fixation and are, therefore, genuine nitrogen suppliers on farms. There is, however, evidence that several non−leguminous plants accumulate as much nitrogen in their leaves as legumes and that these also have very high levels of phosphorus. This is most probably because these, often indigenous, species are better adapted to the area, have a greater root volume and a special ability to recover scarce nutrients from the soil. When their biomass is transferred from where it has been produced to where it can be used it provides extra nutrient input of great benefit to crop producers.
