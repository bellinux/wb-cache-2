5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an electric potential is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called <b>Fermi</b> <b>gas)</b> through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship and limiting mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold <b>Fermi</b> <b>gas</b> in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2.

40|$|Unitary <b>fermi</b> <b>gases</b> {{have been}} widely studied as they provide a {{tabletop}} archetype for research on strongly coupled many body systems and perfect fluids. Research into unitary <b>fermi</b> <b>gases</b> can provide insight into may other strongly interacting systems including high temperature superconductor, quark-gluon plasmas, and neutron stars. Within the unitary regime, the equilibrium transport coefficients and thermodynamic properties are universal functions of density and temperature. Thus, unitary <b>fermi</b> <b>gases</b> provide a archetype to study nonperturbative many-body physics, which is of fundamental significance and crosses several fields. This thesis reports on two topics regarding unitary <b>fermi</b> <b>gases.</b> A recent string theory conjecture gives a lower bound for the dimensionless ratio of shear viscosity of entropy, η=s ≥ 4 πℏ =kb.

Using a stochastic formulation of hydrodynamics, we calculate a lower bound for this ratio accounting for the momentum dissipation from fluctuations. This lower bound is in good agreement with both theoretical and experimental results. The second question addressed is the simulation of elliptic flow. Elliptic flow, first observed in 2002, is a characteristic of strongly coupled systems and has been studied in both quark-gluon plasmas and unitary <b>fermi</b> <b>gases.</b> As such, simulations of these systems are of interest.

Due to the complicated phase structures of population-imbalanced <b>Fermi</b> <b>gases,</b> past works mainly focus on unpolarized <b>Fermi</b> <b>gases.</b> Here we investigate the shear viscosity of homogeneous, population-imbalanced <b>Fermi</b> <b>gases</b> with tunable attractive interactions at finite temperatures by using a pairing fluctuation theory for thermodynamical quantities and a gauge-invariant linear response theory for transport coefficients. In the unitary and BEC regimes, the shear viscosity increases with the polarization because the excess majority fermions cause gapless excitations acting like a normal fluid. In the weak BEC regime the excess fermions also suppress the noncondensed pairs at low polarization, and we found a minimum in the ratio of shear viscosity and relaxation time. To help constrain the relaxation time from linear response theory, we derive an exact relation connecting some thermodynamic quantities and transport coefficients at the mean-field level for unitary Fermi superfluids with population imbalance.
