5|$|Development {{stopped in}} late 1998, {{with the final}} release being on 25 November 1998. The W3C did not {{consider}} <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> to be high priority, and thus, the Arena browser was entirely shut down in favor of outside Linux-community development.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{electric}} {{plants were}} traditionally built {{exclusively on the}} edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface. The development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range. <b>Demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> are operational in Landau-Pfalz, Germany, and Soultz-sous-Forêts, France, while an earlier effort in Basel, Switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes. Other <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> are under construction in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E

25|$|Governments {{around the}} world have {{provided}} a range of different types of funding support to CCS <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects,</b> including tax credits, allocations and grants. The funding is associated with both a desire to accelerate innovation activities for CCS as a low-carbon technology and the need for economic stimulus activities. As of 2011, approximately US$23.5bn has been made available to support large-scale CCS <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> {{around the world}}.|$|E
25|$|In the US, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Urban Maglev Technology Demonstration program {{funded the}} design of several {{low-speed}} urban maglev <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects.</b> It assessed HSST for the Maryland Department of Transportation and maglev technology for the Colorado Department of Transportation. The FTA also funded work by General Atomics at California University of Pennsylvania to evaluate the MagneMotion M3 and of the Maglev2000 of Florida superconducting EDS system. Other US urban maglev <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> of note are the LEVX in Washington State and the Massachusetts-based Magplane.|$|E

25|$|The first Regulation was {{superseded}} by Regulation No 2242/87 – ACE II – which ran until July 1991. Its scope was widened {{to include the}} financing of <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> {{in the fields of}} waste, contaminated site restoration and remedial action for land damaged by fire, erosion and desertification.|$|E
25|$|Some {{recreational}} demonstration lands {{were also}} added to Acadia, Shenandoah, White Sands, and Hopewell Village.

25|$|The {{zero-energy}} building {{concept has}} been a progressive evolution from other low-energy building designs. Among these, the Canadian R-2000 and the German passive house standards have been internationally influential. Collaborative government <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects,</b> such as the superinsulated Saskatchewan House, and the International Energy Agency's Task 13, have also played their part.|$|E

25|$|The 1987 {{amendments}} {{created the}} Nonpoint Source Management Program under CWA section 319. This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects,</b> technology transfer, education, training, technical assistance and related activities {{designed to reduce}} nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} program included Parts A and B. Part-C-like {{plans have}} existed as <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> in Medicare {{since the early}} 1980s but the Part was formalized by 1997 legislation. (Simplistically, Part C is a voucher program similar to the insurance reform included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 as amended). Part D was introduced January 1, 2006.|$|E

25|$|The ACA also {{provided}} bonus payments to plans with ratings of 4 (out of 5) stars or more. The Obama administration launched an $8.35 billion demonstration project in 2012 that increased {{the size of}} the bonus payments and increased the number of plans receiving bonus payments, providing bonus payments to the vast majority of Medicare Advantage plans. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) this demonstration project will cost more than the previous 85 <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> beginning in 1995 combined.|$|E
25|$|Under a 2009 agreement, Loy Yang Power and MBD Energy Ltd {{will build}} a pilot Fossil fuel power plant at the Latrobe Valley power station in Australia using biosequestration {{technology}} {{in the form of}} an algal synthesiser system. Captured CO2 from the waste exhaust flue gases will be injected into circulating waste water to grow oil-rich algae where sunlight and nutrients will produce heavy oil-laden slurry that can make high grade oil for energy, or stock feed. Other commercial <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> involving biosequestration of CO2 at point of emission have begun in Australia.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} 19 companies Australia-wide spending A$654million in exploration programmes in 141 areas. In South Australia, {{which is expected}} to dominate the sector's growth, 12 companies have already applied for 116 areas and can be expected to invest A$524million (US$435 M) in their projects by the next six years. Ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows, by 2010, with at least three power generation <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> coming on stream by 2012. A geothermal power plant is generating 80kW of electricity at Birdsville, in southwest Queensland.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} energy efficiency <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> was the 1986 Energy World exhibition in Milton Keynes, which attracted international interest. Fifty-one houses were built, designed to be at least 30% more efficient than the Building Regulations then in force. This was calculated using the Milton Keynes Energy Cost Index (MKECI), a test-bed for the subsequent SAP rating system and the National Home Energy Rating scheme. Energy World was preceded by the earlier Salford low-energy houses, built in the early 1980s, which continue to be 40% more efficient than the 2010 Building Regulations.|$|E
25|$|Robin Rigg Wind Farm in the Solway Firth is Scotland's only commercial-scale, {{operational}} {{offshore wind}} farm, sited at Robin Rigg, a sandbank midway between the Galloway and Cumbrian coasts in the Solway Firth. It has 60 Vestas V90-3MW wind turbines {{with a total}} installed capacity of 180 MW. Scotland {{is also home to}} two offshore wind demonstration projects: The two turbine, 10 MW Beatrice Demonstrator Project located in the Moray Firth, and the single turbine, 7 MW Fife Energy Park Offshore Demonstration Wind Turbine in the Firth of Forth. There are also several other commercial-scale and <b>demonstration</b> <b>projects</b> in the planning stages.|$|E
25|$|Models {{released}} to the market in 2012 and 2013 include the BMW ActiveE, Coda, Renault Fluence Z.E., Tesla Model S, Honda Fit EV, Toyota RAV4 EV, Renault Zoe, Roewe E50, Mahindra e2o, Chevrolet Spark EV, Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG Electric Drive, Fiat 500e, Volkswagen e-Up!, BMW i3, and Kandi EV.
