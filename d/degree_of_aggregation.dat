6000|$|I WILL here {{interrupt}} {{my account}} of {{the movements of the}} leaves, and describe the phenomenon of aggregation, to which subject I have already alluded. If the tentacles of a young, yet fully matured leaf, that has never been excited or become inflected, be examined, the cells forming the pedicels are seen to be filled with homogeneous, purple fluid. The walls are lined by a layer of colourless, circulating protoplasm; but this can be seen with much greater distinctness after the process of aggregation has been partly effected than before. The purple fluid which exudes from a crushed tentacle is somewhat coherent, and does not mingle with the surrounding water; it contains much flocculent or granular matter. But this matter may have been generated by the cells having been crushed; some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> having been thus almost instantly caused. [page 39] ...|$|E

40|$|Distributions of {{the intensities of}} {{helminth}} infections {{within their}} host populations are invariably aggregated. In {{the case of the}} intestinal nematodes, the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> {{have been shown to be}} species specific, and constant for any given species despite geographical variation in study sites.

This paper investigates the patterns <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> in schistosome egg counts in different endemic areas in Africa (data sets were obtained from Burundi, Cameroon, Tanzania, Zambia and Zaire).

60|$|This salt, when {{absorbed by}} the roots, does not cause the tentacles to be inflected. A plant was so placed in a {{solution}} of {{one part of the}} carbonate to 146 of water that the young uninjured roots could be observed. The terminal cells, which were of a pink colour, instantly became colourless, and their limpid contents cloudy, like a mezzo-tinto engraving, so that some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> was almost instantly caused; but no further change ensued, and the absorbent hairs were not visibly affected. The tentacles [page 142] did not bend. Two other plants were placed with their roots surrounded by damp moss, in half an ounce (14.198 ml.) of a solution of one part of the carbonate to 218 of water, and were observed for 24 hrs.; but not a single tentacle was inflected.

This quantity caused all the tentacles to be inflected, but after 24 hrs. {{there was only a}} trace of aggregation. One of these same leaves was then placed in a weak solution of the carbonate, and after 1 hr. 45 m. the tentacles for half their lengths showed an astonishing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation.</b> Two other leaves were then placed in a much stronger solution of one part of the nitrate to 146 of water (3 grs. to 1 oz.); in one of these there was no marked change after 3 hrs.; but in the other there was a trace of aggregation after 52 m., and this was plainly marked after 1 hr. 22 m., but even after 2 hrs. 12 m. there was certainly not more aggregation than would have fol- [page 50] lowed from an immersion of from 5 m. to 10 m. in an equally strong solution of the carbonate.|$|E

A third leaf was left in water at 125o, until it cooled, and when examined after 1 hr. 45 m., the inflected tentacles showed some aggregation, which became after 3 hrs. more strongly marked, but did not subsequently increase. Lastly, a leaf was waved for 1 m. in water at 120o (48o.8 Cent.) and then left for 1 hr. 26 m. in cold water; the tentacles were but little inflected, and there was only here and there a trace of aggregation.

TEM observations evidenced uniform deposition of thin PPy film on the functionalised nanotubes, whereas co-deposition of PPy and polystyrene sulfonic acid (PSS) lead to thick polymer coverage on hydrated alumina. Modification with polymer complexes resulted in moderately dispersed PDAMIPs {{which is due to}} the various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> and coalescence. FTIR revealed compact and dense PPy structure on the functionalised MWCNTs while it was not the case on alumina and the PSS modified nanotubes. Closer interaction of PPy with the MWCNTs resulted in enhanced charge mobility, whereas greater electroactivity and reversibility of PPy were noted to samples containing functionalised nanotubes and low amount of PSS. Rheological study verified moderate micron-scale dispersity and the modification caused various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregations</b> <b>of</b> the PDAMIPs.

60|$|I made also several {{experiments}} {{on the action}} of the vapour of the carbonate on the glands; but will give only a few cases. The cut end of the footstalk of a young leaf was protected with sealing-wax, and was then placed under a small bell-glass, with a large pinch of the carbonate. After 10 m. the glands showed a considerable <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation,</b> and the protoplasm lining the cells of the pedicels was a little separated from the walls. Another leaf was left for 50 m. with the same result, excepting that the hairs became throughout their whole length of a brownish colour. In a third leaf, which was exposed for 1 hr. 50 m., there was much aggregated matter in the glands; and some of the masses showed signs of breaking up into brown granular matter. This leaf was again placed in the vapour, so that it was exposed altogether for 5 hrs. 30 m.; and now, though I examined a large number of glands, aggregated masses were found in only two or three; in all the others, the masses, which before had been globular, were converted into brown, opaque, granular matter. We thus see that exposure to the vapour for a considerable time produces the same effects as long immersion in a strong solution. In both cases there could hardly be a doubt that the salt had been absorbed chiefly or exclusively by the glands.|$|E
60|$|The Effects of Immersion in Water and {{in various}} Solutions on the {{subsequent}} Action of Phosphate and Carbonate of Ammonia.--We {{have seen in}} the third and seventh chapters that immersion in distilled water causes after a time some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> of the protoplasm, and a moderate amount of inflection, {{especially in the case of}} plants which have been kept at a rather high temperature. Water does not excite a copious secretion of mucus. We have here to consider the effects of immersion in various fluids on the subsequent action of salts of ammonia and other stimulants. Four leaves which had been left for 24 hrs. in water were given bits of meat, but did not clasp them. Ten leaves, after a similar immersion, were left for 24 hrs. in a powerful solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia, and only one showed even a trace of inflection. Three of these leaves, on being left for an additional day in the solution, still remained quite unaffected. When, however, some of these leaves, which had been first immersed in water for 24 hrs., and then in the phosphate for 24 hrs. were placed in a solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 218 of water), the protoplasm in the cells of the tentacles became in a few hours strongly aggregated, showing that this salt had been absorbed and taken effect.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{leaves were}} left for 4 hrs. 30 m. in a {{solution}} of one part of white sugar to 146 of water, and no aggregation ensued; on being placed {{in a solution}} of this same strength of carbonate of ammonia, they were acted on in 5 m.; as was likewise a leaf which had been left for 1 hr. 45 m. in a moderately thick solution of gum arabic. Several other leaves were immersed for some hours in denser solutions of sugar, gum, and starch, {{and they had the}} contents of their cells greatly aggregated. This [page 52] effect may be attributed to exosmose; for the leaves in the syrup became quite flaccid, and those in the gum and starch somewhat flaccid, with their tentacles twisted about in the most irregular manner, the longer ones like corkscrews. We shall hereafter see that solutions of these substances, when placed on the discs of leaves, do not incite inflection. Particles of soft sugar were added to the secretion round several glands and were soon dissolved, causing a great increase of the secretion, no doubt by exosmose; and after 24 hrs. the cells showed a certain amount of aggregation, though the tentacles were not inflected. Glycerine causes in a few minutes well-pronounced aggregation, commencing as usual within the glands and then travelling down the tentacles; and this I presume may be attributed to the strong attraction of this substance for water. Immersion for several hours in water causes some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation.</b> Twenty leaves were first carefully examined, and re-examined after having been left immersed in distilled water for various periods, with the following results. It is rare to find even a trace of aggregation until 4 or 5 and generally not until several more hours have elapsed. When however a leaf becomes quickly inflected in water, as sometimes happens, especially during very warm weather, aggregation may occur in little over 1 hr. In all cases leaves left in water for more than 24 hrs. have their glands blackened, which shows that their contents are aggregated; and in the specimens which were carefully examined, there was fairly well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the pedicels. These trials were made with cut off-leaves, and {{it occurred to me that}} this circumstance might influence the result, as the footstalks would not perhaps absorb water quickly enough to supply the glands as they continued to secrete. But this view was proved erroneous, for a plant with uninjured roots, bearing four leaves, was submerged in distilled water for 47 hrs., and the glands were blackened, though the tentacles were very little inflected. In one of these leaves there was only a slight <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> in the tentacles; in the second rather more, the purple contents of the cells being a little separated from the walls; in the third and fourth, which were pale leaves, the aggregation in the upper parts of the pedicels was well marked. In these leaves the little masses of protoplasm, many of which were oval, slowly changed their forms and positions; so that a submergence for 47 hrs. had not killed the protoplasm. In a previous trial with a submerged plant, the tentacles were not in the least inflected. [page 53] ...|$|E

60|$|WE {{have seen}} in the {{previous}} chapters that many widely different stimulants, mechanical and chemical, excite the movement of the tentacles, {{as well as of the}} blade of the leaf; and we must now consider, firstly, what are the points which are irritable or sensitive, and secondly how the motor impulse is transmitted from one point to another. The glands are almost exclusively the seat of irritability, yet this irritability must extend for a very short distance below them; for when they were cut off with a sharp pair of scissors without being themselves touched, the tentacles often became inflected. These headless tentacles frequently re-expanded; and when afterwards drops of the two most powerful known stimulants were placed on the cut-off ends, no effect was produced. Nevertheless these headless tentacles are capable of subsequent inflection if excited by an impulse sent from the disc. I succeeded on several occasions in crushing glands between fine pincers, but this did not excite any movement; nor did raw meat and salts of ammonia, when placed on such crushed glands. [page 230] It is probable that they were killed so instantly that they were not able to transmit any motor impulse; for in six observed cases (in two of which however the gland was quite pinched off) the protoplasm within the cells of the tentacles did not become aggregated; whereas in some adjoining tentacles, which were inflected from having been roughly touched by the pincers, it was well aggregated. In like manner the protoplasm does not become aggregated when a leaf is instantly killed by being dipped into boiling water. On the other hand, in several cases in which tentacles became inflected after their glands had been cut off with sharp scissors, a distinct though moderate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>aggregation</b> supervened.|$|E

The protoplasm within the cells was not killed, for it was seen to be in distinct movement; and the leaves, having been left in cold water for 20 hrs., re-expanded. Another leaf was immersed in water at 100o (37.7o Cent.), which was raised to 120o (48o.8 Cent.); and all the tentacles, except the extreme marginal ones, soon became closely inflected. The leaf was now placed in cold water, and in 7 hrs. 30 m. it had partly, and in 10 hrs. fully, re-expanded. On the following morning it was immersed in a weak solution of carbonate of [page 69] ammonia, and the glands quickly became black, with strongly marked aggregation in the tentacles, showing that the protoplasm was alive, and that the glands had not lost their power of absorption. Another leaf was placed in water at 110o (43o.3 Cent.) which was raised to 120o (48o.8 Cent.); and every tentacle, excepting one, was quickly and closely inflected. This leaf was now immersed in a few drops of a strong solution of carbonate of ammonia (one part to 109 of water); in 10 m. all the glands became intensely black, and in 2 hrs. the protoplasm in the cells of the pedicels was well aggregated. Another leaf was suddenly plunged, and as usual waved about, in water at 120o, and the tentacles became inflected in from 2 m. to 3 m., but only so as to stand at right angles to the disc. The leaf was now placed in the same solution (viz. one part of carbonate of ammonia to 109 of water, or 4 grs. to 1 oz., which I will for the future designate as the strong solution), and when I looked at it again after the interval of an hour, the glands were blackened, and there was well-marked aggregation. After an additional interval of 4 hrs. the tentacles had become much more inflected. It deserves notice that a solution as strong as this never causes inflection in ordinary cases.

The opacity of tofu gel and off-white color typical of standard uncooked firm tofu is due to the scattering of light by the colloidal particles of the tofu. The addition of higher levels of calcium salts and high protein content contributes to forming a denser and more aggregated gel network which disperses more light resulting a tofu with a whiter gel appearance.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of Al speciation and hydrolysis in geopolymer systems are investigated {{based on the}} partial charge model together with preliminary experimental validation. Calculation of the partial charges of species discloses that the positive partial charge of the Al atom is always {{higher than that of}} Si atom under conditions of similar pH values, suggesting greater tendency of [Al(OH) 4]- tetrahedra to attract negatively charged groups from other species. Given Al atom with four hydroxyl groups under alkaline conditions and the potential to expand its coordination number with greater ease, condensation reactions involving aluminate species appear to occur much more readily. Thus, the model essentially predicts that aluminate species promote condensations reaction owing to factors such as their partial charge and the number of hydroxyl groups, implying that the solubility of aluminate sources (i. e. metakaolin) and the distribution of [Al(OH) 4] - ions have an important influence on the mechanical properties of inorganic polymers.
