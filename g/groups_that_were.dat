Moreover, groups consisting of local females supported the Greek side in several ways, particularly in the transportation of guns, food, clothes, and other important supplies. On specific occasions women also participated in the armed conflicts against the Ottoman forces, {{some of them were}} distinguished in the battlefield, like Maria Nastouli, who reached the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Playtex {{split into}} two companies, Playtex Apparel and Playtex Family Products, {{in a series of}} {{financial}} transactions totaling $1.3 billion. The transactions allowed Smilow to buy out other Playtex shareholders and put ownership of the brand into two separate investment <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> owned by Smilow and other Playtex executives. In 1990 Playtex Products acquired cosmetics brand Maybelline for $300 million.($ in modern dollars). The next year Smilow sold Playtex Apparel to the Sara Lee Corporation, transferring the Bali, Hanes, and Cross Your Heart brands for $571 million, ($ in modern dollars) but keeping the Playtex Family Products Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into questionable lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> {{never thought}} to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} today. With highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{launched a}} crackdown against {{a number of}} civil society organisations. Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Independent Maya {{frequently}} attacked Christianised Maya {{settlements and}} encouraged such settlements {{to abandon their}} new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.|$|E

5|$|Khánh {{selected}} a cabinet of thirteen ministers and two Secretaries of State at ministerial level, and chose new provincial and district chiefs. He originally tried to include {{members of a}} variety of political and religious groups including representatives of the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo sects, who still had remnants of their private armies intact after their defeat by Diệm in 1955. Although Khánh insisted that he had no party affiliation, the orientation of his government was toward the Đại Việt, who held many of the key posts in the government. This provoked bitterness from other anti-communist nationalists and <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> banned under Diệm and were seeking a greater role in public life, as well as from a younger generation who felt that the established nationalist parties were responsible for dividing the people.|$|E
5|$|Many Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{officers}} {{were members of}} other anti-communist nationalist <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> opposed to Diệm, such as the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam) and the Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng (VNQDĐ, Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which were both established before World War II. The VNQDĐ had run a military academy in Yunnan near the Chinese border {{with the assistance of}} their nationalist Chinese counterparts, the Kuomintang. Diệm and his family had crushed all alternative anti-communist nationalists, and his politicisation of the army had alienated the servicemen. Officers were promoted on the basis of political allegiance rather than competence, meaning that many VNQDĐ and Đại Việt trained {{officers were}} denied such promotions. They felt that politically minded officers, who joined Diệm's secret Catholic-dominated Cần Lao Party, which was used to control South Vietnamese society, were rewarded with promotion rather than those most capable.|$|E
5|$|The book {{became an}} {{important}} element in the creation and propagation of the so-called Black Legend – the tradition of describing the Spanish empire as exceptionally morally corrupt and violent. It was republished several times by <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> critical of the Spanish realm for political or religious reasons. The first edition in translation was published in Dutch in 1578, during the religious persecution of Dutch Protestants by the Spanish crown, followed by editions in French (1578), English (1583), and German (1599) – all countries where religious wars were raging. The first edition published in Spain after Las Casas's death appeared in Barcelona during the Catalan Revolt of 1646. The book was banned by the Aragonese inquisition in 1659.|$|E

5|$|The {{eruption}} {{of the conflict}} provided the pretext for violence between highland Merina and coastal Malagasy of other ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> linked to precolonial history and politics. Merina Hova elites founded the MDRM {{not only in the}} interest of ending French rule, but also in regaining the political dominance of the Merina upon independence. In reaction to the founding of the MDRM, in 1946 the Party for the Disinherited of Madagascar (Parti des déshérités de Madagascar, PADESM) was formed. It attracted membership from members of coastal communities formerly subjugated by the Merina empire, as well as highland-based descendents of former Merina slaves. Initially a non-nationalist party, PADESM eventually favored a gradual process toward independence that would preserve close ties to France and prevent the reemergence of the precolonial Merina hegemony. The French authorities tacitly supported PADESM, which accused MDRM of launching the uprising to re-establish Merina rule. By aligning itself with PADESM, Socialist-dominated French politicians sought to cast themselves as champions of the oppressed masses against the exploitative Hova elites.|$|E
5|$|The first Celtic people {{arrived in}} Poland, coming from Bohemia and Moravia, around or after 400 BC, {{just a few}} decades after their La Tène culture was born. They formed several {{enclaves}} mostly {{in the southern part}} of the country, within the Pomeranian or Lusatian populations or in areas abandoned by those people. The cultures or <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> Celtic, or had a Celtic element in them (mixed Celtic and autochthonous), lasted at their furthest extent to 170 AD (the Púchov culture). After the Celts moved in, and during their tenure (they had always remained only a small minority), the bulk of the population had begun acquiring the traits of archaeological cultures with a dominant Proto-Germanic or Germanic component. In Europe the expansion of Rome and the Germanic pressure checked and reversed the Celtic expansion.|$|E
5|$|With the phylogenetic classification, the taxon Labyrinthodontia {{has been}} {{discarded}} {{as it is}} a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics. Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem-based or a node-based classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> formerly placed in Amphibia in Linnaean taxonomy, and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy. If the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in Amphibia, it becomes a paraphyletic group.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{shot down}} her first Japanese {{aircraft}} the following month, in March 1944. The ship conducted anti-aircraft defense operations during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. After that, she joined other battleships that were providing gunfire {{support to the}} ground troops in the Marianas islands. She was assigned to Task Force 34 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. In early 1945, Alabama returned for repair and refit work at the Puget Sound naval yard; the work consisted primarily of improvements to her guns and radar equipment. By early May the ship returned to fleet operations. She was tasked with providing anti-aircraft support to the fast carrier <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> launching air strikes on the Japanese main island of Kyushu. In July 1945, she shelled {{a number of areas}} in Japan, including Kamaishi on the 14th, Hitachi on the 18th, and Hamamatsu on the 29th and 30th. These turned out to be her last offensive operations of the war. Her last duty in the Far East was to assist in the landing of occupation forces in Japan, after which she departed for the United States.|$|E
