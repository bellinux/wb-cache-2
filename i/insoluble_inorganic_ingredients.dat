40|$|ABSTRACT. The work {{presented}} {{here was to}} determine the transformation of phosphorus (P) between different forms in the process of intermittent and continuous aeration. According to this study, aeration, at an airflow rate of 1. 0 L/min, resulted in an increase in the manure pH of about one unit, from 6. 5 to 7. 5, within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in soluble ortho–P of 76 %. This reduction in soluble P was apparently caused by the chemical precipitation that was indicated by a reduction in organic P and a simultaneous increase in <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P. The analysis of mass balances between the P fractions showed a large transformation of <b>inorganic</b> <b>insoluble</b> P into organic forms during the aeration period, which could overshadow the efficiency of soluble P removal by microbes. Because the manure contained about 73. 5 % <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> P, it is suggested that solid–liquid separation should be performed prior to aeration to increase the efficiency of soluble P removal. In addition, continuous aeration did not show an advantage over intermittent aeration in terms of soluble P removal...|$|R

The resting potential of a sapling could be monitored continuously with our measuring apparatus. Changes in resting potential were due to the light. The hyperpolarization and depolarization peaks of the resting potential, whose absolute voltage was about 10 mV, occurred right after lights-off and lights-on, respectively. The resting potential was found to show periodic responses for each day unit. At night (lights-off), the resting potential tended to depolarize with an increase in tangential strain. On the other hand, during the daytime (lights-on) the resting potential tended to hyperpolarize, depolarize, or show a nearly constant value for the tangential strain. The water containing <b>inorganic</b> <b>ingredients</b> was transported, via transpiration, in both directions between the mature xylem zone and the phloem zone through differentiating xylem cells. This water transport within a tree stem had a significant effect on the diurnal changes in resting potential.|$|R

40|$|In this study, an {{extraction}} {{method and}} environmental {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) are employed to reveal {{the changes in the}} occurrence mode of fluorine in a coal-fired power plant in Inner Mongolia, China. The different occurrence states of fluorine during coal combustion and emission show that fluorine in coal mainly assumes <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral forms. The results illustrate that the three typical occurrence modes in coal are CaF 2, MgF 2 and AlF 3. The fluorine in fly ash can be captured by an electrostatic precipitator (EPS) or a bag filter. In contrast, the gaseous fluorine content in flue gas is only in the range of several parts per million; thus, it cannot be used in this study. The occurrence mode of fluorine in bottom ash and slag is inorganic villiaumite (e. g., soluble NaF, KF and insoluble CaF 2) which is difficult to break down even at high temperatures. The occurrence mode of fluorine with the highest content in fly ash is physically adsorbed fluorine along the direction of the flue gas flow. The <b>insoluble</b> <b>inorganic</b> mineral fluoride content in fly ash is also high, but the gradually increasing fluorine content in fly ash is mainly caused by physical adsorption. Fluorine in the coal-fired power plant discharges mostly as solid products; however, very little fluorine emitted into the environment as gas products (HF, SiF 4) cannot be captured.

Extracellular aldose oxidation via a pyrroloquinoline quinone-linked glucose dehy-drogenase (PQQ-GDH) is the main pathway for glucose metabolism in G. diazotrophicus.
