However, Smith's far-reaching goals proved too ambitious to be implemented effectively {{in the face of the}} company's resistant corporate culture. Despite Smith's vision, he was unable to successfully integrate GM's major acquisitions and failed to tackle the root causes of GM's <b>fundamental</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
25|$|As Lovell {{designed}} mausoleums, he came {{to realize}} that there were <b>fundamental</b> <b>problems</b> facing above-ground burial. It had been common for centuries for above-ground burial vaults to be tightly sealed, to prevent the leakage of fluids and the spread of nauseating odors (both generated by the decomposition of the human body) from vaults. Tightly sealed vaults, however, allowed decomposition gases to build up, causing vaults to violently rupture ("exploding vault syndrome") and scatter partly-decomposed remains inside the mausoleum. Lovell designed a solution, which involved building a ventilation system and drainage system behind the vaults. He applied for a patent, which was granted on October 23, 1917 (patent number 1,244,109).|$|E

25|$|The {{index of}} a {{differential}} operator {{is closely related}} to the number of independent solutions (more precisely, it is the differences of the numbers of independent solutions of the differential operator and its adjoint). There are many hard and <b>fundamental</b> <b>problems</b> in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.|$|E
25|$|After the {{publication}} of MELTS, Ghiorso continued to improve and extend it {{with the help of}} colleagues such as Mark Hirschmann, Paul Asimow, Pete Reiners and Victor Kress. After they identified some <b>fundamental</b> <b>problems</b> with the theory at high pressure, they developed pMELTS, a model for high pressures (1-3 gigapascals (GPa)), and published it in 1995. Asimow and co-authors published phMELTS, a model for mid-ocean ridge basalts that incorporated the effect of water content. In 1998, Ghiorso, Hirschmann and Tim Grove established the Library of Experimental Phase Relations (LEPR), an online database for experimental results on solid-melt equilibria. With Gil Gualda, he modified MELTS to work better with rhyolite, a silicate-rich series of rocks, and released rhyolite-MELTS.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these successes, {{there are still many}} {{problems}} that remain to be solved. One of the deepest problems in modern physics is the problem of quantum gravity. The general theory of relativity is formulated within the framework of classical physics, whereas the other fundamental forces are described within the framework of quantum mechanics. A quantum theory of gravity is needed in order to reconcile general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics, but difficulties arise when one attempts to apply the usual prescriptions of quantum theory to the force of gravity. In addition to the problem of developing a consistent theory of quantum gravity, there are many other <b>fundamental</b> <b>problems</b> in the physics of atomic nuclei, black holes, and the early universe.|$|E

The fundamental character of this problem provides one with the opportunity to explore a wide range of issues. What does physics tell us about the universe and ourselves? How do we account for everything physics leaves out? How can living brains be conscious? If everything occurs in accordance with physical law, what becomes of free will? How does Darwin's theory of evolution contribute to the solution to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem?</b> What is the history of thought about this problem? What is of most value associated with human life? What kind of civilized world should we seek to help create? Why is the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> not a part of standard education in schools and universities? What are the most serious global problems confronting humanity? Can humanity learn to make progress towards as good a world as possible? These are some of the questions that can be tackled as an integral part of exploring the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem.</b> But the course does not merely wander at random from one issue to another. Taking the <b>fundamental</b> <b>problem</b> as central provides the course with a coherent structure.
