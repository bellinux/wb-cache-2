[...] Archbishop Eamon Martin of Armagh rebuked Burk and called his comments offensive and urged individuals [...] "to try to be respectful and inoffensive in language" [...] wherever possible.|$|E

All over the country, as August wanes, {{sparkling}} comediennes burst into bloom, the sap stirs in the veins of tramp cyclists, and last year's contortionists, waking from their summer sleep, tie themselves tentatively into knots.

6000|$|I {{have often}} {{wondered}} where Poe got his style. There is a sombre majesty about his best work, {{as if it}} were carved from polished jet, which is peculiarly his own. I dare say if I took down that volume I could light anywhere upon a paragraph which would show you what <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> the kind of thing-- ...|$|E

Performers {{included}} Rivera's family and friends, such as, Larry Hernandez, Tito El Bambino, Diana Reyes and La Original Banda Limon.

Well, what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> cove <b>was</b> so deucedly civil, and all that, that now she won't look at anybody else.

Wilkie said that Howard, Bush and Blair should be brought before an international court, and called for Australia to hold another inquiry into the war. Howard rejected Wilkie's proposition and called him [...] "irrational", telling the media: [...] "Andrew Wilkie said the Iraq invasion {{was responsible for the}} Bali attack of 2005. What about the Bali attack of 2002? And he blamed it Iraq War on the Lindt Cafe siege. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> irrational." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rossi was {{appointed}} Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours for services {{to music and}} charity, along with Parfitt. Rossi said [...] "It's one thing going out to play in front of 50,000 people but talking to the Queen - well that's quite another. We were both so humbled by the experience. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Queen after all. She is England, isn't she?

5000|$|In {{his third}} year at Princeton Everett moved into an {{apartment}} which he shared with three friends he had made during his first year, Hale Trotter, Harvey Arnold and Charles Misner. Arnold later described Everett as follows: [...] He was smart in a very broad way. I mean, to go from chemical engineering to mathematics to physics and spending {{most of the time}} buried in a science fiction book, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> talent. [...] It was during this time that he met Nancy Gore, who typed up his Wave Mechanics Without Probability paper. Everett married Nancy Gore, the next year. The long paper was later retitled as The Theory of the Universal Wave Function.|$|E

And there’s this geezer claiming to be a poet, I mean he hasn’t even got sunglasses on.

5000|$|Much of Hicks's routine {{involved}} direct {{attacks on}} mainstream society, religion, politics, and consumerism. Asked in a BBC interview why he cannot do a routine that appeals [...] "to everyone", {{he said that}} such an act was impossible. He responded by repeating a comment that an audience member once made to him, [...] "We don't come to comedy to think!", to which he replied, [...] "Gee, {{where do you go}} to think? I'll meet you there!" [...] When asked whether there was a [...] "half way" [...] point between audience expectations and his own, he said: [...] "but my way is half-way between, <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a night-club, and, you know, these are adults, and what do you expect?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Simons' {{best known}} Marvel work was his {{run on the}} first series of Ghost Rider. His run on the title saw him first inking veteran artist Don Perlin before joining with Bob Budiansky to create {{one of the best}} remembered runs of the {{characters}} history. Budiansky and Simons worked with writers Roger Stern and J.M. DeMatteis. [...] "The only speed bump we hit in <b>this</b> whole thing <b>was</b> when Simons, who of that team is the unsung hero, left", Budiansky recalled. [...] "He used to come to the office dressed in leather. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not an act, he'd come dressed in one of these black leather, zipper jackets. I don't know if he also wore leather pants. He might have worn them. But anyway, the point is, he knew how to ink leather, which was really important for Ghost Rider. So when he left the book we never really were able to replace that look that he gave the book. The rest of the team was all somewhat saddened by his departure." [...] Marvel attempted to duplicate the highly detailed and rendered look that Budiansky and Simons were able to give the character when the character was relaunched in the early 1990s but never quite succeeded.|$|R

But what <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>is</b> <b>this,</b> that <b>I</b> do not think a man a bit {{more likely to be}} {{agreeable}} because he has the reputation of being very clever.
