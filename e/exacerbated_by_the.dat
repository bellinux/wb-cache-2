5|$|After World WarI, the {{prohibition}} {{movement in the}} United States led to Montreal becoming a destination for Americans looking for alcohol. Unemployment remained high in the city, and was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, 179 of 240 {{members of}} {{parliament}} {{voted in favor of}} pausing the subsidy reform, because of high inflation (<b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sanctions against Iran). Consequently, the growth in consumption of subsidized products rebounded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|As the Armero tragedy was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack {{of early}} warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the {{government}} of Colombia created a special program, the Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), {{now known as the}} Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness)to prevent such incidents in the future.|$|E
5000|$|An {{increase}} in the adult population, as the earlier, larger cohort born in the [...] "baby boom" [...] of the 1960s and 1970s reach adulthood. This effect has been <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> immigration: <b>the</b> largest contingent of immigrants are young adults.|$|R
50|$|He died in Marton, Warwickshire, {{of cancer}} <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> MRSA, at <b>the</b> age of 72, on 20 August 2006. He was {{survived by his}} wife Benita and their {{daughter}} Rachel.|$|R
50|$|Mulock {{retired from}} {{politics}} in 1905 due to rheumatism and neuritis <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> overwork, but <b>the</b> {{movement of his}} political views to the left may also have contributed to his decision.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> actions of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, {{the victory of the}} communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside Iceland (which are also a form of external debt). Households also took on {{a large amount of}} debt, equivalent to 213% of disposable income, which led to inflation. This inflation was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> practice of the Central Bank of Iceland issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E
5|$|Discussions on {{the need}} to build an {{underground}} transportation system in Buenos Aires began in the late nineteenth century, alongside the tramway system, {{which was one of the}} most extensive in the world at the time. The first trams appeared in 1870, and by about 1900 the system was in a crisis <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> monopolisation of the lines, which had concentrated under the ownership of fewer companies during the electrification of the system.|$|E
40|$|Central Diabetes Insipidus {{is often}} an {{overlooked}} complication of cardiopulmonary arrest and anoxic brain injury. We report a case of transient Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) following cardiopulmonary arrest. It developed 4 days after the arrest resulting in polyuria and marked hypernatremia of 199 [*]mM. <b>The</b> latter was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> replacing <b>the</b> hypotonic urine <b>by</b> isotonic saline...|$|R
50|$|Riders TO CDG {{should be}} aware that the RER-B trains become {{extremely}} crowded during the morning rush hour. Standing room only is the norm, and this is <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> luggage. <b>The</b> evening rush hour is of no concern to North Atlantic passengers, since these Paris departure flights are universally scheduled for morning or early afternoon departure.|$|R
50|$|Lacau {{oversaw the}} {{discovery}} of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> English archaeologists Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon in the Valley of the Kings. Relations with Carter were rarely cordial and were <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> monopoly of publication rights which Lord Carnarvon sold to The Times, and pressure from the Egyptian government who resented the lack of Egyptian involvement in the Tutankhamen excavation.|$|R
5|$|During {{the same}} year, however, he allowed his pro-American {{minister}} of defense, General Lon Nol, {{to crack down}} on leftist activities, crushing the Pracheachon by accusing its members of subversion and subservience to Hanoi. Simultaneously, Sihanouk lost the support of Cambodia's conservatives {{as a result of his}} failure to come to grips with the deteriorating economic situation (<b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of rice exports, most of which went to the PAVN/Viet Cong) and with the growing communist military presence.|$|E
5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, {{his involvement in}} operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick was the second-latest {{hurricane}} ever {{to make landfall}} in Mexico. The eighteenth named storm, {{ninth and}} final hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Rick was a short-lived Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale that weakened before making landfall in Mexico on November 10. It hit almost {{a month after the}} more powerful Hurricane Pauline made landfall in the same country. Most of the damage associated with Pauline was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weaker Rick, which struck during rebuilding efforts.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of being fired, many Iraqi {{soldiers}} and Ba’ath Party members protested outside their former places of employment or in squares where they would be visible to Coalition Forces and the CPA. [...] With <b>the</b> unemployment rate <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> de-Ba’athification, <b>the</b> unrest of previously employed civil servants and military personnel contributed to the overall decay of the security situation in Iraq.|$|R
50|$|The Shuttle's {{delta wing}} design {{was driven by}} these issues. These {{requirements}} were further <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> military requirements (<b>the</b> USAF would use the future shuttle for defense satellite payloads and other missions) that extended the Shuttle's flight landing envelope.|$|R
50|$|Moyale saw {{four days}} of ethnic clashes in July 2012 over a long-standing land dispute between Borana and Garre communities, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> drought conditions. <b>The</b> {{fighting}} left at least eighteen dead, and more than twenty thousand people fled {{across the border into}} Kenya.|$|R
5|$|Recovering from {{tuberculosis}} <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dank {{conditions in}} his cell, in December 1988 Mandela {{was moved to}} Victor Verster Prison near Paarl. He was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and used the time to complete his LLB degree. While there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled ANC leader Oliver Tambo.|$|E
5|$|Social {{tensions}} were <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{revival of}} the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to {{be as high as}} 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.|$|E
5|$|Technetium can {{catalyse}} {{the destruction}} of hydrazine by nitric acid, and this property is due to its multiplicity of valencies. This caused {{a problem in the}} separation of plutonium from uranium in nuclear fuel processing, where hydrazine is used as a protective reductant to keep plutonium in the trivalent rather than the more stable tetravalent state. The problem was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mutually-enhanced solvent extraction of technetium and zirconium at the previous stage, and required a process modification.|$|E
50|$|In the NTSB {{investigation}} report, {{the cause}} was attributed to extreme pitch-up to 14g+ caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> loss of the port elevator trim tab due to wear in the trim tab mounts, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> lock-nuts on <b>the</b> mounting bolts losing their self-locking ability due to use past their normal life.|$|R
50|$|As {{an island}} {{located in the}} Sea of Japan, Chibujima is within the Sea of Japan climate zone. Summers {{temperatures}}, though usually mild, are <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> high humidity. Winter temperatures are also generally mild, though <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> strong wind. <b>The</b> surrounding ocean has a warming effect, making winters milder than the mainland. Consequently, {{there is very little}} snow on Chibujima, and what snow does fall usually melts quickly.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{cause of}} the famine was several prolonged periods of drought in the region in early 1943. However, <b>the</b> problem was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> attempts of <b>the</b> colonial authorities to send agricultural produce to the Belgian Congo, {{as part of the}} Allied war effort, in the Second World War.|$|R
5|$|The {{end of the}} Napoleonic Wars in 1815 had {{resulted}} in periods of famine and chronic unemployment, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction {{of the first of}} the Corn Laws. By the beginning of 1819, the pressure generated by poor economic conditions, coupled with the relative lack of suffrage in Northern England, had enhanced the appeal of political radicalism. In response, the Manchester Patriotic Union, a group agitating for parliamentary reform, organised a demonstration to be addressed by the well-known radical orator Henry Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
25|$|Following confederation, {{the fears}} of the anti-confederates were proven correct as new {{national}} policies and trade barriers were soon adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> central government, thus disrupting the historic trading relationship between the Maritime Provinces and New England. The situation in New Brunswick was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> both <b>the</b> Great Fire of 1877 in Saint John {{and the decline of}} the wooden shipbuilding industry; skilled workers were thus forced to move to other parts of Canada or to the United States to seek employment.|$|R
40|$|Two-thirds (65 %) of {{children}} of recent immigrants— 2. 1 million—are low-income. For these children the challenges in academic, physical, emotional, and social development usually associated with economic insecurity {{are likely to be}} <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> language barriers, <b>the</b> process of migration and acculturation, and restrictions on access to safety net programs...|$|R
50|$|Neither Lansing's body nor {{the piece}} of the {{fuselage}} that was blown off the aircraft were ever found. Investigation <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the accident was caused <b>by</b> metal fatigue <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> crevice corrosion. <b>The</b> aircraft was 19 years old and operated in a coastal environment, with exposure to salt and humidity.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these fish for spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, {{independent}} Vermont continued to experience rapid population growth, and Allen sold {{a great deal}} of his land, but also reinvested much the proceeds in more land. A lack of cash, complicated by Vermont's currency problems, placed a strain on Fanny's relatively free hand on spending, which was further <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> cost of publishing Reason, and of {{the construction of a new}} home near the mouth of the Onion River. He was threatened with debtors' prison on at least one occasion, and was at times reduced to borrowing money and calling in old debts to make ends meet.|$|E
50|$|The {{rocker arm}} oil supply pipe was steel, and would {{fracture}} from vibration (later improved). The head steady would also fatigue and fracture from vibration (later improved). The Amal carbs had float needle leakage from vibration, {{which led to}} flooding and fires, <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> having <b>the</b> ignition points located under the right hand carb (relocated {{to the right side}} of the engine after the first year). And the carburetors wore out prematurely from vibration (persistent problem).|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, many {{operating}} systems and their underlying file system implementations used 32-bit integers to represent file sizes and positions. Consequently, no file could {{be larger than}} 232 − 1 bytes (4 GB − 1). In many implementations, <b>the</b> problem was <b>exacerbated</b> <b>by</b> treating <b>the</b> sizes as signed numbers, which further lowered the limit to 231 − 1 bytes (2 GB − 1). Files that were too large for 32-bit {{operating systems}} to handle {{came to be known}} as large files.|$|R
5000|$|From {{an early}} stage the yard was not used at capacity: <b>by</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s road {{competition}} was biting hard into the railways' goods traffic, {{and in particular the}} wagon-load freight that required hump-yards like Tinsley was already declining. The economic malaise and industrial decline of <b>the</b> 1970s <b>exacerbated</b> this. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1980s British Rail was closing its remaining wagon-load freight facilities as being uneconomic.|$|R
