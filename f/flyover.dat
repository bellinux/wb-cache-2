5|$|Michigan {{opened the}} 2010 season {{at home against}} the Connecticut Huskies, the first ever meeting between the two schools. Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special <b>flyover</b> by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another <b>flyover</b> {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by walking to the banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd.

40|$|The {{annoyance}} of {{sessions of}} airplane noise which contained different noise levels {{and numbers of}} <b>flyovers</b> was investigated. The time of occurrence of the high noise level <b>flyovers</b> in the sessions did not significantly affect annoyance, but annoyance increased {{with the number of}} such <b>flyovers.</b> Annoyance decreased with test session duration but increased with the total number of <b>flyovers</b> in the test sessions.

5|$|I-97 {{continues}} {{north as}} a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled {{on the east}} by Veterans Highway on {{the western edge of}} Severna Park. The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway's northern end at I-97's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road.

50|$|The Corporation {{constructs}} <b>flyovers</b> {{as part of}} {{the development}} of infrastructure for easy commuting by tourists in Delhi. The revenue for the construction of some of the <b>flyovers</b> in Delhi has been generated from a share of profit that the Corporation earns from the sale of Country made Liquor (CL). The Corporation charges a flat rate of profit, a margin of Rs.6 per bottle of country liquor, of which a share of Rs.5/- has been fixed as a contribution towards the construction of <b>flyovers.</b> The construction is carried of tourism by transferring knowledge in areas of tour and tourism.|$|R
5000|$|The total {{road network}} in the city's {{metropolitan}} area is 2,780 km. With Chennai's vehicular population having experienced a surge in the late 1990s, several <b>flyovers</b> were built to reduce the traffic congestion in the city. Of about [...] 15,600 million invested by the state government between 2005 and 2014, Chennai cornered a major chunk of the investment. As of 2017, there are 35 functional <b>flyovers</b> {{in the city and}} around 150 bridges including 12 rail over bridges, catering to the city's vehicular population of about 3.9 million, including about 600,000 cars.

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a <b>flyover</b> of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This <b>flyover</b> was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and asked that the fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of Route 14 with Via Princessa in Santa Clarita {{is an unusual}} design, with long <b>flyover</b> ramps for the connections. This {{is the result of}} a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita, that canceled plans for a freeway extension of Route 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of Route 126 was canceled, a different alignment is being constructed with proposed connections to Route 14.|$|E
5|$|With the {{construction}} of American Dream Meadowlands, several improvements are taking place to Route 120.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the annoyance effects of multiple aircraft noise exposure in which 250 subjects judged the annoyance of half-hour periods of airplane noise simulative of typical indoor home exposures. The variables of the aircraft noise exposure were the peak noise level of <b>flyovers,</b> which was constant within each period, and the number of <b>flyovers.</b> Each subject judged 5 of the possible 25 factorial combinations of level and number. Other variables investigated included the experience of the test subjects in making annoyance judgments and their home exposure to airplane noise. The annoyance judgments increased with both noise level and number of <b>flyovers.</b> The increased annoyance produced by doubling the number of <b>flyovers</b> was found to be the equivalent of a 4 to 6 db increase in noise level. The sensitivity of the subjects to changes in both noise level and number of <b>flyovers</b> increased with laboratory experience. Although the means of the annoyance judgments made in the laboratory were found to decrease with the subjects' home exposure to aircraft noise, the subjects' sensitivities to changes in both level and number were unaffected by their home exposure...|$|R

Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E
