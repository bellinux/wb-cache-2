In Part II of this Comment each of the <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> be applied separately to the facts of a recent antitrust case, In re Uranium Antitrust Litigation. Finally, in Part III, the application of the separatist approach to those facts will be critiqued, and an alternative approach to the <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> be discussed...|$|R

25|$|The Department of National <b>Defense</b> <b>will</b> acquire 21 {{units of}} {{refurbished}} UH-1 helicopters through public bidding and will include PHP 60 {{million worth of}} Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) package. After {{the failure of the}} third bidding, the DND has proceeded with the negotiated bidding with the joint venture of Rice Aircraft and Eagle Copter and finally awarded them on December 28, 2013, for a bid price of P1.25 billion for 21 refurbished UH-1 helicopters. Those helicopters should arrive within six months after the awarding.|$|E
25|$|On September 20, 2016 it was {{revealed}} that one of the 13 witnesses whom Prosecutor Steele wants to call in the criminal trial is alleged Cosby victim Margie Shapiro. Allred filed a motion in the civil case of Huth vs. Cosby, to have the deposition of Shapiro postponed until after the criminal trial. Allred stated she believes the <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> try to use the deposition against Shapiro to find discrepancies in the upcoming criminal trial. Cosby attorney Angela Agrusa is opposing this motion. The Judge in the civil case is expected to rule on November 4 on whether or not the deposition will take place.|$|E
25|$|In March 2014, Norwegian {{newspaper}} Dagbladet {{reported that}} the Royal Norwegian Air Force is looking at possibly leasing aircraft from Boeing.

On 29 March 2017, Norway signed a contract for P-8As, to be delivered between 2022 and 2023.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{wrote in}} a 2010 report that the Chinese {{continue}} to invest in modernization of their nuclear forces because they perceive that their deterrent force is vulnerable to American capabilities and that further improvement in American missile <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> drive further Chinese spending in this area.|$|R
30|$|A {{second group}} of genes like {{avirulence}} genes are known to activate plant defense responses. In this case, one expects that constitutive or inducible activation of <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> increase disease resistance. When avirulence genes are used (e.g., avrXa 27), pathogen-specific effects are expected. For this reason, {{most of the cases}} deal with avirulence genes that are broadly distributed (e.g., flagellin).|$|R
5000|$|In American football, a 4-3 {{defense is}} a {{defensive}} alignment consisting of four down linemen and three linebackers. It is a called a [...] "base defense" [...] {{because it is}} the default defensive alignment used on [...] "base downs" [...] (1st and 2nd downs). However, <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> readily switch to other defensive alignments (such as a nickel) as circumstances change.|$|R
25|$|O. bauri usually spends {{its time}} below the leaf litter, {{classifying}} it as a leaf-litter ant. It is also widely {{known as a}} generalist predator. A few of O. bauri’s common prey include worms, spiders, termites, ants, butterflies, flies, and beetles. Usually prey would be around 3 mm and 4 mm in length. The most common prey O. bauri enjoys are soft bodied, for example, termites and wood lice. O. bauri is able to “exploit a food resource largely unavailable to other ants”. This was determined after a researcher found remnants of Nasuitermes a type of termite that as a <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> discharge material that irritates and can block the predator’s sensory organs. Finding parts {{of this type of}} termite prove that the mandibles of O. bauri are able to combat prey which is chemically protected.|$|E
25|$|This {{formation}} {{is widely used}} by Spanish, French and German sides. While it seems defensive to the eye, {{it is quite a}} flexible formation, as both the wide players and the full-backs join the attack. In defense, this {{formation is}} similar to either the 4–5–1 or 4–4–1–1. It is used to maintain possession of the ball and stopping opponent attacks by controlling the midfield area of the field. The lone striker may be very tall and strong to hold the ball up as his midfielders and full-backs join him in attack. The striker could also be very fast. In these cases, the opponent's <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> be forced to fall back early, thereby leaving space for the offensive central midfielder. This formation is used especially when a playmaker is to be highlighted. The variations of personnel used on the flanks in this set-up include using traditional wingers, using inverted wingers or simply using wide midfielders. Different teams and managers have different interpretations of the 4–2–3–1, but one common factor among them all is the presence of the double pivot. The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game. The double pivot is the usage of two holding midfielders in front of the defence.|$|E
500|$|In April, 2009, {{prosecutors}} {{disclosed that}} two emails had been drafted on Wone's BlackBerry [...] "at {{a time when}} prosecutors believed Wone dead". An independent criminal law attorney noted that [...] "The <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> argue that {{this is consistent with}} their claim that the murder happened quickly by an intruder and it was not a long, drawn-out effort to sexually assault Wone before he was killed, as the government is alleging." [...] Previously a court filing indicated the government intended to release a personal profile that Price allegedly used on ALT.com, [...] "a sexually oriented web site specializing in S practices".|$|E
50|$|Especially {{when the}} outcome of the game has been well decided, <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> often give little {{resistance}} to the play as a matter of sportsmanship as well as to reduce injury risk on what is a relatively simple play. The quarterback is generally not touched and the act of intentionally taking the knee results in the play being over in all variations of the sport.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Defenses</b> <b>will</b> {{be allowed}} to return {{turnovers}} on two-point tries or blocked or missed PAT kicks to the opposing end zone for two points, mirroring the NCAA College football rule adopted in the 1988 season. Furthermore, a one-point safety can now also be scored if either team takes possession and fumbles {{out of their own}} end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it.|$|R
5000|$|In American football, the 3-4 {{defense is}} a common {{defensive}} alignment consisting of three down linemen and four linebackers. It is a called a [...] "base defense" [...] {{because it is the}} default defensive alignment used on [...] "base downs" [...] (1st and 2nd downs). However, <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> readily switch to other defensive alignments (such as a dime) as circumstances change. Alternately some defenses use a 4-3.|$|R

With {{the promise of}} a daily $10 salary, {{the children}} accept and soon become unsuspecting accomplices in a marijuana delivery business. One night Bob discovers Mickey making a hole in the basement, and Mickey reveals his plan to dig his way into the same bank he previously robbed, believing that the double jeopardy <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> clear him of any crime. Bob explains to Mickey that he can, in fact, be jailed again, and promptly fires him.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of National <b>Defense</b> <b>will</b> acquire 3 brand-new Medium Lift Fixed Wing Aircraft and its [...] "initial" [...] Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) for the Air Force with {{a budget}} of PHP 5.3 billion.

2500|$|In chess, the {{fortress}} is an endgame drawing technique {{in which the}} side behind in [...] sets up a zone of protection that the opponent cannot penetrate. This might involve keeping the enemy king out of one's position, or a zone the enemy cannot force one out of (e.g. see the opposite-colored bishops example). [...] An elementary fortress is a theoretically drawn (i.e. a [...] ) position with reduced material in which a passive <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> maintain the draw.|$|E
5000|$|Speed over {{size and}} strength. Coordinators that employ Kiffin-style <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> often replace linebackers with safeties {{in order to}} put more speed on the field. In particular, linebackers must be able to cover receivers; in the Tampa 2 scheme, one linebacker {{frequently}} drops back deep into coverage, turning what looks like a Cover 2 defense into a Cover 3. Kiffin's defenses also employ quick, penetrating defensive tackles.|$|R
40|$|Suppressing enemy air {{defenses}} (SEAD) {{has been a}} central element of projecting military air power for over 50 years. However, several developments suggest that this mission is of growing importance to the Department of Defense (DOD).

2500|$|Each point {{begins with}} the two teams {{starting}} in opposite end zones. The team who scored the previous point are now on defense. The teams indicate their readiness by raising a hand, [...] and the team on <b>defense</b> <b>will</b> throw the disc to the other team. This throw is called a [...] "pull". When the pull is released, all players are free to leave their end zones and occupy any area on the field. Both teams should not leave the endzone before the pull is released. Thus, the defending team must run most of the field length at speed to defend immediately. And a good pull is designed to {{hang in the air}} as long as possible to give the defending team time to make the run.|$|E

50|$|Trick plays take {{advantage}} of the fact that nearly all American football plays are either a pass from the quarterback or a run by the halfback. As a result, <b>defenses</b> <b>will</b> think pass when the quarterback has the ball and run when the running back has it. They respond by quickly changing position in an attempt to block further motion of the offense's players. Trick plays depart from these expectations, attempting to have the defense move into position to block the wrong play. They tend only to work if they are unanticipated.|$|R
