40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis is „Savings in material flows in connection with EMS in production companies“. The topic of this dissertation thesis is the saving in material flows in connection with EMS in production companies. Sound ecological management in industrial companies is important {{due to the fact}} it enhances environment protection and provides the companies concerned with competitive advantage. In many cases it provides for better organization of labor and decrease of wastage and allows for other preventive measures. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study the relation between the economical and environmental protection interests of companies operating in selected business sector, the paper examines whether environment protection activities practiced by the companies provide also economical benefit for them. The paper uses literature to analyze relations between EMS, logistics and areas in which savings can be found thus contributing to better results in the fields of environment protection and economy. The gained information together with conducted empirical research is the base used in order to determine the area in which savings could be found. Emphasis is laid on material flows which are studied in selected company active in the field of automotive industry. The analysis is based on the current organizational structure and logistic chain, the analyses focuses mainly on warehousing activities. In the studied company there is charted <b>disconnection</b> <b>point</b> which is located in the reception area in the warehouse. Narrow place was found in the dispatch area of the warehouse, the results of the analyses are the base to be used to express the amount of possible savings. Within the process evaluation, measurements and analysis of working time for each shift have been conducted, since the working load of the concerned shifts presents a risk factor from the perspective of ensuring the in time delivery of materials to the production. Proposal to improve the process is based on the synthesis of acquired facts, it allows for better utilization of working time of warehouse employees and provides extra space for manipulation with materials. When there is extra working load to be handled (extra order from customer) it also provides for the elimination of unnecessary or extra actions connected with operations. The application of the improvement proposal will abolish one of the reasons for non operation time in production, which leads to savings in energy consumption and decreases the amount of emissions. In the final part of the dissertation thesis a summary of solutions to the encountered problems is presented and the possible contribution of this thesis to theory and praxis is described...|$|E
40|$|The folding {{phenomenon}} of comet tail rays {{is explained by}} means of an electric drift due to convectional electric fields. This mechanism results in an angular rate of closure which reduces to that obtained by Ness and Donn (1966) if the velocity profile across the tail is linear and the plasma conductivity is ideal. Observations of both the ray closure and the <b>disconnection</b> events <b>point</b> to the {{phenomenon of}} anomalous resistivity. Magnetic fields of about 30 - 40 gammas in the coma and of 10 gammas in the distant tail (at 1 AU) are estimated from the MHD momentum equation...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{provides}} {{an insight into}} the remote control and disconnection of DSO supply points phenomenon. The remote or local disconnection/connection of supply point is allowed by the breaker function. The automatic <b>disconnection</b> of supply <b>point</b> is enabled by the limiter function. Due to the anticipated implementation of smart meters in the Czech Republic in the future, this work contains the comprehensive description of breaker/limiter function with proposed possibilities of use in the Czech Republic. The thesis deals with the current breaker/limiter function use in the Czech Republic and in other countries. It introduces the smart meter installation in pilot projects to analyze the breaker/limiter function use in other countries. The thesis {{is focused on the}} technical solution of breaker/limiter. Moreover, it describes the ways of connecting the breaker, settting the limiter, connecting/disconnecting a supply point and breaker operation. Further, the thesis introduces the ways of activating the breaker by a customer and defines in which cases it is possible to limit and interrupt the electricity supply in the Czech Republic currently. The main aim of thesis is to describe the specific possibilities of breaker/limiter function use in the Czech Republic. With regard to the function use in other countries and the limiting or interrupting the electricity supply by DSO according to energy law, the possibilities of use are proposed. Each possibility of use is analyzed when implementing the breaker function or the breaker/limiter function. The benefits are defined for a DSO and for a customer. The proposed uses are evaluated in terms of applicability and valid legislation in the Czech Republic. The result of this work is the summary of information about breaker/limiter function {{which is one of the}} new features in the implementation of smart metering. The function installation and the implementation of possibilities described in the thesis depends on the DSO decision...|$|R
40|$|The two artists Ken Okiishi and Felix Gonzalez-Torres [...] though {{separated}} by a generation [...] both use physical objects to signify the loss of human presence, connection or connections. Both instill meaning into familiar physical objects such as candy, clocks, or television screens, and both are able to provoke feelings associated {{with the kinds of}} presence objects can represent – without that actual presence. Gonzalez-Torres worked during a time when digital technology was not yet an existent medium, while Okiishi worked during a time in which the technological world and its social effects are central to his work and message. In fact, a central point of his work gesture/data is to replicate our dependent relationship with technology and how people interact with the virtual world. This world is only available by viewing through a screen; it is unreachable, unlike the tangible objects, that we can physically feel, via which Gonzalez-Torres’ works often confronted viewers. These two artists demonstrate stark, pivotal generational differences: a world and society before technology, art before digital technology (Gonzalez-Torres), and the effects and experiences of art in a world engulfed by such technology entirely (Okiishi). One relies on physical interaction, and the other responds and relays the effects of infinite, intangible spectacles. Both speak to the importance and meaning of presence, or being, and what part that presence or absence plays in art experience during these juxtaposing time periods: before and after the Internet. In his 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle, French theorist Guy Debord wrote, “in societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation”. [1] Gonzalez-Torres’ and Okiishi’s artworks both could be said to exemplify this idea of evolution and generational transformation, but in Okiishi’s work, there is an increased <b>disconnection,</b> to the <b>point</b> that everything may be mere representation. This raises the question: has art changed with technology? Have we lost actual experience to mere representation? [1]Debord, Guy. The Society of the Spectacle. Buchet-Chastel, 196...|$|R
