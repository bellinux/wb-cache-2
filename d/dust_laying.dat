6000|$|... "Pretty lively," [...] said Jones, {{spitting}} gravel as I walked up. Sand and <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> {{thick in}} his beard and blackened his face. [...] "I tell you she made us root." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{were in a}} vault. <b>Dust</b> <b>lay</b> everywhere, on everything, inches thick. Wood crates {{lined the}} walls, huge boxes and crates, {{packages}} and containers. Tance looked around curiously, his eyes bright.|$|R
6000|$|Inch-thick the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> on {{the ground}} [...] For it had long been droughty weather: [...] So with his staff the Cripple wrought [...] Among the dust till he had brought [...] The halfpennies together.|$|R
6000|$|Who now remembers Almack's balls - [...] Willis's {{sometime}} named - In {{those two}} smooth-floored upper halls [...] For faded ones so famed? Where as we trod to trilling sound The fancied phantoms stood around, [...] Or joined {{us in the}} maze, Of the powdered Dears from Georgian years, Whose <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> in sightless sealed-up biers, [...] The fairest of former days.|$|R
60|$|He spun a half-crown {{into the}} air. It fell and rolled under a great, {{yellow-wood}} chest full of curiosities that I had collected, which {{it took all}} our united strength to move. We dragged it aside and not without some excitement, for really a good deal hung upon the chance, I lit a match and peered into the shadow. There in the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> the coin.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a rough}} {{trail to}} the settlement. The red <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick upon it and the {{afternoon}} sun was hot. When at last, powdered all over with dust and very weary, Thurston came in sight of the little wooden store, he noticed Bransome's horse fastened outside it. He {{did not see the}} rancher, who sat on an empty box behind a sugar hogshead inside the counter.|$|R
60|$|But Mannering {{was already}} {{face to face}} with Berenice. She held out her hand without hesitation. If she felt any emotion she {{concealed}} it perfectly. Her voice was steady and cordial, if her cheeks were pale. The <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thickly upon them all. Mannering, tall and grave in his plain dinner clothes and black tie, stood almost like a statue before her, until her extended hand invited his movement.|$|R
6000|$|Jane {{had gone}} {{straight}} to the picture of Marguerite. She unhooked it with a steady hand. The <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick upon it, and festoons of cobwebs lay {{between it and the}} wall. Sir James handed her a pocket-knife, and she ripped away the brown paper from the back.... The advertisement page of a magazine fell out. Jane picked it up. Holding apart the frayed inner edges she extracted two thin sheets covered with writing! ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} {{hot in the}} little West African factory where trader Niven lay dying. The sea breeze had died away, and though sunset drew near, {{it was not yet}} time for the spicy airs from the inland forest to {{mitigate}} the temperature. The <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> still in the sun-scorched compound, about which the palm fronds hung motionless, and only the roar of breakers on the beach broke through the drowsy silence.|$|R
60|$|On Sunday {{morning the}} men were {{conscious}} of a bare, deserted appearance in the church. Mr. Sinclair perceived it himself. After some inward wondering he concluded {{that it was because}} there were no flowers anywhere. The table before the pulpit was bare. On the organ a vase held a sorry, faded bouquet left over from the previous week. The floor was' unswept. <b>Dust</b> <b>lay</b> thickly on the pulpit Bible, the choir chairs, and the pew backs.|$|R
60|$|The lamp hung {{against the}} barn-wall, softly {{illuminating}} {{the lower part}} of the building, where bits of hay and white <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> in the hollows between the bricks, where the curled chips of turnip scattered orange gleams over the earthen floor; the lofty roof, with its swallows' nests under the tiles, was deep in shadow, and the corners were full of darkness, hiding, half hiding, the hay, the chopper, the bins. The light shone along the passages before the stalls, glistening on the moist noses of the cattle, and on the whitewash of the walls.|$|R
60|$|What a scandalous room! There were no {{curtains}} on the window. Mrs. Davis did {{not know}} that Faith and Una had taken them down the day before to use as court trains in one of their plays and had forgotten to put them up again, but she could not have accused those windows more fiercely if she had known. The blinds were cracked and torn. The pictures on the walls were crooked; the rugs were awry; the vases were full of faded flowers; the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> in heaps--literally in heaps.|$|R
60|$|Phil. Madam, your breath, {{which raised}} {{me from the}} <b>dust,</b> May <b>lay</b> me there again: But fate nor time can ever make me lose The sense of your indulgent bounties to me.|$|R
60|$|When I {{first met}} Dumps he was scurrying towards me along a sequestered country lane. It {{was in the}} Dog Days. <b>Dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick on the road; the creature's legs were remarkably short though active, and his hair being long he swept up the dust in clouds as he ran. He was yelping, and I {{observed}} that one or two stones appeared to be racing with, or after, him. The voice of an angry man also seemed to chase him, but {{the owner of the}} voice was at the moment concealed by a turn in the lane, which was bordered by high stone-walls.|$|R
60|$|Instantly all {{the slaves}} began howling and beating their heads, and he {{to whom the}} young man had spoken fell down with his face in the <b>dust,</b> and <b>lay</b> there {{twisting}} and writhing like a worm.|$|R
60|$|During the {{afternoon}} the ride grew hot, and very dusty. We {{came to a}} long, open valley where the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> several inches deep. It had been an unusually dry summer and fall--a fact that presaged poor luck for our hunting--and the washes and stream-beds were bleached white. We came to two water-holes, tanks the Arizonians called them, and they were vile mud-holes with green scum on the water. The horses drank, but I {{would have had to}} be far gone from thirst before I would have slaked mine there. We faced west with the hot sun beating on us and the dust rising in clouds. No wonder that ride was interminably long.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} {{supernova}} SN 1987A, the closest supernova in modern times. Its light echoes have aided in mapping the morphology {{of the immediate}} vicinity [...] {{as well as in}} characterizing <b>dust</b> clouds <b>laying</b> further away but close to the line of sight from Earth.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{was just}} as they had seen it last. There was a sense of {{closeness}} from the exclusion of fresh air, and a gloom and heaviness around, as though long imprisonment had made the very silence sad. The homely hangings of the beds and windows had begun to droop; the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick upon their dwindling folds; and damps had made their way through ceiling, wall, and floor. The boards creaked beneath their tread, as if resenting the unaccustomed intrusion; nimble spiders, paralysed by the taper's glare, checked the motion of their hundred legs upon the wall, or dropped like lifeless things upon the ground; the death-watch ticked; and the scampering feet of rats and mice rattled behind the wainscot.|$|R
60|$|It {{was truly}} a noble garret, for it {{extended}} the whole length of the great square house, with windows at either end, and divided in the middle by a solid chimney. All around stood rows of chests, dilapidated furniture, and wardrobes full of old relics, while the walls were hung with many things for which modern tongues can find no names. In one corner was a book-case full of musty books and papers; in another, kitchen utensils and rusty weapons; the third was devoted to quilts hung on lines, and in the fourth stood a loom with a spinning-wheel beside it, both seemingly well cared for, as the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> lightly on them, and flax was still upon the distaff.|$|R
60|$|With {{my finger}} I who am a {{draughtsman}} drew {{in the thick}} <b>dust</b> that <b>lay</b> {{on the board of}} the chariot the brows of a man and beneath them two deep eyes. The gilt on the board where the sun caught it looked like light in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|It was at best {{merely a}} rocky trail winding along a shelf {{of the eastern}} slope of the Santa Cruz range, yet the only road between {{the sea and the}} inland valley. The hoof-prints of a whole century of zigzagging mules were {{impressed}} on the soil, regularly soaked by winter rains and dried by summer suns during that period; the occasional ruts of heavy, rude, wooden wheels--long obsolete--were still preserved and visible. Weather-worn boulders and ledges, lying in the unclouded glare of an August sky, radiated a quivering heat that was intolerable, even while above them the masts of gigantic pines rocked their tops in the cold southwestern trades from the unseen ocean beyond. A red, burning <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> everywhere, as if the heat were slowly and visibly precipitating itself.|$|R
5000|$|... “To Bite the <b>Dust</b> and Symbolical <b>Lay</b> Communion,” by J.D.M. Ford. Publications of the Modern Language Association. XX (XIII), 2, (1905), 197-230.|$|R
60|$|The <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick {{upon the}} bare ground near the tracks. Alvarita's eye soon {{discovered}} the serrated {{trail of the}} escaped python. It led across the depot grounds and away down a smaller street {{in the direction of}} the little canon, as predicted by her. A stillness and lack of excitement in the neighbourhood encouraged the hope that, as yet, the inhabitants were unaware that so formidable a guest traversed their highways. The heat had driven them indoors, whence outdrifted occasional shrill laughs, or the depressing whine of a maltreated concertina. In the shade a few Mexican children, like vivified stolid idols in clay, stared from their play, vision-struck and silent, as Alvarita came and went. Here and there a woman peeped from a door and stood dumb, reduced to silence by the aspect of the white silk parasol.|$|R
6000|$|The lower floor communicated by two doorways {{with the}} narrow, rock-paved sidewalk. The pulperia--or {{drinking}} shop--of the proprietress, Madama Timotea Ortiz, occupied the ground floor. On the bottles of brandy, anisada, Scotch [...] "smoke" [...] and inexpensive wines behind the little counter the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick save where {{the fingers of}} infrequent customers had left irregular prints. The upper story contained four or five guest-rooms which were rarely put to their destined use. Sometimes a fruit-grower, riding in from his plantation to confer with his agent, would pass a melancholy night in the dismal upper story; sometimes a minor native official on some trifling government quest would have his pomp and majesty awed by Madama's sepulchral hospitality. But Madama sat behind her bar content, not desiring to quarrel with Fate. If anyone required meat, drink or lodging at the Hotel de los Estranjeros they had but to come, and be served. Está bueno. If they came not, why, then, they came not. Está bueno.|$|R
6000|$|Here, {{in these}} immemorial recesses, the natives {{had long been}} wont to bury, as we learned, their oldest objects of {{interest}} and value. There, when we pushed our way within the swinging portal, lay around us, in vast and solemn pyramids of portable property, the silent and touching monuments of human existence. The busy life of a nation lay sleeping here! Here, for example, stood that ancestral instrument for the reckoning of winged Time, which in the native language is styled a 'Grandfather's Clock.' Hard by lay the pipe, fashioned of the 'foam of perilous seas in fairy lands forlorn,' the pipe on which, perchance, some swain had discoursed sweet music near the shady heights of High Holborn. The cradle of infancy, the gamp of decrepitude, the tricycle of fleeting youth, the paraffin lamp which had lighted bridal gaiety, the flask which had held the foaming malt,--all were gathered here, and the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> deep on all of them! ...|$|R
60|$|If I had {{not given}} heed to the clerk's warning, and braced myself for a shock, I should {{certainly}} have dropped the lamp. The room, windowless and bare, was fitted up as a photographic laboratory, with a tap and sink {{at the side of}} it. A shelf of bottles and measures stood at one side, and a peculiar, heavy smell, partly chemical, partly animal, filled the air. A single table and chair were in front of us, and at this, with his back turned towards us, a man was seated in the act of writing. His outline and attitude were as natural as life; but as the light fell upon him, it made my hair rise to see that the nape of his neck was black and wrinkled, and no thicker than my wrist. <b>Dust</b> <b>lay</b> upon him--thick, yellow dust--upon his hair, his shoulders, his shrivelled, lemon-coloured hands. His head had fallen forward upon his breast. His pen still rested upon a discoloured sheet of paper.|$|R
60|$|She {{answered}} {{these questions}} by going there at once. After thoroughly exploring the grove, and satisfying herself that it contained no other living human creature, {{she sat down}} {{under one of the}} largest trees, with a satisfactory little sigh. Miss Jo loved the madrono. It was a cleanly tree; no <b>dust</b> ever <b>lay</b> upon its varnished leaves; its immaculate shade never was known to harbor grub or insect.|$|R
60|$|In {{this way}} they {{discovered}} {{the road where}} he had turned off; but beyond this the tracks did not show, as the road was hard and almost free from <b>dust.</b> It <b>lay,</b> as they expected, toward the hills; but {{there were so many}} country mansions of the wealthy classes dotted about, and so many crossroads leading to these and to the farmhouses of the cultivators, that they felt they were still far from attaining the object of their search.|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was nearly}} overhead, and Kit {{sat in the}} hot <b>dust</b> that <b>lay</b> about the wady. A low bank rose behind him and shaded his head. His eyes hurt, he was tired, and his burned skin was sore, for the dust stung {{as if it were}} mixed with alkali. In the open one could hardly front the sun, but the nights were keen, and at daybreak he had got up {{shivering}} from his hard bed behind a stone.|$|R
6000|$|Brown {{braiding}} on a tailor-made jacket does not, however, consort with hay-wagons. Then we struck {{into the}} woods along what California called a camina reale--a good road--and Portland a [...] "fair track." [...] It wound in and out among fire-blackened stumps under pine-trees, along the corners of log fences, through hollows, which must be hopeless marsh in the winter, and up absurd gradients. But nowhere throughout its length did I see any evidence of road-making. There was a track--you couldn't well get off it, {{and it was all}} you could do to stay on it. The <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> a foot thick in the blind ruts, and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air. The journey in itself was a delight. Sometimes we crashed through bracken; anon, where the blackberries grew rankest, we found a lonely little cemetery, the wooden rails all awry and the pitiful, stumpy head-stones nodding drunkenly at the soft green mullions. Then, with oaths and the sound of rent underwood, a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a [...] "skid" [...] road, hauling a forty-foot log along a rudely made slide.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye, she was sorry, and {{she said}} so,' said Sir Richard, coming back with a little start. 'Very soon--but {{he said it was}} two full hours later--De Aquila rode to the door, with his shield new scoured (Hugh had {{cleansed}} it), and demanded entertainment, and called me a false knight, that would starve his overlord to death. Then Hugh cried out that no man should work in the valley that day, and our Saxons blew horns, and set about feasting and drinking, and running of races, and dancing and singing; and De Aquila climbed upon a horse-block and spoke to them in what he swore was good Saxon, but no man understood it. At night we feasted in the Great Hall, and when the harpers and the singers were gone we four sat late at the high table. As I remember, it was a warm night with a full moon, and De Aquila bade Hugh take down his sword from the wall again, for the honour of the Manor of Dallington, and Hugh took it gladly enough. <b>Dust</b> <b>lay</b> on the hilt, for I saw him blow it off.|$|R
60|$|They {{were riding}} on the margin of turf, {{bordering}} the road on either side, {{so as to avoid}} the <b>dust</b> that <b>lay</b> thick and white upon it; and they held on at an easy canter, till they reached the trees. Then, at Philip's order, they scattered and went at a walk; so as to avoid leaving marks that could be seen, at once, by anyone following them. A couple of hundred yards farther, they came upon a stream running through a wood. It was but a few inches deep.|$|R
60|$|To {{the little}} man who edited The Atheist, a fiery little Scotchman, with fiery, red hair and beard, going {{by the name of}} Turnbull, all this decline in public {{importance}} seemed not so much sad or even mad, but merely bewildering and unaccountable. He had said {{the worst thing that could}} be said; and it seemed accepted and ignored like the ordinary second best of the politicians. Every day his blasphemies looked more glaring, and every day the <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thicker upon them. It made him feel as if he were moving in a world of idiots. He seemed among a race of men who smiled when told of their own death, or looked vacantly at the Day of Judgement. Year after year went by, and year after year the death of God in a shop in Ludgate became a less and less important occurrence. All the forward men of his age discouraged Turnbull. The socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists. The artists said that the soul was most spiritual, not when freed from religion, but when freed from morality. Year after year went by, and at least a man came by who treated Mr. Turnbull's secularist shop with a real respect and seriousness. He was a young man in a grey plaid, and he smashed the window.|$|R
60|$|The boy hesitated as {{he stood}} {{on the edge of the}} road and pointed with mingled {{mischief}} and fastidiousness to the depths of impalpable red <b>dust</b> that <b>lay</b> between him and the horseman. Steptoe saw that he was very smartly attired in holiday guise, with white duck trousers and patent leather shoes, and, after the Spanish fashion, wore black kid gloves. He certainly was a bit of a dandy, as he had said. The father's whole face changed as he wheeled and came before the lad, who lifted up his arms expectantly. They had often ridden together on the same horse.|$|R
6000|$|They did {{not look}} round, and he kept them just within sight, getting down if he chanced to draw closely upon them round a corner. By riding vigorously he kept quite {{conveniently}} near them, for they made but little hurry. He grew hot indeed, and his knees were a little stiff to begin with, but that was all. There was little danger of losing them, for a thin chalky <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> upon the road, and the track of her tire was milled like a shilling, and his was a chequered ribbon along the way. So they rode by Cobden's monument and through the prettiest of villages, until at last the downs rose steeply ahead. There they stopped awhile at the only inn in the place, and Mr. Hoopdriver took up a position which commanded the inn door, and mopped his face and thirsted and smoked a Red Herring cigarette. They remained in the inn for some time. A number of chubby innocents returning home from school, stopped and formed a line in front of him, and watched him quietly but firmly for the space of ten minutes or so. [...] "Go away," [...] said he, and they only seemed quietly interested. He asked them all their names then, and they answered indistinct murmurs. He gave it up at last and became passive on his gate, and so at length they tired of him.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} a pleasant afternoon when I was thus awaiting {{her in the}} outskirts of the village. The eternal smile of the Californian summer had begun to waver and grow less fixed; <b>dust</b> <b>lay</b> thick on leaf and blade; the dry hills were clothed in russet leather; the trade winds were shifting to the south with an ominous warm humidity; a few days longer and the rains would be here. It so chanced that this afternoon my seclusion on the roadside was accidentally invaded by a village belle--a Western young lady somewhat older than myself, and of flirtatious reputation. As she persistently and--as I now have reason to believe--mischievously lingered, I had only a passing glimpse of Consuelo riding past at an unaccustomed speed which surprised me at the moment. But as I reasoned later that she was only trying to avoid a merely formal meeting, I thought no more about it. It was not until I called at the house to fetch Chu Chu at the usual hour, and found that Consuelo had not yet returned, that a recollection of Chu Chu's furious pace again troubled me. An hour passed--it was getting towards sunset, but there were no signs of Chu Chu nor her mistress. I became seriously alarmed. I did not care to reveal my fears to the family, for I felt myself responsible for Chu Chu. At last I desperately saddled my horse, and galloped off in the direction she had taken. It was the road to Rosario and the hacienda of one of her relations, where she sometimes halted.|$|R
