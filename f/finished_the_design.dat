25|$|While the {{full-scale}} Aerodrome {{was being}} designed and built, the {{internal combustion engine}} was contracted out to manufacturer Stephen M. Balzer (1864–1940). When he failed to produce an engine to the power and weight specifications, Manly <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design.</b> This engine had far more power than did the engine for the Wright brothers' first airplane—50hp compared to 12hp. The engine, mostly the technical work of men other than Langley, was probably the project's main contribution to aviation.|$|E

2500|$|Because Kahn had a {{reputation}} for significant time and cost overruns, a local engineering and architectural firm owned by Preston M. Geren was made associate architect, a practice followed in Fort Worth for out-of-state architects. Frank Sherwood served as their project coordinator. [...] The Geren organization had a solid reputation for bringing in projects on time and within budget, but by their own admission they were not especially innovative. [...] The contract called for control over construction to be turned over to Geren when Kahn had <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> a provision that eventually led to conflict because Kahn felt that a design was never finished until the building was constructed. [...] Kahn once said, [...] "the building gives you answers as it grows and becomes itself." [...] The museum trustees settled the issue by deciding that Geren would report directly to them instead of to Kahn, but that Kahn would have final say over the design, except that any changes would have to be approved by Brown.|$|E

2500|$|Work on the GM {{electric}} car program continued {{after the end}} of PrEView. While the original 50 Impact cars were destroyed after testing was <b>finished,</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> had evolved into the GM EV1 by 1996. The EV1 would be the first GM car in history to wear a [...] "General Motors" [...] nameplate, instead of one of GM's marques. The first-generation, or [...] "Gen I" [...] car, which would be powered by lead-acid batteries and had a stated range of 70 to 100 miles; 660 cars, painted dark green, red, and silver were produced. The cars were made available via a leasing program, with the option to purchase the cars specifically disallowed by a contractual clause (the suggested retail price was quoted as $34,000). In similar fashion to the PrEView program, lessees were pre-screened by GM, with only residents of Southern California and Arizona eligible for participation. Leasing rates for the EV1 ranged from $399 to $549 a month. The car's launch was a media event, accompanied by an $8 million promotional campaign, which included prime-time TV advertising, billboards, a web site, and an appearance at the premiere of the Sylvester Stallone film Daylight. The first lessees included celebrities, executives and politicians. A total of 40 EV1 leases were signed at the release event, with GM estimating that it would lease 100 cars {{by the end of the}} year. Deliveries began on December 5, 1996.|$|E

50|$|An {{exploratory}} tunnel {{was initially}} driven at {{the crown of}} the tunnel to provide input into rock quality. This gave the designer excellent information to <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> <b>design.</b> <b>The</b> cavern was constructed using a heading and bench approach, first excavating the heading and following with the bench excavation. All excavation on the cavern was accomplished using drill and blast methods. Vibration monitoring stations were established in buildings along Peachtree Street to monitor the vibrations and compare to contract limits.|$|R
50|$|The {{designers}} {{were asked}} to design a look for a Fashion Week gala.

50|$|In 1901, the Berlin {{architect}} Max Spitta was {{entrusted with}} the construction plans for the church. However, as Spitta died in December 1902, architect Franz Schwechten <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> in late Romanesque style. The foundation was laid in 1903 and the new church was inaugurated {{in the presence of}} the imperial couple on 17 May 1908. The building was primarily constructed by the Philipp Holzmann Company from Frankfurt. The numerous artisan works inside the building were the work of local craft shops.|$|E
50|$|Dismissing {{the idea}} of a design with two upright sails, Drake decided to move the sail by rotation, as moving it linearly would require a {{mechanical}} system. Experimenting with a rotational design which became the concept for the universal joint, whereby the angle of attack of the sail to the board could be varied to allow control of both power and craft direction. Drake <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> by using an earlier but for them failed invention of East Coast racing sail, and added a wishbone boom.|$|E
50|$|In 1968 boat {{designers}} Rod MacApline-Downie and Dick Gibbs {{designed the}} Buccaneer 18. It {{was a popular}} sailboat design, but it led to a demand for a lighter, more affordable boat. Three years later, in 1971, MacApline-Downie and Gibbs <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> on the Mutineer 15. The Mutineer and Buccaneer are very similar in basic design, and include {{many of the same}} features. At the time it was designed, the Mutineer had several innovative features, including the roller furling jib, spinnaker rigging, and a foredeck launcher tube.|$|E

50|$|Around 1974, Crouwel was {{commissioned}} by typewriter manufacturer Olivetti to design a typeface for their new electric typewriters. The result was a sans serif monoline (all lines are of equal thickness) typeface. Olivetti called it Politene. All characters {{are based on a}} square grid, with the 45-degree corners. Before Crouwel could <b>finish</b> <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> <b>the</b> interest for electric typewriters declined, so much so that they did not need <b>the</b> type <b>design</b> anymore. As a consequence, the copyrights of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> went back to Crouwel. At the same time they commissioned Crouwel, they asked Josef Müller-Brockmann to design a typeface as well.|$|R

50|$|The theater {{has been}} {{described}} as too modern and not modern enough, too ambitious and too restrained. The theater was built on a surface of 567,700 square foot, has 2000 seats and facilities for 2,500 staff members. The last architect Diamond Schmitt Architects <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> by creating an onyx wall which is visible from outside and illuminated. The lobby has a modern style with several straight and spiral staircases with glass balustrades. For the glass stairs and balustrades Diamond Schmitt Architects co-operated with EeStairs as well as some other individual construction professionals during the consultation process for the new theatre.

5000|$|Charter was {{originally}} optimized for printing on the low-resolution 300 dpi laser printers of the 1980s, and remains suitable for printing on both modern high-resolution laser printers and inexpensive lower resolution inkjet printers {{due to its}} strong, legible design. Its structure was optimised for low-memory computers and printers. In a 2013 interview, Carter explained that it used [...] "a very simplified structure and a minimum number of curves, more straight-line segments... very economical compared to, say, Times New Roman," [...] but noted that rapid development of printers made this unnecessary even before he had <b>finished</b> <b>the</b> <b>design.</b> In its simplification of serif forms, it anticipates Carter's later landmark design, Georgia for Microsoft.|$|E
