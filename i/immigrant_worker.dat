40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify the status of occupational health and safety services for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers,</b> the barriers to employing <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> and the needs of the managers in workplaces to keep <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> healthy and safe. This study was a crosssectional survey. We sent self-administered questionnaires to 126 workplaces in the western part of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan in August 2006. The questionnaire included the characteristics of the workplace, barriers to employing <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers,</b> current actions to keep <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> healthy and safe, the implementation rate of health checkups and important issues to keep <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> healthy and safe. Implementation rates of health and safety education, creating job instruction manuals written in their native languages, creating safety signs written in their native languages, and the use of translators were 62. 5 %, 50. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 37. 5 %, respectively. Implementation rates of general health checkups, special health checkups and follow up after health checkups were 80. 8 %, 73. 6 % and 67. 3 %, respectively. The most important issue which the managers considered kept <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> healthy and safe was health checkups (69. 6 %). In conclusion, several occupational health and safety services were conducted for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> without a margin to compare with Japanese workers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this review}} is to examine whether <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> have a higher {{occupational}} injury rate than native employees. We collected 72 studies from around the world. A calculation based on 31 of these studies shows {{that the risk of}} occupational injury for foreign-born workers is 2. 13 times higher than that of native-born workers. In seven studies immigrants actually had a lower occupational injury rate. At highest, <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> had ten times the injury rate of native workers, whereas in one USA study the occupational injury rate of <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> was only half of that of American-born workers. However, three studies consistently showed that <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> had a higher injury rate than the original population during their first five years at the workplace, but that after five years their rate decreased to below the level of native workers. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> have a worse work conditions than native workers...|$|R

When their relationship becomes known, they experience various forms of hostility and public rejection.

40|$|Abstract Background No {{national}} study has investigated whether <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> {{are less likely}} than U. S. -workers to seek medical treatment after occupational injuries and whether the payment source differs between two groups. Methods Using the 2004 – 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data, we estimated the annual incidence rate of nonfatal occupational injuries per 100 workers. Logistic regression models were fitted to test whether injured <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> were less likely than U. S. -born workers to seek professional medical treatment after occupational injuries. We also estimated the average mean medical expenditures per injured worker during the 2 [*]year MEPS reference period using linear regression analysis, adjusting for gender, age, race, marital status, education, poverty level, and insurance. Types of service and sources of payment were compared between U. S. -born and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Results A total of 1, 909 injured U. S. -born workers reported 2, 176 occupational injury events and 508 injured <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> reported 560 occupational injury events. The annual nonfatal incidence rate per 100 workers was 4. 0 % (95 % CI: 3. 8 %- 4. 3 %) for U. S. -born workers and 3. 0 % (95 % CI: 2. 6 %- 3. 3 %) for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Medical treatment was sought after 77. 3 % (95 % CI: 75. 1 %- 79. 4 %) of the occupational injuries suffered by U. S. -born workers and 75. 6 % (95 % CI: 69. 8 %- 80. 7 %) of the occupational injuries suffered by <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> The average medical expenditure per injured worker in the 2 [*]year MEPS reference period was $ 2357 for the U. S. -born workers and $ 2, 351 for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> (in 2009 U. S. dollars, P [*]=[*] 0. 99). Workers’ compensation paid 57. 0 % (95 % CI: 49. 4 %- 63. 6 %) of the total expenditures for U. S. -born workers and 43. 2 % (95 % CI: 33. 0 %- 53. 7 %) for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> U. S. -born workers paid 6. 7 % (95 % CI: 5. 5 %- 8. 3 %) and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> paid 7. 1 % (95 % CI: 5. 2 %- 9. 6 %) out-of-pocket. Conclusions <b>Immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> had a statistically significant lower incidence rate of nonfatal occupational injuries than U. S. -born workers. There {{was no significant difference in}} seeking medical treatment and in the mean expenditures per injured worker between the two groups. The proportion of total expenditures paid by workers’ compensation was smaller (marginally significant) for <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> than for U. S. -born workers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose : – The paper's {{aim is to}} {{introduce}} the interactive acculturation model (IAM) of Bourhis et al. to predict how disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> relates {{to the quality of}} intergroup work-relations. Design/methodology/approach : – The sample consisted of 141 host community (Dutch) and 41 non-western <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> of a postal service company who filled out a questionnaire. Methods of analyses include analysis of variance and multiple regression. Findings : – In line with the IAM, results showed that a higher disconcordance in preferred acculturation orientations between host community and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers</b> related to a poorer quality of intergroup work-relations. However, intergroup contact moderated this relationship differently for host community and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Research limitations/implications : – Data are cross-sectional and collected in one organization. Future studies should replicate the findings to other organizational contexts, cultural groups, and collect longitudinal data to determine causal effects. Practical implications : – Organizations should monitor disconcordance in acculturation orientations amongst host community and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> A multicultural culture in organizations may reduce disconcordance in acculturation orientations between host community and <b>immigrant</b> <b>workers.</b> Originality/value : – The paper helps to explain the mixed findings in cultural diversity research so far, by demonstrating that disconcordance in acculturation orientations relates negatively to intergroup work-relations in a multicultural workplace...|$|R
