[...] In 1943, Louis made an appearance in the wartime Hollywood musical This Is the Army, directed by Michael Curtiz. He appeared as himself in a musical number, [...] "The Well-Dressed Man in Harlem," [...] which emphasized the importance of African-American soldiers and promoted their enlistment.|$|E

6000|$|... "I sure am, Tom!" [...] was the reply, and Sam's tones showed what {{a weight}} {{had been taken}} from his heart. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it up with Grace before another twenty-four hours pass." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{learned a}} thing or two since I came here. At first I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> them while they were at home, but now I've learned that they are going away on a {{houseboat}} trip on the Ohio and the Mississippi. I propose to follow them and give them more than they want the first opportunity that presents itself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Our {{fellow human}} creatures {{will be all}} right--so long as they don't come into our kitchen when they've no {{business}} there,' retorted my father, somewhat testily.

6000|$|Saxton nodded. [...] "Then {{you will}} have to get into the mine, though I don't quite know how we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it yet," [...] he said.

At the island, Steph finds out Luke is a virgin and offers to give him sex lessons. After taking a shower and having sex together, Luke tells Steph that he loves her. She reacts with astonishment and it's obvious (to the viewer, although not to Luke) that she's not looking for that kind of relationship with him. Justin later contacts Steph asking if she wants to hang out.|$|R

"I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> up a tree," [...] {{said little}} Archie, {{and managed to}} smuggle a small {{evergreen}} {{into the house and}} place it in a large closet that was not being used.

50|$|Clay and Clayboy go {{to college}} to show the dean Clayboy's {{certificate}} for Latin. He accepts it, and adds the name Clay Spencer Jr. to the roll of incoming freshmen. Clay then visits a friend to get a loan {{to pay for the}} college. Unfortunately, Minnie-Cora, who Clayboy had earlier rejected, is now married to the friend, and she won't let him lend Clay the money. Olivia takes the kids home and tells Clay to give up - Clayboy is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get to college. Clay visits the new house, now well under construction, and hears Olivia's words echoing in his mind as he strolls around the place. Drenching the wood framing in accelerant, he burns the house down. Later, at home, he tells Olivia all the things he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> up their existing home, and tells her the new house is gone. He's sold the land to Col. Coleman to pay for Clayboy's college.|$|R
5000|$|JPMorgan {{would be}} fine if we stopped talking about the damn {{nationalization}} of banks. We've got plenty of capital. To policymakers, I say where were they? ...

60|$|She {{went on a}} long way. Still we went on. It was evident, {{from the}} manner in which she held her course, that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> some <b>fixed</b> destination; and this, and her keeping in the busy streets, and I suppose the strange fascination in the secrecy and mystery of so {{following}} anyone, made me adhere to my first purpose. At length she turned into a dull, dark street, where the noise and crowd were lost; and I said, 'We may speak to her now'; and, mending our pace, we went after her.|$|R

40|$|The muon and J/Psi {{combined}} reconstruction was {{studied in}} an environment of Beauty events. It was used a full simulation of all the relevant components of the ATLAS detector. In particular, the reconstruction efficiency of the two muons from the J/Psi meson was studied in details. It was observed that the muon reconstruction efficiency decreases {{in the case of the}} two close muons. However, this problem has been clarified that is not in the reconstruction but in the simulation stage, digitization of TGC's, of DICE version for Physics TDR and is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>fixed</b> by the new version of DICE...|$|R
40|$|Although misdemeanors {{comprise}} {{an overwhelming}} majority of state criminal court cases, little judicial and scholarly attention has been focused on how misdemeanor courts actually operate. In her article, Misdemeanors, Alexandra Natapoff rights this wrong and explains how the low-visibility, highly discretionary decisions made by actors at the misdemeanor level often result in rampant discrimination, incredible inefficiency, and vast miscarriages of justice. Misdemeanors makes a significant contribution to the literature by refocusing attention on the importance of misdemeanor offenses and beginning an important dialogue about what steps should be taken <b>going</b> forward <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> our broken misdemeanor justice system...|$|R
5000|$|The crash, {{as well as}} Jeff Gordon's {{crash in}} Atlanta weeks later, was {{a wake-up call to}} several race-tracks to install more SAFER barriers.

We should have had a SAFER Barrier there. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> that right now." [...] Other tracks such as Talladega Superspeedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, Dover International Speedway, and several other tracks vowed to install SAFER barriers alongside the whole track soon afterwards.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, while {{commenting on}} defense {{programs}} {{likely to be}} cut following the change in government, John Young, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, stated that the VH-71 [...] "is very high on that list". The rising cost of VH-71 program contrasted poorly with President Barack Obama's stance on curbing government spending; during a White House gathering in February 2009 President Obama commented that the procurement process had [...] "gone amok and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it." [...] He additionally stated that [...] "The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me." [...] In March 2009 the projected total cost for the planned 28 VH-71s was over $13billion. [...] On 6 April 2009 the proposed Defense budget announced by Defense Secretary Robert Gates had not included funding for the VH-71. [...] On 1 June 2009, the U.S. Navy announced that the contract was officially canceled, and that remaining funds were to be reinvested in upgrades to the existing fleet of VH-3D and VH-60N helicopters. [...] Nine VH-71s had been completed at time of the cancellation.|$|R

40|$|In {{this note}} {{we present a}} second {{independent}} proof for the theorem introduced previously that establishes an isomorphism between SU(2) and LB 1 X LB 1 X LB 1. Since the local groups LB 1 and LB 2 are isomorphic, it was also previously proved a similar result for LB 2 X LB 2 X LB 2. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> reverse the three sets of tetrads that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be used {{in order to prove}} this new version. Instead of choosing three SU(2) different tetrads keeping the electromagnetic tetrad the same for all three sets of SU(2) tetrads, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> keep <b>fixed</b> the SU(2) tetrad, that is, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pick just one SU(2) tetrad but choose three different arbitrary but fixed electromagnetic tetrads in order to gauge locally the only local SU(2) tetrad involved in our new version of this theorem. The same result will be obtained via an alternative but equivalent way. Comment: A new and straightforward version of the theorem presented in "Tetrads in Yang-Mills geometrodynamics...|$|R
