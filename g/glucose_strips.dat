In this paper we critically evaluated the long-term stability of <b>glucose</b> <b>strips</b> made of barrel plating gold electrodes. Compared to other glucose biosensing platforms of vapor deposited palladium and screen printed carbon electrodes, the proposed glucose biosensor was found to show the best stability among the three biosensing platforms in thermal acceleration experiments at 40 degrees C for 6 months with an average bias of 3. 4 % at glucose concentrations of 5 - 20 mM. The precision test of this barrel plating gold glucose biosensor also showed the best performance (coefficients of variation {{in the range of}} 1. 4 - 2. 4 %) in thermal acceleration experiments at 40 degrees C, 50 degrees C and 70 degrees C for 27 days. Error grid analysis revealed that all measurements fell in zone A and zone B. Regression analysis showed {{no significant difference between the}} proposed biosensor and the reference method at 99 % confidence level. The amperometric glucose biosensor fabricated by inserting two barrel plating gold electrodes onto an injection-molding plastic base followed by immobilizing with a bio-reagent layer and membrane was very impressive with a long-term stability up to 2. 5 years at 25 degrees C. Overall, these results indicated that the glucose oxidase/barrel plating gold biosensing platform is ideal for long-term accurate glycemic control. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Extrafloral glands in Passifloraceae {{species have}} aroused the {{interest}} of many researchers because of their wide morphological diversity. The present work analyzed the foliar glands on 34 species of Passiflora from samples containing glands in the petiole and foliar blade fixed in 50 % solution of formaldehyde-ethanol-acetic acid and stored in a 70 % ethanol solution. For anatomical analyses, part of the material was embedded in Paraplast, longitudinally sectioned and double stained with safranin and astra blue. Scanning electron microscopy analysis was also carried out. To analyze the presence of sugars in the secretion of foliar glands, a <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> test was used. Based {{on the results of}} morphological, anatomical and <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> tests, the foliar secretory glands in Passiflora can be grouped into two categories: Type I glands, defined as nectaries, can be elevated or flattened, and can have a sugar content high enough to be detected by the <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> test analysis. Type II glands are elevated and did not show a positive reaction to the <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> test. From an anatomical viewpoint, glands characterized as extrafloral nectaries show a multistratified secretory epidermis, typically followed by two flat layers of nectariferous parenchyma with dense content. Internal to these layers, vascular bundles are immersed in the subsecretory parenchyma and terminate in phloem cells. On the other hand, type II glands show a single layer of elongated secretory epidermal cells. Internal to this single layer, parenchyma and vascular tissue with both phloem and xylem elements can be observed. The analyzed species show a wide diversity of gland shape and distribution, and the combined analysis of morphology, anatomy and preliminary tests for the presence of glucose in the exudate in different Passiflora subgenera suggests the occurrence of two categories of glands: nectaries and resin glands...|$|R

40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the direct costs associated with type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus in Spain taking into account a National Health Service perspective. Method A costs of illness study was conducted using the prevalence approach and data from existing databases and bibliographic references related to the use of resources in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The costs categories analysed were: hospital costs (including outpatient care), primary care costs (including additional tests cost and self monitoring blood <b>glucose</b> <b>strips</b> cost) and drug costs. In calculating the non-related cost, only the extra cost was taken into account. Additionally, we analysed the complications cost independently of where costs were originated. Costs were updated to 2012 euros. Results The total direct annual cost of diabetes mellitus was 5, 809 million euros, representing 8. 2 % of the total Spanish health expenditure. Drug costs was the major component of total cost (38 %), followed by hospital costs (33 %). Drug costs accounted for 2, 232 million euros, with antidiabetic drugs costs being 861 million euros (15 %). Self monitoring blood <b>glucose</b> <b>strips</b> only contributed 118 million euros (2 %) to the total cost. The cost of complications cost was 2, 143 million euros, around 37 % of the total. Conclusions Total direct costs associated with diabetes mellitus represent a high proportion of total Spanish health expenditure. It is crucial to introduce measures and strategies to improve efficiency in the control and treatment of diabetes mellitus, with the final purpose of reducing its complications and the considerable economic impact generated. © 2013 Sociedad Española de Diabetes.

40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a laboratory assessment of five blood glucose meters. The instruments ' analytical characteristics under optimum laboratory conditions and examination of {{potential sources of}} errors were intercompared. All glucometers produced precise results, and {{in all but one}} meter the CV values varied between 1. 5 % and 6 %. CV's for reproducibility and within-day precision of Glucometer Gx were 10. 5 % and 7. 3 %. Sample volume, blood incubation time and colour stability of the strip may influence the results of blood glucose measurements with glucose meters. Underloading the sample strip had statistically significant effects on normal blood glucose values for all meters. One Touch II gave also significantly different results when the strip was overloaded. Incubation times shorter or longer than those recommended by the manufac-turer influenced the results of all glucose meters. After colour development of the strip, changes were small for Haemo-Glukotest 20 - 800 R strips and Glucotrix, whereas Accutrend <b>glucose</b> <b>strips</b> had to be read immediately following the prescribed incubation time. Comparison of the glucose meter results with those obtained by the hexokinase method showed good correlation coefficients for Reflolux S (r = 0. 992), Accutrend (r = 0. 988), One Touch II (r = 0. 942), Glucometer Gx (r = 0. 986) and Glucocard (r = 0. 976). Error grid analysis showed that the results of all meters were clinically correct. Variations in haematocrit are known {{to be a source of}} errors when blood glucose is determined with a test strip. In the normoglycaemic range the results obtained with Accutrend and Glucocard were not influenced by even extreme haematocrit values. In the high glucose concentration range there was a decrease in blood glucose values with increasing haematocrit for all meters. This error was smaller with Accutrend and Glucocard than with the other meters.

The objectives: To set the {{parameters}} of calved cow’s milk, biochemical indicators of cows and calves blood and cow‘s body mass index and to explain how biochemical indicators in cow’s blood influence calves health. Place of investigation and methodology: The experiment was accomplished during the months of August - October 2012 in ŽŪB Grūduva, located in the Gotlybiskiu village Šakiai region. 13 cows of various lactation and productivity mainly of Holstein and Lithuanian Black and White dairy cow breeds and 13 Holstein and Lithuanian Black and White dairy calves were selected for the experiment. The samples were taken from jugular vein in the neck, using vacuum, disposable tubes without anticoaugulant. (BD Vacutiner, England.). Blood samples were taken from calved cows 2 days after parturition, then after 7 days, and after 14 days. Calves blood samples were taken {{at the age of}} two-days-old, then 7 -days-old and two weeks of age. While taking the samples the calves were weighed and rectal temperature was measured. Biochemical parameters of: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg, urea, phosphorum (P), albumen (ALB), total protein (B. b.), enzymes aspartate aminotransferae (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration in serum were investigated with computerized analyzer „Hitachi 705 “ (Hitachi, Japan) using DiaSys“ (Diagnostic Systems GmbH, Germany). Blood glucose (mmol / l) was determined by using disposable <b>glucose</b> <b>strips.</b> From the blood serum the quantity of calves immunoglobulin G was determined. Information on milk somatic cells (SCC), milk protein, milk fat, milk, lactose and the amount of urea was collected using the SE “Pieno Tyrimai” data. In the investigated dairy farm, herd management and accounting is managed using "Afifarm" computerized herd management program. Results: The results obtained while carrying out the experiment showed that the biochemical parameters of calved cows blood influence young calves blood indicators. A positive relationship was established between cows phosphorus and calves magnesium; calcium of cows and calves albumins (p < 0. 05) negative correlation between the total protein in cows and ALT in calves, and the urea of cows and calves (p < 0. 05). During the experiment calves put on 4. 5 kg of weight in 14 days Average one calve weight increase per day was 0. 321 kg which was not considered as high. According to Kulpis J. (2010) during the lactation period the calves should not be fed too much. What is important is that during the lactation period the calves would be healthy and resistant to infections. During the experiment half of the calves did not have proper amount of immunoglobulin G. The data showed that calved cow’s body mass index (KMI) didn’t have influence young calves blood glucose, urea, ALT, AST, phosphorus indicators.

Diabetes costs estimated from the data and reported experience of diabetic patients first seen at the diabetes clinic at Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam in 1981 / 82 and patients with newly diagnosed diabetes seen in 1989 / 90. Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 464 patients: 315 men, 149 women. All 202 patients diagnosed to have diabetes between 1 June 1981 and 31 August 1982 (Group I). All 262 patients diagnosed between 1 September 1989 and 31 October, 1990 (Group II). The average direct cost of diagnosis per person was Tshs. 2212 (US $ 11). The average one year direct cost of diabetes care in 1989 - 90 was Tshs 57365 (US $ 287) for a patient with insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (IRDM) and Tshs 20553 (US $ 103) for a patient with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Outpatient costs accounted for 79. 8 % of the total direct cost in an IRDM patient while the corresponding figure for an NIDDM patient was 67. 2 %. For an IRDM patient insulin purchase accounted for 68. 2 % of the average one year direct outpatient costs, and treatment of chronic complications and infections accounted for 13. 2 %. For an NIDDM patient, of the total one year direct outpatient costs, purchase of oral hypoglycaemic drugs was 42. 5 % and treatment of chronic complications and infections was 48. 8 %. Indirect costs were calculated in terms of Healthy Life Days (HLDs) lost because of diabetes mellitus. It was found that total future healthy life days lost per patient were 4100 days. Of these 69 % were lost because of premature mortality, 1 % was lost due to disability before death, 29 % because of chronic disability and 1 % due to infections and acute complications associated with diabetes. Vii For outpatient care of all diabetic patients 15 years and above in Tanzania in 1989 - 90 about US $ 2, 721, 151 were needed.

To have cared for all diabetic patients 15 years and above in Tanzania in the year 1989 / 90 about Tshs. 795, 292, 530 (US $ 3, 976, 463) would therefore have been required. Of the total direct costs, 68 % was for outpatient care and 32 % for inpatient care. Excluding costs for transport (born by the patients themselves) and self home blood or urine glucose monitoring (not presently done) from the total direct costs of diabetes care, then the actual government exp€nditure on diabetes care in 1989 / 90 was Tshs. 769, 713, 714 (US $ 3, 848, 569). This implies that 0. 2 % (diabetic patients who were on treatment) of the Tanzanian population 15 years and above used about 8. 1 % of the total government health expenditure which was Tshs. 9, 481, 676, 460 (US $ 47, 408, 382) Financial requirements {{for the care of}} diabetic patients in Tanzania are therefore extensive, and place a very great burden on the limited government resources available for health care. This study highlights the increasing strain which the care of patients with chronic diseases will place on the health budgets of developing countries and the need for exploring alternative methods of health c...|$|E
25|$|The first-generation devices {{relied on}} the same {{colorimetric}} reaction that is still used nowadays in <b>glucose</b> test <b>strips</b> for urine. Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the test strip had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|R
25|$|The cost of home {{blood glucose}} {{monitoring}} can be substantial {{due to the}} cost of the test strips. In 2006, the consumer cost of each <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> ranged from about $0.35 to $1.00. Manufacturers often provide meters at no cost to induce use of the profitable test strips. Type 1 diabetics may test as often as 4 to 10 times a day due to the dynamics of insulin adjustment, whereas type 2 typically test less frequently, especially when insulin is not part of treatment. A recent study on the comparative cost-effectiveness of all options for the self-monitoring of blood glucose funded by the National Health Service in the UK uncovered considerable variation in the price paid, which could not be explained by the availability of advanced meter features. It estimated that a total of £12 m was invested in providing 42 million self-monitoring of blood glucose tests with systems that fail to meet acceptable accuracy standards, and efficiency savings of £23.2 m per annum are achievable if the National Health Service were to disinvest from technologies providing lesser functionality than available alternatives, but at a much higher price.|$|R
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article by Polonsky et al. (1) reporting that self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) improves glycemic control in noninsulin-treated type 2 diabetes. In the U. K., SMBG is recommended for insulin-treated diabetes (2), and controversy exists in relation to treatment with lifestyle advice or oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs). A Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient {{evidence to support the}} use of SMBG in noninsulintreated type 2 diabetes (3). Furthermore, a health technology assessment review suggests that SMBG has limited clinical effectiveness in improving glycemic control in noninsulin-treated type 2 diabetes (4). In view of the widespread use of SMBG, cost implications, and the fact that U. K. management algorithms are based on HbA 1 c targets (2), clarity is required on the role of SMBG. We used the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) databank (5) to examine <b>glucose</b> <b>strip</b> prescribing in relation to HbA 1 c in groups treated with diet, OHAs, and insulin. SAIL contains patient data from 35 primary care systems for the Swansea area (n 5 250, 086). We examined the diabetes population aged 18 – 70 yearswithanHbA 1 c performe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Both Roche and Abbott have {{released}} new <b>glucose</b> meter <b>strips.</b> They supply the entire Australian hospital market. The present study compared {{the performance of}} the new strips utilizing various specimen types (capillary, venous lithium heparin whole blood, venous lithium heparin plasma and serum) and evaluated how well they comply with the International Standards Organization (ISO) 15197 criteria. Methods: The study included imprecision, patient comparison and interference studies. Participants with and without diabetes were recruited to evaluate the performance of various specimen types against the Beckman DxC 800 <b>glucose</b> method. The <b>strips</b> were tested for different interferences: galactose, maltose, lactose, Icodextrin, Intragam, paracetamol, sodium, ascorbic acid, variable strip storage temperature, haematocrit, haemolysis and lipaemia. Results: The imprecision of the two strips was ∼ 5 % or less, except for the Abbott strip at very low values (1. 4 mmol/L), ∼ 7 %. In total, 78 % and 84 %, respectively, of the results from the finger prick capillary specimens with the Roche (Accu-Chek Performa meter) and Abbott (Optium Xceed meter) strips, not 95 % or greater as recommended by the ISO guideline, were within the recommended limits compared with reference plasma estimation on laboratory analysers. Galactose, ascorbic acid, haematocrit and sodium on the Roche and ascorbic acid and haematocrit on the Abbott strip continue to interfere to a variable degree with the glucose measurement. Conclusion: Analytically small differences exist between the <b>glucose</b> meter <b>strips.</b> The most significant analytical difference with the strips was at low glucose levels when compared with laboratory analyses and this may be of clinical importance. The impact of some of the interferences is variable between the two strips. Individuals, health-care professionals and health-care institutions should consider these data when selecting glucose meters for the management of people with diabetes mellitus...|$|R
