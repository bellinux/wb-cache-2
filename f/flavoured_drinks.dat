40|$|Food {{additives}} are substances {{added to}} food to preserve flavour or enhance its taste and appearance. The most abundant additives used in production of refreshing-non alcoholic beverages (soft drinks) are: potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate caffeine, some artificial food colourings, artificial sweeteners etc. Different medical {{studies have shown}} that the usage of additives have various impact on human’s health. In the current study, the presence of: preservatives (potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate), caffeine, quinine chloride, synthetic food colorants, artificial sweeteners (saccharin, acesulfame potassium, sodium cyclamate and aspartame), citric acid, phosphoric acid and ascorbic acid were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography. For that purpose, 872 samples of soft drinks (carbonated mineralised and water based <b>flavoured</b> <b>drinks),</b> which were imported (751) and produced (121) in the Republic of Macedonia, from the period from 2008 to 2012 were analyzed. The obtained results showed different distribution of food additives in the imported soft drinks and soft drinks from the domestic producers. The most prominent additives in the imported soft drinks were found to be preservatives potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate, which were present in 80...|$|E
40|$|An {{exposure}} assessment {{was performed to}} estimate the daily intake of benzoates for the Flemish population. Three age groups were considered: preschool children (n = 697; age 2 - 6; 3 -day estimated dietary record), adolescents (n = 341; age 14 - 18; 7 -day estimated dietary record) and women (n = 641; age 18 - 40; 2 -day estimated dietary record). In {{a first step in}} the risk evaluation process as proposed by the European Union, the individual food consumption data were multiplied with the maximum permitted use levels for benzoates per food group. The median (interquartile range) estimated daily intake is, respectively, 2. 0 (1. 0 - 3. 2) mg/kg bw, 1. 7 (1. 1 - 2. 7) mg/kg bw and 1. 92 (1. 3 - 3. 0) mg/kg bw for preschool children, adolescents and adult women. In all age groups, the greatest potential contributor to the total estimated benzoate intake was the group of non-alcoholic <b>flavoured</b> <b>drinks.</b> At respectively the 92 nd percentile (children), the 97 th percentile (adolescents) and the 94 th percentile (women), the accepted daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg bw/day is exceeded slightly. However, this approach, in which the maximum permitted use levels are used is known to overestimate the intake, since not all food items in which benzoates are allowed, contain (the maximum permitted use level of) benzoates. A more precise estimation, using actual levels, is recommended. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the implications of substituting citric acid with other acidulants; malic acid, fumaric acid and tartaric acid and a combination thereof (Fruitaric® acid), in a <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> A trained sensory panel (n= 10) compared the sourness intensity of the acidulants at both equal sour and equal weight concentrations in water and in a Grape and a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> The sensory panel compared the temporal character of the acidulants at equal sour concentrations in water and both sports <b>drink</b> <b>flavours.</b> This included determining the rate, onset, duration and maximum intensity parameters of the perceived sourness. To determine if repeated exposure testing of sports drinks with the different acidulants added at equal sour concentrations would lead to hedonic adjustment, consumers (n= 128) were repeatedly exposed to a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink</b> {{over a period of}} 22 days. Citric acid, the acidulant currently used in the sports drinks, served as a reference in all the comparisons. Previously determined equal sour concentrations of tartaric and Fruitaric® acids as determined in water was found to be equally sour to citric acid when applied to water and a Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink</b> but less sour than citric acid when compared in the Grape <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drink.</b> Malic and tartaric acids were found to be equal sour to citric acid in water and both sports <b>drink</b> <b>flavours.</b> The application of equal sour concentrations seemed to be flavour specific. Sourness of water and more complex solutions, such as <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drinks,</b> seemed to be dependant on multiple factors including pH, titratable acidity, molecular weight, acidulant concentration and oBrix. The results from this study rejected anecdotal reports that acidulants differ in their temporal sensory profiles, although the lack of significant differences may be a function of the specific concentration level (0. 2 %) used. Repeated exposure testing of Lemon&Lime <b>flavoured</b> sports <b>drinks</b> with different acidulants resulted in hedonic adjustment. Consumer preferences post exposure could not have been predicted with a traditional consumer taste test {{at the start of the}} study. The findings of this study surely challenge the validity of sensory evaluation test strategies that rely on single exposure testing to predict long term consumer preferences.

40|$|A within-subject {{design was}} used to test whether {{repeatedly}} drinking a novel-flavoured and coloured drink while thirsty would influence subsequent liking for or consumption of that drink, compared to a different <b>flavoured</b> and coloured <b>drink</b> repeatedly consumed while less thirsty. Each participant was given 300 ml of one <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> (H) after consuming a high salt meal (5. 27 g of salt), and 300 ml of another <b>flavoured</b> <b>drink</b> (L) after consuming a low salt meal (1. 27 g of salt). Participants had 4 sessions with each meal-type/drink combination, in an intermixed order. Pre- and post-training assessments of the drinks were conducted to determine the impact of the training regime on pleasantness and perceived thirst-quenching effect of the drinks. The final session included a choice test, and ad libitum access to the chosen drink, after either a high or low salt meal. In this final choice session, people drank almost twice as much H as L; however, there were no differential effects of past training on rated liking or choice. The increased consumption of H might reflect greater liking for H which was not detected by the rating scales; or it might reflect the learning of greater "conditioned thirst" in response to the flavour of H. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{effect of}} colour {{conditioning}} on taste, quality and liking perception of fruit <b>flavoured</b> <b>drinks</b> {{was investigated in}} this study using a Between-Subjects Experimental Design. This study utilized twenty four (24) psychology students of Covenant University as participants. The colour of the fruit drink served as the independent variable while dependent variables such as taste, quality and liking perception were measured. Six research hypotheses were stated and tested. The results {{indicated that there was}} no significant difference in the association of colour with taste based on gender (t =. 29, p> 0. 05). Colour was observed to have a significant effect on taste and quality perception (t= 2. 10, p< 0. 05) and (t= 3. 0, p< 0. 05) respectively. Relationships between colour and the three dependent variables were observed. There was a negative but not significant relationship between colour and taste perception as well as colour and liking perception, while a positive but not significant relationship was observed between colour and quality perception. A significant positive relationship between quality and liking perception was observed (r=. 63, p< 0. 01). From the findings, it was concluded that colour has an effect on taste and quality perceptions although the result seemed inconclusive concerning the effect of colour on how much participants liked the drink. It is therefore recommended that food designers put into consideration the colour of food products as it would have an effect on consumers. decision making and buying behaviour. ...|$|E
40|$|The results {{reporting}} the hygiene and quality assessment, aerobic plate counts (APC), total coliform count (TCC), detection of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. of beverages and ice are reported. A total of 24 water and ice {{samples were collected}} from four educational institutes in Jeli, Kelantan. The analysis showed that the aerobic plate counts (CFU/ 100 ml) were identified with viable contamination measuring between less than 1. 6 CFU/ 100 ml to 17 CFU/ 100 ml. The contamination by total conform count was detected with the highest value at > 1100 CFU/ml and the lowest are < 3. 0 CFU/ml. Generally, most of the aerobic plate counts were counted as estimated aerobic plate counts (EAPC) as the count of viable detection is less than 25 colonies. Similar hygiene and quality assessment was done in Pattani area which is in Prince of Songkla University. The focus areas are Lan It and Lan Lay which are located in PSU area and covered 4 samples each. The methods used for detecting the potential microbes were aerobic plate count, total coliform count by most probable number, and detection of E. coli and Salmonella spp. count. However, all samples were tested negative for E. coli and Salmonella spp. detection. Coconut from Lan It and tamarind from Lan Lay showed numerous counts in APC whereby the highest count is 14 CFU/ 100 ml. Out of eight samples there were five samples that showed positive results for total coliform count. In a nutshell, the value of contamination of microorganisms in PSU, Pattani was higher than in UMK, Jeli particularly in the coconut and syrup <b>flavoured</b> <b>drinks...</b>|$|E
