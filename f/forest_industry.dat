He also held the federal seat of O'Connor in Western Australia, which included much of the Great Southern region and significant areas of plantation forests. Tuckey and the <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> had a close relationship, {{to the extent that}} the industry paid for newspaper advertisements that reproduced a letter from Tuckey, following critical coverage of forestry MIS schemes in the media.

5|$|The German Empire saw Eastern Europe - {{primarily}} Russia - as a {{major source}} of vital products and raw materials, both during World War I and in the future. Her resources overstretched by the two-front war, Germany pursued a policy of breaking up Russia from within by providing financial support to revolutionary groups such as the Bolsheviks, Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRs) and separatist factions such as the Finnish Activists leaning toward Germanism. Between 30 and 40 million marks were spent on this endeavor. Controlling the Finnish area would allow the Imperial German Army to penetrate Petrograd and the Kola Peninsula, an area rich in raw materials for the mining industry. Finland possessed large ore reserves and a well-developed <b>forest</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} study where a GDSS-approach was used for a SWOT-based {{strategy}} analysis of the Finnish <b>forest</b> <b>industries.</b> <b>Forest</b> <b>industries</b> belong to the basic, strategic industries in the world, and they have a great importance for the Finnish economy. This study is the first part of a research program that aims at finding visions and alternative strategies in the field of <b>forest</b> <b>industries,</b> and at developing new scientific methods. The program is a learning process where one central tool is the GroupSystems-software. Thus, the contribution of the program is both methodological and gives new knowledge for <b>forest</b> <b>industries.</b> In this paper, the focus is on describing how {{the first part of the}} Finnish <b>forest</b> <b>industries</b> SWOT-analysis was conducted in a GDSS-laboratory by using the GroupSystems-tool. The study included the identification and prioritisation of the environmental change factors, i. e. threats and opportunities, faced by the Finnish <b>forest</b> <b>industries</b> in the future...|$|R

25|$|Representatives for {{the forest}} owners {{traveled}} in February 1961 to Finland to inspect cooperative mills there. The Norwegian Forest Owners Association approved the plans on 20 March. The main opposition to the mill came from the other <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> companies in the country. Follum Fabrikker proposed that they could build a new mill in Trøndelag, and offered to allow forest owners and the government receive {{a third of the}} ownership each.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} foreign trade, the key {{economic}} sector is manufacturing. The largest industries are electronics (21.6 percent), machinery, vehicles and other engineered metal products (21.1 percent), <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> (13.1 percent), and chemicals (10.9 percent). Finland has timber and several mineral and freshwater resources. Forestry, paper factories, and {{the agricultural sector}} (on which taxpayers spend around 2 billion euro annually) are politically sensitive to rural residents. The Greater Helsinki area generates around a third of GDP.|$|E
25|$|While the {{economic}} growth stagnated in Finland in the early 1930s following the Great Depression, international trade began to recover relatively soon {{and in particular the}} export of forest products from the ports in the Bothnian Bay was growing. Already in 1932, a delegation from Northern Ostrobothnia submitted a proposal {{for the construction of a}} new state-owned icebreaker. In 1935, another large delegation of politicians and representatives from coastal cities proposed expanding the state-owned icebreaker fleet. They were also strongly supported by the growing Finnish <b>forest</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

South America has large natural forest areas and excellent natural conditions for planting trees. However, <b>forest</b> <b>industries</b> have not grown in a way that permit sustainable exploitation of natural forests and improve the Gross National Product and Trade Balance of South America’s countries.

25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the Second World War the wood industry in Trøndelag was outdated and had limited capacity. Forest-owners {{were forced to}} sell large portions of their lumber to industries in Eastern Norway. The long distances and hence transport costs cut into the prices, giving the forest-owners reduced revenue. At the time the <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> was until 1957 organized through a price regulation mechanism, with maximum prices for lumber set by the government. Prices were set through negotiations between forest owner associations, organized by drainage system, and the industry.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{proposal}} was to extend the line into the Taupo industrial area. The line would extend from the proposed log-processing yard around the southern flank of Mount Tauhara and head north towards Broadlands Road before completing a horseshoe like curve south into the Taupo Mill on Centennial Drive. The report said the line {{would be used for}} transporting sawn timber from the processing yard to the mill on Centennial Drive. <b>Forest</b> <b>industry</b> people did not express an interest in this option, as they did not believe it would bring any new opportunities to them.|$|E
25|$|Though {{growth in}} the hamlets of Whitchurch–Stouffville was {{stagnant}} after {{the demise of the}} <b>forest</b> <b>industry,</b> the population began to grow again in the 1970s, with development in Metropolitan Toronto and the consequent arrival of new commuters. These developments led to a reexamination at the provincial level of municipal governance. On January 1, 1971, Whitchurch Township and the Village of Stouffville were merged to create the Town of Whitchurch–Stouffville; the combined population was 11,487. The town's southern boundary was also moved four farm lots south of the original southern boundary of Main Street. This land was formerly a part of Markham Township.|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} at Mysen had {{a dramatic}} impact on Eidsberg. With the railway Mysen received {{a post office}} and telegraph. The central areas had previously been at Folkenborg, where the municipal hall and Eidsberg Sparebank was located, and the area around Eidsberg Church. Many companies and shops moved to Mysen, and both the municipal hall and the bank moved there in 1900. The largest cargo customer with the railway was the <b>forest</b> <b>industry.</b> Also farmers benefited, as the railway {{made it possible to}} export milk to the capital. The railway caused the first dairy in Eidsberg to opened in 1883, next to Mysen Station.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{both the}} fishing and {{forestry}} industries experienced a significant downturn in economic activity. In July 1997, Canadian fishermen blockaded the Alaska Marine Highway ferry M/V Malaspina, keeping {{it in the}} port as a protest in the salmon fishing rights dispute between Alaska and British Columbia. The <b>forest</b> <b>industry</b> declined when a softwood lumber dispute arose between Canada and the USA. After the pulp mill closed down, many people were unemployed, {{and a lot of}} modern machinery was left unused. After reaching a peak of about 18,000 in the early 1990s, Prince Rupert's population began to decline, as people left in search of work.|$|E
