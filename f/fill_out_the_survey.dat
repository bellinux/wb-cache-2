A random sample of 2, 999 private impoundment (i. e., no public waters) applicants for Triploid Grass Carp Permits from Texas Parks and Wildlife was utilized as the survey mailing list.

40|$|Objectives: To {{find the}} level of {{interest}} of medical librarians in social tagging, which sites are the most popular, how social tagging is being used, and {{to determine if there}} is a relationship between years in the profession and use of tagging. Methods: A 16 question online survey was administered to a random sample (n= 348) of MLA members. Results: One hundred fifty six surveys were returned for a response rate of 45 %. Forty-seven percent of the sample used tagging with a 95 % confidence interval of 39 % to 55 %. General sites (Del. icio. us and Flickr) were used more than specialized sites. Sixty-seven percent used tagging for organization, 60 % for discovery, 11 % for outreach, 21 % for education, 41 % for collaboration, and 48 % for personal use only. More experienced librarians appeared to use tagging less: however this trend was not statistically significant (using the Pearson chi-square statistic). Discussion: User tagging is still a new technology for medical librarians; roughly half have used it. The survey methodology is inherently biased towards positive results due to nonresponse error.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{information from}} surveys completed by taxpayers {{who participated in}} 12 tax incentive programs during calendar year 2007. The report is prepared in accordance with various incentive statutes intended to provide accountability and a means to evaluate program effectiveness. Statutes require the Department to summarize survey information in descriptive statistics; further analysis of program effectiveness is assigned to the Legislature and to the Department in future years. B&O and sales tax incentives resulted in reduced state revenues of $ 221. 7 million in 2007. Most of this was attributable to the B&O tax credit for high technology firms. The deferral/exemption for high technology and rural manufacturers totaled $ 127. 2 million in reduced state and local sales tax receipts. For 2007 there were 1, 415 taxpayers who participated in these incentive programs and reported a total employment of 282, 089. Participants and their employees were counted more than once when they took part in multiple programs. The Department checked surveys for reasonableness and verified responses with tax records or with taxpayers over the phone to the extent possible.

This research study is related to both theory and practice. The main relevance lies in analyzing the relationship between HPMP and sustainability outcomes in SMEs. This research study relates to theory by applying the resource-based view and configurational approaches used in this study. The study employed a quantitative methodology. Data were collected through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was adopted from a previous validated survey measuring HPMP in Australian SMEs. The target population consisted of SMEs operating in the city of Karachi, Pakistan.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} leadership styles of respiratory managers in the hospital environment, through examination of B. M. Bass 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) model of transformational, transactional and laissez-faire leadership. The author measured leadership alignment and outcome factors through the multifactor leadership questionnaire (MLQ 5 x-short) survey. Respiratory managers are a large part of the healthcare team. They provide the respiratory therapist they manage with education, orientation and supervision. The respiratory managers of 200 Magnet recognized hospitals located within the United States were mailed a MLQ 5 x-short survey. Each manager was asked to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> and return it in the self-addressed envelope that was included. No personal information was obtained; the survey included 45 descriptive statements. The respiratory managers were asked to rate themselves on how frequently each of the descriptive statements described their leadership style. The statements are grouped into related leadership behaviors. Each of the leadership behaviors then is located in one of the leadership styles, transformational, transactional, or laissez-faire. The MLQ surveys were then scored. Each of the managers was given a score in each of the leadership behaviors. Scores were then analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results revealed that respiratory managers use a higher level of transformational leadership behaviors than transactional or laissez-faire behaviors. The mean score of the transformational behaviors was 3. 4, transactional 2. 68 and laissez-faire. 63. The literature revealed that transformational leadership style was predominating in Magnet recognized hospitals. This study was looking specifically at respiratory managers. Since no literature can be found on the leadership styles of respiratory managers this will add to the body of knowledge.

Unauthorized access of personal information may result in identity theft, stalking, harassment, and other invasions of privacy. Information privacy concerns are impediments to broad-scale adoption of the Internet for purchasing decisions.

This study investigated the relationship between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s computer self-efficacy and information privacy concerns; and also examined the differences among different age groups and between genders regarding information privacy concerns and their relationships with computer self-efficacy. A paper-based survey was designed to empirically assess computer self-efficacy and information privacy concerns. The survey was developed by combining existing validated scales for computer self-efficacy and information privacy concerns. The target population of this study was the residents of New Jersey, U. S. A. The assessment was done by using the mall-intercept approach in which individuals were asked to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>survey.</b> The sample size for this study was 400 students, professionals, and mature adults. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used for testing data normality and the Spearman rank-order test was used for correlation analyses. MANOVA test was used for comparing mean values of computer self-efficacy and information privacy concerns between genders and among age groups. The results showed that the correlation between computer self-efficacy and information privacy concerns was significant and positive; and there were differences between genders and among age groups regarding information privacy concerns and their relationships with computer self-efficacy. This study contributed to the body of knowledge about the relationships among antecedents and consequences of information privacy concerns and computer self-efficacy.
