2500|$|At {{one time}} during the bushfires in Canberra, a [...] "fire tornado" [...] was {{documented}} (and later confirmed). It was known to have winds exceeding 160mph.

50|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> {{consists}} of a core of ash, and an invisible rotating pocket of air. A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> can reach up to 2,000 F, hot enough to potentially reignite ashes sucked up from the ground. Often, fire whirls are created when a wildfire or firestorm creates its own wind, which can turn into a vortex of fire.This causes the tall and skinny appearance of a fire whirl's core.|$|E
40|$|Internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> {{might be}} induced in tall {{buildings}} under fires. Hazards {{associated with such}} <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> should be assessed carefully. The physics behind is not clearly understood, even the conditions of onsetting internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> are unknown. It is important to observe the physical phenomenon carefully first, before carrying out theoretical analysis. In this article, internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> were studied with a small vertical shaft model under different ventilation conditions. A 1. 6 kW propanol pool fire {{was placed in a}} rectangular vertical shaft of height 145 cm. Ventilation provisions at the bottom and side wall were arranged. The conditions of onsetting internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> were investigated in detail with support from some full-scale burning tests at Harbin, Heilongjiang, China. It is concluded that allowing a vertical gap of appropriate width and height at the side wall would onset internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls.</b> Flame height would be stretched by several times the value for free burning. The burning rate of the pool fire would increase. Results are also confirmed by full-scale burning tests. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense {{wildfires}} are called <b>fire</b> <b>whirls.</b> They {{are not considered}} tornadoes, except in the rare case where they connect to a pyrocumulus or other cumuliform cloud above. <b>Fire</b> <b>whirls</b> usually are {{not as strong as}} tornadoes associated with thunderstorms. They can, however, produce significant damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>whirls</b> {{can last}} {{for an hour or}} more, and they cannot be {{extinguished}} directly.|$|R
5000|$|Fire whirls {{most often}} move fairly slowly. Fire whirls can set objects in their paths ablaze and can hurl burning debris out into their surroundings. The winds {{generated}} by a <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> can also be dangerous.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{understand}} the characteristics of <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> in the inclined shaft with corner gap, large eddy simulations (LES) of thermal flow field in a 9 -meter-high inclined shaft were employed. In the inclined shaft, the conrner gap is 0. 3 m and 0. 7 m in width, and the inclination angle is 5 °, 30 °, 45 °, 50 ° and 55 ° from the vertical orientation axes respectively. It is found that a whirling flow field could be formed under proper inclination angles and corner gap width. Rotational axis of <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> in the inclined shaft would have same inclination angles with the shaft. Similar to the case of <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> in a vertical shaft, the width of corner gap of inclined shaft also influences the whirling motion of the flame. In this paper, for the same fire and inclination angle, the 0. 3 -meter-wide corner gap is easier to form stable <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> than the 0. 7 -meter-wide corner gap. By comparison with buoyancy, the slightly greater Coriolis force was found above a height 3 m for inclined <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> when the width of croner gap is 0. 3 m, however, the Coriolis force acts only on {{the lower part of the}} shaft when the width of croner gap is 0. 7 m...|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{numerous}} large <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> (some tornadic) that developed after lightning struck an oil storage facility near San Luis Obispo, California on 7 April 1926, several of which produced significant structural damage {{well away from the}} fire, killing two. Many whirlwinds were produced by the four-day-long firestorm coincident with conditions that produced severe thunderstorms, in which the larger <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> carried debris 5 kilometers away.|$|R
5000|$|Especially large {{wildfires}} {{may affect}} air currents in their immediate vicinities by the stack effect: air rises {{as it is}} heated, and large wildfires create powerful updrafts that will draw in new, cooler air from surrounding areas in thermal columns. Great vertical differences in temperature and humidity encourage pyrocumulus clouds, strong winds, and <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> {{with the force of}} tornadoes at speeds of more than 80 km/h. [...] Rapid rates of spread, prolific crowning or spotting, the presence of <b>fire</b> <b>whirls,</b> and strong convection columns signify extreme conditions.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl,</b> of {{reportedly}} uncommon {{size for}} New Zealand wildfires, formed on day {{three of the}} 2017 Port Hills fires in Christchurch. Pilots estimated the fire column to be 100 m high.|$|E
50|$|An {{extreme example}} of a fire tornado is the 1923 Great Kantō {{earthquake}} in Japan which ignited a large city-sized firestorm and produced a gigantic <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> that killed 38,000 people in fifteen minutes in the Hifukusho-Ato region of Tokyo.|$|E
50|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> or swirl, {{sometimes}} called fire devils or fire tornadoes, {{can be seen}} during intense fires in combustible building structures or, more commonly, in forest or bush fires. A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> is a vortex-shaped formation of burning gases being released from the combustible material. The genesis of the vortex is probably {{similar to that of}} a dust devil. As distinct from the dust devil, it is improbable that the height reached by the fire gas vortex is greater than the visible height of the vertical flames because of turbulence in the surrounding gases that inhibit creation of a stable boundary layer between the rotating/rising gases relative to the surrounding gases.|$|E
40|$|Large scale <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> {{have not}} {{traditionally}} {{been recognized as}} a frequent phenomenon on wildland fires. However, there are anecdotal data suggesting that they can and do occur with some regularity.

2500|$|The near-cyclonic {{strength}} of the wind change created an unstoppable firestorm that produced tornado-like <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> and fireballs of eucalyptus gas measuring over three metres across. Survivors reported that the roar of the fire front was similar to that of a jet engine, though multiplied fifty, a hundred times. The change in temperature and air pressure was so savage that houses were seen exploding before fire could touch them. A resident of Aireys Inlet, on Victoria's western coast, was quoted: ...|$|R

50|$|As more {{buildings}} {{succumbed to}} the flames, a major contributing factor to the fire’s spread was a meteorological phenomenon known as a <b>fire</b> <b>whirl.</b> As overheated air rises, it comes into contact with cooler air and begins to spin creating a tornado-like effect. These fire whirls are likely what drove flaming debris so high and so far. Such debris was blown across the main branch of the Chicago River to a railroad car carrying kerosene. The fire had jumped the river a second time and was now raging across the city’s north side.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> [...] - [...] also {{commonly}} known as a fire devil, or, (in many cases) erroneously, as a fire tornado, firenado, or fire twister [...] - [...] is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often made up of flame or ash. They usually start with a whirl of wind or smoke. Fire whirls may occur when intense rising heat and turbulent wind conditions combine to form whirling eddies of air. These eddies can contract into a tornado-like vortex that sucks in burning debris and combustible gases.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} tornadoes include the {{multiple}} vortex tornado, landspout and waterspout. Waterspouts {{are characterized by}} a spiraling funnel-shaped wind current, connecting to a large cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. They are generally classified as non-supercellular tornadoes that develop over bodies of water, but there is disagreement over whether to classify them as true tornadoes. These spiraling columns of air frequently develop in tropical areas close to the equator, and are less common at high latitudes. Other tornado-like phenomena that exist in nature include the gustnado, dust devil, <b>fire</b> <b>whirls,</b> and steam devil.|$|R

50|$|Whirlwinds are {{subdivided}} into two main types, the great (or major) whirlwinds and the lesser (or minor) whirlwinds. The first category includes tornadoes, waterspouts, and landspouts. The range of atmospheric vortices constitute a continuum and {{are difficult to}} categorize definitively. Some lesser whirlwinds may sometimes form {{in a similar manner}} to greater whirlwinds with related increase in intensity. These intermediate types include the gustnado and the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl.</b> Other lesser whirlwinds include dust devils, as well as steam devils, snow devils, debris devils, leaf devils, and shear eddies such as the mountainado and eddy whirlwinds.|$|E
50|$|The fire jumped {{across the}} Peshtigo River and burned {{on both sides}} of the inlet town. Survivors {{reported}} that the firestorm generated a <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> (described as a tornado) that threw rail cars and houses into the air. Many escaped the flames by immersing themselves in the Peshtigo River, wells, or other nearby bodies of water. Some drowned while others succumbed to hypothermia in the frigid river. The Green Island Light was kept lit during the day because of the obscuring smoke, but the three-masted schooner George L. Newman was wrecked offshore, although the crew was rescued.|$|E
50|$|Fire whirls are {{sometimes}} colloquially called fire tornadoes, {{but are not}} usually classifiable as tornadoes as the vortex in most cases does not extend from the surface to cloud base. Also, even in such cases, even those fire whirls are not classic tornadoes, in that their vorticity derives from surface winds and heat-induced lifting, rather than a tornadic mesocyclone aloft. The literal fire tornado is a rare phenomenon, much more powerful and destructive than the a typical <b>fire</b> <b>whirl,</b> in which the wildfire generates a pyrocumulonimbus cloud that then spawns a tornado. When this tornado forms in or enters the fire zone, it fans flames enormously, draws flame and burning debris into itself, and scatters burning debris over a wide area.|$|E
60|$|No one knows, unless perhaps Oro did, {{in which}} case he kept the {{information}} to himself, {{and no one will}} ever know. At any rate there it was, travelling towards us on its giant butt, the peg of the top as it were, which, hidden in a cloud of friction-born sparks that enveloped it like the cup of a curving flower of <b>fire,</b> <b>whirled</b> round and round at an infinite speed. It was on this flaming flower that the search-light played steadily, doubtless that Oro might mark and measure its monstrous progress.|$|R
40|$|Internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> {{induced by}} a pool {{fire in a}} {{vertical}} shaft of height 15 m with different ventilation conditions are studied experimentally. Ventilation is provided through a rectangular gap at the side wall with varying widths. Gasoline pool fires with diameters up to 0. 46 m are set up {{at the center of}} the floor. Flame height and burning duration of the pool fire are measured. Average flame height ranged from 1 to 4. 5 m when whirling is onsetted in the vertical shaft. Experimental studies indicate that air supply to the upper part of the shaft is a key factor for onsetting internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirls.</b> Oxygen is required to sustain combustion to generate heat for inducing whirling motions. Therefore, flame will not whirl without adequate oxygen supply. In this study, the flaming zone in a vertical shaft is divided into four stages: the initial stage, flame rising-up stage, stable flame, whirling stage and decay stage. Based on the flame height correlations for free burning pool fires, the fuel consumption rate of the pool fire in the shaft at each stage is estimated. Correlations of the whirling flame height with fuel mass and other key parameters are then derived. Computational fluid dynamics is applied to examine the validity of the derived correlation expressions. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|In meteorology, {{instability}} can {{be described}} by various indices such as the Bulk Richardson Number, lifted index, K-index, convective available potential energy (CAPE), the Showalter, and the Vertical totals. These indices, as well as atmospheric instability itself, involve temperature changes through the troposphere with height, or lapse rate. Effects of atmospheric instability in moist atmospheres include thunderstorm development, which over warm oceans can lead to tropical cyclogenesis, and turbulence. In dry atmospheres, inferior mirages, dust devils, steam devils, and <b>fire</b> <b>whirls</b> can form. Stable atmospheres {{can be associated with}} drizzle, fog, increased air pollution, a lack of turbulence, and undular bore formation.|$|R
40|$|An {{internal}} <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> can {{be generated}} by burning a pool fire in a vertical shaft with appropriate sidewall ventilation provision. Earlier experimental {{results show that the}} flame swirling motion depends on the corner gap width providing ventilation. In this article, experiments on generating an internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> in a 9 m tall vertical shaft model will be reported. Flame shapes in burning a gasoline pool fire inside the shaft model with different corner wall gap widths and tray diameters were observed. Fuel mass of the pool fire, flame height of the internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl,</b> and transient air temperatures were measured. From the results, it is further confirmed that an internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> cannot be generated when the gap width is too wide or too narrow. An internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> is developed in five stages. The pool fire is burning in a way similar to burning in open air at stage I. The burning rate of pool fire increases at stage II. Swirling flame motion starts to develop at stage III. An internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> develops fully at stage IV. Stage V is the decay stage. Furthermore, the created internal <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> can be divided into three zones. Zone I is at the lower part with the flame rotating violently. Zone II is in the middle part with a slower swirling rate. The upper part zone III has no flame rotation. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> {{is simply}} a vortex flow with combustion. To {{understand}} the mechanism generating fire whirls, large scale experiments were conducted in a vertical square channel (2. 0 m × 2. 0 m × 15. 0 m) with a lateral seam. They were also simulated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using fire dynamics simulator (FDS) version 4. 07 which includes a method for large eddy simulation. To investigate the primary characteristics of fire whirls, five cases were simulated, each using a different bottom vent. It was found that when three edges {{at the bottom of}} the channel connect with the ambient a <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> cannot be produced. The other four cases produced one. In those cases, the distribution rule of temperature and axial velocity of the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> at the channel centerline with the changing of height was presented. Next, the observed shifting of the central axis of the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> from the channel's centerline was analyzed. It was also noted that the positions of the top of the flame in the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> were incontinuous. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of both {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on a laboratory-scale fixed-frame type <b>fire</b> <b>whirl.</b> We designed a fixed-frame type <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> generator consisting of two vertically oriented split PMMA cylinders which are placed in an off-center location to create a small compartment with a slit at each end. At {{the center of the}} compartment floor, a 5 cm-diameter 1 -propanol pool fire generated upward buoyancy flow and fresh air entering the compartment through the slits, generating swirl motion in the compartment. This is a fixed-frame type <b>fire</b> <b>whirl.</b> We measured transient 2 -D radial, tangential, and axial velocity profiles with 2 -D particle image velocimetry (PIV). The radial and tangential velocity profiles were measured at four different heights (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm) along the axis of the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl,</b> while the axial velocity profiles were measured at 10 cm in the axial height. We also measured relative temperature distributions of the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl</b> with an infrared thermograph technique. These measurements show that both the tangential velocity and the absolute value of radial velocity increase with an increase in the radial distance, while they remain relatively constant along the axis. Our IR data also show that the relative temperature map stays unchanged along the axis. The radial locations where the maximum radial and tangential velocity were measured approximately coincide and are at about 3. 5 cm on the radial coordinate, while the visible spinning flame location is at about 1. 2 cm. This shows a difference in the velocity structure between open pool fires and fire whirls, because the location of the maximum flow velocity and visible flame approximately coincides for laminar open pool fires. A simple laminar 2 -D axisymmetric CFD model was developed to simulate these measured flow and temperature structures created by the <b>fire</b> <b>whirl,</b> and reasonable agreement was obtained...|$|E
