40|$|Paper {{bills are}} now the primary channel of {{communication}} between companies and their customers. However, their potential for personalization is limited, {{and they are not}} interactive. If a customer wants to react to something in his paper bill – for example, to make a customer service inquiry or to order a new service – he must make a telephone call. <b>Internet</b> <b>Billing</b> promises far more than a new and inexpensive way to deliver billing information. Industry experts predict that <b>Internet</b> <b>Billing</b> will fundamentally change the way companies interact with their customers. Eventually, the Internet Bill will be an interactive entry to a host of additional services including customer self-care, automated sales one-to-one marketing. The Internet Bill will become the gateway through which customers and companies have electronic one to one dialogs. The focus of this paper will be on the development and analysis of an Open <b>Internet</b> <b>Billing</b> System architecture using the Systemic Methodologies Problem Structure Methodology (PSM), Metasystem for Decision Making and Total System Intervention (TSI). Systemic Analysis considers the problem situations as systems, makes a thorough analysis on these situations and defines them in a very accurate way. The methodologies of this analysis concentrate on the human factor that is evolving in those systems and they are a very valuable tool helping us to understand and define the system functions.

We demonstrate the suitability of our adaptation by analyzing a specific version of the <b>Internet</b> <b>Billing</b> Server protocol introduced by Carnegie Mellon University. Our analysis shows that, while the security properties a key distribution or authentication protocol shall provide are well understood, it is often not clear which properties an electronic commerce protocol can or shall provide.

Introduction A worldwide data networking infrastructure is gradually falling into place which will allow consumers and service providers to interact in a vast electronic marketplace. In France some 9, 000 services are available over the Minitel network. In the U. S., access to electronic databases generates billions of dollars a year in business.

40|$|Interconnecting {{services}} {{is a complex}} task. A part of the complexity comes from {{the need to have}} a common, shared view of the information, ontology. Thus, {{there is a need for}} approaches that help to overcome the differences between service ontologies, and to manage the possible future evolution of the ontologies. The approach proposed in this paper provides a support for cooperation between services. Our proposition is useful for service architectures that evolve and grow in size constantly. The number of services increases and even services are changing to offer new alternatives. The aim is to provide a flexible way to partially automate the processing of ontology and related mapping evolution management. A case study in Telecom service cooperation illustrates the benefits of our approach. We apply our algorithm and implementation prototype p 2 OEManager to Message Billing Service ontology and <b>Internet</b> <b>Billing</b> Service ontology and particularly, we use our ontology agent model and prototype to manage some significant changes in these ontologies...|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} basic “constitutional” {{rules for the}} Internet is a {{recurring}} one. But recently a question arises: is an <b>Internet</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights still possible? This {{is the focus of}} the present essay, which is structured upon two different, although related, topics. Firstly, the choice of the regulatory model best suited for the Internet is considered - the hard law and binding one, or the soft law and self-regulatory one - together with the issues of constitutional legitimacy arising from each model at the national and European levels. Secondly, attention is given to the specific experience of the Italian <b>Internet</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights, drafted by a Commitee charged by President Boldrini and approved on November 23 rd, 2015, with a motion voted by a transversal majority in the Chamber of Deputies of the Italian Parliament. The basic legal questions concerning fundamental rights addressed by the Bill are analyzed, while underlining its value as a political guideline for the future legislator of the Internet...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{legal and}} policy {{issues raised by}} changes in payment methods related {{to the rise of}} the Internet. The two major changes – the rise of P 2 P systems like PayPal, and the rise of <b>Internet</b> <b>billing</b> systems (EBPP) to replace the use of paper bills and checks – both involve new intermediaries that facilitate payments made by conventional payment systems. The paper first discusses how those systems work. It then discusses problems in the framework currently used to regulate those systems in the United States, which has not been updated to protect consumers from the special problems those systems raise. Finally, the paper considers problems with the potential shift of payments services from the heavily regulated banking industry to new and unregulated Internet-related startups. The paper considers a variety of strategies for producing a level field of competition between banks and the new entities {{and at the same time}} providing adequate protection for the consumers that use the systems in question...|$|E
40|$|SubScrip is a {{protocol}} {{that allows the}} establishment of pay-per-view services on the Internet where every single access has only a very low value. It can effectively bundle payments to use any existing or proposed <b>Internet</b> <b>billing</b> mechanism as a basis, solving the problem of transaction costs being too high to economically support small payments in pay-per-view schemes. The SubScrip protocol is a prepaid anonymous system with no need for user identification, and in its simple form does not require expensive encryption computations. SubScrip is different from other payment mechanisms proposed in {{that it does not}} require the setting up of a complete banking and billing hierarchy, but can be implemented based on, and without any modifications to, any combination of all currently existing or proposed Internet payment mechanisms. 1 Introduction The Internet appears to be the ideal marketplace to sell information worldwide.

40|$|The future Internet may be {{built to}} deliver better service to traffic that is {{accompanied}} by additional payments. In such a scenario, changes in payments and the resulting performance impact could be realized on very fine timescales, such as within seconds. Thus, users would benefit from (1) a desktop instrument that measures and presents their applications ’ Internet traffic in a user-friendly fashion and (2) desktop controls that allow the adjustment of desired service level, and corresponding payment, for their application traffic in real time. In this paper we present Bill-Pay Control, an interactive, web-based user interface that we designed and implemented as part of Bill-Pay Sim, a simulation system that emulates the performance that such a future Internet might exhibit. Bill-Pay Control runs on a user’s workstation, continually displays application-level network traffic statistics, and allows the user to select accompanying service levels. This functionality provides the user with the flexibility to improve network and application performance by controlling payments tied to the chosen traffic. We also report our initial experience with the system and make observations about its efficacy as an evaluation environment for proposed <b>Internet</b> <b>billing</b> schemes. ...|$|E
