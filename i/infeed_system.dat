40|$|Short circuit ratio (SCR) {{is widely}} applied {{to analyze the}} {{strength}} of AC system and the small signal stability for single power elec-tronic based devices <b>infeed</b> <b>systems</b> (SPEISs). However, there still lacking the theory of short circuit ratio applicable for multi power electronic based devices <b>infeed</b> <b>systems</b> (MPEIS), as the complex coupling among multi power electronic devices (PEDs) leads to difficulties in stability analysis. In this regard, this paper firstly proposes a concept named generalized short circuit ratio (gSCR) to measure the strength of connected AC grid in a multi-infeed system from the small signal stability point of view. Generally, the gSCR is physically and mathematically extended from conven-tional SCR by decomposing the multi-infeed system into n inde-pendent single <b>infeed</b> <b>systems.</b> Then the operation gSCR (OgSCR) is proposed based on gSCR {{in order to take}} the variation of op-eration point into consideration.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve active form error control of the surface {{grinding}} process, a system model for the process should be established. Gao and Jones have developed a discrete control system model for a transverse grinding process. Not many researchers have investigated a discrete control system model for the surface grinding process. The model for the surface grinding process is presented and {{it is based on}} the physical laws associated with the process together with mathematical equations describing the workpiece surface form error profile and flatness error. The system variables for the surface grinding control include required size reduction, nominal wheel infeed, nominal accumulated wheel infeed, wheel infeed position, and flatness error. Based on the model, the workpiece flatness error decreases when the grinding pass number increases. The reduction of flatness error through form error control should be fully investigated after establishing a model for the discrete control system. In surface grinding, a high speed workpiece table motion is involved. In {{order to achieve}} active form error control for improving the machining accuracy, the control commands will include a substantial amount of high frequency signals that may not be sufficiently implemented by a wheel <b>infeed</b> <b>system.</b> A micro positioning system was designed as an additional unit for providing fast control actions. A composite control scheme was proposed for combining both systems. Models of the discrete control system for the surface grinding process controlled by the micro positioning actuating system, the wheel <b>infeed</b> <b>system,</b> and the composite control were established. The methods which reduce the flatness error effectively were identified. For micro positioning systems with a piezoelectric actuator used for dynamic active surface grinding control, sinusoidal excitation at a high frequency would be used and would give additional problems in comparison with the commonly used step signals due to the hysteresis effects of the actuator, which require a good modeling approach. Comparisons between models of polynomial regressions with various orders of continuity including single, dual, zero order and first order multiple polynomials, direct mapping with polynomial fit, and direct mapping with numerical analysis were performed...|$|E
40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} few choices {{being able}} to machine very hard {{materials}} to deliver ultra high precision at high material removal rate. Surface grinding has been widely used to achieve high accuracy for high quality mechanical, electrical, and optical parts, such as silicon wafers and optical lenses. With the rapid advances in semiconductor and optics industries, more challenges have been posed than ever before to machining quality in terms of form error in surface grinding process. To improve machining form quality with higher efficiency in a surface grinding process, form error control is necessary. In the existing studies, {{it was found that}} the motor driven wheel infeed control is the most widely used method for form error control. However, the output precision and bandwidth of this control method are limited. The piezoelectric actuator driven tool motion or workpiece infeed table has high resolution and wide dynamic response frequency. In order to combine the advantages of both the wheel <b>infeed</b> <b>system</b> and the piezoelectric actuated workpiece <b>infeed</b> <b>system</b> to achieve fast active control and large driving force, a new variable infeed control method has been proposed and investigated. To realize variable infeed for form error control, a basic discrete system model for the surface grinding process was firstly established. The model was useful for obtaining surface form profile, workpiece size reduction, grinding force and the surface form error. To avoid significant remounting errors caused by offline measurement in the modeling process, a high precision in-process surface form measurement system was developed. To deal with the two key problems, opaque barrier and vibration, an air beam technique to remove coolant, a damping technique and a moving average technique to reduce vibration were proposed. With the developed in-process surface form sensing system, an improved discrete system model was proposed to address the partial removal and precision control problems. Models for partial removal, full removal, and sparking out conditions were established. Significant improvements were obtained by the improved model compared with the basic system model. To utilize the developed piezoelectric actuator based precision positioning table for form error control, dynamic hysteresis of the PZT table was studied under loading conditions. A concept of upper frequency limits for dynamic hysteresis stability was proposed and the values were determined when a 10 % performance reduction was considered. For the new variable infeed control system constructed for the study, an iterative control algorithm was proposed to obtain compensation infeed of workpiece table. Computational studies were carried out. Experimental studies were also successfully conducted for validation and assessment. Through the studies, {{it was found that the}} surface form error decreased exponentially as more grinding passes were involved. In addition, using the new variable infeed approach, surface form error can be reduced by up to 20 % when compared with the existing approach. The best result can achieve 88. 9 % based on computational study. The proposed models and control method should be very useful for many precision machining industries.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve active control for {{improved}} machining accuracy and efficiency, the control commands will include {{a substantial amount of}} high frequency signals. The high frequency command signals may not be sufficiently implemented by the single actuating unit that is the wheel <b>infeed</b> <b>system.</b> To solve this problem, an additional actuating unit will be required to support the workpiece in order to implement small but fast control actions. A high performance workpiece micro-positioning table utilizing a piezoelectric translator under preloaded Hertzian contact has been developed and experimentally tested. The table has shown to have a high resolution of better than 20 nm and a high natural frequency of approximately 579. 2 Hz. When implementing a 43. 587 mum step motion, the acceleration could be up to 33. 51 g, where g is acceleration due to gravity. It is found that when large step commands are applied, the workpiece table would exhibit excessive overshoot due to the separation between the piezoelectric translator and the moving part of the table. This would cause large shock accelerations, seriously affecting the machining accuracy. Dynamic models have been established to describe the table-top motions and the occurrence of the separation, which should be significant due to the wide use of the design of preloaded Hertzian contact. The models have not been examined systematically using an experimental approach. The micro positioning table is briefly introduced and the velocity and acceleration models of the table are presented. Experimental results are analyzed to verify the established models and to validate the findings about the separation. The average modeling error was found to be less than 3 %. This gives confidence in using the system for the fast active control required in high speed machining processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{operation}} and optimization of integrated electricity {{and natural gas}} systems is investigated. The couplings between these different infrastructures are modeled by energy hubs, which can convert and store different types of energy. In previous work, the interaction between three interconnected hubs has been analyzed.

In this paper, the hubs, representing residential areas, are also connected to a grid. The energy exchange not only between hubs but also between hubs and the grid is investigated. The hubs contain solar PV installations wherewith they have the ability to feed in energy to the grid. Simulations are presented where the proposed scheme is applied to the hub system.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} renewable generation in power systems necessitates the modeling of this stochastic <b>system</b> <b>infeed</b> in operation and planning studies. The system analysis leads to multivariate uncertainty analysis problems, involving non-Normal correlated random variables. In this context, the modeling of stochastic dependence is paramount for obtaining accurate results; it {{corresponds to the}} concurrent behavior of the random variables, having a major impact to the aggregate uncertainty (in problems where the random variables correspond to spatially spread stochastic infeeds) or their evolution in time (in problems where the random variables correspond to infeeds over specific time-periods). In order to investigate, measure and model stochastic dependence, one should transform all different random variables to a common domain, the rank/uniform domain, by applying the cumulative distribution function transformation. In this domain, special functions, copulae, {{can be used for}} modeling dependence. In this contribution the basic theory concerning the use of these functions for dependence modeling is presented and focus is given on a basic function, the Normal copula.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} affine reserve policies for accommodating large, fluctuating renewable <b>infeeds</b> in power <b>systems.</b> The approach uses robust optimization with recourse to determine operating rules for power system entities such as generators and storage units. These rules, or policies, establish several hours in advance how these entities are to respond to errors in the prediction of loads and renewable infeeds once their values are discovered. Affine policies consist of a nominal power schedule plus a series of planned linear modifications that depend on the prediction errors that will become known at future times. We describe how to choose optimal affine policies that respect the power network constraints, namely matching supply and demand, respecting transmission line ratings, and the local operating limits of power system entities, for all realizations of the prediction errors. Crucially, these policies are time-coupled, exploiting the spatial and temporal correlation of these prediction errors. Affine policies are compared with existing reserve operation under standard modelling assumptions, and operating cost reductions are reported for a multi-day benchmark study featuring a poorly-predicted wind infeed. Efficient prices for such "policy-based reserves" are derived, and we propose new reserve products that could be traded on electricity markets. Comment: 27 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The project began by studying the EM 7 ´s structure and function by working on itsassembly line. A short literature study on the subject Design for Manufacturing wasalso done. By working {{on the assembly line}} and by speaking with staff from production anddevelopment departments, a number of ideas for reducing manufacturing costs arose. Estimations of the potential cost reduction size for each proposal were done incollaboration with vendors and the purchasing department. Based {{on the size of the}} cost reduction, technical risk, impact on the assembly lineand the development time the various proposals were ranked. The two highestranked proposals were selected for further development towards finished solutions. One of the ideas that were selected to develop in to a finished solution meant thatsome of the pneumatic valves were replaced with others. Most of the mechanicalfeatures on the EM 7 are operated by pneumatic cylinders, and they are controlled bythe valves. The valves in use today have very fast switching times which makes themrelatively expensive. By replacing the valves with valves that have higher airflow butlonger switch times, costs are reduced through a lower purchase price of the valves. Thanks to the higher airflow this can be done without affecting the EM 7 ´sperformance. The second proposal was selected because it reduces assembly time. By using rivetsfor the assembly of the EM 79 ̆ 2 s z-fold <b>infeed</b> <b>system,</b> assembly time can be reducedsignificantly.

40|$|In {{precision}} machining, {{a high-speed}} workpiece table motion is typically involved. In {{order to achieve}} active control for improved machining accuracy and efficiency, the control commands will include {{a substantial amount of}} high frequency signals. The high frequency command signals may not be sufficiently implemented by the single actuating unit that is the wheel <b>infeed</b> <b>system,</b> since this type of system typically has a small frequency bandwidth for dynamic operations. To solve this problem, an additional actuating unit will be required to support the workpiece in order to implement small but fast control actions. The actuating unit and the wheel infeed unit will work together under a composite control scheme to combine the advantages of both units such that fast active control and large driving force can be obtained at the same time. In order to realize the actuating unit to implement positioning functions that are fast but at the micrometer level, piezoelectric translators are typically used. Several single-axis precision positioning table systems utilizing the translators have been developed. One of the micropositioning tables has shown to have a resolution better than 20 nm. When implementing a 43. 587 μm step motion, the acceleration could be up to 33. 51 g. The dynamic models of this table for the responses of step or sinusoidal command signals have been investigated. Also, the theoretical results based on the models for the step signals and the corresponding experimental results have been compared. Both results matched with each other except when large step commands were applied. The mismatch is due to detachment between the piezoelectric translator and the moving part that is supposed to be in contact with the translator. A detachment model has been utilized to explain this phenomenon. Also, the other factors that affect the performance of the positioning systems such as the deformation of the table, and the natural frequencies of the table have been investigated. In order to achieve precision machining, the adverse effects of these factors should be reduced...|$|E
