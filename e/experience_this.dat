5|$|In {{response}} to its losses, UBS announced a CHF 15billion rights offering {{to raise the}} additional funds need to shore up its depleted reserves of capital. UBS cut its dividend {{in order to protect}} its traditionally high Tier 1 capital ratio, seen by investors as a key to its credibility as the world's largest wealth management company. Marcel Ospel, who had been the architect of the merger that created UBS in 1998, also announced that he would step down as a chairman of the bank to be replaced by Peter Kurer, the bank's general counsel with virtually no banking <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> ultimately proved very costly to UBS.|$|E

5|$|The {{relatively}} mild, temperate marine climate, {{allows for}} outdoor recreation year round, including walking, hiking, cycling and outdoor team sports. Mountain biking is usually restricted to marked routes. Watersports like sailing, kayaking, motor boating, etc. are also popular, {{and since the}} bay rarely freezes up in winter, {{they can also be}} practised most of the year. Recreational and transportational pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, radiate from the city centre to the countryside, providing safety from motorised vehicles and a more tranquil <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> includes the 30 kilometre long pathway of Brabrandstien, encircling the Brabrand Lake. The long-range hiking route Aarhus-Silkeborg, starts off from Brabrandstien.|$|E

5|$|A young Serb {{boy from}} the {{vicinity}} of Višegrad is taken from his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian boys to <b>experience</b> <b>this</b> fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E
5|$|Agitos {{original}} {{release was}} plagued with multiple issues including long load times, which the team sought to rectify through updates. After the initial release, a Club Activities system {{was going to}} be added. Similar to the Guilds of previous games, players could ally with them, engage in activities unique to the clubs and compete with rival clubs in contests. From the end of July to mid August during the game's original release, it was featured in a crossover with Rise of Mana, a mobile installment in Square Enix's Mana series. An earlier collaboration was also staged between Agito and Square Enix Legend World, a Japan-exclusive browser game. Eventually, it was determined by the developers that Agito was no longer suited for continued updates. The game was shut down on November 30, 2015. As part of its announcement of the game's shutdown, Square Enix said that a new updated version was being prepared that would be better suited for further updates and improved player <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> updated version was revealed to be Final Fantasy Type-0 Online, a 2016 multiplayer game for similar platforms to Agito.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E

5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme, while others {{had served as}} volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited. In contrast, the majority of officers initially appointed had previous military <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli Campaign.|$|E
5|$|The Navy was {{reasonably}} {{pleased with}} the first ship, Bayan, and decided to order another cruiser {{after the start of}} the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904. Russian shipyards were still unavailable, so the Navy decided to simply order a repeat with minor modifications based on war <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> was an attempt to minimize the work load on the Naval Technical Committee (Morskoi tekhnicheskii komitet), but they proved to require more attention than planned and a contract was not signed until 20 April 1905. The contract specified that all drawings would be turned over to allow for the construction of two identical ships in St. Petersburg, using newly available slipways. These changes generally added weight and the armor was reduced in thickness to compensate, although the change from Harvey armor to more resistant Krupp armor meant that there was little actual loss in protection.|$|E
5|$|Some {{soldiers}} had received training through the compulsory training scheme {{that had been}} established in 1911, while others had served as volunteers in the part-time forces before the war or {{as members of the}} British Army, but their numbers were limited and in many cases the quality of the training they had received was also limited. The original intention had been that half the initial intake would consist of soldiers that were currently serving in the Militia, but ultimately this did not come to fruition and while about 8,000 of the original intake had some prior military experience, either through compulsory training or as volunteers, over 6,000 had none at all. In terms of officers, the situation was better. For example, within the 1st Division, of its initial 631 officers, 607 had had previous military <b>experience.</b> <b>This</b> was largely through service in the pre-war militia, though, where there had been little to no formal officer training. In addition, there was a small cadre of junior officers who had been trained for the permanent force at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but their numbers were very small and at the outbreak of the war the first class had to be graduated early {{in order for them to}} join the AIF, being placed mainly in staff positions. Other than small numbers of Duntroon graduates, from January 1915 the only means to be commissioned into the AIF was from the ranks of enlisted personnel. As a result, by 1918 the majority of company and battalion commanders had risen from the ranks. While the AIF's initial senior officers had been members of the pre-war military, few had any substantial experience in managing brigade-sized or larger units in the field as training exercises on this scale had been rarely conducted before the outbreak of hostilities. This inexperience contributed to tactical mistakes and avoidable casualties during the Gallipoli campaign.|$|E
