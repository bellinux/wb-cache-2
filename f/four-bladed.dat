5|$|The <b>four-bladed</b> {{propeller}} {{was replaced}} by a slightly smaller three-bladed model, and the bilge keels, previously added to reduce the tendency to roll, were replaced by a heavy external oak keel for the same purpose. The five-masted schooner sail-plan {{was replaced by}} four masts, two of which were square-rigged. With the refit complete, Great Britain went back into service on the New York run. After only one further round trip she was sold again, to Antony Gibbs & Sons, which planned to place her into England-Australia service.|$|E
5|$|The very {{expensive}} project of 1910, costing Coandă about one million francs, {{left him with}} limited funds. The possibility of a new contract with the French government led Coandă to build the Coandă-1911. He wished to win an army-organised competition at Reims in October, one that required two engines in each aircraft as a fail-safe strategy. At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one. During trials the assembly did not provide enough traction and a <b>four-bladed</b> propeller was ordered. The mounting support of the engines, initially intended for a jet propulsion version, was not adequate for the new configuration so the forward chassis had to be modified.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her <b>four-bladed</b> {{propeller}} {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and wrenched off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
5000|$|The Bell 412 is {{a further}} {{development}} of the Bell 212, the major difference being the composite <b>four-blade</b> main rotor. [...] The UH-1N has also been developed into the upgraded, <b>four-blade</b> UH-1Y.|$|R

25|$|The Bell 407 is a <b>four-blade,</b> single-engine, civil utility helicopter; a {{derivative}} of the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger. The 407 uses the <b>four-blade,</b> soft-in-plane design rotor with composite hub {{developed for the}} United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior instead of the two-blade, semi-rigid, teetering rotor of the 206L-4.|$|R
25|$|The XF-11 used Pratt & Whitney R-4360-31 28-cylinder radial engines. Each engine drove {{a pair of}} {{contra-rotating}} <b>four-bladed,</b> controllable-pitch propellers, {{which can}} increase performance and stability, {{at the cost of}} increased mechanical complexity. Due to constant problems with the contra-rotating propulsion system, the second prototype had regular single <b>four-bladed</b> propellers.|$|E

2500|$|Bell {{participated in}} a joint Bell-Government {{integrated}} test team during the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the H-1 program.

[...] The existing two-blade semi-rigid, teetering rotor system is being replaced with a <b>four-blade,</b> hingeless, bearingless rotor system.

25|$|The final {{configuration}} of the Model 533 for the research contract was with a proprietary, <b>four-bladed,</b> flex-beam rigid rotor developed by Bell. Afterwards, the Model 533 was returned to its original two-bladed configuration and retired.|$|E
25|$|The Sprat was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} 275hp (210kW) Rolls-Royce Falcon III engine with a nose radiator, driving a <b>four-bladed</b> wooden propeller. As on the Velos, the upper engine cowling dropped smoothly away from the upper wing leading edge.|$|E
25|$|The S-52 {{also served}} {{as the basis of}} the turbine-powered S-59, which as the XH-39, competed for and lost the {{contract}} that produced the Bell UH-1 Iroquois. This aircraft differed in having a <b>four-bladed</b> rotor (against the S-52's three) and retractable tricycle gear.|$|E
50|$|The MQ-8B {{features}} a <b>four-blade</b> main rotor, {{in contrast to}} the larger-diameter three-blade rotor of the RQ-8A, to reduce noise and improve lift capacity and performance.
