500|$|Blofeld {{tries to}} escape in a midget submarine, but Bond gains {{control of the}} submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the {{satellite}} control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a cruise ship, where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond turns the tables on them, causing Kidd to hurl himself overboard after being set aflame and Wint to detonate with the bomb after being thrown overboard. Tiffany then asks James Bond a sensitive question: [...] "How the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> we get those diamonds down again?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to Buddy Guy, [...] " [...] {{feel this}} {{psychedelic}} stuff at all... {{and if the}} feeling is gone, that's it. You can't get too busy behind a singer. You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> you have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm so sick of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Grohl {{has said}} that Cobain told him, [...] "Music comes first and lyrics come second," [...] and Grohl {{believes}} that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain's phrasing on the album {{is often difficult to}} understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, [...] "Even though you couldn't quite tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as hell." [...] Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing [...] "Why in the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?" ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Gilbert Chinard {{wrote in}} 1936: “Lafayette became a legendary figure and a symbol {{so early in}} his life, and {{successive}} generations have so willingly accepted the myth, that any attempt to deprive the young hero of his republican halo will probably be considered as little short of iconoclastic and sacrilegious.” That legend has been used politically: the name and image of Lafayette were repeatedly invoked in 1917 in seeking to gain popular support for America's entry into World WarI, culminating in the famous phrase, [...] "Lafayette, we are here". This occurred at some cost to Lafayette's image in America: veterans returned from the front singing [...] "We've paid our debt to Lafayette, who the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> we owe now?" [...] A longer-term threat was the increasing sophistication of Americans and the lessened need for symbols of patriotism; by 1971, according to Anne C. Loveland, [...] "Lafayette no longer served as a national hero-symbol." [...] In 2002, however, Congress voted to grant Lafayette honorary citizenship.|$|E
500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' And I just thought how the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E
500|$|Before {{completing}} The Way I See It, Saadiq previewed its {{songs in}} May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City. He also planned a grassroots marketing {{strategy for the}} record, which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records. He felt that [...] "nobody at the label knew" [...] him {{in an interview with}} The Dallas Morning News: [...] "They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a '60s record. 'What the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> we do with this record?' It was quality. There was not a lot of marketing and promotion, but they knew I had the credibility so you don't just throw it in the garbage ... I don't mind being a [...] because that's actually a better road to take. I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again." [...] In the week leading up to its release, Saadiq made promotional appearances at V-103's For Sisters Only, the International Soul Music Summit, and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta. He also performed songs from the album on VH1 Soulstage. Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector's edition box set with 7-inch vinyl singles. In the United Kingdom, it was issued with two bonus tracks—a [...] "Euro version" [...] of [...] "Big Easy" [...] and the song [...] "Come On Home".|$|E

500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but I would hate to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> you know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E
500|$|Due to his resounding loss to Nixon in the 1972 {{election}} and the causes behind it, [...] "McGovernism" [...] became a label that a generation of Democratic politicians tried to avoid. In 1992, nationally syndicated Chicago Tribune columnist Bob Greene wrote, [...] "Once again politicians – mostly Republicans, but some Democrats, too – are using his name as a synonym for presidential campaigns that are laughable and {{out of touch with}} the American people." [...] Conservatives used McGovern's name as a ready synonym for what they saw as liberal failures. Indeed, according to Daniel McCarthy of The American Conservative, the Republican Party began to act after 1972 as if [...] "every Democratic leader, no matter how Southern, how pro-war, how middle-of-the-road, is really a McGovernite. Indeed, for nearly 40 years the conservative movement has defined itself in opposition to the Democratic standard-bearer of 1972. Anti-McGovernism has come to play for the Right the unifying role that anticommunism once played, much to the detriment of older principles such as limited government, fiscal continence, and prudence in foreign policy." [...] The association with dovishness and weakness on defense has been especially prevalent, although McGovern publicly stated in 1972 that he was not a pacifist and that use of force was sometimes necessary, such as in World War II. McGovern later said in 2001 that his political image had been exaggerated: [...] "I am a liberal and always have been – just not the wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be." [...] He continued to feel that he was marginalized with his views miscast. He saw himself as a son of the prairie, in 2005 reciting his traditional upbringing and family values, culminating with [...] "I'm what a normal, healthy, ideal American should be like", and in 2006 said, [...] "How the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> you get elected in South Dakota for twenty years if you're a wild-eyed radical?" ...|$|E

Bull was skeptical of any {{plans to use the}} Remagen crossing, and he told Bradley, [...] "You're not going anywhere down there at Remagen. You've got a bridge, but it's in the wrong place. It just doesn't fit in with the plan." [...] Bradley replied, [...] "What the <b>hell</b> <b>do</b> you want us to do, pull back and blow it up?" ...|$|E
