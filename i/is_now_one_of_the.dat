5|$|No {{records of}} the Maine Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more popular cat breeds in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid may have {{originated}} in Europe and Asia but it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most widely distributed species of aphids.

Several players in that game went on to play in the National Hockey League, including Brendan Shanahan, Theoren Fleury, Sergei Fedorov, Alexander Mogilny and Vladimir Konstantinov.|$|E
5|$|The {{faculty of}} the University of Florida awarded Sledd the university's first honorary degree, a Doctor of Divinity, at the spring 1909 {{commencement}} ceremonies. In 1933, John J. Tigert, the university's third president, invited Professor Sledd to be the university's baccalaureate speaker. After his death, the university honored him again, renaming one of its early residence halls as Sledd Hall in 1939. The small state university, which Sledd had been instrumental in creating and organizing, <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ten largest single-campus universities in the United States, with a total enrollment of nearly 50,000 undergraduate, graduate and professional students.|$|E

5|$|In 1861 the London and North Western Railway revived powers {{granted to}} the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to build a railway from Manchester via Eccles and Tyldesley to Wigan with a branch to Kenyon Junction on the Liverpool to Manchester Line via Leigh and Pennington. The station, {{originally}} named Bedford Leigh served the town. The railway crossed the town on a viaduct which has since been largely demolished. It closed in May 1969, leaving the town without a railway: after the reopening of Mansfield and Corby railway stations, Leigh <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest towns in Great Britain without a railway station. Numerous colliery lines crossed the town, but with {{the closure of the}} collieries these were no longer required.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{because of}} its size, The Sirens and Ulysses failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today's terms) for Sirens and for Samson and Delilah, also {{exhibited}} by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry, {{and as soon as}} it was complete Sirens began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 Sirens was returned to public display and <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.|$|E

While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average {{for the city of}} Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.|$|E

5|$|The first {{botanical garden}} in the United States, Bartram's Garden, was founded in 1730 near Philadelphia, {{and in the same}} year, the Linnaean Botanic Garden at Philadelphia itself. President George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, all {{experienced}} farmers, shared the dream of a national botanic garden for the collection, preservation and study of plants {{from around the world to}} contribute to the welfare of the American people paving the way for establishing the US Botanic Garden, right outside the nation's Capitol in Washington DC in 1820. In 1859, the Missouri Botanical Garden was founded at St Louis; it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world’s leading gardens specializing in tropical plants. This was one of several popular American gardens, including Longwood Gardens (1798), Arnold Arboretum (1872), New York Botanical Garden (1891), Huntington Botanical Gardens (1906), Brooklyn Botanic Garden (1910), International Peace Garden (1932), and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (1938).|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34%, with 69% of adults surviving {{from one year to}} the next. Mortality in young males is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years. This species <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest operating. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that they hope to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E
