50|$|In July 2013, the United States Department of Justice {{announced}} that Gallup {{had agreed to}} pay $10.5 million to settle allegations that it violated the False Claims Act and the Procurement Integrity Act for conduct involving several of its federal government contracts and subcontracts. The settlement resolved allegations in a complaint filed by the United States in November 2012. The complaint alleged that Gallup knowingly overstated its true <b>estimated</b> <b>labor</b> hours in proposals to the U.S. Mint and State Department for contracts and task orders that were to be awarded without competition. Because of Gallup’s conduct, the complaint alleged, the two federal agencies awarded Gallup contracts and task orders at falsely inflated prices. The settlement also resolved allegations that Gallup engaged in improper employment negotiations with a then Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) official, Timothy Cannon, {{in order to obtain}} a FEMA subcontract at an inflated price and additional FEMA funding after the subcontract had been awarded. The allegations against Gallup were originally brought in a lawsuit filed under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Michael Lindley, Gallup’s former Director of Client Services. As a result of the settlement with Gallup, Lindley will receive $1,929,363 as his share of the government’s recovery. Under the settlement, there was no prosecution and no determination of liability.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{discrimination}} is introduced in a taste-based model where workers are not paid at marginal productivity. Workers’ utility functions include the non-wage {{characteristics of the}} job. Heterogeneity in worker preferences allows firms to exercise market power in the labor market, which is thus oligopsonistic. According to the theoretical arguments in Manning (2003 a) and as shown by an increasing literature, considering the labor market as oligopsonistic reflects reality. Boal and Ransom (1997) and more recently Manning (2011) summarize studies highlighting monopsony and point out issues at stake. Empirically, Staiger et al. (2010) and Ransom and Sims (2010) show monopsony with respect to nurses and teachers in the USA, respectively. Booth and Katic (2011) <b>estimate</b> <b>labor</b> supply elasticity around 0.7 in Australia, confirming monopsony power existence. Falch (2011) points out monopsony in Norway concerning teachers. Barth and Dale-Olsen (2009) indicate that 70 – 90 % of the gender wage gap among low-skilled workers is explained by monopsonistic discrimination.

40|$|<b>Estimating</b> <b>labor</b> supply {{functions}} using {{a discrete}} {{rather than a}} continuous specification has become increasingly popular in recent years. On basis of the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) I test which specification of discrete choice is the appropriate model for <b>estimating</b> <b>labor</b> supply: the standard conditional logit model or the random coefficient model. To the extent that effect heterogeneity is present in empirical models of labor supply functions, {{the application of a}} random coefficient model is necessary to avoid biased estimates. However, because of the complex structure, random coefficient models defy calculating confidence intervals of marginal effects or elasticities. Therefore, if heterogeneity is nonexistent or does not lead to a significant bias in the derived labor supply elasticities, standard discrete choice models provide the more favorable choice. Due to their simple structure, conditional logit models are far less computational intensive providing standard tools to calculate confidence intervals of elasticities. My findings suggest that effect heterogeneity is present when estimating a discrete choice model of labor supply drawing on data of the GSOEP. However, the labor supply elastisities derived form the specifications with and without random effects do not differ significantly. That leads {{to the conclusion that the}} standard discrete choice model, attractive for its simple structure, provides an adequate model choice for the analysis of labor supply functions based on the GSOEP.
