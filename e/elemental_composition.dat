5|$|The testing {{showed that}} the base layer onto which the codex was painted is {{composed}} of gypsum, a material used as a base layer for paintings since antiquity. The black paint was analysed with RBS and {{found to be a}} carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices. The red colour used in the codex is red ochre, an iron-based pigment. There is very little blue colouration in the Grolier Codex and the presence of the distinctive Maya Blue pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain cobalt and does contain clay. Its <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> matches that of palygorskite, the main inorganic component of Maya Blue. However, some other materials such as lapis lazuli could not be ruled out since PIXE only identifies elements, not compounds. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.|$|E

It {{is shown}} that the regional sources of this raw material are linked to two major volcanic structures: the Chacana and the Paletara calderas, localised on the eastern cordillera of Ecuador and on the central Andean cordillera of south Colombia respectively. Seventy-two samples were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and/or particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE).

25|$|The <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> of Mars is {{different}} from Earth′s in several significant ways. First, Martian meteorite analysis suggests that the planet's mantle is about twice as rich in iron as the Earth's mantle. Second, its core is more rich in sulphur. Third, the Martian mantle is richer in potassium and phosphorus than Earth's and fourth, the Martian crust contains {{a higher percentage of}} volatile elements such as sulphur and chlorine than the Earth's crust does. Many of these conclusions are supported by in situ analyses of rocks and soils on the Martian surface.|$|E

40|$|A {{correlation}} between Monte-Carlo simulations of the NNTE geophysical neutron logging-tool response and measurements {{made on the}} rock blocks at the calibration facility in Zielona Góra (Poland) has been examined. The NNTE tool is a recent achievement of Polish geophysicists. It {{is equipped with a}} neutron source and three detectors. The tool is designed to measure the thermal neutron absorption cross-section of geological formations in situ. The computer modelling is intended to complete the calibration measurements with simulated experiments in complicated borehole situations. A good correspondence between the simulated and real experiments is obvious demand. The simulations have been performed using the MCNP 4 C computer code. In the first approach <b>elemental</b> <b>compositions</b> of block rock matrices have been taken directly from the results of a chemical analysis. In the second approach boron B- 10 has been added to the <b>elemental</b> <b>compositions</b> of rocks to compensate the difference between their absorption cross-section calculated from the <b>elemental</b> <b>compositions</b> and those known from the laboratory measurements. The very good agreement has been obtained between results of calculations and measurements.

25|$|Using the {{advanced}} technique of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), for TEMs appropriately equipped, electrons can be rejected {{based upon their}} voltage (which, due to constant charge is their energy), using magnetic sector based devices known as EELS spectrometers. These devices allow for the selection of particular energy values, which {{can be associated with}} the way the electron has interacted with the sample. For example, different elements in a sample result in different electron energies in the beam after the sample. This normally results in chromatic aberration – however this effect can, for example, be used to generate an image which provides information on <b>elemental</b> <b>composition,</b> based upon the atomic transition during electron-electron interaction.|$|E
25|$|Much {{of what we}} {{know about}} the <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> of Mars comes from {{orbiting}} spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments to measure the surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars in the form of meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E

Methane yield can be estimated from the <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> of substrate along with an estimate of its degradability (the fraction of the substrate that is converted to biogas in a reactor). In order to predict biogas composition (the relative fractions of methane and carbon dioxide) it is necessary to estimate carbon dioxide partitioning between the aqueous and gas phases, which requires additional information (reactor temperature, pH, and substrate composition) and a chemical speciation model.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} and {{decomposition}} of a fish, otoliths may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and fossilization. Dispersed otoliths {{are one of the}} many microfossils which can be found through a micropalaeontological analysis of a fine sediment. Their stratigraphic significance is minimal, but can still be used to characterize a level or interval. Fossil otoliths are rarely found in situ (on the remains of the animal), likely because they are not recognized separately from the surrounding rock matrix. In some cases, due to differences in colour, grain size, or a distinctive shape, they can be identified. These rare cases are of special significance, since the presence, composition, and morphology of the material can clarify the relationship of species and groups. In the case of primitive fish, various fossil material shows that endolymphatic infillings were similar in <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> to the rock matrix but were restricted to coarse grained material, which presumably is better for the detection of gravity, displacement, and sound. The presence of these extrinsic grains, in osteostracans, chondrichthyans, and acanthodians indicates a common inner ear physiology and presence of open endolymphatic ducts.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the loline {{alkaloids}} was first isolated from the grass Lolium temulentum and its <b>elemental</b> <b>composition</b> determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification {{and analysis of the}} lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the very intimate association of plant and endophyte and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to endophyte infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some chemically defined growth media, which suggests that the endophyte is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature.|$|E
