40|$|Developmental {{plasticity}} {{is found}} in most organisms, but its role in evolution remains controversial. Environmentally induced phenotypic differences may be translated into adaptive divergence among lineages experiencing different environmental conditions through genetic accommodation. To examine this evolutionary mechanism, we studied the relationship between plasticity in larval development, postmetamorphic morphology, and morphological diversity in spadefoot toads, a group of closely related species that are highly divergent in the larval period and body shape and are distributed throughout temperate areas of both the New and the Old World. Previous studies showed that accelerated metamorphosis is adaptive for desert-dwelling spadefoot toads. We show that even under common garden conditions, spadefoot toad species show <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> norms for the larval period. In addition, experimentally induced changes in the larval period caused correlated morphological changes in postmetamorphic individuals such that long larval periods resulted in relatively longer hindlimbs and snouts. A comparative analysis of morphological variation across spadefoot toad species also revealed {{a positive correlation between}} the larval period and limb and snout lengths, mirroring the effects of within-species plasticity at a higher taxonomic level. Indeed, after ≈ 110 Ma of independent evolution, differences in the larval period explain 57 % of the variance in relative limb length and 33 % of snout length across species. Thus, morphological diversity across these species appears to have evolved as a correlated response to selection for a reduced larval period in desert-dwelling species, possibly diverging from ancestral plasticity through genetic accommodation...|$|E

[...] University of Washington, 2013 Although {{microbial}} {{adaptation to}} new environments {{has been studied}} extensively in laboratory evolution experiments, less is understood about how natural strains adapt to new, constant laboratory conditions after transitioning to become model organisms. In this dissertation, I took a cross-sectional approach to query the osmotolerance repertoire of a decades-old model halophilic archaeon compared with recently isolated conspecific natural isolates. Using growth rate reaction norms and whole genome sequencing, I found that fitness is highly variable across gradients in total salinity and ion composition for both laboratory and natural strains. Although we expected <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> norms and genome sequences to support evidence of specialization in the model organism, both the model and natural isolates shared similar growth patterns across conditions and shared > 95 % sequence similarity. In the following chapters, I characterize the hypersaline environment in the Great Salt Lake, quantify osmotolerance phenotypes across three gradients in salinity, and I explore gene expression signatures across an ion composition gradient in H. salinarum NRC- 1. I close by comparing fitness profiles and genome sequences of the model and natural strains, and I address the unexpected similarity among strains, even after eliminating contamination as an explanation. Ultimately, despite at least 50 years of evolutionary opportunity between the lab and natural isolates, we find that osmotolerance phenotypes and nucleotide sequence is largely maintained in the laboratory, and that a decades-old model organism remains a relevant study organism for microbial-environmental response...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} new reactions of cyclic oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur acetal derivatives and their applications in a diverse range of synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry. Detailed herein are advances in three main areas of acetal chemistry, namely: studies towards a new methodology for the synthesis of medium ring heterocycles; the use of thioacetals as directing groups for the palladium-mediated oxidation of olefins; and multi-component reactions for the synthesis of drug-like heterocyclic compounds. A brief overview of the chemistry of cyclic acetal derivatives is given in the first chapter, followed by a chapter on each of the three areas investigated. Relevant introductory literature is reviewed {{at the beginning of each}} chapter. Firstly, the ring expansion chemistry of unsaturated cyclic oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur acetal derivatives was explored for the development of a new methodology for the synthesis of medium ring heterocycles. This methodology has thus far proved unsuccessful in the synthesis of medium rings, although several interesting and unusual transformations were observed, such as the unexpected formation of an intriguing bicyclic enaminium salt. The use of thioacetals as directing groups for the palladium-mediated oxidation of terminal olefins was also explored, leading to the evolution of a new methodology for the catalytic, regioselective formation of either vinyl or allylic acetates. Dithianes were shown to stabilise intermediates in the allylic oxidation pathway, allowing their structure elucidation and characterisation by low-temperature NMR spectroscopy and in one case X-ray crystallography. This enabled a detailed mechanistic study leading to the observation of two finely balanced, <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> mechanisms. Finally, building upon previously unpublished results, a number of three and four-component reactions were investigated, giving drug-like α-aminoamides; this methodology was applied to the synthesis of some medium ring heterocycles...|$|E
40|$|Recently, our {{research}} group has synthesized {{a new class}} of monoanionic tridentate ligands, ToR (ToM = tris(4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -oxazolinyl) phenylborate and ToP = tris(4 -S-isopropyl- 2 -oxazolinyl) phenylborate), and developed the corresponding stoichiometric and catalytic chemistry of zirconium, yttrium, rhodium, iridium, and magnesium complexes. This thesis begins with the comparison of this new class of scorpionate-type ligands (ToM and ToP) with more classical Tp (tris(pyrazolyl) borates) and Cp (cyclopentadienyl) analogues, both in terms of relative electron donating ability as well as steric bulk. Group 7 metal tricarbonyl complexes of ToM and ToP (ToMM(CO) 3 and ToPMC(O) 3; M = Re, Mn) were synthesized in this purpose and the corresponding νCO IR stretching frequency data were used for the electron donating ability comparison. Solid angles of these ancillary ligands were calculated using coordinates from crystal structures or molecular models with the program Solid-G to obtain a quantitative assessment of the relative steric properties. The thesis then mainly focuses on the chemistry of four-coordiante zinc complexes using ToM as the supportive ancillary ligand. The main interest lies on the synthesis of molecular terminal zinc hydride and its catalytic activity in Si−O bond formation reactions, as well as the isolation and reactivity study of alkylperoxy zinc compounds (ToMZnOOR) obtained from the reactions of the corresponding zinc alkyls (ToMZnR) with molecular O 2. The later part of this thesis also discusses the chemistry of ToM-supported magnesium complexes and the comparison with analogous zinc complexes. It starts with the synthesis of ToM-supported zinc and magnesium bulky silyl complexes, both comprising with and without β-SiH moieties (ToMM−SiR 3; M = Zn, Mg; R = SiHMe 2, SiMe 3). The study further extends to <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> pathways of ToMMSi(SiHMe 2) 3 (M = Zn, Mg) towards CO 2.

40|$|Abstract Title of Document:	Diversity in Catalytic Reactions of Propargylic Diazoesters 	 	Huang Qiu, Doctor of Philosophy, 2016 	 Directed By:	Professor Michael P. Doyle, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry 	 Propargylic aryldiazoesters, which possess {{multiple}} reactive functional {{groups in}} a single molecule, were expected to undergo <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> pathways {{as a function of}} catalysts. A variety of transition metal complexes including rhodium(II), palladium(II), silver(I), mercury(II), copper(I and II), and cationic gold (I) complexes have been examined to be effective in the catalytic domino reactions of propargylic aryldiazoesters. An unexpected Lewis acid catalyzed pathway was also discovered by using FeCl 3 as the catalyst. Under the catalysis of selected gold catalysts, propargylic aryldiazoesters exist in equilibrium with 1 -aryl- 1, 2 -dien- 1 -yl diazoacetate allenes that are rapidly formed at room temperature through 1, 3 -acyloxy migration. The newly formed allenes further undergo a metal-free rearrangement in which the terminal nitrogen of the diazo functional group adds to the central carbon of the allene initiating a sequence of bond forming reactions resulting in the production of 1, 5 -dihydro- 4 H-pyrazol- 4 -ones in good yields. These 1, 5 -dihydro- 4 H-pyrazol- 4 -ones undergo intramolecular 1, 3 -acyl migration to form an equilibrium mixture or quantitatively transfer the acyl group to an external nucleophile with formation of 4 -hydroxypyrazoles. In the presence of a pyridine-N-oxide, both E- and Z- 1, 3 -dienyl aryldiazoacetates are formed in high combined yields by Au(I) -catalyzed rearrangement of propargyl arylyldiazoacetates at short reaction times. Under thermal reactions the E-isomers form the products from intramolecular [4 + 2]-cycloaddition with H‡ 298 = 15. 6 kcal/mol and S‡ 298 = - 27. 3 cal/ (mol•degree). The Z-isomer is inert to [4 + 2]-cycloaddition under these conditions. The Hammett relationships from aryl-substituted diazo esters ( = + 0. 89) and aryl-substituted dienes ( = - 1. 65) are consistent with the dipolar nature of this transformation. An unexpected reaction for the synthesis of seven-membered conjugated 1, 4 -diketones from propargylic diazoesters with unsaturated imines was disclosed. To undergo this process vinyl gold carbene intermediates generated by 1, 2 -acyloxy migration of propargylic aryldiazoesters undergo a formal [4 + 3]-cycloaddition, and the resulting aryldiazoesters tethered dihydroazepines undergo an intricate metal-free process to form observed seven-membered conjugated 1, 4 -diketones with moderate to high yields...|$|E

40|$|Norges Bank {{has been}} {{delegated}} {{the task of}} contributing to a steady growth of the Norwegian economy by keeping inflation low and stable. The goal {{is to keep the}} yearly growth in consumer prices at 2. 5 percent in the medium run, balancing the inflation path with the overall capacity utilization whenever there is a conflict between the two, which corresponds to flexible inflation targeting. The main instrument for doing this is the sight deposit rate (foliorenten) on commercial banks' overnight deposits in Norges Bank, which affects money market rates through banks' marginal funding costs. The policy rate decisions are based on analyses done with NEMO (the Norwegian Economy Model), as well as on general assessments {{about the state of the}} economy. NEMO is a large New Keynesian DSGE model representing the Norwegian mainland economy in a simplified and stylized manner. Uncertainty about the true structure of the economy is always an issue, and it is by no means certain that NEMO is the best possible description of it. A way to accommodate this uncertainty is to set the interest rate in a robust manner, meaning that monetary policy achieves a satisfactory level of macroeconomic stabilization also when the economy is highly different from the NEMO economy. Such policies that work well across a wide range of structural models are robust to model uncertainty. However, robustness comes at the cost of optimality. Optimal policy is fine-tuned to the dynamics of a specific model, and does not perform well for completely different economies, as intuition suggests and many analyses show. A policy reaction function utilizing less model-specific information performs better on average across models, but naturally worse in each separate model, yet not substantially worse, as my results show. Such a restricted information rule is called a simple interest rate rule and is said to be robust if it performs well across a large variety of models. Simple rules are commonly used by central banks in the conduct of monetary policy, of which there is thorough proof. Janet Yellen in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System indicated that she uses "the Taylor rule" to provide her with " a rough sense of whether or not the funds rate is at a reasonable level". The popularity of simple interest rate rules is due to their applicability and the way they are intuitive and communicative to the general public, but most of all their robustness properties. Norges Bank also uses simple rules to cross-check the policy derived from NEMO, among other the above-mentioned Taylor rule. The actual performance of these rules in the Norwegian economy has not been properly investigated, and little work has been done on robust simple rules is a good representation. A large share of the international literature has however found that the Taylor rule performs quite poorly, and in particular it appears not to be hard-hitting enough. This calls for a better robust rule for the Norwegian economy, which is the goal of my work to find. By analyzing the properties and performance of a number of different policy rules, I seek a rule tailored to the Norwegian economy that yields a satisfactory outcome in a variety of models. I use five different models for the Norwegian economy, with NEMO as the benchmark model: two extensions of NEMO - "Credit NEMO" with a credit market incorporated, and a backward-looking version "Policy NEMO" - as well as a small open model economy, the "Leitemo-Gali-Monacelli" (LGM) model, and a slightly modified version of the macroeconometric model "Norwegian Aggregated Model" (NAM) by Bårdsen and Nymoen, which is a model in "the Norwegian tradition" similar to KVARTS used by the Statistics Norway and RIMINI previously used by Norges Bank. NAM differs substantially from the other four, and drives much of the results in this thesis, which gives sound justifications for including it in the set of models. All of the models prescribe highly <b>divergent</b> <b>reaction</b> functions for the nominal interest rate, and therefore constitute a good and wide-ranging base for robustness analyses. I mostly base my work on the paper by Taylor and Wieland (2009) on robust simple interest rate rules. As they do, I first find the optimal coefficients in three specifications of a simple interest rate rule in each seperate model: one rule where the nominal interest rate responds only to inflation fluctuations and the output gap; one where the lagged interest rate is added in order to allow for more gradual adjustments, and one with the lagged output gap as well. The optimization procedure is done in MatLab with the software Dynare and a search algorithm developed Junior Mai for internal use in Norges Bank. My results show that since the optimized rules are fine-tuned to the dynamics of the rule-generating model, they yield remarkably less stability in the competing models. In particular miserable is the rule with only two variables from the LGM model applied in NAM, generating instability. There is also a strong conflict between the prescribed three variable rules in CN and NAM. In order to improve the achievement of the simple rules, I look at "Bayesian rules" where an average of the outcomes in the models is optimized in order to find the interest rate rule that best stabilizes this "model-mean". The Bayesian rules are more robust as they reduce the variability in each model compared to the first-best rule from another model. They also perform well in the models that they have not been optimized over, NEMO and Policy NEMO. Robustness properties are evaluated using the relative increase in loss in a model stemming from the interchange of two policy rules translated into variability of inflation, a measure called Implied Inflation variability Premium (IIP). My results show a large dispersion of IIPs in the models, with the Bayesian rules naturally generating the lowest average IIP. In particular low IIPs are yielded by the rules where the relative importance of NAM in the optimization is tuned down. I find that rules that respond to last period's rate, inflation deviations from target and the current output gap is the most robust class of rules. Another robustness tool used is fault tolerance (FT), where the relative increase in loss resulting from gradually varying the optimal value of a coefficient in a policy rule is displayed in a graph. FT is both used to measure to which extent a rule is robust towards small changes in the parameters, and how much a model is tolerant to different policies. The three-parameter interest rate rules is proved to be the most robust, and are hence the best to insure against model uncertainty with. NEMO and Policy NEMO are the most fault tolerant models, closely followed by CN, and NAM is the least tolerant. At the end of the thesis I present what I refer to as "the Golden Interest Rule" (GIR), which is the rule that do best on average across the models. Through evaluating IIPs and FT of the different optimized rules, I found the properties of the best-performing rules, and tried several combinations of the parameter values that appeared to be optimal. GIR is as expected, a three-parameter rule that allows for a moderate degree of interest rate smoothing, yet not too much due to NAM. The long run responses to economic disturbances are substantially above the original Taylor rule, in particular three to inflation deviations from target and one and a half to GDP movements from trend. These strong reactions give sufficient stabilization of the real economy in all models considered...|$|E
40|$|Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) is now {{recognized as a}} medial disorder. In contrast to recent related reports, the present review focuses primarily on aetiological aspects of CFS. Four major hypotheses are reviewed. (1) Although CFS {{is often associated with}} viral infection, the presence of viruses has as yet not consistently been detected. (2) It is not clear whether anomalies of the HPA axis often observed in CFS, are cause or the consequences of the disorder. (3) Immune dysfunction as the cause of CFS is thus far the weakest hypothesis. (4) The psychiatric and psychosocial hypothesis denies the existence of CFS as a disease entity. Accordingly, the fatigue symptoms are assumed to be the consequence of other (somatic) diseases. Other possible causes of CFS are oxidative stress and genetic predisposition. In CFS cognitive behavioural therapy is most commonly used. This therapy, however, appears to be ineffective in many patients. The suggested causes of CFS and the <b>divergent</b> <b>reactions</b> to therapy may be explained by the lack of recognition of subgroups.

Perle, born in 1915 and educated here {{at a time when}} twelve-tone composition was little understood, felt the urge to revise Schoenberg's method so as to reconcile serial chromaticism with the hierarchical elements of tonal practice. The system he evolved, known as “twelve-tone tonality, ” has been the basis of most of his compositions until 1969, and all since. Del Tredici, born in 1937, studied at Princeton at a time when serialism had become dogma. Yet he eventually repudiated the technique and turned to a highly eccentric form of tonality. Thorne, born in 1953, gave little thought to twelve-tone composition. “It was the generation before me who had this monkey on its back, ” he says. Instead, Thorne came to maturity amid the welter of styles, from minimalism to neo-Romanticism, that characterized America during the 1970 s. All three attitudes offer us invaluable insights into the composers and their music. In some circles George Perle is known as a musicologist, particularly for hi...|$|R
5000|$|Barthelme {{continued}} {{his success in}} the short story form with Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts (1968). One widely anthologized story from this collection, [...] "The Balloon", appears to reflect on Barthelme's own intentions as an artist. The narrator of the tale inflates a giant, irregular balloon over most of Manhattan, causing widely <b>divergent</b> <b>reactions</b> in the populace. Children play across its top, enjoying it quite literally on a surface level; adults attempt to read meaning into it, but are baffled by its ever-changing shape; the authorities attempt to destroy it, but fail. Only in the final paragraph does the reader learn that the narrator has inflated the balloon for purely personal reasons, and sees no intrinsic meaning in the balloon itself, {{a metaphor for the}} amorphous, uncertain nature of Barthelme's fiction. Other notable stories from this collection include [...] "The Indian Uprising", a mad collage of a Comanche attack on a modern city, and [...] "Robert Kennedy Saved From Drowning", a series of vignettes showing the difficulties of truly knowing a public figure; the latter story appeared in print only two months before the real Kennedy's 1968 assassination.|$|R
5000|$|Paltrow's final {{appearance}} in the [...] "A Night of Neglect" [...] episode was met with <b>divergent</b> <b>reactions.</b> Both MTV journalist Aly Semigran and Gonzalez approved of Holly's departure, the latter of whom stating that Glee writers gave the character an appropriate ending and rounded out her arc. In contrast, CNN writer Lisa Respers France was dismayed by the character's exit and favored Holly's [...] "memorable" [...] characterization in the episode. The Washington Post Lisa de Moraes expressed interest in a season three return, and Canning described Holly as [...] "charming as ever" [...] in the episode. Myles McNutt, writing for The A.V. Club, felt the installment [...] "captured the occasional awkwardness of Paltrow's presence on the show", and wrote that casting such a prominent actress [...] "has its disadvantages when you know that she's only around on a temporary basis". TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak noted that Will and Emma's romance—and that Paltrow probably {{was not ready to}} commit to the series full-time—led to Holly's adieu. Slezak concluded that what he liked about Holly, was that she did not succumb to Will, which, according to Slezak, made him less annoying.|$|R

The quality of fluidiged bed was measured by means of fluidization index proposed by W. W. Shuster.

40|$|The first {{examples}} of 3, 3 -diaryloxetanes are prepared in a lithium-catalyzed and substrate dependent <b>divergent</b> Friedel–Crafts <b>reaction.</b> para-Selective Friedel–Crafts reactions of phenols using oxetan- 3 -ols afford 3, 3 -diaryloxetanes by {{displacement of the}} hydroxy group. These constitute new isosteres for benzophenones and diarylmethanes. Conversely, ortho-selective Friedel–Crafts reactions of phenols afford 3 -aryl- 3 -hydroxymethyl-dihydrobenzofurans by tandem alkylation–ring opening; {{the outcome of the}} reaction diverging to structurally distinct products dependent on the substrate regioselectivity. Further reactivity of the oxetane products is demonstrated, suitable for incorporation into drug discovery efforts...|$|R

40|$|Brain {{oscillations}} {{are critical}} for cognitive processes, and their alterations in schizophrenia have been proposed to contribute to cognitive impairments. Network oscillations rely upon GABAergic interneurons, which also show characteristic changes in schizophrenia. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the capability of hippocampal networks to generate oscillations in a rat model previously shown to reproduce the stereotypic structural alterations of the hippocampal interneuron circuit seen in schizophrenic patients. This model uses injection of GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin into the baso-lateral amygdala which causes cell-type specific disruption of interneuron signaling in the hippocampus. We found that after such treatment, hippocampal theta rhythm was still present during REM sleep, locomotion, and exploration of novel environment and could be elicited under urethane anesthesia. Subtle changes in theta and gamma parameters were observed in both preparations; specifically in the stimulus intensity – theta frequency relationship under urethane and in <b>divergent</b> <b>reactions</b> of oscillations at the two major theta dipoles in freely moving rats. Thus, theta power in the CA 1 region was generally enhanced as compared with deep theta dipole which decreased or did not change. The results indicate that pathologic reorganization of interneurons that follows the over-activation of the amygdala–hippocampal pathway, as shown for this model of schizophrenia, does not lead to destruction of the oscillatory circuit but changes the normal balance of rhythmic activity in its various compartments...|$|R

His 1991 essay in The New York Times, [...] "A Question of Mercy", describes how he was drawn into a mercy killing situation at a time well before Jack Kevorkian made physician-assisted suicide a subject of heated national debate. The attempt was botched because Selzer, fearful as he was of being charged with murder, could not be there to administer the final lethal dose. In 2016, death with dignity is a right legally recognized in four states.Selzer's exploration into the question of autonomy over the body continues to resonate in our culture today, with his literature bringing richer shades of truth than the political discourse allows. When Leon Kass, Chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, included four of Selzer's pieces in the 2003 anthology Being Human: Readings from the President's Council on Bioethics, it underscored Kass's view of Selzer: [...] "A man who lives with a knife, has his hands on organs, but preserves wonder and awe, is special." ...|$|R
