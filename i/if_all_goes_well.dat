500|$|A {{secondary}} {{function of}} the dog is to [...] "sniff out" [...] ingredients by putting his nose {{to the ground and}} smelling for items. The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time, including in huts and cities. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well,</b> the dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on the map, where the player can uncover the unseen ingredients. With repeated use, Alchemy Formulas will increase in level, enhancing their curative, offensive, or support effectiveness. Although there are dozens of Formulas available to be found within the game, only nine can be equipped at a time. To overcome this, there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy's current Alchemy list; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use.|$|E
500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1924 season, Leyland was recognised in The Times {{as one of the most}} promising young professional batsmen in England; the newspaper's cricket correspondent noted that Leyland [...] "is fully expected, in Yorkshire, to develop into a first-rate left-handed batsman." [...] He continued to improve that season, scoring 1,259 runs at 30.70. In August, he scored his first century in first-class cricket, hitting 133 not out in a drawn game against Lancashire; later in the month, he scored another century. Leyland further improved his record in 1925, hitting 1,572 runs at 40.30. Wisden commented: [...] "Leyland still further increased the big reputation he had made in the previous summer and ought, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> with him, to attain the highest distinction." [...] By the end of the 1926 season, in which he scored 1,561 runs at 39.02 and hit five centuries, Leyland had established himself as one of the most reliable batsmen in the Yorkshire team.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{identified}} the [...] "real self" [...] as {{the aspect of}} one's being that is founded in the actualizing tendency, follows organismic valuing, needs and receives positive regard and self-regard. It is the [...] "you" [...] that, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well,</b> you will become. On the other hand, {{to the extent that}} our society is out of sync with the actualizing tendency, and we are forced to live with conditions of worth that are out of step with organismic valuing, and receive only conditional positive regard and self-regard, we develop instead an [...] "ideal self". [...] By ideal, Rogers is suggesting something not real, something that is always out of our reach, the standard we cannot meet. This gap between the real self and the ideal self, the [...] "I am" [...] and the [...] "I should" [...] is called incongruity.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978 and 1979, Gurr {{was on the}} Somerset staff, {{though he}} made limited {{appearances}} in both first-class and List A cricket. In 1978, Wisden reported, [...] "Gurr's great potential was, unhappily, not available until the end , when he had manfully overcome a shattering loss of confidence". A year later, the Wisden report was little changed: [...] "The recurring inability of Gurr to fill his ordained position as opening fast bowler continued to worry everyone," [...] its report said. At {{the end of the}} season, Gurr got married and took a job with an insurance company. In his entry in the first-ever Cricketers' Who's Who book in 1980, Gurr wrote: [...] "I will probably spend the 1980 season playing part-time, acting as stand-by. I hope to develop my career in the life assurance market while trying {{to keep in touch with}} the first-class game. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well,</b> I hope to try and spend more time in cricket in two or three seasons' time." [...] In fact, he played in one second eleven match for Somerset in 1980, but never again appeared in first-class or List A cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Saadia Gaon {{read the}} words of [...] "And your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God," [...] to teach that <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>goes</b> <b>well</b> and runs {{smoothly}} for those engaged in the accumulation of money, then they are apt to put their entire trust in money and forget to make mention of their Master and deny their Provider. Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common. Reading [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that pride is the principal cause of forgetting essentials. Due to the abundance of affluence, peace, and tranquility, a person's heart can become haughty and smug, and the evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) can {{find it easy to}} provoke a person to follow the heart without restraint. When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and you say in your heart: â€˜My strength and the power of my hand has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E

25|$|The Boer leaders soon {{agreed on}} a plan. Half of Beyers' men would stay behind to keep Broadwood from marching to the rescue. The remainder, about 1500 men, were split into three attacking groups. Beyers would lead his {{commando}} against 300 British pickets on the mountaintop. Beyers detached Commandant Badenhorst to attack the camp from the west. De la Rey would capture several kopjes in the Moot to the south. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>went</b> <b>well,</b> Clements' brigade would be trapped and destroyed.|$|R
