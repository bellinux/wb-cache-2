Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) – its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the n=2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the n=1 shell, which can hold only two.|$|R

In this paper we study the LHC phenomenology of a charged colored lepton partner, namely the color <b>octet</b> <b>electron,</b> $e_ 8 $ in an effective theory framework. We explore various mechanisms for resonant production of $e_ 8 $'s. With the pair production channel the 14 TeV LHC can probe $e_ 8 $'s with masses up to 2. 5 TeV (2. 8 TeV) with 100 fb$^{- 1 }$ (300 fb$^{- 1 }$) of integrated luminosity. A common feature in all the resonant production channels {{is the presence of}} two high $p_T$ electrons and at least one high $p_T$ jet in the final state. Using this feature, we implement a search method where the signal is a combination of pair and single production events. This method has potential to increase the LHC reach significantly. Using the combined signal we estimate the LHC discovery potential for the $e_ 8 $'s. Our analysis shows that the LHC with 14 TeV center-of-mass energy and 100 fb$^{- 1 }$ (300 fb$^{- 1 }$) of integrated luminosity can probe $e_ 8 $'s with masses up to 3. 4 TeV (4 TeV) for the compositeness scale of 5 TeV.

We assume that matter is at zero temperature, charge neutral, in beta-equilibrium, and populated by the baryon <b>octet,</b> <b>electrons,</b> and muons. In order to study the effects of different degrees of stiffness in the equation of state, we explore the parameter space of the model, which reproduces nuclear matter properties at saturation, as well as massive neutron stars. Magnetic field effects are introduced both in the equation of state and in the macroscopic structure of stars by the self-consistent solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations. In addition, effects of poloidal magnetic fields on the global properties of stars, as well as density and magnetic field profiles are investigated. We find that not only different macroscopic magnetic field distributions, but also different parameterizations of the model for a fixed magnetic field distribution impact the gravitational mass, deformation and internal density profiles of stars.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} Lewis’s ideas concerning the chemical bond {{and in particular the}} concept of the electron pair bond and the octet rule. We show that the concept of the electron pair bond has endured to the present day and is now understood to be a consequence of the Pauli principle. In contrast the octet rule is now regarded as much less important than was originally generally believed, although Lewis himself knew several exceptions and regarded it as less important than what he called the rule of two (the <b>electron</b> pair). The <b>octet</b> rule was more strongly promoted by Langmuir who is also responsible for the term covalent bond. However, many more exceptions to the octet rules than were known to Lewis are now known and the terms hypervalent and hypovalent used to describe such molecules are no longer particularly useful. Today it is realized that bonding electron pairs in many molecules are not as well localized as Lewis believed, nevertheless resonance structures, i. e., plausible alternative Lewis struc-tures, are still often used to describe such molecules. Moreover electrons are not always found in pairs, as for exam-ple in linear molecules, which can, however, be satisfactorily described by Linnett’s double quartet theory. The elec-tron density distribution in a molecule can now be analyzed using the ELF and other functions of the electron den-sity to show where electron pairs are most probably to be found in a molecule...|$|R
40|$|A observação de objetos compactos com campos magnéticos superficiais da ordem de 1014 − 1015 G, denominados magnetares, tem chamado a atenção para os efeitos de campos magnéticos intensos na matéria nuclear e nas propriedades observacionais de estrelas compactas. No {{interior}} de magnetares, é esperado que os campos magnéticos sejam ainda mais intensos, podendo alcançar intensidades de até 1019 G. Nesse trabalho, estudamos os efeitos de campos magnéticos intensos nas equação de estado e estrutura de estrelas de nêutrons. Descrevemos a matéria nuclear dentro das estrelas em um novo formalismo relativístico de campo médio, que introduz forças de muitos corpos através de uma dependência dos campos escalares nas constantes de acoplamento da interação nuclear. Assumindo que a matéria encontra-se `a temperatura nula, eletricamente neutra e em equilíbrio beta, e populada pelo octeto babilônico, elétrons e múons, exploramos o espaço de parâmetros do modelo, de modo a descrever as propriedades da matéria nuclear na saturação, bem como estrelas de híperons massivas. Além disso, no contexto do assim chamado hyperon puzzle, investigamos o papel dos potenciais hiperônicos na relação massa-raio e na população dessas estrelas, através da solução das equações de Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV). A presença de campos magnéticos gera uma quantização de Landau nos níveis de energia das partículas carregadas e também uma anisotropia nas componentes do tensor energia momentum. Os efeitos do momento magnético anômalo das partículas nos níveis de energia de todas as partículas também são calculados, incluindo as não-carregadas, e mostramos que estes também aumentam a magnetização da matéria. Finalmente, introduzimos os campos magnéticos na estrutura das estrelas através da solução auto-consistente das equações de Einstein-Maxwell. Essas soluções nos permitem descrever modelos estelares axissimétricos estacionários, nos quais assumimos um campo magnético poloidal. Assim, consideramos a matéria sob a ação de um campo magnético estático que depende da densidade, alcançando intensidades da ordem de 1018 G no centro das estrelas. Concluímos que campos magnéticos têm efeitos significativos na sua população, mas apenas os efeitos do campo magnético na estrutura das estrelas possuem grande influências nas propriedades globais, como a massa máxima e a deformação desses objetos. The {{observation of}} compact objects with surface magnetic fields {{as strong as}} 1014 − 1015 G, denominated magnetars, has drawn attention {{to the study of}} the effects of strong magnetic fields on nuclear matter and compact stars observational properties. In the interior of magnetars, the magnetic fields are expected to be even stronger, and might reach values up to 1019 G. In this work, we study the effects of strong magnetic fields on the equation of state and structure of neutron stars. We describe nuclear matter inside stars in a new relativistic mean field formalism that takes many-body forces into account, by means of a field dependence of the nuclear interaction coupling constants. Assuming that matter is at zero temperature, charge neutral, beta-equilibrated and populated by the baryonic <b>octet,</b> <b>electrons</b> and muons, we explore the parameters space of the model in order to describe the nuclear matter properties at saturation, as well as massive hyperon stars. Also, in the context of the so called hyperon puzzle, we investigate the role of hyperon potentials in the mass-radius relation and population of hyperon stars, by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. The presence of the magnetic fields generates a Landau quantization on the energy levels of the charged particles and also an anisotropy in the components of the energymomentum tensor. We also calculate the effects of the anomalous magnetic moment of the particles on the energy levels of all particles, including the uncharged ones, and show that it increases the magnetization of the matter. Finally, we introduce the magnetic fields in the strutucture of stars by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations self-consistently. These solutions lead to stationary and axisymmetric stellar models, in which a poloidal magnetic field is assumed. Hence, the matter is considered to be under a static density dependent magnetic field, reaching intensities of the order of 1018 G at the center of the stars. We conclude that magnetic fields affect significantly the particles population of the stars, but only the effects on the structure of stars have strong influence on the global properties, as maximum masses and deformation, of these objects...|$|R
