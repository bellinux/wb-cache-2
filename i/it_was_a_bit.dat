5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> much.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And I really wanted to write {{something}} which did speed up, and took the emotion and the adrenaline with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

25|$|At first no {{suitable}} coffin for {{the body}} could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded for anyone to get {{in or out of}} the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the Maury River. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the General's body, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes. He was buried underneath Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, where his body remains.|$|E
25|$|With its {{aluminum}} {{body and}} frame, the Insight was an expensive car {{to produce and}} was never designed for high-volume sales. Instead, {{it was designed to}} be a real world test car for hybrid technology and a gauge to new consumer driving habits. With an aerodynamic fuel-saving shape similar to the Audi A2, and some unconventional body colors <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more than mainstream car buyers could handle, preferring more conservative styles. Production halted announced in May 2006, with plans announced to replace Insight with a new hybrid car, smaller than the eighth generation Civic, but not earlier than in 2009. Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.|$|E
25|$|Michael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in {{the fourth}} quarter-final of the C Trophy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of an {{implosion}} from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort just stopped dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, {{but it was too}} little, too late.|$|E

25|$|After un-assembled {{planes were}} strafed {{on the ground}} on May 30 at Ekron {{airfield}} the fighters were moved to makeshift strip located around the current Herzliya Airport. The airfield was used as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> back from the front-lines, and was clandestine {{since it was a}} purpose built strip, that was constructed after the beginning of hostilities, in between the orange orchards around Herzliya, and didn't appear on published maps. The Israeli Air Force scored its first aerial victories on June 3 when Modi Alon, flying Avia D.112, shot down two Egyptian Air Force DC-3s which had just bombed Tel Aviv. The first dogfight against enemy fighters took place a few days later, on June 8, when Gideon Lichtaman shot down an Egyptian Spitfire. During these initial operations, the squadron operated with a few planes versus almost complete Arab theater Air supremacy and the airplanes were parked dispersed between the orange trees. The fighters were moved in October to Hatzor Airbase from the Herzliya strip in due to its unsuitability in rainy conditions, probable loss of clandestine status, moving front lines which made former British bases safe for use, and a shift in the balance of air superiority towards the Israelis.|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{described}} it as a [...] "fast and breezy vampire tale punctuated with a few nasty shocks" [...] and stated that [...] "Stine sends his characters through the details of a plot that is basically all chase." [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Karen MacPherson stated that Dangerous Girls [...] "moves along at a fast clip, powered by short chapters with cliffhanger endings and weirdly interesting characters." [...] Sarah Sawtelle from Teenreads.com commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> slow at times, but it was one of Stine's best books.|$|E

After writing more uptempo dance-based songs, such as [...] "Wannabe", {{the group and}} the two producers decided to write a slow ballad. But as the group were writing the song, they realised that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too slushy, so {{it was decided to}} address the importance of contraception with the lyrics: [...] "Be a little bit wiser baby. Put it on, put it on".|$|E

In a later interview, Townshend explained ...|$|E
500|$|One of Zoe's {{first and}} main storylines was being stalked by fellow student Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later {{commented on the}} storyline, {{deciding}} it was her most memorable: [...] "The most memorable for me {{was the one with}} my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like I said, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> weird, but I quite liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, and they just looked at me as they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E
50|$|Symphony No. 2 in D minor, Op. 5 was {{composed}} by George English in 1933 (from 1 February to 2 November). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> larger works than his First, but more conventional too.|$|R

5000|$|Cross Rhythms Stephen Luff {{wrote that}} [...] "Its {{hard to find}} favourites as this album <b>is</b> simply outstanding. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>a</b> slow burner, but once it gets under your skin, it does not let go." ...|$|R

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Live Forever" [...] is a crowd {{favorite}} to play at concerts. In some concerts, most notably Manchester in 1996, a slideshow of famous deceased musicians Oasis admired—such as Elvis Presley, Bob Marley, and Sid Vicious—would be displayed behind the band, {{with a picture of}} John Lennon always {{at the end of the}} slideshow. [...] During the early years, Liam Gallagher would personally sing the falsetto part, [...] "You and I, we're gonna live forever." [...] Noel Gallagher eventually picked up the role of singing the falsetto, as [...] "Liam thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> gay."

500|$|Delays {{were caused}} {{as a result}} of manufacturing. This may cause the pavilions to stay on exhibit until November. Additionally, the Hadid Pavilion may be {{situated}} in {{a different part of the}} park for part of 2010. [...] The choices of Hadid and van Berkel were somewhat controversial because Burnham was a classicist and they are both avant-garde modernists. [...] Additionally, local architects complained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a slight that two European architects were chosen to produce works to serve as the focal points of the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration. [...] The pavilions were scheduled to be a focal point of the centennial celebration of the 1909 Plan of Chicago, which is a yearlong celebration. [...] However, Hadid's Pavilion encountered manufacturer's difficulty in executing Hadid's complex, computer-aided design.|$|E

500|$|Writers Chris Drake and Graeme Bassett {{put it that}} [...] "On paper, at least, {{the premise}} seemed irresistible", yet view the {{blending}} of puppetry and live action as [...] "uneasy". Prior to his death in 2002, Unwin himself praised the off-beat nature of The Secret Service, defending the inclusion of elements such as Unwinese dialogue as [...] "an attempt to add {{a new dimension to}} the puppet field ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> bizarre, but then aren't many new ideas a little odd at first?" [...] On the subject of the cancellation, he commented that the series was possibly [...] "a little bit before its time".

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney {{composition}} [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". Although the Beatles {{had enjoyed}} widespread commercial and critical success with Sgt. Pepper, {{the long hours}} they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: [...] " [...] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play." [...] His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: [...] "I jump into chords that {{no one seems to}} get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar".|$|E
