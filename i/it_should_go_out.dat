60|$|Every man {{dropped his}} tools, {{and ran to}} the nearest shaft for his life. It was not, indeed, {{probable}} that the flood would fill all the wide-extended ramifications of the vast mine, but no one knew for certain where the catastrophe had occurred, or how near the danger might be to the spot where he laboured. Enough for each that death was dealing terrible destruction somewhere overhead, and that, unless every muscle were strained to the uttermost, the pathway might be filled up, and his retreat cut off. The rush was swiftly but not easily made. Those who have never traversed the levels of a Cornish mine may perhaps fancy, on hearing of levels six feet high, and {{about two and a half}} feet broad, on the average, that the flight might resemble the rush of men through the windings and turnings of the intricate passages in a stupendous old castle. But it was far otherwise. The roofs, walls, and floors of these levels were irregular, not only in direction, but in height and form. There was no levelling or polishing-off anywhere. It was tunnelling of the roughest kind. Angles and projections remained as the chisel, the pick, and the blasting-powder had left them. Here, the foot tripped over a lump, or plunged into a hollow; there, the head narrowly missed a depending mass of rock, or the shoulder grazed a projecting one. Elsewhere, pools of water lay in the path, and at intervals the yawning chasm of a winze appeared, with one or two broken planks to bridge the gulf, of twenty, forty, or sixty feet, that descended to the levels below. Sometimes it was possible to run with the head stooped a little; generally the back had to be bent low--often double; and occasionally progress could only be made on hands and knees,--this, too, with a candle to be guarded from blasts of air or dripping water, and trimmed, lest <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and leave the place in total darkness.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Paper Planes" [...] {{music video}} was censored by MTV in December 2007, {{who had also}} banned the video for M.I.A.'s single [...] "Sunshowers". In this version, M.I.A.'s vocals were doubled, the gun sounds {{replaced}} with popping sounds, and the word [...] "weed" [...] replaced with the word [...] "seed". The producers of Pineapple Express asked for the word to be similarly changed before use, a request M.I.A. found [...] "ridiculous, cause the whole movie's about weed." [...] On 16 December 2007, following some fan disapproval of the leaked MTV version, M.I.A. stated in a MySpace entry that MTV's decision to change the sound disappointed and angered her, adding that MTV had [...] "sabotaged" [...] a music video made more safe and mainstream than her regular videos. The song was similarly censored during her live performance on the Late Show with David Letterman to her visible surprise, an action she had not agreed to. The chorus effects during the soundcheck of her Late Show performance were different from what was played live during the taping. At her concert at the Austin City Limits festival {{a few days after}} the show, she spoke more of the incident, thanking David Letterman onstage [...] "for letting her into the American mainstream." [...] A writer for New York magazine felt the issue of MTV censoring [...] "Paper Planes" [...] was a non-controversy as the edited clip had been removed from MTV following fan-pressure and replaced, noting [...] "they've been gun sounds and imagery since 1997, according to Wikipedia. What does surprise us is that MTV ever considered showing the video at all. We had no idea they still aired music videos, much less ones by talented artists like M.I.A. If anything, it likely airs at odd hours when nobody's watching." [...] Tom Breihan of The Village Voice also noted this to be part of a general trend by networks like MTV and BET and radio towards rap songs such as those by 50 Cent where any references to drugs, sex and violence were removed and replaced, concluding that this was a double standard approach to rap artists' work compared to songs by Green Day and My Chemical Romance. Commenting that [...] "Paper Planes" [...] is a [...] "song that deserves to start a few arguments, and <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the wider world with its argument-starting potential left intact", Breihan noted that although the uncensored version would not inspire rioting in the streets, more listeners opted to download music as mainstream [...] "cultural outlets in which ... music makes itself heard are increasingly afraid of offending anyone, ever, for any reason".|$|E

"Why, then, when {{he comes}} back with Mr. Wolfe, should he not take a fancy to this little person, as his mamma wishes--only, to do us justice, we Esmonds care very little for what our mammas wish--and marry her, and set up beside you in Virginia?

60|$|Then {{he entered}} into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to know all this matter. She formed a long tale of that part; how she had it from one that I had told the whole story to, {{and that was to}} help me dispose of the goods; and this confidante brought the things to her, she being by {{profession}} a pawnbroker; and she hearing of his worship's disaster, guessed at the thing in general; that having gotten the things into her hands, she had resolved to come and try as she had done. She then gave him repeated assurances that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> never <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of her mouth, and though she knew the woman very well, yet she had not let her know, meaning me, anything of it; that is to say, who the person was, which, by the way, was false; but, however, it was not to his damage, for I never opened my mouth of it to anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why not?" [...] he protested. [...] "I {{have not}} the tortuous brain {{of the modern}} politician. I hate cities--the smell of them, the {{atmosphere}} of them, the life in them. The desire for travel is only half born in me. That may come--I cannot tell. I love the daily work here; I am fond of horses and dogs. I know every yard of land we own, and I know what it will produce. It interests me to try experiments--new crops, a new distribution of crops, new machinery sometimes, new methods of fertilizing. I love to watch the seasons come and reign and pass. I love to feel {{the wind and the}} sun, and even the rain. All these things have become a sort of appetite to me. I am afraid," [...] he wound up a little lamely, [...] "that this is all very badly expressed, but the whole truth of it is, you see, that I am a man of simple and inherited tastes. I feel that my life is here, and I live it here and I love <b>it.</b> Why <b>should</b> I <b>go</b> <b>out</b> like a Don Quixote and search for vague adventures?" ...|$|R
