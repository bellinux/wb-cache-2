In addition, the chapter considers Hume’s views on the imagination as a faculty <b>of</b> producing <b>ideas,</b> {{as well as on}} the part that imagining plays in <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> modal knowledge and in <b>the</b> comprehension <b>of,</b> and resistance to, false or fictional opinions...|$|R

40|$|This chapter overviews Hume’s {{thoughts}} on the nature and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> imagining, with an almost exclusive focus on <b>the</b> first book <b>of</b> his Treatise of Human Nature. Over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> this text, Hume draws and discusses three important distinctions among our conscious mental episodes (or what he calls ‘perceptions’) : (i) between impressions (including perceptual experiences) and ideas (including recollections, imaginings and occurrent beliefs); (ii) between <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memory and <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination; and (iii), among <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination, between <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judgement (i. e. occurrent beliefs) and <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fancy (i. e. imaginings). I discuss each distinction in turn, also in connection to contemporary views on imagining. In addition, I briefly consider Hume’s views on the imagination as a faculty aimed at <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> <b>ideas,</b> {{as well as on}} the role that imagining plays in <b>the</b> wider context <b>of</b> our mental lives, notably in <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> modal knowledge and in <b>the</b> comprehension <b>of</b> stories and opinions that we take to be false or fictional...|$|R

5|$|Summation {{describes}} {{the addition of}} arbitrarily many numbers, usually more than just two. It includes the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum of a single number, which is itself, and the empty sum, which is zero. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them {{if they had been}} chided or were upset. This theme, linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
5|$|As David Halberstam {{put it in}} {{his book}} Playing for Keeps: Michael Jordan and the World He Made,Michael Jordan and David Falk helped make each other, and each profited to a {{remarkable}} degree from their special collaboration. It is true that Michael Jordan was the person who in the end actually did the deeds, went on the court and hit the final jump shot again and again, but {{it is also true that}} David Falk helped revolutionize the process of representing a basketball player, going into a team sport and creating the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual player as a commercial superstar.|$|E
5|$|At his death, {{the role}} of the emperor as a patron of Eastern Orthodoxy was claimed by Ivan III, Grand duke of Muscovy. He had married Andreas' sister, Sophia Paleologue, whose grandson, Ivan IV, would become the first Tsar of Russia (tsar, or czar, meaning caesar, is a term {{traditionally}} applied by Slavs to the Byzantine Emperors). Their successors supported the idea that Moscow was the proper heir to Rome and Constantinople. The <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Empire as the successive Third Rome was kept alive until its demise with the Russian Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb as a completed action, viewing it {{from start to finish}} as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used to quantify the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} years in England, Jinnah was {{influenced}} by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other future Indian independence leaders. This political education included exposure to the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> democratic nation, and progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When a clear <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, who {{had arrived in the}} United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the country was}} also influenced by American cinema, and many of his illustrations were based on cinematic imagery.
