5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective flame retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a <b>flame</b> <b>retardant.</b> Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, arsenic and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{have been}} used in {{polymers}} to reduce the flammability of plastics, building materials, fabric and papers. In recent years, organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were used as substitutes for Brominated <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants.</b> The consume amounts of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in 2001 was about 5 times than that of 2000 in Japan. Recently, several studies have shown the carcinogenicity and neurotoxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Reducing the risk of fire is the main advantage of using organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> However, there are possible health risks from the toxicity of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Health and fire risk assessment methods of organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were established in this study. Optimum additive level of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> was proposed by comparing the two kinds of risks. The method was applied to estimate the optimum additive level of TCPP in wall covering materials. Practicality of the risk minimization approach was proved. However, because it is an interdisciplinary study, there are some problems such as data deficiency etc. Accuracy of the risk assessment method should be promoted in the further study...|$|R

50|$|The term <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> subsumes {{a diverse}} group of {{chemicals}} which are added to manufactured materials, such as plastics and textiles, and surface finishes and coatings. <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> inhibit or delay the spread of fire by suppressing the chemical reactions in the flame or by the formation of a protective layer on the surface of a material. They may be mixed with the base material (additive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants)</b> or chemically bonded to it (reactive <b>flame</b> <b>retardants).</b> Mineral <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are typically additive while organohalogen and organophosphorus compounds can be either reactive or additive.|$|R
5|$|Brominated {{flame retardants}} {{represent}} a commodity of growing importance, {{and make up}} the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> produces hydrobromic acid which interferes in the radical chain reaction of the oxidation reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can be added to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can be added to the final polymers.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ono's {{family moved}} without her to Scarsdale, New York, an {{affluent}} town 25 {{miles north of}} mid-town Manhattan. When she later rejoined her family in the U.S., she enrolled at nearby Sarah Lawrence College. While her parents approved of her college choice, Ono said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, poets, and others who represented the bohemian lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited galleries and art happenings in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. American avant-garde artist, composer, and musician La Monte Young was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her Chambers Street loft in Tribeca as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her mentor John Cage advised her to treat the paper with <b>flame</b> <b>retardant.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some occupations expose {{workers to}} higher levels of {{halogenated}} <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and their degradation products. A small study of U.S. foam recyclers and carpet installers, who handle padding often made from recycled polyurethane foam, showed elevated levels of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> in their tissues. Workers in electronics recycling plants around the world also have elevated body levels of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> relative to the general population. Environmental controls can substantially reduce this exposure, whereas workers in areas with little oversight can take in very high levels of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> Electronics recyclers in Guiyu, China, have some of the highest human body levels of PBDEs in the world. A study conducted in Finland determined the occupational exposure of workers to brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> and chlorinated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (TBBPA, PBDEs, DBDPE, HBCD, Hexabromobenzene and Dechlorane plus). In 4 recycling sites of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), the study concluded that control measures implemented on site significantly reduced the exposure. Workers making products that contain <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (such as vehicles, electronics, and baby products) may be similarly exposed. U.S. firefighters can have elevated levels of PBDEs and high levels of brominated furans, toxic degradation products of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b>|$|R

5|$|The episode filmed {{for eight}} days. In one sequence, Carl Grimes sparks up a {{cigarette}} lighter and drops {{it onto a}} horde of walkers after Rick creates a diversion to distract the walkers. Greg Nicotero, the special effect director for The Walking Dead, used black panels to capture {{the elements of the}} fire; this enabled them to edit the flames onto the walkers. To reduce the chances of getting burned, the stuntmen put on several layers of <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> suits. The first layer consisted of a dry Nomex undergarment; this was followed by several layers of Nomex clothing that were gelled. Since the sequence was conducted on multiple occasions, the stuntmen were coated with gel containing cationic polymers. The last layer was a raincoat, which would separate the gel from the stuntmen's clothing and allowed them to be engulfed in flames for several seconds without injury.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has wildland fire engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E

50|$|The {{tests on}} the fire {{behaviour}} of materials with different <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> revealed that halogen free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> produce less smoke and toxic fire emissions, {{with the exception of}} the aryl phosphates RDP and BDP in styrenic polymers. The leaching experiments showed that the nature of the polymer is a dominating factor and that the leaching behaviour of halogen free and brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> is comparable. The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules. The impact assessment studies reconfirmed that the improper waste and recycling treatment of electronic products with brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> can produce dioxins which is not the case with halogen free alternatives. Furthermore, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has been carrying out a series of projects related to the environmental assessment of alternative <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> the “design for environment” projects on <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> for printed wiring boards and alternatives to decabromo diphenylethers and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD).|$|R

40|$|In {{this essay}} studies on {{two classes of}} {{brominated}} polyaromatic <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are reviewed. Theoretically, 209 different congeners of both PBBs and PBDEs are possible. These congeners have specific chemical and physical properties, which lead to different biological and toxicological effects. Most studies {{have been based on}} commercial mixtures of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> which complicates the pursuit of unambiguous data and insights. Only adequate quantification of individual congeners will allow comparative environmental and toxicological studies. Progress in this field depends upon the availability of pure synthesized congeners for use as standards. The present environmental levels of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> do not pose an immediate, major environmental risk. However, most of the PBB and PBDE congeners found in commercial <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> are persistent, lipophilic and bioaccumulating, which represents a definite potential threat to both human and environmental life. Therefore, prolonged commercial use of brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> should be avoided. These compounds need to be replaced by alternative <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> provided these alternatives are proven to be less harmful. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{are in many}} home {{products}} including couches, chairs, and electronics. The {{most commonly}} used <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> contained polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) until 2004, when {{the majority of these}} chemicals were phased out. PBDEs were found to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic to both humans and the environment. Organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> have become an option for alternative <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> but have not been tested extensively. There is concern that many of these organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> may be carcinogenic, neurotoxic, or reproductive toxicants. Using zebrafish as a model, three organophosphate <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> (TDCPP, TCPP, and TCEP) were tested for their developmental and neurotoxic effects. The results of this study indicated that there are both physical and behavioral effects of all three of these chemicals. With further testing, it may be found that these negative effects are linked to various neurological disorders in humans such as ADD and ADHD. Other neurological disorders, such as autism or depression, may also be affected, but additional studies would need to be performed in order to determine this.

40|$|This chapter {{begins with}} {{background}} information on <b>flame</b> <b>retardants,</b> including their classification (Section 3. 1). Section 3. 2 presents the <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{included in this}} assessment and Section 3. 3 discusses those which were considered but excluded from the assessment. Section 3. 4 presents the mechanisms by which <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> reduce or prevent combustion. 3. 1 General Information on <b>Flame</b> <b>Retardants</b> <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> decrease the ignitability of materials and inhibit the combustion process, limiting the amount of heat released. The simplest way, in theory, of preventing polymer combustion is to design the polymer {{so that it is}} thermally stable. Thermally stable polymers are less likely to decompose into combustible gases under heat stress, which prevents combustion from initiating. Because thermally stable polymers are often difficult and expensive to process and may have performance limitations, manufacturers use other means, such as flame-retardant chemicals, to impart flame-retardant properties to polymers. <b>Flame</b> <b>retardants</b> decrease the likelihood of a fire occurring and/or decrease a range of undesirable consequences of a fire (Lyons 1970; Cullis and Hirschler 1981).

50|$|The {{environmental}} behaviour of <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{has been studied}} since the 1990s. Mainly brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found in many environmental compartments and organisms including humans, and some individual substances {{were found to have}} toxic properties. Therefore, alternatives have been demanded by authorities, NGOs and equipment manufacturers. The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing halogen free versus brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b> About a dozen halogen free <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS). Overall, they were found to have a much lower tendency to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue than the studied brominated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{products}} containing halogenated <b>flame</b> <b>retardants</b> {{are sent}} to landfills.
