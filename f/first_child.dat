30|$|Relaxed on-demand expansionThe second {{improvement}} {{is to use}} a relaxed on-demand expansion that reduces the need of exhaustive expansion and sorting operations. The on-demand expansion was proposed in [50] for hard-output decoder. It consists in expanding the <b>first</b> <b>children</b> of parent nodes and choosing one minimum between these children. Then, the survival path expands the next child. In our approach, a portion A of the <b>first</b> <b>children</b> is chosen. Then, the corresponding parents expand their next children. This operation is repeated to get K best nodes. The number of the <b>first</b> <b>children</b> A is chosen in order to allow a parent node to extend all its possible children nodes depending on the constellation and on the total number K of retained solutions. Figure 5 shows an example with K= 4 and A= 2. All parent nodes at the first level expand their <b>first</b> <b>children.</b> The two children that have the smaller Euclidean distances (nodes 1 and 7) are retained. Then, the corresponding parent nodes (P 1 and P 2) expand their next children (nodes 3 and 8). The distance is compared, and the two nodes (3 and 10) having the lowest distances are retained to get 4 best candidates.|$|R
