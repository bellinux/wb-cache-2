An {{adaptation}} of two well-established measures {{of changes in}} financial markets- return and volatility- is presented {{for the analysis of}} changes: (a) in consumer confidence about national economies, and (b) in sentiments articulated in financial news stories text and extracted automatically by counting the frequency of polarity words. This analysis is then compared and contrasted with the changes in <b>key</b> <b>stock</b> market indices- by looking at the actual distribution of returns of the sentiment, consumer confidence and stock market indices. We have looked at three stock market indices (S&P 500, ISEQ, and Nikkei) for periods of two years or more. For consumer confidence we have analysed the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index and the Irish Economic and Social Research Institute’s Consumer Confidence survey.

40|$|The study {{examined}} the relationship between stock market performance and economic growth in Nigeria. It utilized the bounds testing co-integration procedure also known as autoregressive distributed lag estimation procedure. The empirical model combined <b>key</b> <b>stock</b> market indicators and some traditional macroeconomic variables to estimate the hypothesized relationship in the study. It found that in the long-run, overall output in the Nigerian economy is less sensitive to changes in stock market capitalization as well as the average dividend yield thereby casting doubt on the ability of the Nigerian stock market in its present level of development to serve as a barometer for measuring or predicting the overall health of the Nigerian economy as well as its direction over the long-run horizon. The other major finding in the study is that the long-run growth of the Nigerian economy is highly sensitive to marginal variations in interest rate which is suggestive that macroeconomic variables in the country are at present more useful in shaping the long-run direction of the Nigerian economy...|$|E

40|$|Fishing {{communities}} in Europe are facing significant challenges due to policy measures {{aimed at reducing}} fishing effort in order {{to cope with the}} ‘‘crisis’’ in <b>key</b> <b>stocks.</b> While it is imperative to ensure sustainability of the resource, such policies may overlook the contribution of fisheries to the social and cultural well-being of coastal communities. This article explores the contribution that sense of place can make to understanding the relationship between fishing and cultural ecosystem ser- vices, drawing on case studies from Cornwall, southwest England. Through semi- structured interviews with fishing community stakeholders we outline how fishing contributes to sense of place in terms of individual and community identities, as well as a particular place character associated with the physical presence of fishing. We suggest that a co-constructionist account of the relationship between sea and land can provide a starting point for understanding the cultural landscape that emerges as a result of fishing...|$|R

40|$|The role grey seals {{have played}} in the {{performance}} of fisheries is controversial and a cause of much debate between fishers and conservationists. Most studies focus on the effects of seal damage to gears or fish and on prey population abundance but little attention is given to the consequences of the latter for the fisheries. We develop a model that quantifies the economic impact of grey seal predation on the West of Scotland demersal fisheries that traditionally targeted cod, haddock and whiting. Three contrasting fishing strategy scenarios are examined to assess impacts on equilibrium fleet revenues under different levels of seal predation. These include status quo fishing mortality (SQF, steady state with constant fishing mortality), open access fishing (bioeconomic equilibrium, BE) and the maximum economic yield (MEY). In all scenarios, cod emerges as the <b>key</b> <b>stock.</b> Large whitefish trawlers are most sensitive to seal predation due to their higher cod revenues but seal impacts are minor at the aggregate fishery level. Scenarios that consider dynamic fleet behaviour also show the greatest effects of seal predation. Results are sensitive to the choice of seal foraging model where a type II functional response increases sensitivity to seal predation. The cost to the fishery for each seal is estimated...|$|E
40|$|The {{time series}} of {{abundance}} indices for many groundfish populations, as determined from trawl surveys, are often imprecise and short, causing stock assessment estimates of abundance to be imprecise. To improve precision, prior probability distributions (priors) {{have been developed}} for parameters in stock assessment models by using meta-analysis, expert judgment on catchability, and empirically based modeling. This article presents a synthetic approach for formulating priors for rockfish trawl survey catchability (qgross). A multivariate prior for qgross for different surveys is formulated by using 1) a correction factor for bias in estimating fish density between trawlable and untrawlable areas, 2) expert judgment on trawl net catchability, 3) observations from trawl survey experiments, and 4) data on the fraction of population biomass in each of the areas surveyed. The method is illustrated by using bocaccio (Sebastes paucipinis) in British Columbia. Results indicate that expert judgment can be updated markedly by observing the catch-rate ratio from different trawl gears in the same areas. The marginal priors for qgross are consistent with empirical estimates obtained by fitting a stock assessment model to the survey data under a noninformative prior for qgross. Despite high prior uncertainty (prior coefficients of variation ≥ 0. 8) and high prior correlation between qgross, the prior for qgross still enhances the precision of <b>key</b> <b>stock</b> assessment quantities...|$|E

5000|$|The act’s results vary for {{different}} regions and different fish stocks. It {{did not prevent}} the overfishing of many species throughout its first 20 years of existence. This prompted major amendments in 1996 and 2006. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued a report to Congress in 2010 {{on the status of}} U.S. fisheries. It reported that of the 192 stocks monitored for overfishing 38 stocks (20%) still have fish “mortality rates that exceed the overfishing threshold … and 42 stocks (22%) are overfished”. [...] This is down from 38% and 48% respectively in 2000. [...] A 2003 NMFS report reviewed achievements of the act since 1996. Highlighting the inconsistent effects of the legislation, it revealed that overfishing was eliminated in 15 major fish stocks while overfishing was initiated in 12 major fish stocks. To improve their overfishing prevention programs, the NMFS has implemented the Fish Stock Sustainability Index (FSSI), which measures <b>key</b> <b>stocks</b> according to their overfishing status and biomass levels. Since the FSSI began the index has increased every year.|$|R
40|$|The Stock Market is a {{specialized}} financial market with acclaimed capacity to facilitate and mobilize {{savings and investment}} for economic and industrial growth. As a long term security provider, the market stands out as an agent for economic growth in many world economies. This paper tries {{to determine whether there}} is any causal link between stock market performance and economic growth in Nigeria. The study is significant for policy formulation and implementation by government and other stakeholders of the Nigerian Stock Market. Time Series data on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and <b>key</b> <b>stock</b> market performance indicators were collated for the period 1984 to 2011. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) Technique was adopted in analysing the data. The results indicate that about 88 % of the changes in economic growth could be explained by changes in stock market performance in the short run, implicating Market Capitalization (MKTCAP), Value of Transaction in the market (VALTRAN) and All share Index(ALLSVI) as significant predictors. The long run effect is shown to stand at 95 % with MKTCAP and ALLSVI as having significant influences. The Error Correction Model coefficient of- 0. 39 suggests slow speed in operators ’ ability to adjust to shocks in stock market performance and in restoring investors ’ confidence in such circumstances. The work therefore calls on stock market regulators and operators to address key policy issues that are capable of boosting marke...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} 4 papers that propose methods for modeling and estimation in a dynamic or nonstationary environment. An underlying theme throughout the thesis {{the belief that}} bioeconomic equilibriums are moving over time and that steady state models are often inappropriate in dynamic setting. Two empirical dynamic settings are explored. The first showing a regime change in the biological characteristics with consideration of the economic impact to the fisheries. The second proposes estimation methods in a nonstationary environment. Policy implications are explored and suggestions are made where appropriate. Chapter 1 models common-pool industries which experience exogenous technology shocks. Shocks are modeled as a compound Poisson process for total factor productivity and induce off-equilibrium dynamics that lower the equilibrium resource stock while causing capital buildup. The steady state changes from a stable node to a shifting focus with boom and bust cycles, even if only technology is uncertain. A fisheries application is developed, but the results apply to many settings with discontinuous changes in value and open access with costly exit. Chapter 2 provides a fisheries relevant empirical analysis of the biological dynamics of a fisheries that has undergone a regime shift. <b>Key</b> <b>stock</b> assessment statistics are computed for the Northern anchovy over 1981 - 2009. Spatial and temporal variation of the eggs, larvae is characterized and modeled. We find that recent low recruitment productivity that can be attributed largely to poor environmental conditions. An economic appendix explores the determinants of catch in the anchovy fishery. Chapter 3 further explores the modeling and estimation of jump diffusion processes as they apply to financial time series. A framework is proposed for estimating and forecasting realized volatility {{in the presence of}} jumps. An optimal method for threshold selection is proposed that minimizes the out-of-sample forecasting loss. We find that large truncation thresholds may not be optimal from a forecasting perspective. An extensive simulation study and an empirical application to S&P 500 futures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Chapter 4 models a dynamic environment as regime shifts in a spatial bioeconomic framework. Regime shifts are induced through a cyclic time varying parameter meant to mimic environmental oscillations. The optimal economic resource exploitation policy is derived, explicitly showing the impact of spatial connectedness in this dynamic setting. Through simulation alternative management policies are explored that ignore the spatial connectedness and the corresponding impacts on economic variables and resources stoc...|$|E
