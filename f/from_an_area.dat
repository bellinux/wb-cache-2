5|$|Hurricane Humberto formed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low {{pressure}} generated by Hurricane Gabrielle. The low formed into a tropical depression on September 21 while south of Bermuda, tracking northwest, {{and was named}} Tropical Storm Humberto the next day. It began moving north, and then northeast as it passed Bermuda and strengthened into a hurricane. Humberto headed over the colder waters of the far north Atlantic Ocean, and dissipated quickly on September 27.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the latest}} Cape Verde-type hurricanes to form in any season, Joan formed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of {{convection}} in the intertropical convergence zone that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa early in October. It developed banding and was upgraded to Tropical Depression Seventeen on October 10 and later designated as Tropical Storm Joan while located at low latitude in the central Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} {{within a particular}} area often differ in their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area.</b> A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E

Azzimani had organised the trip for the children, who were <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> which saw rioting following the death of a man fleeing police in January 2010. He said in an interview prior to the games that the trip for the children was more important than his own, and related it to being introduced to being introduced to skiing on a school trip of his own at the age of six years old.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Akash (JTWC designation: 01B, {{also known}} as Cyclonic Storm Akash) was the first named {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Warned by both India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), it formed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather on the Bay of Bengal on May 12, and gradually organized as it drifted northward. An eye began to develop as it approached land, and after reaching peak 3-min sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) it struck about 115km (70mi) south of Chittagong in Bangladesh. Akash rapidly weakened over land, and advisories were discontinued on May 15.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Forrest, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone that prompted the evacuation of 600,000people in Bangladesh in late November1992. Originating <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November20 as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November21 before dissipating early the next day.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Geralda (also {{known as}} Intense Tropical Cyclone Geralda) was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that caused catastrophic damage in Madagascar in late January 1994, among the strongest to hit the country. It originated <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure over the Indian Ocean on January25. Over the following few days, the depression underwent gradual intensification, reaching its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph) on January 31. Cyclone Geralda made landfall near Toamasina, Madagascar after weakening from its peak intensity. Within hours of moving onshore, the system had substantially weakened, and by February5, Geralda had degenerated into a land depression, and it became extratropical three days later.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Graham of the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone {{season was}} a weak {{tropical}} storm that affected Australia during late February and early March 2003. Graham originated <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of convection that emerged onto water after sitting over Australia on 23 February. The interaction with a monsoon trough formed {{an area of}} low pressure that developed into Tropical Cyclone Graham on 27 February. The storm moved slowly to the east-southeast, and after turning to the south it peaked as a tropical storm and made landfall on Western Australia the next day. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland, and dissipated on 1 March. The storm dropped heavy rainfall and caused high winds, which produced flooding and downed trees. One fatality occurred, though no significant damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Kate {{originated}} <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of {{low pressure}} that was first identified on 22 February 2006, within a monsoonal trough. The system rapidly intensified throughout the day, with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology issuing their first advisory {{on the system}} that evening. Upon being classified, the system was immediately declared Tropical Cyclone Kate, skipping tropical low status. At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began issuing advisories on the system, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 13P. The storm had developed well-defined, upper-level outflow enhanced by diffluence over the system.|$|E

5|$|Debra's origins were <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of {{convection}} {{over the}} western Bahamas and Florida {{related to an}} upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a belt of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
5|$|Ecnomiohyla rabborum is {{classified}} under the genus Ecnomiohyla of the treefrog subfamily Hylinae, family Hylidae. It was first described in 2008 {{by a team}} of herpetologists consisting of Joseph R. Mendelson III, Jay M. Savage, Edgardo Griffith, Heidi Ross, Brian Kubicki, and Ronald Gagliardo. During its discovery in 2005, it was initially misidentified by the team as Ecnomiohyla fimbrimembra, but Kubicki recognized it as a new species. The type specimens were raised in captivity. They were obtained from tadpoles collected by Griffith and Ross <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> near El Valle de Antón, Coclé, Panama on July 15, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Bob {{was one of}} the costliest {{hurricane}}s in New England history. The second named {{storm and}} first hurricane of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season, Bob developed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure near The Bahamas on August 16. The depression steadily intensified, and became Tropical Storm Bob late on August 16. Bob curved north-northwestward as a tropical storm, but re-curved to the north-northeast after becoming a hurricane on August 17. As such, it brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on August 18 and August 19, and subsequently intensified into a major hurricane (Category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). After peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h), Bob weakened slightly as it approached the coast of New England.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emilia was, at the time, {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on {{record in the}} Central Pacific Ocean, and the first of such to be classified as a Category5 hurricane– the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. However, hurricanes Gilma later that year and Ioke in 2006 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. The fifth named storm and {{the first of three}} Category 5hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Faith {{reached the}} northernmost {{latitude}} {{and had the}} longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and {{the west coast of}} Africa on August21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August23. About 42hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105mph (165km/h), before weakening slightly on August26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Florence was {{the third}} of four named {{tropical}} cyclones to make landfall on the United States during the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventh tropical storm and second hurricane of the season, Florence developed on September 7 <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of convection associated with a dissipating frontal trough in the southern Gulf of Mexico. After initially moving eastward, the storm turned northward and strengthened. Florence reached hurricane status and later peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) on September 9 shortly before striking southeastern Louisiana. The storm rapidly weakened over land and dissipated on September 11 over northeastern Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frank was {{the last}} of three {{hurricane}}s in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, which set a record low within modern day records for the basin. It formed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of thunderstorms from the Caribbean Sea, and became Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 21 while located just south of the Mexican Coast. It moved northwest, and became Tropical Storm Frank only 12 hours after it was declared a depression. It strengthened to its initial peak as a moderate tropical storm, and weakened due to increasing wind shear late on the August 23. It later recovered, and became a hurricane on August 25. After peaking as a strong Category 1 hurricane, it rapidly weakened, and dissipated on August 28. Although Frank never made landfall, it did impact western Mexico. A total of six people were killed with over 800,000 people affected.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Iselle was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall on the Big Island of Hawaii in recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the annual hurricane season, Iselle developed <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of disturbed weather southwest of Mexico on July31, 2014. Assuming a west-northwest course that it would maintain throughout its existence, generally favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for gradual strengthening, with the cyclone attaining hurricane status a day after formation. Continued strengthening progressed for several days up until August4, when Iselle reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg), making it a Category4hurricane. Thereafter, Iselle encountered hostile environmental conditions and quickly weakened before making landfall on the Big Island on August8 as a moderate tropical storm. Its passage over the island disrupted the cyclone, and Iselle later dissipated on August9.|$|E
