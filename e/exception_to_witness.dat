500|$|Lord Hope {{said that}} there was [...] "a {{formidable}} body of authority which should not be lightly disregarded" [...] in favour of the immunity. He emphasised that the rule was not there to protect the incompetent expert witness, but ensure that witnesses were not deterred from coming forward and giving evidence without facing allegations afterwards in attempt to obtain damages from them. He was concerned by the lack of evidence either way as <b>to</b> whether an <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the rule in Watson was needed or the consequences of introducing such an exception, particularly as the effect of the decision of the majority was to remove the immunity with retrospective effect, and there was [...] "no way back" [...] from this without legislation. The [...] "need for certainty" [...] made it necessary to extend the rule <b>to</b> all <b>witnesses,</b> in his view, even though some genuine claims may be barred as a result. He was particularly concerned that an [...] "incautious" [...] removal of the immunity from experts [...] "risks destabilising the protection that is given <b>to</b> <b>witnesses</b> generally", adding that the approach of Lord Phillips contained [...] "seeds...for challenging the whole concept of witness immunity." ...|$|R

The health care sector is no <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the inter-organizational dynamic imperatives driven with ICT innovative advances. This article proposes a conceptual model of symbiotic e-health networks in a meta-cultural domain that goes beyond the realm of extant literature on dyadic relationships. The model dimensions are posited on a key informant approach and content analysis of the strategic perceptions of international ICT and health care executives interacting through dyadic partnerships. The findings and implications of the study for the model and further information management research are underscored. The underlying meta-cultural frame is characterized by public governance values and the article explores its perceived role in sustaining symbiotic e-health networks in Canada and Sweden...|$|R
