5|$|Ectomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, A.muscaria is the fungal {{equivalent of a}} weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing <b>it</b> <b>near</b> Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.|$|E

5|$|In all {{versions}} of the tale, after marrying Gautama, Ahalya settles into his ashram (hermitage), which generally becomes the site of her epic curse. The Ramayana records that Gautama's ashram is in a forest (Mithila-upavana) near Mithila, where the couple practices asceticism together for several years. In other scriptures, the ashram is usually near the river bank. The Brahma Purana {{says that it is}} near the river Godavari and the Skanda Purana (701–1200 CE) places <b>it</b> <b>near</b> the river Narmada.

5|$|After Iris {{strengthened}} into a hurricane, {{it turned}} to the west-southwest due to interaction with Hurricane Humberto. An upper-level low north of Puerto Rico increased wind shear over the hurricane, which dislocated the center from the deep convection. As a result, Iris weakened to tropical storm status on August24 after being a hurricane for about 24hours. As the storm approached the Lesser Antilles, the thunderstorms decreased markedly and the cloud pattern became disorganized. As late as August25, there was uncertainty whether Iris would continue toward the islands or turn to the north. A new circulation became the dominant center as the storm continued westward, and Iris brushed Saint Lucia early on August26. An approaching trough turned the storm to the northwest, bringing <b>it</b> <b>near</b> most of the Lesser Antilles. Early on August27, Iris weakened to an intensity of , although it immediately began restrengthening. Later that day, the center made landfall on Montserrat, Anguilla, and Barbuda with winds of over 60mph (95km/h). By that time, an eye began reforming, and the structure became better organized as wind shear decreased.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew <b>it</b> <b>near</b> the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E

5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from <b>it</b> <b>near</b> Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Julian's ex-wife Rebecca Hotchkiss {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. T. C. proposes to Liz, but she becomes increasingly paranoid over his romantic feelings for Eve. Liz attempts to force Julian {{to have sex with}} her {{in the middle of an}} earthquake and tsunami, and stabs him in the back when he does not comply. At this point, Liz lies to Julian by saying that he had raped her in the past. T. C. later breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex-wife's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into his life. On the eve of Eve's trial, Liz offers her adoptive sister a deal: she will rescind her accusation and not testify if Eve promises to leave Harmony forever. Eve considers the deal before ultimately refusing <b>it.</b> <b>Near</b> the end of Eve's trial, Julian agrees to give Rebecca anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison. Tabitha Lenox's daughter Endora Lenox magically casts the jury into a fake flashback, matching Rebecca's testimony, and the judge declares a mistrial.|$|E

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury <b>it</b> <b>near</b> their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and is without electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked <b>it</b> <b>near</b> Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E

5|$|The 1948 Bermuda {{hurricane}} (Air Weather Service designation: Dog) was {{an intense}} and long-lived Cape Verde-type tropical cyclone that wrought significant damage to Bermuda {{and areas of}} Newfoundland in September1948. The storm was the eighth named storm and third hurricane of the annual hurricane season. Originating as a tropical wave {{off the coast of}} Africa on September4, the cyclone tracked a general westward path for much of its initial stages as it gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity shortly after development and then hurricane intensity a day later. After reaching a longitude roughly equal to that of the Lesser Antilles, the hurricane began to curve northward on a parabolic track, bringing <b>it</b> <b>near</b> Bermuda at peak intensity as a Category4hurricane on September13. Afterwards, the hurricane began to accelerate northeastwards and weaken. The waning tropical cyclone grazed Cape Race before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September15; these remnants persisted for an additional day.|$|E

The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from <b>it.</b> <b>Near</b> the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|The river {{crossing}} remained secret until Hungarian envoys, who {{were attempting to}} negotiate a peace, informed the Grand Master. As soon as Ulrich von Jungingen grasped the Polish–Lithuanian intentions, he left 3,000 men at Schwetz (Świecie) under Heinrich von Plauen and marched the main force to organize a line of defense on the Drewenz River (Drwęca) near Kauernik (Kurzętnik). The {{river crossing}} was fortified with stockades. On 11 July, after meeting with his eight-member war council, Władysław II Jagiełło decided against crossing the river at such a strong, defensible position. The army would instead bypass the river crossing by turning east, towards its sources, where no other major rivers separated his army from Marienburg. The march continued east towards Soldau (Działdowo), although no {{attempt was made to}} capture the town. The Teutonic army followed the Drewenz River north, crossed <b>it</b> <b>near</b> Löbau (Lubawa) and then moved east in parallel with the Polish–Lithuanian army. According to the Order propaganda the latter ravaged the village of Gilgenburg (Dąbrówno). Later, in the self-serving testimonies of the survivors before the Pope the Order claimed that Von Jungingen was so enraged by the alleged atrocities that he swore to defeat the invaders in battle.|$|E
