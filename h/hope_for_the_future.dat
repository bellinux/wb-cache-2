5|$|It is now February, 1967. Don (Jon Hamm) {{discovers that}} Lane (Jared Harris) stole {{money from the}} company and fires him. Sally's (Kiernan Shipka) {{childhood}} {{comes to an end}} while she has a rendezvous with former neighbor Glen Bishop (Marten Weiner). After Don expresses a yearning for more, Roger (John Slattery) gets him a meeting with Dow Chemical, a client that could shape the future of the company.

5|$|His first 13 {{games for}} the club yielded 12 goals, and he was rewarded with an England Under-21 debut against San Marino in November 1993, in which he scored England's opening goal in the third minute. Fowler was unable to sustain his goal-a-game ratio {{throughout}} the season, but finished his first season as the club's leading scorer with 18 goals in all competitions, although Ian Rush had scored more goals in the league. It was, however, a disappointing season for Liverpool, as they finished eighth in the Premier League without making any impact {{in any of the}} major competitions, though the departure of Graeme Souness as manager and the appointment of Roy Evans as successor built up <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E
5|$|Christopher Nolan reprised {{his duties}} as director, and brought his brother, Jonathan, to co-write {{the script for}} the second installment. The Dark Knight {{featured}} Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face. Principal photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November. Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong. On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died from a bad combination of prescription medication. Warner Bros. had created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger's death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign. The film depicts Gotham attempting to rebuild after Batman's actions have caused so much damage to its organised crime families, aided by the prosecution of charismatic District Attorney Harvey Dent, but {{the involvement of the}} anarchic Joker threatens everything, as his actions lead to the death of Rachel Dawes and Harvey being scarred and transformed into Two-Face. Although Batman is able to stop the Joker from forcing two ferries- one loaded with civilians and the other with prisoners- to destroy each other, he is forced to take the blame for the murders committed by Dent to ensure that the city retains its <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E

25|$|The 1978 {{season was}} another losing campaign, {{but it was}} {{highlighted}} {{by the presence of}} rookie quarterback Doug Williams. Despite a season-ending injury in which his mouth had to be wired shut, he showed enough potential to give Bucs fans <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> His leadership and often electrifying play would transform the team much sooner than anyone expected. Injuries led to a 5-11 record, {{but for the first time}} the Buccaneers began to resemble a real team.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapists}} {{have conducted}} studies {{to understand why}} some cancer patients turned to art making as a coping mechanism and a tool to creating a positive identity outside of being a cancer patient.

25|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Cold war, the Western policies changed as it became evident that a return to operation of the West German industry was needed not only for the restoration of the whole European economy but also for the rearmament of West Germany as an ally against the Soviet Union. On 6 September 1946 United States Secretary of State, James F. Byrnes made the famous speech Restatement of Policy on Germany, also known as the Stuttgart speech, where he amongst other things repudiated the Morgenthau plan-influenced policies and gave the West Germans <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Reports such as The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria helped to show the U.S. public how bad the situation in Germany really was.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{children}} forced into begging primarily receive little to no education, with upwards of sixteen hours a day dedicated to time on the streets. With education being a leading method in escaping poverty child beggars {{have been shown to}} engage in a cyclical process of continuing this practice cross-generationally. Interviews conducted by UNICEF show that children who beg have little <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and do not believe their circumstances will improve. Children who work on the streets typically have little or no knowledge of their rights, leaving them especially susceptible to exploitation both as juveniles and later as adults. Children who beg have also been found by UNICEF to have much higher instances of HIV-infection due to lack of awareness and supervision on the streets.|$|E

500|$|In June 1999, Time {{magazine}} {{published a}} special edition titled [...] "". Anne Frank was selected {{as one of the}} [...] "Heroes & Icons", and the writer, Roger Rosenblatt, described her legacy with the comment, [...] "The passions the book ignites suggest that everyone owns Anne Frank, that she has risen above the Holocaust, Judaism, girlhood and even goodness and become a totemic figure of the modern world—the moral individual mind beset by the machinery of destruction, insisting on the right to live and question and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of human beings." [...] He notes that while her courage and pragmatism are admired, her ability to analyse herself and the quality of her writing are the key components of her appeal. He writes, [...] "The reason for her immortality was basically literary. She was an extraordinarily good writer, for any age, and the quality of her work seemed a direct result of a ruthlessly honest disposition." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Jacques-Belletête {{acted as}} the game's art director, being {{in charge of}} {{creating}} its look. The two key visual themes were the Icarus myth and the artwork of the Renaissance: both were woven in on a narrative and visual level. In terms of colors, the team drew inspiration from notable Renaissance artists, including Johannes Vermeer and Rembrandt. The color scheme was dominated by black and gold: black represented the game's dystopian aspects, while the gold both humanity and <b>hope</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The Renaissance styling originally permeated everything, but they were ending up with crates looking like baroque furniture, so they toned it down and blended it with modern and cyberpunk elements. During development, the team coined the term [...] "cyber-renaissance" [...] to define their blending of Renaissance styling, cyberpunk elements, and the Icarus myth. An extensive amount of concept art was created for the game: while the majority was handled by artists Richard Dumont and Eric Gagnon, other contributors included Jim Murray, Brian Dugan, Theirry Doizon, Trong Nguyen and Sébastien Larroudé.|$|E
