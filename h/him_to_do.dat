5|$|In 1933, King Features {{assigned}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the art for an espionage action-adventure strip, Secret Agent X-9, scripted by novelist Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond's illustrative {{approach to}} that strip made him King Features' leading talent.|$|E

5|$|State Democratic Party leaders accused Daniels and the Republicans {{of passing}} {{controversial}} legislation only to enhance Daniels' image {{so he could}} seek the presidency. Daniels, however, denied the charges, saying he would have enacted the same agenda years earlier had the then-Democratic majority permitted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

5|$|David Childs, one of Silverstein's {{favorite}} architects, {{joined the}} project after Silverstein urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. He developed a design proposal for One World Trade Center, initially collaborating with Daniel Libeskind. In May 2005, Childs revised the design to address security concerns. He is {{the architect of}} the tower, and is responsible for overseeing its day-to-day design and development.|$|E
5|$|On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates {{posted a}} video of himself on Facebook {{in which he is}} seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg {{challenged}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{commander}} Sulzbach made {{a tactical}} error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein {{before they could}} join up, even though his generals urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king {{that he could not}} guarantee that he would hold the city.|$|E

5|$|A {{virtually}} unknown work by Gaudí is the Casa Clapés (1899–1900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, {{commissioned by the}} painter Aleix Clapés, who collaborated on occasion with Gaudí, such as in decorating the Palau Güell and the Casa Milà. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies. Due to its lack of decoration or original structural solutions its authorship was unknown until 1976, when the architect's signed plans by Gaudí were discovered. In 1900, he renovated the house of Dr. Pere Santaló, at 32 Carrer Nou de la Rambla, a work of equally low importance. Santaló {{was a friend of}} Gaudí's, whom he accompanied during his stay in Puigcerdà in 1911.It was he who recommended <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> manual work for his rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|According to Gary Oldman, {{very little}} was written about Oswald in the script. Stone gave him several plane tickets, {{a list of}} contacts, and told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his own research. Oldman met with Oswald's wife, Marina, and her two daughters {{to prepare for the}} role. Beata Poźniak studied 26 volumes of the Warren Report and spent time living with Marina Oswald. Since the script {{contained}} few lines for the Oswalds, Poźniak interviewed acquaintances of the Oswalds in order to improvise her scenes with Gary Oldman.|$|E

5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches to claim a Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E

50|$|Michael Barry is {{the lead}} singer and {{harmonica}} player of Stormcellar. Prior to pursuing music, Michael studied at the School Of Visual Arts in Gore Hill, Sydney and film editing and script writing at TAFE. Around this time, Michael Barry began taking harmonica lessons from the legendary Jim Conway (The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band/ Backsliders), which led <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> gigs with acoustic trio Motherboard Blues. Whilst jamming at The Empire Hotel in Leichhardt, Sydney, Barry met Paul Read and joined with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make the first Stormcellar album in 2007.|$|R
5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
5|$|Finally, she {{rebels and}} leaves, {{making her way}} into town. There she watches the act of another street entertainer, Il Matto ("The Fool"), a talented high wire artist and clown (Richard Basehart). When Zampanò finds her there, he {{forcibly}} takes her back. They join a ragtag travelling circus where Il Matto already works. Il Matto teases the strongman at every opportunity, though he cannot explain what motivates <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. After Il Matto drenches Zampanò with a pail of water, Zampanò chases after his tormentor with his knife drawn. As a result, he is briefly jailed and both men are eventually fired from the travelling circus.|$|E

5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film. He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and {{was impressed by the}} latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed to shoot the film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels and Himmler {{were far}} more antisemitic than Göring, who mainly adopted that {{attitude}} because party politics required <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews. He required the registration of all Jewish property {{as part of the}} Four Year Plan, and at a meeting held after Kristallnacht was livid that the financial burden for the Jewish losses would have to be made good by German-owned insurance companies. He proposed that the Jews be fined one billion marks.|$|E

Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted from the sky. After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle.|$|E
