5|$|Minority Report also {{continues}} Spielberg's {{tradition of}} depicting broken families.*Vest. pg. 136 In Dick's short story, Anderton is a childless, married man whose main motives are self-preservation and preventing the disassembly of the PreCrime division. While {{he is also}} trying to save himself in the movie, his greater concern is uncovering the story behind his son's disappearance. Spielberg would later transform his next science fiction film, War of the Worlds, from a story about a single man to one about a divorced father concerned with protecting his children. Buckland notes that the two tragic parent-child relationships in the picture (Agatha and Ann Lively, John and Sean Anderton) have a common element. The movie has four shots of them submerged in water. Agatha's face is shown in a close up shot, taken from directly above her, when she is submerged in her photon milk, nutrient bath. When photos of her mother's submerged corpse are shown to her, the emphasized photograph is a similar image of her face taken from directly above. Anderton and his son are shown together in a pool flashback scene in which they have a contest to see who can hold their breath longest. John is underwater when <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> taken, and later in the apartment he is shown lying motionless, immersed in a filled bathtub, in a manner Buckland finds similar to the shots of Agatha and Ann. Buckland notes that co-screenwriter Frank introduced the water theme, as he wrote Agatha and her mother's back stories while adding the bathtub scene.|$|E

It was transferred to canvas after Goya's death and has since been held in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the command}} module, Christopher's son {{remotely}} activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit in Obesandjo's base, {{using it to}} kill Obesandjo and his men. Wikus takes control of the battle suit and rescues Christopher, who promises to return in three years with the cure. Wikus kills all the attacking soldiers before Venter cripples the suit, which ejects Wikus. As he corners a heavily injured Wikus, a group of aliens protect Wikus and kill Venter by tearing him apart. The command module with Christopher and <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> lifted into the mothership, which they use to leave Earth, and Johannesburg's residents celebrate the alien ship's departure.|$|E
25|$|This Bible, {{as indeed}} all the picture Bibles of the Middle Ages, {{did not contain}} {{the full text of}} the Bible, and {{contained}} much original commentary. Short passages only were cited, and these not so as to give any continuous sense or line of thought. But the object of the writer seems to have been chiefly to make the texts cited the basis of moral and allegorical teaching, in the manner so common in those days. In the Psalter he was content with copying out the first verse of each psalm; whilst when dealing with the Gospels he did not quote from each evangelist separately, but made use of a kind of confused diatessaron of all four combined. An attempt was made to establish a connection between the events recorded in the Old Testament and those recorded in the New, even when there {{does not seem to be}} any very obvious connection between them. Thus the sleep of Adam, recorded in the beginning of Genesis, is said to prefigure the death of Christ; and Abraham sending his servant with rich presents to seek a wife for <b>his</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> a type of the Eternal Father giving the Gospels to the Apostles to prepare the union of His Son with the Church.|$|E
