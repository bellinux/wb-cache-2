This paper analyzes Heart of Darkness from this new ecological scope by exploring the implied human-nature dichotomy and the resultant impact on both sides.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study focused on}} the entrepreneurial culture of 100 faculty at five private, religiously affiliated institutions with strong teaching missions. The departments that {{participated in the study}} were biology, chemistry, economics and sociology. These departments were chosen due to the opportunities present in these specific disciplines for entrepreneurial activity. ^ There is minimal {{research in the area of}} faculty entrepreneurial activity. This study offers a foundation to begin to understand the faculty entrepreneurial culture. This study provides three primary findings: faculty reaction to the term entrepreneur in relationship to the work of faculty; distinguishing characteristics associated with faculty entrepreneurs; and institutional policies most important to faculty entrepreneurs. ^ The term entrepreneur in relationship to faculty activity denoted negative images for most faculty. Faculty bristled at the idea of being an entrepreneur. Faculty believed that the term entrepreneur shook the very fiber of what it meant to be an academician. ^ The key finding of this study reveals that the faculty entrepreneurs possess common distinguishing characteristics and can be grouped into three distinct categories: Fund Seekers, Experts for Hire, and Faculty Visionaries. Fund Seekers secured external funding through sponsored research grants from federal agencies and/or private foundations. The common characteristics of Fund Seekers included persistence, <b>exceptional</b> <b>writing</b> skills, and attention to detail. Experts for Hire participated in consulting opportunities, expert witness testimony, paid seminars, and contracted papers. The key characteristics cited for this type of faculty entrepreneur were strong communications skills and an ability to build and cultivate relationships. Faculty Visionaries managed research centers or institutes, assisted in start up companies, and/or secured patents. Faculty Visionaries were creative, politically savvy, and trail blazers. ^ A review of institutional policies demonstrated that the policies of central importance to faculty entrepreneurs included indirect cost recovery rates and teaching loads. ^ This study provides a solid foundation to understand a rapidly growing phenomenon among faculty and within institutions, as well as provides direction as how to best stay on the cutting edge of the fast moving future of higher education. This study combined with future studies will form a more vivid picture of the entrepreneurial landscape. ...|$|E
40|$|Maditsi {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} authors in Sepedi literature. He has written various texts, including poetry, short stories and a novelette. He won the first award of the Samuel E Mqhayi prize awarded by the Suid -Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns in 1971, with his poetry book Monamolomo bolela monatsebe o tlo go kwa. His <b>exceptional</b> <b>writing</b> proficiency have been recognised by a scholar such as Thobakgale (1996 : 6), who writes: (Maditsi) could be called the leading author of the development of Sepedi short stories, because his short stories, namely Mogologolo (1970), Monyane (1974) and Dipheko (1985) are of high standard as compared to the initial ones as they have raised the standard of Sepedi short stories. The aim of this dissertation is to analyse Maditsi’ s short story ‘Pheko ya pula’ from the anthology Dipheko, as a traditional short story, with special reference to two levels, namely content and plot. When analysing ‘Pheko ya pula’, two strategies have been chosen, namely ‘to define’and ‘to intepret’. The reason is because in this research there are terms such as journey, patronage, etc, that require definition, as well as ideas (characters, events, design, title, theme, topic, technique, conflict and others) that require interpretation and are related to the topic. Furthermore, the model used in this investigation was the adapted narratological model developed by Groenewald (1993) and Mojalefa (1997). This model differ from older models developed by narratologists such as Genette (1980) and Strachan (1988), because it emphasizes that when one discusses content, topic is important. When plot structure is examined, theme is highlighted, and when style is investigated, atmosphere plays a very important role. With regard to the content level, it was revealed that content consists of four elements, namely characters, events, time and place. Furthermore, it was also discovered that characters are subdivided into two categories, namely main and minor characters. These major characters are kind- hearted person and quarrelsome person and they are described according to the following index: intention, patronage, resistance, assistance and patronised. In the short story ‘Pheko ya pula’, the kind-hearted person is Potego, while the quarrelsome person is Mathoma, because he opposes Potego’s kindness. If this text is read and studied intensively the reader realises that the assistance of the quarrelsome person, Mathoma is the resistance of the kind-hearted person, Potego, and vice versa. Events can be classified into two categories, namely essential and other events. The essential events are further subdivided into three categories, namely first, middle and last events. The concept of time at the content level is explained in terms of three categories, namely narratological time, historical time and indefinite time. Place is divided into two categories: the physical place where events occur and indefinite place. In analysing plot structure, three elements are important, namely theme, design and title, because theme links the events of the plot of ‘Pheko ya pula’. Title plays a significant role in distinguishing the name of the literary text and design identifies the type of literary work. Four phases of plot, namely exposition, development, climax and denouement, have also been examined as pillars of the literary text. In the exposition phase, the first conflict (local witchdoctors refused to find the rain charm for the Puding community) is discussed in terms of the following techniques: contrast, foreshadowing, naming, focus, repetition and others. Sequence of events, flashback, symbol and other techniques were used in the development. In the climax, the author used cycle, repetition and other techniques, while in the denouement he used flashback and foreshadowing. In conclusion, this research has also examined the way Maditsi has used the journey as a technique in Sepedi literature, because ‘Pheko ya pula’ is based on a journey from the beginning to the end. The author has used this important technique with consummate skill. Dissertation (MA) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008. African Languagesunrestricte...|$|E
50|$|The {{collapse}} of the property boom led to <b>exceptional</b> <b>write</b> offs of more than £100 million in 1991 and 1992. At the same time, few {{in the construction industry}} were making substantial profits. Gradually, Taylor Woodrow’s construction business was reduced in size and the emphasis of the group was redirected to private housing - both in the United Kingdom and North America. In March 1994, Taywood Homes was strengthened, by the acquisition of Heron Homes taking its sales to an annual rate of 1,000, while overseas the success of its United States and Canadian subsidiaries gave the group an extra 2,000 a year sales. By the end of the 1990s, Taylor Woodrow was describing itself as an international housing and property group. The last major civil engineering contract had been as part of the Channel Tunnel consortium (completed in 1994) and although there were still substantial building contracts, including the National Assembly for Wales (2006), construction was on the way out. In September 2008, Taylor Woodrow finally exited the construction market by selling Taylor Woodrow Construction to Vinci.In January 2001, Taylor Woodrow intervened in the proposed merger of Bryant-Beazer, buying Bryant for £632 million in cash and shares. Adding Bryant's annual sales of 4,000 to Taywood's 2,000 immediately elevated Taylor Woodrow to one of the United Kingdom's top five housebuilders. Taywood's housing was relocated to Bryant's Birmingham office, and rebranded under the Bryant name. Two years later the housing business was again enlarged, this time by the acquisition of Wilson Connolly, taking output to approaching 10,000 units a year.|$|R
