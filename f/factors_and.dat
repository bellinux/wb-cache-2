Epidermal growth factor-related growth factors are important modulators of gastric homeostasis in normal and damaged gastrointestinal mucosa. To evaluate expression of heparin binding epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin in antral mucosa of Helicobacter pylori-infected and non-infected dyspeptic patients and to correlate levels of heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin mRNA with mitogenic activity of gastric epithelial cells. A total of 10 Helicobacter pylori-infected and 15 Helicobacter pylori non-infected (10 with and 5 without gastritis) dyspeptic patients were studied. Diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection was based on rapid urease test and histology. Heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin mRNA expression in antral mucosa were assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression and localization of both peptides were determined by immunohistochemistry. Mitogenic activity of antral gastric mucosa was assessed by determination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index by immunohistochemistry. Heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin mRNA expression increased in Helicobacter pylori-infected vs Helicobacter pylori non-infected patients. Heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin immunostaining was more intense and deeper in gastric gland compartment in infected mucosa than in non-infected mucosa. Increase in heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin mRNA expression significantly correlated with increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen labelling index. Helicobacter pylori gastritis is associated with up-regulation of heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin which correlates with increased mitogenic activity of gastric mucosa. Increased heparin binding-epidermal growth <b>factor</b> <b>and</b> amphiregulin expression is postulated to contribute to reparative response of gastric mucosa to Helicobacter pylori infection...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion <b>factors)</b> <b>and</b> desiccated.|$|E
