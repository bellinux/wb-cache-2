50|$|In {{addition}} to business, Mr. Lachman {{was an avid}} and nationally ranked polo player. In 1980, he founded the Perkins Shearer/Denver Symphony Annual Polo Cup in connection with his tenure {{as a member of}} the Board of Trustees of the Denver Symphony Orchestra. Lachman organized and played in what originated as a single match and grew into an annual tournament that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the Denver Symphony Orchestra. Unbeknownst to its current organizers, this event grew into what is now called the Denver Polo Classic, a major fundraiser for children's’ charities.http://www.denverpolo.org Lachman maintains solid ties to Duke University, having served on several of the Advisory Boards, including the Board of Visitors of the Duke University Medical Center, the Duke <b>Heart</b> <b>Board,</b> and the Duke Eye Center http://www.dukemedicine.org/news_and_publications/publications/index/chancellorsreport20052006.pdf/file?cachestamp=1222091447591. He combines his involvement with Duke and his teaching background with Johns Hopkins 2000 - 2006 by providing college counseling to foreign students wishing to attend university in the United States. Gary is currently continuing his support of classical music by serving on the Board of Trustees of The Palm Beach Symphony.|$|E

Gustoća jasenovine u apsolutno suhom stanju signifikantno je manja od gustoće recentne. Ista je pojava uočena i kod utezanja u radijalnom i tangencijalnom smjeru i također volumnog utezanja. Istraživana mehanička svojstava: čvrstoće na tlak u longitudinalnom smjeru, statič ke čvrstoće na savijanje, tvrdoće u longitudinalnom, radijalnom i tangencijalnom smjeru toplinski obrađene jasenovine, također su signifikantno manja od recentne. Obrada jasenovine na visokoj temperaturi polučila je drvo veće dimenzionalne stabilnosti, odnosno manjih veličina linearnih i volumnog utezanja, ali manjih mehaničkih svojstava jasenovine. The aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{differences}} in some physical and mechanical properties of heat treated and recent wood. Wood used in this research was ash (Fraxinus excelsiorL.) from the area of Otok, region of Slavonia in Croatia. The felled tree was 85 years old with the diameter at breast height of 53 centimetres. A <b>heart</b> <b>board</b> was made from the tree trunk in the north-south direction, 4 metre long and 6 centimetres thick. The <b>heart</b> <b>board</b> was dried naturally with an average water content of 12 %. The <b>heart</b> <b>board</b> was sawn in four equal parts so that four heart boards were obtained – each 1 metre long. Looking from stump to top of the tree, the first and third heart boards were not heat treated and they were used for establishing the properties of recent ash. From the above four heart boards, samples were made for determining macroscopic, physical and mechanical properties of recent and heat treated ash. Treatment of ash (Fraxinus excelsiorL.) at the temperature of 200 oC caused significant changes of technical properties relatively physical and mechanical properties of the treated wood. Maximum possible number of samples was made for each physical and mechanical property in radial direction, i. e. from heart to bark. Maximum shrinkage was determined in radial and tangential direction, as well as maximum volume shrinkage, density in absolutely dry condition, nominal density and water content after a fortnight of soaking in water of physical properties. Determination was also made of compression strength parallel to the grain, static bending strength, hardness in longitudinal, radial and tangential direction. The investigation of some physical and mechanical properties of recent ash (Fraxinus excelsiorL.) and heat treated ash at 200 oC show diametrically different values of investigated properties. The investigation of mechanical properties of recent ash was carried out on samples with water content of 12 %, while the water content of the heat treated ash samples was 4 %. In order to be able to compare the results of mechanical properties, their values were converted to the water content of 4 % for recent ash and 12 % for heat treated ash. For increasing or decreasing mechanical properties of wood, correction factor was used in accordance with Forest Product Laboratory, Madison. The comparison of mean values of physical and mechanical properties of recent and heat treated ash was carried out in accordance with Mann-Whitney test with the help of statistical software Statistica. Density distribution in absolutely dry condition in radial direction of heat treated ash deviates from the distribution common for recent ash. The loss of mass with a relatively constant sample volume is evident in radial direction, and especially in the heart section. Mean value of density in absolutely dry condition of recent ash is higher by 8. 4 % than density of heat treated ash. Shrinkage in radial and tangential direction and volume shrinkage of recent ash are higher that shrinkage in heat treated ash. Shrinkage in radial direction is higher by 70 %, in tangential direction by 62. 2 % and volume shrinkage by 63. 7 %. All above said physical properties of recent ash are significantly different from physical properties of heat treated ash. The investigated mechanical properties of recent ash are also significantly higher than mechanical properties of heat treated ash. Compression strength in longitudinal direction of recent ash is higher by 36. 8 %, static bending strength is higher by 48 %, hardness in longitudinal direction (cross-cut) is higher by 31. 3 %, hardness in radial direction (tangential cut) is higher by 22. 8 % and hardness in tangential direction (radial cut) is higher by 25. 9 % than the stated mechanical properties of heat treated ash at 200 oC. All investigated mechanical properties of recent ash differ significantly from these properties of heat treated ash. Dimensional stability of ash under such regime of heat treatment resulted in increased dimensional stability, and however the investigated mechanical properties are significantly lower. The above said percentages of higher values of mechanical properties of recent ash than of heat treated ash with water content of 12 % and 4 % indicate that they are similar at 12 % and 4 %. The similarity of these percentages indicates that the correction coefficients for calculating mechanical properties at different water contents is also satisfactory for heat treated ash...|$|E

When the Countess married a French officer, her Hungarian in-laws insisted that the children be returned to Hungary for their schooling. The girls were sent to the Sacred <b>Heart</b> <b>boarding</b> school in Pressbaum, near Vienna. Geraldine´s happy chilhood then passed on the chateau Oponice (present day Slovakia), Apponyi ancestral family possessions in Upper Hungary, which territory then belonged to Czechoslovakia (whose citizenship Geraldine gained and also learnt Slovakian language). She lived there until 1938. Her family's fortune spent, Geraldine earned a living as a shorthand typist.

50|$|McCulloch, a striker, {{began his}} senior career with Third Lanark, whom he joined from junior side Shotts United in 1932. After {{two years at}} Cathkin Park, he was signed by Hearts for £530, moving east {{at the same time}} as his Thirds team-mate John MacKenzie. His first season at Tynecastle was notable, as he scored 38 times (at an average of a goal per game) to top the First Division scoring charts. Such a goal-scoring ratio helped Hearts to both a third-place finish and {{increased}} attendances, although Double-winners Rangers proved too strong in the Scottish Cup semi-finals. Costs incurred by work to improve Tynecastle's facilities and capacity were proving a financial millstone and in November 1935, the <b>Hearts</b> <b>board</b> indicated that certain players were available for transfer. McCulloch was by this stage one of five Scotland players on the club's books, having made his debut against Wales a year earlier, and an obvious transfer target. After numerous expressions of interest from English clubs, McCulloch and international team-mate Alex Massie were sold to offset the debt, McCulloch joining London side Brentford for a club record incoming fee of £6,000.|$|R
