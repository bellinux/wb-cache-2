5|$|Markings have {{a strict}} standard, with {{detailed}} terminology, for showing <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; {{many of those}} found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E

His children's television credits include playing the Abominable No Man in Timmy Mallett's Timmy Towers and presenting Beat the Cyborgs, Name That Toon, On Your Marks, Insides Out, and History Busters, {{the last of}} which won a Royal Television Society Award. Speight also worked on This Morning, The Heaven and Earth Show, The Big Breakfast and was a contestant in ITV's Celebrity Wrestling.

Speight began dating her in 2003, and they became engaged in Barbados in 2005. They planned to get married <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> dress and Speight joked that the wedding might feature monkeys, his favourite animal.|$|E
25|$|France's {{penal code}} forbids any private {{defamation}} {{of a person}} or group for belonging or not belonging, in fact or <b>in</b> <b>fancy,</b> to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or for having a handicap (Article R. 624-3).

25|$|The {{hate speech}} laws in France are matters of both civil law and {{criminal}} law.

25|$|On Boxing Day, {{over the}} years many fans have chosen to attend Wigan Athletic's match <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> dress.

However, on Boxing Day in 2014 a boycott of the club's fixture against Leeds United was ordered by some supporters due to the ticket prices for the match at Elland Road. Around 750 away fans attended the match.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} Saturday in August the town holds its annual Carnival and Show, which attracts {{thousands}} of visitors to the town {{from all over the}} world.

25|$|The May Fair {{is one of}} the few horse fairs now left in the country. The Main Street is sanded {{down and}} given over to horse selling for the day.

Local shops compete for the best dressed window, and children take part <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> dress competitions and the duck race. A May Fair queen is chosen to represent the town over the next year.|$|E
25|$|This {{event was}} started in 2013 by the Saddleworth branch of the Round Table as an {{alternative}} to the prior 'Beer Walk' event which was cancelled in 2011. The beer walk started in 1973. Participants walked around Saddleworth <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> dress, stopping off at pubs. Spectators were encouraged to donate money for charity. It was organised for 39 years, however due to 4,000 (approx) unofficial walkers taking part in the event, in addition to the 2,500 official walkers, the police estimated it would cost £58,000 to stage the walk in 2012. However some people continue to do the walk unofficially.|$|E

25|$|The Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881 {{guarantees}} {{freedom of}} the press, subject to several prohibitions. Article 24 prohibits anyone from publicly inciting another to discriminate against, or to hate or to harm, a person or a group for belonging or not belonging, in fact or <b>in</b> <b>fancy,</b> to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or for having a handicap.

25|$|Geneva celebrates L'Escalade on {{the weekend}} nearest 12 December celebrating {{the defeat of the}} {{surprise}} attack by troops sent by Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Besides festive traditions that includes chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour, Geneva has been organizing 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been very popular amongst racers across all ages. Non-competitive racers have fun by dressing up <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> costumes, while walking in the race. 2015 marks the 38th edition of this race.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the Day of the Dead, overt veneration of Santa Muerte remained clandestine {{until the middle of}} the 20th century. When it went public in sporadic occurrences, reaction was often harsh, and included the desecration of shrines and altars. At the beginning of the 20th century, José Guadalupe Posada created a similar, but secular figure by the name of Catrina, a female skeleton dressed <b>in</b> <b>fancy</b> clothing of the period. José Guadelupe Posada began to evoke the idea that the universality of death generated a fundamental equality amongst man. His paintings of skeletons in daily life and that La Catrina were meant to represent the arbitrary and violent nature of an unequal society.|$|E
