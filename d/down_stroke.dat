25|$|Eurypterus {{belongs to}} the {{suborder}} Eurypterina, eurypterids in which the sixth appendage had developed a broad swimming paddle remarkably {{similar to that of}} the modern-day swimming crab. These appendages could only be moved in near-horizontal planes (i.e. they can not be bent much upwards or downwards). They are generally thought to utilize a rowing type of locomotion. The paddles are almost vertically oriented on the backward and <b>down</b> <b>stroke,</b> pushing the animal forward and lifting it up. They are then oriented horizontally on the recovery stroke to slash through the water without pushing the animal back. This type of swimming is exhibited by crabs and water beetles.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the <b>down</b> <b>stroke</b> of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E

60|$|The unfortunate to {{be punished}} held out his arm at a level with his shoulder, back uppermost. Raising his arm so that the rod fell almost {{straight}} behind his back, Dr. Litter would bring it <b>down,</b> <b>stroke</b> after stroke, with a passionless and mechanical air, but with a sweeping force which did its work thoroughly. Four cuts was the normal number, {{but if it was}} the third time a boy had been sent up during the term he would get six. But four sufficed to swell the back of the hand, and cover it with narrow weals and bruises. It was of course a point of honour that no sound should be uttered during punishment. When it was over the Doctor would throw the broken rod scornfully upon the ground and return to his seat. The Junior then carried it away and placed a fresh one upon the desk.|$|E

50|$|A pole lathe is a wood-turning lathe {{that uses}} a long pole as a return spring for a treadle. Pressing the treadle with your foot pulls on a cord that is wrapped around the piece of wood or billet being turned. The {{other end of the}} cord reaches up {{to the end of a}} long springy pole. As the action is reciprocating, the work rotates in one {{direction}} and then back the other way. Cutting is only carried out on the <b>down</b> <b>stroke</b> of the treadle, the spring of the pole only being sufficient to return the treadle to the raised position ready for the next <b>down</b> <b>stroke.</b> Modern pole lathes often replace the springy pole with an elastic bungee cord.|$|E
40|$|Unlike a helicopter, {{an insect}} can, in theory, use both lift and drag to stay aloft. Here {{we show that}} a {{dragonfly}} uses mostly drag to hover by employing asymmetric up and <b>down</b> <b>strokes.</b> Computations {{of a family of}} strokes further show that using drag can be as efficient as using lift at the low Reynolds number regime appropriate for insects.

50|$|In case of fingerstyle playing {{there is}} a {{technique}} in rasgueado where guitarist play bass, lead, rhythm, beat and vocals all on same guitar. The technique {{is different from that}} of old fingerstyle playing. Here players use there fingers alternating. Thumb (T) alternates on bass and fingers (1,2,3,4) play other part with up and <b>down</b> <b>strokes</b> on required string. Finally, palm gives the matching beat.|$|R
5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), the {{indirect}} muscles occupy the greatest {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke.

Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and <b>down</b> <b>strokes.</b>|$|R

60|$|No {{one knows}} how the horse came down, whether it {{stumbled}} or whether the rat on the off side really got home {{with one of those}} slashing <b>down</b> <b>strokes</b> of the teeth (given with the full weight of the body); and the doctor never discovered that he himself was bitten until he was inside the brickmaker's house, much less did he discover when the bite occurred, though bitten he was and badly--a long slash like the slash of a double tomahawk that had cut two parallel ribbons of flesh from his left shoulder.|$|R

50|$|A {{cambered}} foil can be {{more efficient}} than a symmetrical foil, but a rigid cambered foil is efficient for producing lift in just one direction. The Lunocet uses the water pressure to induce camber in the flexible flukes which are symmetric at rest. The camber is dynamic and changes sides with up and <b>down</b> <b>stroke.</b> The flexibility is mostly at the tips and trailing edge.|$|E

500|$|Townshend {{considered}} himself less technical than guitarists such as Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck {{and wanted to}} stand out visually instead. His playing style evolved from the banjo, favouring <b>down</b> <b>strokes</b> and {{using a combination of}} the plectrum and fingerpicking. His rhythm playing frequently used seventh chords and suspended fourths, and he is associated with the power chord, an easy-to-finger chord built from the root and fifth interval that has since become a fundamental part of the rock guitar vocabulary. [...] Townshend also produced noises by manipulating controls on his guitar and by allowing the instrument to feedback.|$|R
