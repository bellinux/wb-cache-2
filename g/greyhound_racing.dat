5|$|<b>Greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> was {{introduced}} to Belle Vue in 1926, in the UK's first purpose-built greyhound stadium, constructed {{at a cost of}} Â£22,000. It was built on land leased by Belle Vue to the <b>Greyhound</b> <b>Racing</b> Association (GRA), a company chaired by Sir William Gentle, who was also the chairman of Belle Vue (Manchester) Ltd. The site was sold to the GRA in 1937, with the proviso {{that it had to be}} used for <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greyhound and Speedway racing {{also took}} part in the town, using the Albion Rovers FC ground. <b>Greyhound</b> <b>Racing</b> began on 11 December 1931 and lasted until 1986. The Edinburgh Monarchs rode there in 1968-69 (as the Coatbridge Monarchs) after losing their track at Meadowbank Stadium to the {{developers}} for the 1970 Commonwealth Games. Glasgow Tigers moved from Hampden Park to Coatbridge in 1973, and stayed there until June 1977, when they were forced out by the <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the war the {{greyhound}} company introduced floodlights and in 1958 {{the entire}} surface required relaying after the Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing.</b> The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> to nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{racing and}} <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> are both popular in Ireland. There are {{frequent}} horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding {{and training of}} race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs. The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.|$|E
5|$|To {{help pay}} for the upkeep of the site, a {{greyhound}} track was built in 1927. The first meeting was held on 7 April 1928. The Arms Park (Cardiff) <b>Greyhound</b> <b>Racing</b> Company Limited signed a 50-year lease in 1937, with Cardiff Athletic Clubthe owners of the Arms Parkhaving no rights to break the agreement or to review the rental until 50 years expired.|$|E

5|$|Between 1997 {{and early}} 2013, Watford shared Vicarage Road with rugby union side Saracens F.C. The stadium has hosted matches for the England under-21s, and senior {{international}} football between overseas teams. Elton John has also used Vicarage Road as {{a venue for}} concerts: He first played at the stadium in 1974 and returned in 2005 and 2010 to stage fundraising concerts for the club.

5|$|England has {{a strong}} {{sporting}} heritage, and during the 19th century codified many sports that are now played around the world. Sports originating in England include association football, cricket, rugby union, rugby league, tennis, boxing, badminton, squash, rounders, hockey, snooker, billiards, darts, table tennis, bowls, netball, thoroughbred horseracing, <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> and fox hunting. It has helped the development of golf, sailing and Formula One.|$|E

Their predecessor, Manchester Storm, went out of business in 2002 because of financial problems that led to them being unable to pay players' wages or the rent for the Manchester Arena in which they played.|$|E

5|$|The site {{is owned}} by Cardiff Athletic Club and has been host to many sports, apart from rugby union and cricket; they include athletics, {{association}} football, <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing,</b> tennis, British baseball and boxing. The site also has a bowling green {{to the north of}} the rugby ground, which is used by Cardiff Athletic Bowls Club, which is the bowls section of the Cardiff Athletic Club. The National Stadium also hosted many music concerts including Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Bon Jovi, The Rolling Stones and U2.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contests}} between {{animals are}} now regarded as sports for example, horse racing {{is regarded as}} both a sport and {{an important source of}} entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like cockroaches.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{activities}} that became synonymous with Belle Vue was speedway (known {{at the time as}} dirt track racing), which was introduced on 28 July 1928 in the recently built <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> arena. The sport proved to be very popular, and the decision was taken to convert the 1887 athletics ground into a speedway stadium, which opened on 23 March 1929. It was at the time the largest purpose-built speedway stadium in the country, possibly in the world. Eventually it became the first home of the Belle Vue Aces, but it was also used for many other events, such as football, cricket, rugby league (Belle Vue Rangers), baseball, stock car racing and tennis. The stadium had covered accommodation for 40,000spectators. As the speedway bikes ran on wood alcohol (known as dope), they were unaffected by fuel rationing during the Second World War and racing was able to continue, although many other attractions in the gardens were forced to close.|$|E

5|$|After the viaduct {{the road}} becomes Southend Road, passing north of Walthamstow, and {{immediately}} before the Crooked Billet junction, the former site of Walthamstow <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> track. It continues eastward, cutting through a southern section of Epping Forest and meeting the Woodford New Road at Waterworks Corner, before an elevated junction with the M11 motorway and Southend Road heading to Gants Hill. The South Woodford to Barking Relief Road (the section between the M11 and A13) opened in 1987. Previously, the A406 extended along Southend Road and Woodford Avenue as far east as Gants Hill. The current {{route of the}} North Circular Road turns south, passing Eastern Avenue (A12) on a flyover at the Redbridge roundabout. It passes Romford Road (the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester) {{to the west of}} Ilford and London Road, Barking, and ends at a roundabout with the A13 Newham Way / Alfred's Way in Beckton. To reach the Woolwich Ferry, traffic must follow local roads to the ferry terminal. This leads across the River Thames, connecting with the eastern end of the South Circular Road {{on the other side of}} the river. The junction with the A13 has been built to enable the North Circular to be continued across the junction to the Thames Gateway Bridge if and when it is built.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the border}} with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large {{recreation}} areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution. In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of Â£38,000 to house the 16,000exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating Queen Victoria's 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than sixmonths and was attended by more than 4.75million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also <b>greyhound</b> <b>racing</b> from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all that remains is the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987.|$|E
