500|$|Pierre Pentecôte, {{the militia}} {{character}} played by Carlo Brandt, {{was presented with}} a pitiful look, rather than a caricature villain. [...] Gatlif depicted him as a character with a drooping hat and a few <b>extra</b> <b>pounds</b> to symbolise the fat militia of the period. The orphan, P'tite Claude, was played by Mathias Laliberté. Rufus was chosen by Gatlif {{for the role of}} Fernand because of his typical French looks. Puri Dai, the grandmother, was played by Raya Bielenberg, a Soviet-born Norwegian artist and 2005 recipient of Oslo City art award, who uses music and dance {{in an effort to make}} the Romani culture better known in Norway. Gatlif found her in Oslo. The other notable characters in the movie, Darko, Kako, Chavo, Zanko and Tatane were played by Arben Bajraktaraj, Georges Babluani, Ilijir Selimoski, Kevyn Diana and Thomas Baumgartner respectively. A minor character named Levis was played by then 11-year-old great-grandson of Django Reinhardt, a virtuoso jazz guitarist and composer of Manouche Romani ethnicity. The cast included people of many nationalities, Albanian, Kosovar, Georgian, Serbian, French and Norwegian along with the nine Romani people Gatlif found living in extreme poverty in Transylvania. Arrangements were made for these Romani to stay in France for the three to four months it took to shoot the film.|$|E

2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people want to see me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on <b>extra</b> <b>pounds,</b> Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E
50|$|Hulled or free-threshing {{status is}} {{important}} in traditional classification because the different forms are usually grown separately, and have very different post-harvesting processing.

60|$|Charley mooned over it for {{a couple}} of days; then word was brought to us, as before, that on the next Sunday Demetrios Contos would repeat his performance. Charley roused himself. He had our boat out of the water, cleaned and repainted its bottom, made a trifling {{alteration}} about the centre-board, overhauled the running gear, and sat up nearly all of Saturday night sewing on a new and much larger sail. So large did he make it, in fact, that additional ballast was imperative, and we stowed away nearly five hundred <b>extra</b> <b>pounds</b> of old railroad iron {{in the bottom of the}} boat.|$|E
60|$|And let not {{the reader}} imagine that this {{leadership}} involved {{little or no}} manhood. Northern snow-shoes are about five feet long, and twelve or fifteen inches broad. The netting with which the frames are filled up-- somewhat like {{the bottom of a}} cane chair--allows fine well-frozen snow to fall through it like dust and the traveller, sinking it may be only a few inches in old well-settled-down snow, progresses with ease. But when a heavy fall such as I have described takes place, especially in spring, and the weather grows comparatively warm, the traveller's circumstances change greatly for the worse. The new snow being light permits him to sink deep into it--perhaps eight or ten inches--at every step; being also soft, that which falls upon the shoes cannot pass through the netting, but sticks there, giving him many <b>extra</b> <b>pounds</b> weight to lift as he goes heavily along. Add to this that his thick winter garb becomes oppressive in mild weather, and you will perceive that Macnab's duties as beater of the track were severe.|$|E

He made one successful run under the ship, came back for an <b>extra</b> <b>pound</b> of weight for his next attempt and failed to return from the second dive. Elliott speculated in his autobiography that Crabb suffered equipment failure. Subsequent criticism of Crabb, whom Elliott {{believed to be a}} brave and honourable officer and who had undertaken successful operations of the same kind before, was resented by Elliott.|$|R
6000|$|I parted {{from him}} at The Hague.

He had packed off [...] "Mrs. Horatio Jones" [...] some days before, to the relief, I imagine, of both of them, and he himself continued his journey to Berlin. I never expected to see him again, although {{for the next few}} months I often thought of him, and even tried to discover him by inquiries in the City. I had, however, very little to go upon, and after I had left Fenchurch Street behind me, and drifted into literature, I forgot him.|$|R
500|$|The first {{transfer}} {{for which}} Manchester United (then Newton Heath) {{had to pay}} a fee was the transfer of Gilbert Godsmark from Ashford in January 1900. Manchester United paid Ashford a fee of £40 for Godsmark. The club's first £1,000 transfer came in 1910, when they signed Leslie Hofton from Glossop. When the club signed Tommy Taylor from Barnsley in 1953, the fee {{was intended to be}} £30,000. However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the [...] "£30,000 man" [...] tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by £1 to £29,999. Busby then took the <b>extra</b> <b>pound</b> from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There has heen much {{discussion}} centred {{on the decline}} ofthe specific housing grants in England, Scotland and Wales, and the implications for rent levels et by local housing authorities. In this paper {{it is argued that}} rent incentives provided by the Block Grant have been largely ignored. Data is derived, showing that for some major city housing authorities every <b>extra</b> <b>pound</b> raised in rent income results in more than a <b>pound</b> of <b>extra</b> Block Grant. For some authorities the grant leverage is less, whilst for others it is non-existent. Incentives to raise rents are greatest for city authorities with low rent policies. By such means central government can continue to force rents upwards without taking direct control over rents...|$|R

50|$|Boxing, like {{several other}} {{fighting}} sports, categorizes its competitors into weight classes. Some fighters {{try to take}} advantage of this by dieting before weigh-in so that they can be bumped down a weight class. In extreme cases, a fighter may forego solid food before the official weigh-in ceremony, and eat a lot afterward to compensate. In some very extreme cases, boxers have been forced to stop eating solid food up to three days before the weigh-in ceremony, in order to make weight for the fight. Sometimes, if a boxer doesn't make the weight agreed for on the first weight-in, he or she might go to a sauna or to jog with a jacket to sweat and lose the <b>extra</b> <b>pounds,</b> however this is mainly water that the body holds. After weigh ins, competitors will in general add on weight before the fight, resulting in them weighing anywhere from 5 to 25 lbs above the weight class.|$|E

40|$|The {{evolution}} of intelligence {{began with the}} movement of Crossopterygian fish onto land. The eventual appearance of large dinosaurs eliminated all but the smallest of mammalian creatures, with the survivors forced to move only nocturnally, when enhanced olfactory and aural faculties were favored and involved a larger grey matter/body mass ratio than possessed by the dinosaurs. Additionally, the mammals made comparisons between the inputs of various senses, implying the presence of significant memory capacity {{and an ability to}} abstract survival information. More complex behavior occurred with the advent of tree dwellers (forward-looking eyes), hands, color vision, and the ability to grip and manipulate objects. An <b>extra</b> <b>pound</b> of brain evolved in the human skull in less than a million years. The neural processes that can lead to an action by a creature with a brain are mimicked by the basic AND and OR gates in computers, which are rapidly approaching the circuit density of the human brain.
