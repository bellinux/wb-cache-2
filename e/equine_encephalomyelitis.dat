50|$|Like {{many other}} species of birds, the yellow-crowned night heron is an {{intermediate}} host and amplifier of the eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EEE) virus (sleeping sickness). This common virus in the Southeast of the United States is lethal to horses and can be to humans as well. It is transmitted by mosquitoes: an infected mosquito will transmit the virus to a yellow-crowned night heron, which will be unaffected by it but will host it (the heron {{is known as a}} “reservoir host” for the virus) until another mosquito picks it up from the heron and transmits it to a horse or a human. Because of the distances that the yellow-crowned night heron travels when it migrates, it carries the virus over larger geographical areas, becoming an amplifier of the EEE. However, EEE remains a rare disease which symptoms can be treated, and only a few cases are declared every year.|$|E

40|$|The {{action on}} mice of several {{neurotropic}} viruses was studied {{with reference to}} factors which influence infection. With pseudorabies virus, section of the sciatic nerve with inoculation into the ipsilateral foot pad significantly retarded the speed of infection. The virus ascended other nerves of the leg, but at a slower rate. It {{would appear that the}} number of nerve fibers available for passage may play a rôle in the speed with which infection occurs with this virus. When pseudorabies virus was inoculated into an area of inflammation its effects were markedly lessened. Similar experiments with unmodified <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus which, unlike pseudorabies, does not ascend along local nerves, showed no impedance of infection. Brain trauma did not change the rate of infection with the viruses of St. Louis encephalitis, herpes, or pseudorabies. But intraperitoneal injection of glycerine, followed by intramuscular inoculation of St. Louis virus, resulted in marked facilitation of infection, as already remarked of fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus. This phenomenon did not occur with pseudorabies or herpes. In contrast to certain other viruses, pseudorabies and herpes viruses were only slightly more effective in young mice than in adults. With St. Louis virus, as with fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses, inoculation into the eye or nose was far more effective than other peripheral routes. This was not the case with pseudorabies. Herpes, however, also showed greater sensitivity of the intraocular route. After injection into the eye, St. Louis and fixed <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> viruses invaded the optic pathway, while herpes and pseudorabies avoided the optic fibers and attacked the trigeminal nerve.

40|$|A {{specific}} {{complement fixation}} test can be obtained in various central nervous system virus infections by using as antigens emulsions of infected brain tissue, freezing and thawing the brain emulsion, and then centrifuging it in an angle head centrifuge at 3500 R. P. M. for 1 hour. The method has proved reliable {{in the case of}} rabies, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese B encephalitis, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> Western <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> louping ill, and spontaneous encephalomyelitis of mice (Theiler's disease).

For human sera a temperature of inactivation of 60 °C. also for 20 minutes has been adopted; at this temperature the reaction is in general specific. Complement-fixing antibodies in high titre were found in the sera of rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, and dogs immunized with rabies virus.

40|$|Hydroxylapatite column {{chromatography}} methods {{were developed to}} characterize selected alphavirus populations. Different conditions of pH and phosphate molarity were required to obtain satisfactory elution profiles and separations for Western <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus strains, compared with Eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> virus and Semliki Forest virus strains. Raising the pH of the buffers effected earlier elutions of all viruses. Selection of phosphate gradients with more gentle slopes and adjustment to the proper pH effected better separations of virus subpopulations. Elution profiles were not affected by 0. 85 % NaCl, 10 % fetal calf serum, or 1 % bovine serum albumin, which are common constituents of virus-stabilizing diluents. Passage of Western <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and Semliki Forest viruses in BHK- 21, Vero, or duck embryo cell cultures or in suckling mouse brains did not usually affect elution profiles, unless passage also resulted in {{a shift in the}} plaque size marker. Essentially all infectious virus applied to the column was recoverable in appropriate fractions. This permitted accurate determinations of heterogeneity within alphavirus populations. For Western <b>equine</b> <b>encephalomyelitis</b> large-plaque (LP) and small-plaque (SP) virus populations, it was possible to detect ratios of 1 LP in a population of 106 SP, and 1 SP in 103 LP by using linear phosphate gradients. When stepwise elution procedures were used, it was possible to detect ratios of 1 SP in a population of 105 LP.

40|$|A {{number of}} viruses {{have been studied}} {{following}} inoculation {{into the eyes of}} experimental animals. In general, it has been found that the intraocular inoculation of certain viruses is effective in initiating infection of the central nervous system in susceptible hosts, with or without the production of specific reactions in the ocular tissues.
