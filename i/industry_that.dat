5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E

5|$|Between the 1940s and the 1970s, {{the city}} saw {{significant}} growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service {{in large numbers}} seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, {{a part of the}} local <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the Interstate Highway System allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Belgium possessed two {{colonies in}} Africa—the Belgian Congo, {{which it had}} {{controlled}} since its annexation of the Congo Free State in 1908, and Ruanda-Urundi, a former German colony that had been mandated to Belgium in 1924 by the League of Nations. The Belgian colonial military numbered 18,000 soldiers, {{making it one of}} the largest standing colonial armies in Africa at the time. The Congo underwent an economic boom in the 1920s and mines, plantations, and transportation networks were greatly developed. The Great Depression led to a collapse of commodity prices, undermining the colony's export-based economy and leading to a large reduction in income and employment. The only <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> expanded during the time period was centered around cotton production.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame by publishing a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E

On February 7, 1975, the government released a document outlining Ethiopia's new economic policy, which was explicitly socialist in philosophy and intent. The policy identified three manufacturing areas slated for state involvement: basic <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> produced goods serving other <b>industries</b> and <b>that</b> {{had the capacity}} to create linkages in the economy; <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> produced essential goods for the general population; and <b>industries</b> <b>that</b> made drugs, medicine, tobacco, and beverages.

5|$|In 1886, 5million {{birds were}} {{estimated}} to be killed for their feathers. They were shot usually in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. The plumes, or aigrettes, as they were called in the millinery business, sold for $32 an ounce in 1915— the price of gold. Millinery was a $17million a year <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> motivated plume harvesters to lay in watch of nests of egrets and many colored birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Plumes from Everglades wading birds {{could be found in}} Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to the inability of traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war.

5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would {{lay the groundwork}} for the modern Soviet air force and the <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before these could be enacted, Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered that the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|Over 40% of French {{grape vines}} and {{vineyards}} were devastated over a 15-year period, {{from the late}} 1850s to the mid-1870s. The French economy was badly hit by the blight; many businesses were lost, and wages in the wine industry were cut to less than half. There was also a noticeable trend of migration to, among other places, Algiers and America. The production of cheap raisins and sugar wines caused problems for the domestic <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> threatened to persist even after the blight itself. The damage to the French economy, is estimated to have been slightly over 10billion Francs.|$|E

5|$|The war {{had ended}} before series {{production}} was started, and the Defence Forces {{did not need}} new vehicles. On the contrary, the army had {{to reduce the number}} of vehicles according to the Moscow Armistice. The frustrated component suppliers left the business and the Ministry of Trade and Industry terminated the vehicle supply contract from the end of 1946. In early 1946, Yhteissisu had agreed with the Ministry of Trade and <b>Industry</b> <b>that</b> vehicles not bought by the state could be sold on the civilian market. Sisu S-22s became available for sale at 12 SAT locations in Finland. The company presented a lighter, lower-cost model, the S-22K, at the Helsinki Domestic Industry Fair in May 1946.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> grew up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
