Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 119 - 125. This study investigates a) {{the components}} of motivation that Turkish university EFL students hold, b) their preferences for instructional activities, c) how these two concepts relate to each other, and d) whether the proficiency level affects responses toward motivation and instructional <b>activity</b> <b>types.</b> The study was conducted at Hacettepe University, School of Foreign Languages, with the participation of 343 students from three different proficiency levels (pre-intermediate, intermediate, and upper-intermediate). The data were collected using a 81 -item questionnaire related to motivation and instructional <b>activity</b> <b>types.</b> Factor analysis was conducted for the collected data and the factors found {{formed the basis of}} the scales used in the subsequent analysis. In the motivation section, nine factors were determined which formed the internal structure of motivation. Among these factors, instrumental motivation, which had the highest median score, was found the most important motivation type in this population. The anxiety factor had the lowest median score. In the instructional activity section, four factors were found. While the communicative focus factor had the highest median score, the traditional approach factor had the lowest score. This study also indicated that there is a relationship between preferences for <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> in relation to students’ motivation. In fact, significant correlations were found between almost all motivation styles and communicative and challenging activities. But, the effect sizes of the correlations were not the same with all <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> in each motivation style. Some of the correlations were much stronger than the others. This result shows that even though there was not a clear-cut difference between students’ preferences for <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> in relation to motivational styles, some <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> were favored more than the others in each motivation style. This finding revealed a variation across the groups and thus confirmed this possible link between motivation and instructional <b>activity</b> <b>types.</b> Additionally, the results in this study indicated that there were large differences in motivation and <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> preferences among different language proficiency levels.

Thirty-five older adults performed an activity routine comprised of different activities (5 min/activity) while wearing three ActiGraph GT 3 X+ activity monitors (dominant hip, wrist, and ankle) and a portable metabolic system. Accelerometer and steady-state metabolic data were used to develop artificial neural network, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms (ANNLab, RFLab, and SVMLab) to predict <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> and intensity in older adults using 20 s classification intervals. Classification accuracy of the models in detecting five activity categories ranged from 87 % (ANNLab hip, RFLab hip, and SVMLab hip) to 96 % (SVMLab wrist). The biases and root mean squared errors (RMSE) for predicted METs ranged from - 0. 01 MET (RMSE: 0. 54 MET) for the RFLab wrist algorithm to 0. 02 MET (RMSE: 0. 67 MET) for the ANNLab hip algorithm. Study 2 evaluated the performance of the RFLab and SVMLab algorithms for predicting <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> in free-living conditions. Fifteen participants from Study 1 were observed for 2 - 3 h in their free-living environment while wearing three ActiGraph GT 3 X+ activity monitors (dominant hip, wrist, and ankle). The RFLab and SVMLab - algorithms were applied to hip, wrist, and ankle accelerometer data to classify five activity categories. Direct observation of <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> and duration served as criterion measures to evaluate percent correct classification rates of the algorithms. Correct classification rates ranged from 49 % (SVMLab hip, SVMLab wrist, and RFLab wrist) to 55 % (SVMLab ankle). New RF and SVM algorithms were developed using free-living accelerometer data (RFFL and SVMFL) and different classification intervals were also applied. Correct classification of <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> for the RFFL and SVMFL ranged from 53 % (SVMFL wrist, 5 s classification intervals) to 71 % (SVMFL ankle, 30 s classification intervals). Overall correct classification rates of up to 76 % (RFFL hip and RFFL ankle, 30 s classification intervals) were achieved when classifying only three activity categories. Our machine learning algorithms accurately predict <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> from accelerometer data in older adults under ‘laboratory conditions’ but not in free-living conditions. We were able to improve free-living classification accuracy using algorithms developed under free-living conditions. Further refinement of the algorithms is required for achieving sufficient accuracy in classifying <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> in free-living older adults...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of technology, larger data sets concerning activity travel behavior become available. These data sets often lack semantic interpretation. This implies that annotation in terms of <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> and transportation mode is necessary. This paper aims to infer <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> from GPS traces by developing a decision tree-based model. The model only considers activity start times and activity durations. Based on the decision tree classification, a probability distribution and a point prediction model were constructed. The probability matrix describes the probability of each <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> for each class (i. e. combination of activity start time and activity duration). In each class, the point prediction model selects the <b>activity</b> <b>type</b> that has the highest probability. Two types of data were collected in 2006 and 2007 in Flanders, Belgium, i. e. activity travel data and GPS data. The optimal classification tree constructed comprises 18 leaves. Consequently, 18 if-then rules were derived. An accuracy of 74 % was achieved when training the tree. The accuracy of {{the model for the}} validation set, i. e. 72. 5 %, shows that overfitting is minimal. When applying the model to the test set, the accuracy was almost 76 %. The models indicate the importance of time information in the semantic enrichment process. This study contributes to future data collection in that it enables researchers to directly infer <b>activity</b> <b>types</b> from <b>activity</b> start time and duration information obtained from GPS data. Because no location information is needed, this research can be easily and readily implemented to millions of individual agents. Peer reviewe...|$|R
