40|$|For the {{production}} of the orthophoto map Vernagtferner 1979, scale I: 10000, photographs of the flight "Hintereisferner 1979 " were used, which {{have been found to be}} very suitable for <b>differential</b> <b>rectification.</b> Control points were determined before the flight took place. The processing of nine stereopairs was carried out on an analytical plotter. Simultaneously with the on-line plotting of the contour lines the reference data for the computation of the profiles for the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> were recorded. The orthophoto map was covered by four aerial photographs. A smooth data transfer was ensured because the same computer was used for the data acquisition and the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification.</b> Two printing originals were prepared, one for the outline drawings with contour lines and another for the orthophoto. The print was done in black for the two copies. The data acquisition, the computation of the scanning profiles for the othoprojector and the procedure of the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> are described. The reason for the use of on-line drawn contour lines is explained. Further applications, also for digital contour lines, are introduced. Possibilities for the achievement of high photo quality during the reproduction are discussed...|$|E

Uniform scale {{and the absence of}} relief displacement in orthophotos make them an important component of GIS databases, where the user can directly determine geographic locations, measure distances, compute areas, and derive other useful information about the area in question. <b>Differential</b> <b>rectification</b> has been traditionally used for orthophoto generation. For large scale imagery over urban areas, <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> produces serious artifacts in the form of double mapped areas at object space locations with sudden relief variations, e. g., in the vicinity of buildings. Such artifacts are removed through true orthophoto generation methodologies which are based on the identification of occluded portions of the object space in the involved imagery. Existing methodologies suffer from several problems such as their sensitivity to the sampling interval of the digital surface model (DSM) {{as it relates to the}} ground sampling distance (GSD) of the imaging sensor. Moreover, current methodologies rely on the availability of a digital building model (DBM), which requires an additional and expensive pre-processing. This paper presents new methodologies for true orthophoto generation while circumventing the problems associated with existing techniques. The feasibility and performance of the suggested techniques are verified through experimental results with simulated and real data...|$|E

40|$|Vibrationally coupled {{electron}} transport through single-molecule junctions is considered. Reviewing {{our recent}} theoretical work, {{we show that}} electron-hole pair creation processes represent the key to understand the vibrational excitation characteristic of a single-molecule contact. Moreover, these processes {{can lead to a}} number of interesting transport phenomena such as, for example, negative <b>differential</b> resistance, <b>rectification,</b> mode-selective vibrational excitation and a pronounced temperature dependence of the electrical current. Thus, electron-hole pair creation processes are crucial to elucidate the basic mechanisms of vibrationally coupled electron transport through a single-molecule contact, despite the fact that these processes do not directly contribute to the electrical current that is flowing through the junction.

40|$|The epipolar {{resampling}} {{of linear}} pushbroom imagery {{is essential for}} automatic DEM extraction and feature collection. Due to the special imaging geometry of linear array scanners, the epipolar geometry of linear pushbroom imagery is very complex. In this paper, a fast algorithm for epipolar resampling of linear pushbroom imagery is proposed which can satisfy the real time processing demand of automatic DEM extraction and feature collection. The <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> of linear pushbroom imagery based on the rigorous geometric model {{is the basis for}} epipolar resampling. The back projection of ground points is essential for the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> of linear pushbroom imagery and its main objective is searching the best scan line. The traditional best scan line searching methodology based on collinearity equation iterations needs a lot of calculation which has little practical use. According to the geometric constraints of the central perspective plane of scan line, the best scan line is determined efficiently within several iterations which just calculating the distance of ground point to the central perspective planar in object space. Based on our fast back projection algorithm, the epipolar resampling processing efficiency of linear pushbroom imagery can be improved greatly. The ADS 40 airborne linear pushbroom imagery is tested and experiment results show that our algorithm has the merits of both high accuracy and efficiency which is suitable for real time processing of epipolar resampling...|$|E

40|$|The {{comparison}} between aerial photographs and satellite images, {{with regard to}} their performance, is strongly actual: in fact, advantages and defects of both are well known. In the past, low spatial resolution of satellite images was a limit in cartographical applications: now, the recent orbital platform are improving the data quality and, at the same time, make very large ground coverage possible. This feature, in digital orthorectification, is most interesting. it can reduce (and, in some cases, eliminate) the need of image mosaicking, which is difficult or not possible using aerial photographs. Some experiences in our archaeological research unit,have shown the capabilities of IKONOS images in Cartography on a large scale, related to land study on extended archaeological sites. The intent is to experience the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> applied to a satellite image (SPOT V, IKONOS, etc.), comparing the obtained digital product with reference maps (as far as the scale 1 : 2000) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} the {{automatic}} reconstruction of a three dimensional terrain surface is presented. Matching is performed in object space, so that an arbitrary number of overlapping images, {{with a minimum of}} two, can be used. Image pyramids are used to decrease the search space. The similarity measure is the correlation coefficient. In order to take perspective differences into account, the images are resampled after each pyramid level, using the latest available surface model. The resampling method that is used comprises the <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> procedure for orthophotograph generation. Thus orthophotographs are automatically generated, simultaneously with the surface reconstruction. All pixels in the orthophotograph are matched. In order to make the result more robust, that is to reduce or eliminate the effects of gross errors, the matched points are filtered in two steps. The resolution of the digital surface model can be reduced by estimating a sparser grid of heights through a least squares adjustment of finite elements. Some test results are presented.

40|$|So far, orthoimages are {{generated}} from aerial photographs by <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> {{to correct the}} effects of relief displacements. Digital Terrain Models (DTM) describe only the topographic surface but ignore trees, man-made objects, etc. Therefore, the effect of leaning buildings or bent bridges appears, especially in urban areas. Expensive Digital Surface Models (DSM) describe the entire surface including the mentioned objects. This enables the generation of orthoimages of a high quality which are called “True Orthoimage”. Now, recent developments of optoelectronic line-scanning cameras like HRSC or ADS 40 allow for a totally new approach for orthoimage generation. The nadir-looking channels of these cameras provide image data in parallel projection along the flight line, and in central perspectives across. If a scene is imaged twice in flight lines perpendicular to each other, the first image strip provides correct ground coordinates of any object in one direction, the second image strip in the other direction. The new approach {{takes advantage of the}}se particular geometric properties by combining the correct ground coordinates of each point. Thus, the generation of a true orthoimage becomes possible without height information. Due to the mixed projections of pushbroom sensor imagery, the relief displacements occur only in one direction. Thus, occluded areas are significantly smaller than in conventional aerial photographs. Moreover, the new approach takes advantage of the particular pattern of certain urban areas, to fill up remaining gaps with image information only from the participated image strips.

40|$|The {{availability}} of high accuracy GCPs (Ground Control Points) and DEMs (Digital Elevation Models) becomes {{the key issue}} for successful implementation of an image orthorectification project. It {{is a very difficult}} task for collecting a large number of high quality GCPs by using traditional methods to meet all the requirements for digital photogrammetric and orthorectification process. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) – also referred to as airborne laser scanning (ALS), provides an alternative for high-density and high-accuracy three- imensional terrain point data acquisition. One of the appealing features in the LiDAR output is the direct vailability of three dimensional coordinates of points and intensity data in object space. With LiDAR data, highaccuracy and high-resolution intensity image, hillshade DSM (Digital Surface Model) image, and DEM can be generated. Due to high planimetric accuracy characteristics of LiDAR data, ground truth can be extracted from these LiDAR-derived products (e. g., hillshade image and intensity image). This study investigated the feasibility of using LiDAR-derived hillshade DSM image and intensity image to extract ground truth for aerial image orthorectification. Two sets of GCPs were extracted from hillshade image and intensity image separately, and then were used as the inputs for aerial triangulation processing. LiDARderived DEM was then employed for <b>differential</b> <b>rectification</b> to produce the final orthoimage. The assessment of the planimetric accuracy of orthorectified images by using different set of GCPs was conducted by comparing the coordinates of some checking points from orthoimages and correspondent GPS surveyed coordinates. ...|$|E

40|$|It is the {{traditional}} procedure to generate orthophotos from aerial photographs by <b>differential</b> <b>rectification.</b> The effects of relief displacement are corrected by considering a Digital Terrain Model (DTM). Due {{to the fact that}} DTM's do not describe the surface of buildings, bridges, trees etc. such objects remain in perspective views in the resulting orthophotos. If a Digital Surface Model (DSM) describes the mentioned objects, the caused displacements can also be corrected, and the results are called “True Orthoimages”. However, recent developments of optoelectronic cameras like HRSC or ADX 40 allow for a totally new approach for orthoimage generation. The nadir-looking channels of these cameras provide image data in parallel projection along the flight line, and in central perspectives across. If a scene is imaged twice in flight lines perpendicular to each other, the first image strip provides correct ground coordinates of any object in one direction, the second image strip in the other direction. The new approach takes advantage of these particular geometric properties. It is based on the definition of corresponding points in the image data sets by means of matching techniques or corresponding areas by means of segmentation procedures. Each conjugate point directly provides the correct ground coordinates and can be assigned as a pixel to the orthoimage. Thus, a true orthoimage is generated without any knowledge of the object heights or further calculations. The paper provides {{a detailed description of the}} approach, and its advantages and limitations are discussed.
