40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} {{nanofiltration}} (NF), ultrafiltration (UF) and ozonization pilot scale tests for revamping and improvement of an industrial plant that treats wastewaters {{coming from a}} wide range of hazardous industrial processes. Tests demonstrated that the best treatment is NF whose feed stream comes from sand filters rather than first ozonization stage before <b>final</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the effluent. NF rejection coefficients resulted to be 31 % for TDS, 94 % COD, 9 % Cl-, 47 % surfactants, 66 % phenols and 91 % SO 4 2 -. UF was tested as NF pre-treatment but results were not so promising in terms of rejection and permeate flux, as well as fouling reduction. Other experimental tests were carried out in order to understand where to recycle the NF retentate: the best treatment in terms of COD reduction and biodegradability was ozonization followed by recycling to the physico-chemical stage. In the same manner, it was found that ozonization of the NF permeate is the best process solution before <b>final</b> treatment and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the effluent. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Petro{{chemical}} {{and chemical}} wastewaters contain {{a great variety}} of contaminants needing different treatments for their removal. In recent decades, regulations for the <b>final</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have set more and more stringent limits for macro- and micro-pollutants, requiring upgrades to existing WWTPs. This paper examines the interventions at the WWTP for the petrochemical site of Porto Marghera, near Venice, Italy. Due to extremely severe legal limits and bare available areas for plant upgrading, the existing Conventional Activated Sludges (CAS) tank was converted into a Membrane Biological Reactor (MBR). In this way, the increased sludge retention time (SRT) enhances nitrification and biodegradation, bioaccumulation and mineralization of the more persistent compounds and the passage through the ultrafiltration membrane guarantees a full solid-liquid separation. An analysis of the different forms of nitrogen in the treated wastewaters showed significant amounts of dissolved and recalcitrant organic nitrogen. The limit of 10 mg L- 1 for total nitrogen (TN) is met by the combined means of a membrane filtration, which removes the organic nitrogen discharged with the sludge flocks, and a post-denitrification...|$|R

To determine the optimum condition of the RO membrane, response surface methodology (RSM) was used. The results showed there was correlation between all key variables. POME concentration, trans-membrane pressure, pH and time would give significant effects in reducing the parameters in POME treatment with the optimum condition of 15. 77 % for POME concentration, 3. 73 for pH, 0. 5 bar trans-membrane pressure and 5 hours for filtration time.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to reclaim and recover palm oil mill {{effluent}} (POME) for water reuse using tubular ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. The reclaimed water was compared with the <b>final</b> <b>discharged</b> water <b>of</b> the local mill. The raw POME was first subjected to a physical pre-treatment process to remove the content of organic matter and suspended solids. The pre-treatment process was coupled with membrane technology (UF and RO) to reclaim the clean water from POME. From the combined techniques of UF (5 bar) and RO (30 bar) the results showed that the turbidity and BOD 5 were reduced by 99 % and 98. 9 %, respectively. Compared to the <b>final</b> <b>discharged</b> POME, this suggested method gives a significant difference in BOD 5 and turbidity.

40|$|Olive Mill Wastewaters are {{considered}} pollutants of great interest, {{due to their}} high organic and phenolic content. Difficult treatment and <b>final</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> those wastewaters is also intensified by their seasonal production in relatively high production rates. Moreover, {{a great deal of}} harmful impacts on human health {{as well as on the}} environment, have been attributed to phenolic substances. In the present work, the efficiency of olive pulp bacteria on phenol biodegradation, as well as on the removal of the organic and phenolic substances of olive mill wastewaters, was studied. In order to study phenol biodegradation, experiments were performed at suspended growth and attached growth packed-bed reactors. The effect of the specific surface area of the packed-bed reactor’s support material, and the operational mode of the packed-bed reactors, was also examined, as a first step to optimize the process of biological phenol removal. Furthermore, the kinetics of olive pulp bacteria on phenol biodegradation was studied. Modelling of the draw-fill experiments in the suspended growth and the attached growth packed-bed reactors was performed. Modelling is a useful tool in understanding the behaviour of biological processes, in the design of the most suitable reactor system and in predicting the substance concentrations in the system. In the last part of the research the capability of the same mixed bacterial culture on the removal of the phenolic and organic content of olive mill wastewaters was examined. The olive mill wastewater toxicity on olive pulp bacteria was studied on batch suspended growth experiments, applying different wastewater dilutions. Besides suspended growth reactors, experiments were also performed in bench and pilot scale packed-bed reactors, where the effect of different support materials and operational mode was tested. ...|$|R
