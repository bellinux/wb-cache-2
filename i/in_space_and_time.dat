5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do anything {{in the way of}} complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that it has come to this was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure <b>in</b> <b>Space</b> <b>and</b> <b>Time</b> produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013.

5|$|In {{the first}} two albums Valérian travels through time in a {{two-seater}} device, the XB27, which transports him to the various relay stations that Galaxity has hidden throughout time (e.g. in Bad Dreams (Les Mauvais Rêves) the relay is hidden below a tavern). In subsequent stories Valérian and Laureline use the saucer-shaped Astroship XB982 (which made its debut appearance in 1969 in the short story The Great Collector (Le Grand Collectionneur). The astroship is able to travel anywhere using a spatio-temporal jump, a sort of hyperspace drive enabling near-instant transportation anywhere <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> are basic symmetries {{of the laws of}} mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of physical interactions with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

40|$|An {{extension}} to the fluctuation splitting approach for approximating hyperbolic con-servation laws is described, which achieves higher than second order accuracy <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> by extending {{the range of}} the distribution of the fluctuations. Initial re-sults are presented for a simple linear scheme which is third order accurate <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> on uniform triangular grids. Numerically induced oscillations are suppressed by applying the flux-corrected transport algorithm. These schemes are evaluated in the context of existing fluctuation splitting approaches to modelling time-dependent flows and some suggestions for their future development are made...|$|R
5|$|Since Alfred Eisenack first {{recognised}} {{and named}} {{the group in}} 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility {{is due to the}} rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (<10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; better still, they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating palæozoic units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.|$|E
5|$|However, modern {{agriculture}} seriously reduces biodiversity. Traditional {{third world}} agriculture that is best at maintaining diversity with multiple cropping systems such aspolyculture(includingcompanion plantingandintercropping) andagroforestrysystems such as shifting cultivation. In Latin America, between 70% and 90% of beans are grown mixed with other {{crops such as}} maize and potatoes. Worldwide, multiple cropping provided up to 20% of all food in 1986. Traditional systems also maintain diversity within a crop species, such as in theAndesmountains where up to 50 varieties of potato are grown.The effects of loss of biodiversity are especially noticeable in pest control. Herbivorous pest insects tend to become more abundant inmonocultures. Stable agroecosystems are biodiverse and contain sufficient numbers of natural enemies of crop pests, such asparasitoidalwasps which are able to controlaphidsandlepidopterancaterpillars. These ecosystems continuously provide food and breeding sites for these beneficial species. Agroecosystems can achieve this equilibrium by arranging a suitable combination of crops <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time,</b> given the type of soil and surrounding environment; sufficient abundance of non-crop plants in and around fields; and appropriate management of vegetation. Suitable farming strategies include polyculture,crop rotation, mosaics of small scattered fields and uncultivated land. Additional strategies include perennial crops such asorchards(especially if a diverse floral undergrowth is permitted), tolerating specific weed species, and raising genetic diversity such as by planting mixtures of crop varieties.|$|E

30|$|Based on the locally {{one-dimensional}} strategy, {{we propose}} two high order finite difference schemes for solving two-dimensional linear parabolic equations. In the first method, fourth order approximation <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> (2, 2) Padé formula in time are considered. These {{lead to a}} fourth order finite difference scheme <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> For the second method, we employ sixth order approximation <b>in</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> (3, 3) Padé formula in time. This yields a novel sixth order scheme <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> The methods are proved to be unconditionally stable, and the Sheng–Suzuki barrier is successfully avoided. Numerical experiments are given to illustrate our conclusions as well as computational effectiveness.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a new {{scheme of}} {{arbitrary}} high order accuracy <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> is proposed to solve hyperbolic conservative laws.

According to a Lax-Wendroff procedure, all the time derivatives are then replaced by <b>space</b> derivatives. <b>And</b> the <b>space</b> derivatives is calculated by WENO reconstruction polynomial. One of the most important advantages of this new scheme is easy to implement. In addition, it should be pointed out, the procedure of calculating the <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time</b> derivatives <b>in</b> numerical flux {{can be used as a}} building block to extend the current first order schemes to very high order accuracy <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time.</b> Numerous numerical tests for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic conservative laws demonstrate that new scheme is robust and can be high order accuracy <b>in</b> both <b>space</b> <b>and</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
