5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the direction of travel. During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{students}} have an absolute score, each student's absolute score are compared with other students to yield an aggregate score, and {{the students}} are ranked according to that basis. This allows the examination to accommodate for overly <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> overly difficult questions. Contrary to popular belief, the PSLE aggregate score has no ceiling of 300. In 2007, for example, the highest aggregate score for the PSLE was 294 and the lowest aggregate score was 87. The lowest score for 2011's PSLE was 43 but the highest score was 283.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of bruises {{may be seen}} in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the navel (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis. Connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome may cause relatively <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> spontaneous bruising depending on the severity.|$|E

25|$|According to Ziethaml et al., layout affects how <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> {{difficult}} it is to navigate through a system. Signs and symbols provide cues for directional navigation and also inform about appropriate behaviour within a store. Functionality refers to extent to which the equipment and layout meet the goals of the customer. For instance, in the case of supermarkets, the customer's goal may be to minimise {{the amount of time spent}} finding items and waiting at the check-out, while a customer in a retail mall may wish to spend more time exploring the range of stores and merchandise. With respect to functionality of layout, retail designers consider three key issues; circulation– design for traffic-flow and that encourages customers to traverse the entire store; coordination– design that combines goods and spaces in order to suggest customer needs and convenience– design that arranges items to create a degree of comfort and access for both customers and employees.|$|E
25|$|Pro mode for {{keyboards}} shows during gameplay ten white {{keys and}} the corresponding black keys, as the full range cannot be displayed on screen; Two visual cues are given to the player to identify what position on the controller they should play relative to the keys shown on-screen. One cue is through highlighting the entire lane that corresponds to a played note whether correct or not; this {{is designed to help}} keep the player's hand positions correlated on the unit. A second cue is uniquely grouped coloring of a channel containing a set of 5 keys matching similar markings on the keyboard unit to identify the correct area of the keyboard that the player should be on. Pro keyboard charting includes notes and chords using a combination of white and black keys. On <b>Easy</b> <b>or</b> Medium Pro keys, the range of keys on screen does not shift, but on Hard and Expert the range of keys shown on the screen shifts as the song necessitates, requiring the player to move their own hands in turn. Arrow indicators are displayed to indicate when the displayed area is about to shift left or right, giving the player time to compensate.|$|E
25|$|In December, 2012, William Cheswick {{wrote an}} article {{published}} in ACM magazine that included the mathematical possibilities of how <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> difficult it would be to break passwords that are constructed using the commonly recommended, and sometimes followed, standards of today. In his article, William showed that a standard eight character alpha-numeric password could withstand a brute force attack of ten million attempts per second, and remain unbroken for 252 days. Ten million attempts each second is the acceptable rate of attempts using a multi-core system that most users would have access to. A much greater degree of attempts, at the rate of 7 billion per second, could also be achieved when using modern GPUs. At this rate, the same 8 character alpha-numeric password could be broken in approximately 30 seconds. Increasing the password complexity to a 13 character alpha-numeric password increases the time needed to crack it to more than 900,000 years at 7 billion attempts per second. This is, of course, assuming the password does not use a common word that a dictionary attack could break much sooner. Using a password of this strength reduces the obligation to change it as often as many organizations require, including the U.S. Government, as it could not be reasonably broken in such a short period of time.|$|E

500|$|The {{player is}} able to speak to demons instead of {{fighting}} them, and can try to form an alliance with them; these negotiations involve the player trying to increase the demon's mood, and start with the player picking an attitude – friendly or intimidating – after which they get to choose {{how to respond to}} what the demon says or does, and whether to give the demon items or money it asks for. Demons act differently depending on their personality, as well as the in-game phase of the moon; it is impossible to converse with demons during full moon, forcing the player to fight or flee. Depending on choices the player makes throughout the game, their moral alignment changes; the different alignments are [...] "law", [...] "chaos", and [...] "neutrality". These affect how the plot progresses, and how <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> difficult it is to form alliances with certain demon types, depending on how compatible the player's and the demon's alignments are.|$|E
500|$|Gameplay may {{be altered}} {{when it is}} felt that a game might be too <b>easy</b> <b>or</b> {{difficult}} for the Western audience. Some of the older Final Fantasy titles, such as Final Fantasy IV, were altered to be more easy {{to play in the}} West than in Japan, though their remakes and ports have generally restored the difficulty. Einhänders gameplay also received notable cuts for its North American release. On the other hand, [...] was made more difficult in localized versions because the Western market was judged [...] "more familiar" [...] with the real-time strategy genre than the Japanese market. For the Western release of Dissidia Final Fantasy, the game was changed to suit Western players, including removing several RPG elements to make it more akin to an action game. Censorship can also affect the localized versions of the games and require obscuring mature themes, rewriting risqué remarks or phrases, altering graphics or removing parts of some scenes. This was common in the NES and SNES eras but less drastic later on once video game content rating systems were established. Original Western releases of early games in the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest featured multiple occurrences of this form of censorship. Final Fantasy VIII also received some censorship for its European release, including the removal of a Nazi-like uniform. Less commonly, this also goes the other way, for instance with Final Fantasy XII, in which a sequence involving violence against a female character was censored in the Japanese version but restored in the American and European releases. References to religion can also be removed, as in Final Fantasy IV and VI. Such references in Xenogears caused Square to consider not releasing it in North America.|$|E
