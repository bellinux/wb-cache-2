500|$|After her {{departure}} from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films, Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records, but was later dropped due to disagreements {{between her and the}} label. [...] "They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money. They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox. And I never wanted that. That wasn't what it was about for me. I pretty much had a sense of myself, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be an imposter," [...] Lords said.|$|E
500|$|They {{had four}} children—Linda's {{daughter}} Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James—and remained married until Linda's untimely death {{from breast cancer}} at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul stated in the Daily Mail, [...] "I got a counsellor because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [...] perfect all the time... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies." ...|$|E
2500|$|She became {{disenchanted with}} Islam, and {{was shocked by}} the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, for which al-Qaeda {{eventually}} claimed responsibility. After listening to videotapes of Osama bin Laden citing [...] "words of justification" [...] in the Qur'an for the attacks, she wrote, [...] "I picked up the Qur'an and the hadith and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> find Bin Laden's quotations in there." [...] During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur'an as relative – it was a historical record and [...] "just another book." ...|$|E

2500|$|David Amram, {{first met}} Woody Guthrie in 1956. [...] In his {{report of the}} 2005 WoodyFest he remembers that meeting: [...] "Ever since that day we first met, I have always hoped that someday I would {{get the chance to}} go to Okemah, but with my crazy {{schedule}} I never had the opportunity to do so. When I was invited to the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By doing that, and by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Gambart, [...] "isn't this vexing? <b>I</b> {{thought it}} <b>would</b> please him so much, for {{of course he}} <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never press him for the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] he said. [...] "There is {{only one}} reason in the world <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> admit--I don't even <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> accept <b>that.</b> The other things don't count. They don't exist." ...|$|R

2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. I felt as if I had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E

6000|$|... "You darling!" [...] he said; [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{surprise}} you. I {{came right}} up from Plymouth by the night train. And I have long leave, {{and plenty of}} time to get married. Isn't it jolly, dear Laura?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{followed}} you," [...] he answered. [...] "I think you <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> I tried not to," [...] he went on, after a moment's pause. [...] "I fought against it {{as hard as}} I could; {{but in the end}} I had to give in." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ashley: [...] "Thank you. Now I {{will tell}} you what I was really going to ask. Why did you wish to drive me back to Miss Fray when you <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be false to her a {{thousand}} times if I could only once be true to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{went against}} the grain to have {{dealings}} with such a man, for I was born of honest people, but if the ould gentleman himself had offered {{me a couple of}} saws, and I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to give him a thousand years extra of purgatory, I would have closed with the bargain. Those two saws cost me another louis, and cheap enough, too.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not seek}} to explain the mystery which had brought her across the sea into that little garden of Mrs. Temple's and into my heart.

60|$|All {{that night}} I lay awake, trying to sift some motive for Mr. Allen's deceit.

60|$|The {{sales manager}} of the biggest book store for ten blocks cannot be deceived in a customer. And he knew, of course, that, as a professor, I was no good.

He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> hang around for two hours, get in everybody's way, and finally buy a cheap reprint of the Dialogues of Plato, or the Prose Works of John Milton, or Locke on the Human Understanding, or some trash of that sort.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell you}} the humiliation and also the fury which filled my mind as I lay there like a {{helpless}} sheep being carried to the butcher's.
