60|$|Clavering nodded, for {{he dared}} not trust himself to speak, and the man, who took up {{an armful of}} the billets, dropped {{a few of them}} through the open top of the stove. One, as it happened, jammed inside it, so that he could get no more in, and he laid hold of an <b>iron</b> <b>scraper</b> to free it with. He now stood with his back to Clavering, but the rifle still lay within his reach upon the table.|$|E
50|$|Scutching {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The scutching process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers. Scutching can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand scutching of flax is done with a wooden scutching knife and a small <b>iron</b> <b>scraper.</b> The end products of scutching flax are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a hot}} autumn {{morning when}} we {{prepared}} to commence our task of railroad building, the last forlorn hope between ourselves and ruin. Harry and I stood each beside our teams, which were harnessed to a great <b>iron</b> scoop or <b>scraper</b> designed to tear out a heavy load of soil at each traverse. This we would pile in the slight hollows, so that, sinking a few feet through the rises and raised slightly above each depression, the road-bed might run straight and level across the prairie. A group of sinewy, dusty men waited about the line of flat cars loaded with rails close behind, while a plume of black smoke curled aloft from the huge locomotive in a dingy column against {{the blue of the}} sky. This, with the cluster of tents and shanties, was all that broke the white grass-land's empty monotony.|$|R
5000|$|Church of St. John the Evangelist is a {{historic}} Episcopal church on Chittenden Road (a.k.a. Route 25) in Stockport, Columbia County, New York. It was completed in August, 1846 {{at a cost of}} $12,000 and consecrated by Bishop Heathcote Delancey of the Diocese of Western New York on July 3, 1847. Earlier, the Reverend Henry Townsend of the Diocese of Connecticut rode on horseback over the Berkshire Mountains to attend the original incorporation meeting on Sept. 20, 1845[...] St. John's was the first Episcopal church built in Columbia County, NY and its grounds bear one of two original lychgates in the county, the second being at St. Mark's Church in Philmont. [...] St. John's is a one-story, rectangular, wood-frame building in the board-and-batten Carpenter Gothic style painted deep brown, hence its affectionate local moniker, [...] "The Little Brown Church." [...] It features a projecting center entrance tower holding a cast iron church bell, double entry doors, stained glass window and upper double vents. The main entrance, flanked by <b>iron</b> boot <b>scrapers,</b> opens to reveal a simple vestibule bearing the bell rope and a framed plaque in memory of Joseph Marshall, builder of the church, whose remains are interred beneath the north transept. Marshall was born in Huddersfield, England in 1773, emigrated to America in 1827, built St. John's in 1846 and died in 1848. Steep gable roofs protect the horizontal main structure containing the organ loft, nave, chancel and sanctuary. The north and south walls of the nave each contain four beautiful stained glass windows. At the building's northwest corner at right angles to the main nave is a former sacristy, which now forms the organ chamber. At the southwest corner stands the present sacristy. The adjacent cemetery contains approximately 2,200 burials from 1821 to the present.|$|R
