5|$|A {{tradition}} {{going back}} at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs for love of Phaon, a ferryman. This is regarded as unhistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person reference in a non-biographical poem. The legend may have resulted <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> a desire to assert Sappho as heterosexual.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{asteroid}} bodies, {{the asteroid belt}} also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres.

Due to the Poynting–Robertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they would at least get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office.

5|$|Calakmul {{was already}} a large city in the Preclassic period. The early history of Calakmul is obscure, {{although}} a dynastic list has been pieced together that extends back into an ancestral past. This dynasty has been reconstructed <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> Late Classic ceramics from the region of great Preclassic cities of El Mirador and Nakbe. This may mean that Calakmul ultimately inherited its political authority from one of these cities, with its dynasty originating in the Late Preclassic in the Mirador Basin and relocating itself to Calakmul in the Classic period {{after the collapse of}} these cities.|$|E

Encouraging their son's love of music, Fisher's parents gave him piano lessons; he also learned to play the guitar. It was during this period that Fisher developed an interest in amateur radio, constructing rudimentary spark transmitters and receivers.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{study was}} {{published}} that examined genetic variation among five Indian equine breeds—the Manipuri, Marwari, Spiti, Bhutia, and Zanskari. Based on analysis of microsatellite DNA, the Manipuri {{was found to}} have the greatest genetic distance from the Marwari, and a much closer genetic distance to the other three breeds. The distance from the Marwari was not only genetic, but seen in physical characteristics, particularly height and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse is closely associated with the Arabian, while the four other breeds are thought to have descended at least <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> the Tibetan pony. None of the breeds in the study were found to be closely genetically associated with the Thoroughbred.|$|E

5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple by suggesting that Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.|$|E
5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>from</b> misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan's hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and {{may lead to the}} cognitive decline seen early in AD.|$|E
5|$|King Khaba is {{considered}} to be difficult to assess as a figure of ancient Egypt. His name is archaeologically well-attested by stone bowls and mud seal impressions. Khaba's reign is securely dated to the Third Dynasty. Because of the contradictions within Ramesside king lists and the lack of contemporary, festive inscriptions, his exact chronological position within the dynasty remains disputed. These problems originate <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> contradictory king lists, which were all compiled long after Khaba's death, especially during the Ramesside era. It is also a matter of debate as to where Khaba might have been buried. Many Egyptologists and archaeologists propose that an unfinished step pyramid at Zawyet el'Aryan, known as the Layer Pyramid, belongs to him. Others believe instead that his tomb is a large mastaba close to the Layer Pyramid, where numerous stone vessels bearing Khaba's serekh have been found.|$|E

5|$|Lipid {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of lipid transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize lipid distribution across lipid bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once lipid asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{charge that}} Christian Science came from Quimby, not divine revelation, stemmed <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>from</b> Eddy's use of Quimby's {{manuscript}} (right) when teaching Sally Wentworth {{and others in}} 1868–1870. Eddy said she had helped to fix Quimby's unpublished work, and now stood accused of having copied her own corrections. Against this, Lyman P. Powell, one of Eddy's biographers, wrote in 1907 that Quimby's son held an almost identical copy, in Quimby's wife's handwriting, of the Quimby manuscript that Eddy had used when teaching Sally Wentworth. It was dated February 1862, eight months before Eddy met Quimby.|$|E
