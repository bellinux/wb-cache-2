2500|$|Drawings for the Canadian Sexton {{self-propelled}} 25 pounder—also {{derived from}} the M3 chassis—were obtained and adapted, with the turret {{and much of the}} frontal armour of the Grant replaced by an open-topped fighting compartment.

A QF 25pounder Mk 2/1 with a [...] fixed length recoil system and a muzzle brake was mounted centrally in the superstructure, allowing the gun to traverse over a 40degree arc. Elevation was limited to 40degrees, and depression to 9.5degrees. The more resilient M4 Sherman suspension units replaced the M3 type bogies. Stowage was provided for 88 high explosive and/or smoke shells and 16 armour-piercing (AP) rounds. The 25-pounder and a strengthened saddle were mounted on a bolster-and-beam assembly welded to the track sponsons, whilst the gun was equipped with the same sighting gear as the towed field gun, allowing for both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>laying.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} later, the Richtfläche (lining-plane) sight {{was invented in}} Germany and {{provided}} a means of <b>indirect</b> <b>laying</b> in azimuth, complementing the clinometers for <b>indirect</b> <b>laying</b> in elevation which already existed. Despite conservative opposition within the German army, indirect fire was adopted as doctrine by the 1890s. In the early 1900s, Goertz in Germany developed an optical sight for azimuth laying. It quickly replaced the lining-plane; in English, it became the 'Dial Sight' (UK) or 'Panoramic Telescope' (US).|$|E

In essence, this was the geometry of using angles to aiming points that could be in any direction relative to the target. The problem was the lack of an azimuth instrument to enable it; clinometers for elevation already existed.|$|E

50|$|As {{there is}} no {{gyroscopic}} or similar system for independent, automated and autonomous gun laying in the DANA, the gunner of howitzer uses a ZZ-73 panoramic telescope with a PG1-M-D collimator for <b>indirect</b> gun <b>laying.</b> This sight has a horizontal scale used to set the appropriate horizontal laying via aiming at reference points. This means that the DANA is not an autonomous system {{there needs to be}} an additional device to assist in gun laying (in fact, the firing positions of such artillery systems are usually prepared before the guns are positioned there). For direct fire engagements, the gunner uses an OP5-38-D telescopic sight.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} vein, ant {{algorithms}} model the foraging behaviour of ant colonies. To {{find the best}} path between the nest {{and a source of}} food, ants rely on <b>indirect</b> communication by <b>laying</b> a pheromone trail {{on the way back to}} the nest if they found food, respectively following the concentration of pheromones if they are looking for food. Ant algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of combinatorial optimization problems over discrete search spaces.|$|R

This was a gun-mounted rotatable open sight, mounted in alignment with the bore, and able to measure large angles from it. Similar designs, usually able to measure angles in a full circle, were widely adopted over the following decade. By the early 1900s the open sight was sometimes replaced by a telescope and the term goniometer had replaced [...] "lining-plane" [...] in English.|$|E

50|$|Predicted fire aims {{to achieve}} {{tactical}} surprise when {{the target is}} to be engaged by <b>indirect</b> fire. Gun <b>laying</b> is based on calculations of the range and azimuth of the target relative to the gun position, {{without the need for}} ranging shots (or adjusting) or even observation of the target. Ranging shots take time, and alert the enemy both to the presence and position of the guns, and to the likelihood of an attack. Predicted fire enables enemy artillery, strongpoints or troop concentrations to be struck without warning, often shortly before a friendly attack so as to leave no time for recovery, or engagement of targets hidden from observation by friendly forces. It can be used to plan any type of fire, including concentrations or the creeping barrages commonly used in World War I.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{in this paper}} Ant-P-solver, a generic constraint solver based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic. The ACO metaheuristic takes inspiration on the observation of real ants collective foraging behaviour. The idea is to model the problem as the search of a best path in a graph. Artificial ants walk trough this graph, in a stochastic and incomplete way, searching for good paths. Artificial ants communicate in a local and <b>indirect</b> way, by <b>laying</b> a pheromone trail {{on the edges of}} the graph. Ant-P-solver has been designed to solve a general class of combinatorial problems, i. e., permutation constraint satisfaction problems, the goal of which is to find a permutation of n known values, to be assigned to n variables, under some constraints. Many constraint satisfaction problems involve such global permutation constraints. Ant-P-solver capabilities are illustrated, and compared with other approaches, on three of these problems, i. e., the n-queens, the allinterval series and the car sequencing problems...|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} plants, Echinopsis peruviana can be {{propagated}} from cuttings. The {{result is a}} genetic clone of the parent plant. For example, the top 15 cm end of a cactus column can be cleanly removed with a knife. The cutting can be left to heal {{for about two weeks}} in the scattered or <b>indirect</b> light, by <b>laying</b> it upon its side. It should be kept away from excessive moisture that will encourage growth of an opportunistic infection, and should receive good airflow at this time. The plant will heal by forming a calloused seal to withstand bacterial and fungal attack such as mold. The unrooted cutting can be kept upright in a propped up position {{for an extended period of}} time (2+ years) without harm. Often roots will emerge from the lowest point of the plant between 3-6 months time. Rooting hormone is not required and its use may damage the soft tissues of the plant, giving rise to bacterial or fungal rot that may kill the clone.|$|R
60|$|In the {{discussion}} of the Clarendon convention of 1869 Mr. Sumner—a man of some great qualities, but too often the slave of words where he thought himself their master—made an extravagant speech against the British government in the senate, assessing the claim of the United States upon this country on principles that would have raised it to the modest figure of some four hundred million pounds sterling due from us to them, or, as Mr. Gladstone himself estimated it, to sixteen hundred millions. It does not matter which. This was only a violent and fantastic exaggeration of an idea of constructive claims for <b>indirect</b> damages that <b>lay</b> slumbering, but by no means extinct, in American minds, until, as we shall see, in 1872 it very nearly led to a disastrous explosion. This idea first found distinct and official utterance in the despatch of 1869. Besides compensating individuals for depredations, we were to pay for the cost to America of chasing the cruisers; for the transfer of most of the American commercial marine to the British flag; for enhanced insurance; and generally for the increased difficulty of putting down the rebellion.|$|R
40|$|Introduction To achieve {{high gain}} with {{continued}} scaling in CMOS fabrication processes, use of three-stage op-amps has become indispensable. In {{the progression of}} CMOS technology development, the supply voltage has been decreasing while the transistor threshold volt-ages do not effectively scale. Also the inherent gain available from the transistors has been decreasing with downsizing of the transistor gate length. The traditional techniques for achieving high gain by vertically stacking up (i. e. cascoding) the transistors, to achieve high gain are becoming difficult to realize in the modem sub- 100 nm processes as the threshold voltage doesn 2 ̆ 7 t scale well. Thus the paradigm of vertical cascoding of transistors needs {{to be replaced by}} the horizontal cascading in order to design op-amps in low supply voltage processes. This thesis presents novel multi-stage topologies for singly ended as well as fully differential op-amps with the highest performance ever reported. We have also explored and comprehensively developed the indirect feedback compensation theory for the two-stage as well as the multi-stage op-amps, The proposed indirect compensated op-amps exhibit significant improvements in speed over the traditional Miller compensated op-amps and result in much smaller layout size and lower power consumption. Contributions in this Thesis •Indirect feedback compensation for two and higher stage op-amps have been analyzed for all known topologies. Analysis for novel indirect feedback compensation method employing split-length devices is presented. Split-length device indirect feedback compensation is useful in high speed compensation of low-voltage op-amp topologies. The split-length <b>indirect</b> compensation <b>lays</b> the foundation for the development of ultra low power and high performance multi-stage op-amps. A test chip containing the various two-stage topologies has been fabricated in a 0. 5 μm CMOS process and tested for the same load conditions. The split-length indirect compensated op-amps displayed a ten times enhancement in the gain-bandwidth and four times faster transient settling compared to the traditional Miller compensated op-amp topologies. The tested performance of the op-amps is in close accordance with the simulated results as we have used a relatively long channel CMOS process where the process variations and random offsets are negligible. •Stable and low power three-stage op-amps can also be designed by using indirect feedback compensation, in conjunction with pole-zero cancellation, to achieve excellent phase margins close to 90 °. A theory for the compensation of three and multi-stage op-amps has been presented which matches well with simulations and experiments. The three-stage op-amps documented in this thesis achieve highest simulated figures-of-merit (FoMs) compared to the state-of-art and can be directly used in integrated systems to achieve higher performance. A second chip containing various three-stage singly-ended op-amps has been designed in 0. 5 μm CMOS process and is presently in fabrication. •We have presented a discussion on the impractical and incorrect multi-stage biasing schemes which are commonly found in literature. It has been demonstrated that diff-amps must be used for the internal gain stages for robust biasing of the multi-stage op-amp. The theory for three-stage op-amp design has been extended to a generalized n-stage op-amp case and can be used to build higher order multi-stage op-amps. •Novel multi-stage fully-differential op-amp topologies are presented which amend the impractical topologies widely reported in literature. The fully differential topologies proposed in this work combine improvised biasing schemes and novel common-mode feedback techniques to obtain op-amp topologies which are robust to large offsets. The simulated performance of the fully-differential three- stage op-amps improves by at least three times in performance over the state-of- the-art. A third test chip containing numerous fully-differential op-amps has been designed in the same 0. 5 μm CMOS process and is getting fabricated. The test results for all three-stage op-amps are expected to be close to the simulated performance for this process...|$|R
