40|$|The area of {{cultivated}} land used for organic farming expands every year, as does consumer demand for organic food. Organic farming is a system of land cultivation without chemical inputs, because chemicals can have a negative {{impact on the}} environment, human health as well as health of farm animals. An important part of organic farming are also various sowing methods based on the alternation of a broad range of different crops. <b>Dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum spelta, also known as spelt or hulled wheat), is ideally suited for this system, as it is less demanding in terms of external environmental conditions than bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, also known as common wheat. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to gain insight {{about the impact of}} the seeding rate on the yield and the consequent profit from <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> in organic farming. A second objective was to evaluate any differences in the values of selected quality indicators of grain, depending on the seed rate. Finally, on the basis of the obtained results, to choose the seeding rate which proved to be ideal in given conditions. The results of our experiments with selected genotypes of spring and winter <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> and control varieties of bread wheat sown in different seeding rates (100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 germinable seeds per m 2) in the organic way of farming in the Research Station in Prague - Uhříněves show that the spring genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> had a peak of offsetting almost a month later, in comparison with the control variety of spring bread wheat. Winter genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> had this peak of offsetting approximately two weeks later than the control variety of winter bread wheat. Both <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> and the control variety of bread wheat from low seeding rates (1. 0 and 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha) offset more as expected, and simultaneously achieved a higher average weight of dry aboveground biomass and biomass of the roots per plant than plants of high seeding rates (4. 0 and especially 5. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). The evaluated genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> compared to the control varieties of bread wheat were generally characterized by intense offsetting, higher weight of dry aboveground biomass, and especially higher weight of dry matter of roots per plant. Achieved yields were negatively influenced by the course of weather conditions, especially by the drought throughout most of the vegetation period in 2015 - spring varieties of wheat, however, were affected by the drought far more than winter wheat. Based on the resulting yields, we can say that in our experiment the spring genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> had the highest yields in the seeding rate of 4. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha, for winter <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> the best seeding rate was 3. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha (however, variety of Rubiota had a high yield already with the seeding rate of 2. 0 million of germinable seeds/ha). To specify the information, it is needed to obtain results from more years. From the evaluated genotypes, the yield of white spring <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> slightly outperformed the control variety of bread wheat Granny and in particular the second genotype of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat,</b> T. spelta KEW. In the case of winter varieties, the yield of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> Alkor outperformed the second variety of winter <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> Rubiota as well as the control variety of bread wheat Penalta. The evaluation of qualitative parameters showed that genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> outperformed the control varieties of bread wheat, especially in the content of N-substances and wet gluten content in grain dry matter. Both spring genotypes of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> also achieved very good results in the Zeleny sedimentation test - both exceeded the minimum value required from wheat for bakeries (30 ml). Also winter varieties of <b>dinkel</b> <b>wheat</b> Rubiota exceeded this limit. The number of decrease was high in the evaluated varieties of winter wheat, while spring wheat was negatively affected by sprouting due to the rainy weather just before the harvest. The level of seeding rate had no effect on the values of qualitative indicators...|$|E
40|$|In {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} phylogenetic donors of cytoplasm to Emmer-Dinkel and Timopheevi groups of wheat (Triticum), and the Aegilops kotschyi-Ae. variabilis complex, the restriction fragment patterns of chloroplast DNAs of representative species were {{compared with those of}} their putative diploid ancestors. The following seven restriction enzymes were used; BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, KpnI, PstI, SmaI and XhoI. The restriction fragment patterns of an Emmer and a <b>Dinkel</b> (common) <b>wheat</b> were identical with those of Ae. longissima, and different from those of Ae. aucheri, Ae. bicornis, Ae. searsii, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. speltoides, and T. urartu by 4 to 12 fragments. The restriction fragment patterns of a Timopheevi wheat were identical with those of Ae. aucheri, and different from those of all other diploids by four to nine fragments. The restriction fragment patterns of Ae. variabilis were identical to those of Ae. bicornis and Ae. searsii, and different from those of all other species. Thus, we have concluded that Ae. longissima, Ae. aucheri and Ae. bicornis (or Ae. searsii) were the cytoplasm donors to the Emmer-Dinkel and the Timopheevi groups, and the Ae. kotschyi-Ae. variabilis complex, respectively. A diphyletic origin of Emmer and Timopheevi groups is supported by the present results...|$|R
