For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E

5|$|Taylor Swift is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, {{released}} on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records. Swift was 16 {{years old at}} the time of the album's release and wrote its songs during her freshman year of high school. Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Musically, the album is country music styled, and lyrically <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one. Lyrics also touch on Swift's personal struggles in high school.|$|E
5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. <b>It</b> <b>speaks</b> of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E

Vocals on this song were provided by Jacqueline Govaert of Krezip. Arjen Lucassen has stated that this is his least favorite Ayreon song.|$|E
25|$|Akilattirattu {{projected}} {{to the imagination}} of the followers of Ayyavazhi an ideal society where the caste discrimination did not exist. In its account of the past, Akilattirattu speaks of an age in which people lived as one family without the discrimination of caste. It blames the kalineesan for dividing the people on the basis of caste. <b>It</b> <b>speaks</b> of a future when Ayya Vaikundar will rule all the people with equality.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} a {{negative}} relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed {{to have a higher}} spiritual quality of life on a spiritual well-being scale had less depressive symptoms. Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> to one’s ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients.|$|E

25|$|Nechtan's ecclesiastical {{reforms are}} seen as having led to closer links between Pictland and Northumbria, with notable results in artistic forms. His {{expulsion}} of Ionan clerics, rather than being a submission to Rome and Northumbria, probably marks the coming of age of an independent Pictish church, which nonetheless remained close to Iona and to Ireland. In addition, <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> to a very considerable degree of royal control over the church in Pictland, which {{appears to have been}} contentious in the ninth century.|$|E

25|$|On January 6, 1773, black petitioners {{submitted}} {{the first of}} five appeals written during the year, asking {{for a range of}} rights, to Governor Hutchinson and the General Court of Massachusetts. Though signed only by a slave named Felix, the document petitioned for the freedom and rights of all slaves in the Massachusetts colony. While the tone of the petition is cautious, <b>it</b> <b>speaks</b> to the “unhappy State and Condition” in which enslaved persons are forced to live. Abolitionists later published the petition as a pamphlet, along with letters and other abolitionist documents. Felix’s petition expressed the talk of freedom, liberty, {{and the pursuit of happiness}} that was circulating around Massachusetts and other American colonies before the American Revolution. No record of a response from the Massachusetts General Court exists. Although slavery was never explicitly abolished or prohibited in the new Massachusetts Constitution after the Revolutionary War, rulings in freedom suits by Mum Bett and Quock Walker established that its representation of rights was incompatible with slavery, and remaining slaves effectively gained their freedom.|$|E

500|$|Critical opinion {{has been}} divided on The Good Terrorist.

The Irish literary critic Denis Donoghue complained that {{the style of the}} novel is [...] "insistently drab", and Kuehn referred to Lessing's text as [...] "surprisingly bland".
