5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general <b>dullness</b> of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} {{of the federal government}} has shaped every facet of the city of Ottawa, and its architecture has been dramatically affected for both good and ill. Ottawa exists as a major city almost solely because it was selected to be the capital of the new nation of Canada, and the federal government remains the dominant employer in the city. Many of Ottawa's most acclaimed structures are the result of federal government projects, but the affinity for cheapness and blandness of recent government building has also {{played a central role in}} Ottawa's perceived architectural <b>dullness.</b>|$|E
25|$|West in 1930 {{and later}} P. G. A. H. Voigt (1940) {{showed that the}} early Wente-style {{condenser}} microphones contributed to a 4 to 6dB midrange brilliance or pre-emphasis in the recording chain. This meant that the electrical recording characteristics of Western Electric licensees such as Columbia Records and Victor Talking Machine Company in the 1925 era had a higher amplitude in the midrange region. Brilliance such as this compensated for <b>dullness</b> in many early magnetic pickups having drooping midrange and treble response. As a result, this practice was the empirical beginning of using pre-emphasis above 1,000Hz in 78rpm and rpm records.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} the official university lectures, but complained that most were stupid and boring, {{and found himself}} too sensitive {{to the sight of}} blood. He was disgusted by the dull and outdated anatomy lectures of professor Alexander Monro tertius, and later regretted his failure to persevere and learn dissection. Munro's lectures included vehement opposition to George Combe's daringly materialist ideas of phrenology. As the exception to the general <b>dullness,</b> the spectacular chemistry lectures of Thomas Charles Hope were greatly enjoyed by the brothers, but they did not join a student society giving hands-on experience. Darwin regularly attended clinical wards in the hospital despite his great distress about some of the cases, but could only bear to attend surgical operations twice, rushing away before they were completed due to his distress at the brutality of surgery before anaesthetics. He was long haunted by the memory, particularly of an operation on a child.|$|E
25|$|Ballad operas {{developed}} {{as a form of}} English stage entertainment, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene. It consisted of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that were deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was The Beggar's Opera of 1728, with a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by John Christopher Pepusch, both of whom probably influenced by Parisian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work. Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title Polly and he was followed by many other composers. There was also a general revival in English language opera in the 1730s, largely attributed to Thomas Arne, the first English composer to experiment with Italian-style all-sung comic opera, unsuccessfully in The Temple of <b>Dullness</b> (1745), Henry and Emma (1749) and Don Saverio (1750), but triumphantly in Thomas and Sally (1760). His opera Artaxerxes (1762) was the first attempt to set a full-blown opera seria in English and was a huge success, holding the stage until the 1830s. Arne {{played a major role in}} moving the ballad opera into a more pastoral form, together with Isaac Bickerstaffe producing Love in a Village (1763) using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. It was followed by other works like William Shield's Rosina (1781). Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the eighteenth century, it was maintained into the nineteenth century by figures such as Charles Dibdin and his family and its influence can be seen in light operas like those of Gilbert and Sullivan's, particularly their early works like The Sorcerer (1877).|$|E

500|$|Dickson Wright also {{comments}} on the early signs in Modern Cookery of what she considers the increasing <b>dullness</b> of Victorian cookery. Although she finds Acton [...] "in most respects an admirable cookery writer", she observes that {{between the first and}} the third editions Acton has gone from using garlic sparingly to avoiding it entirely. She is equally scathing about Acton's [...] "Burlington Whimsey" [...] which she calls [...] "basically a dish of brawn"; she argues that the Victorians were too fond of it, and that Acton's recipe is [...] "the epitome of dull food dressed up to look whimsical." ...|$|E

The review praised the game for its attention to detail and challenge and noted that players need to master certain gameplay skills to move on. Criticisms included a [...] "lack of variety" [...] and <b>dullness</b> in gameplay, {{in which it was}} compared to a [...] "visit to the tax office". The PC Engine version was briefly mentioned in the December1991 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly as part of a review of games that have been released outside the U.S. They noted the faithful translation from the NES version as well as the revamped and more detailed graphics; they said that [...] "PC Engine owners should not miss this one!" ...|$|E

[...] In 1970, art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, [...] "uniform in their <b>dullness,</b> lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [...] Sully, [...] Peale, [...] Hughes, and Gobrecht" [...] and [...] "whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he {{seems not to have}} brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.|$|E
500|$|Shoe polish was to {{be found}} just about {{everywhere}} Allied troops ventured. American war correspondent Walter Graeber wrote for TIME magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that [...] "old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay {{side by side with}} empty bottles of Chianti." [...] A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. [...] American soldiers were then finding the <b>dullness</b> of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Goebbels {{wrote that}} on {{looking at the}} film that he was [...] "struck by the <b>dullness</b> of its portrayal, the {{coarseness}} of its construction, and the inadequacy of its acting." [...] Despite Goebbels statement, he would present the film uncensored {{from time to time}} in private screening rooms for close personal friends. On the French release, The New York Times wrote that [...] "It is the French version of Fritz Lang's production, [...] "Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse" [...] ("Dr. Mabuse's Will"). It is a hallucinating and horrifying story, depicted with great power and the extraordinary beauty of photography that Lang has led his admirers to expect." [...] At the Hungarian premiere of the German-language print in 1933, Variety wrote that the film [...] "...certainly shows the influence of American mystery pictures. The story is very long-winded and even an ingenious director like Fritz Lang could not prevent its being rather slow-moving in places." ...|$|E
500|$|Another 585runs at 83.57 in the 192526 season looked {{likely to}} win Kippax {{a place in the}} team to tour England in 1926. He failed in the Test-trial match staged in early December, but made the highest score of the Sheffield Shield competition, 271 not out (in 423minutes) against Victoria at the SCG, which {{effectively}} steered NSW to the title. The subsequent omission of Kippax from the touring team is a famous blunder in Australian cricket history. Although Kippax was nearly 29, former Australian captain Monty Noble called the non-selection a [...] "crime against the cricketing youth of Australia". His omission is usually attributed to [...] "interstate parochialism" [...] and was a [...] "triumph of <b>dullness</b> over batting artistry." [...] Australia surrendered the Ashes on the tour, with much of the blame for the loss directed at the team’s skipper, Herbie Collins. After he returned to Australia, administrators relieved Collins of the captaincy of his grade team and NSW, thus creating an opportunity for Kippax.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales. In the first number, along with the promise to avoid the <b>dullness</b> of other periodicals, Fielding confronted [...] "the armies of Grub Street" [...] and proclaimed his disdain for the literary critics of the day: [...] "As to my brother authors, who, like mere mechanics, are envious and jealous of a rival in their trade, to silence their jealousies and fears, I declare {{that it is not}} my intention to encroach on the business now carried on by them, nor to deal in any of those wares which they at present vend to the public." [...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E
500|$|The {{mathematician}} Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, {{stating that}} [...] "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not <b>dullness</b> and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research. King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy's 1940 essay A Mathematician's Apology. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate, namely Euclid's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers, and the {{proof that the}} square root of 2 is irrational. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for mathematical elegance: [...] "seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy" [...] (King's italics), and describes the proof as [...] "aesthetically pleasing". The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: [...] "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is Beethoven's Ninth Symphony beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I know numbers are beautiful." ...|$|E

The house, a Victorian pseudo-Gothic {{pastiche}} described as architecturally [...] "devoid of interest" [...] by a local guide book and [...] "ugly" [...] by his wife, but is Tony's pride and joy. Entirely content with country life, he is seemingly unaware of Brenda's increasing boredom and dissatisfaction, and of his son's developing waywardness. Brenda meets John Beaver and, despite acknowledging his <b>dullness</b> and insignificance, she begins an affair with him. Brenda starts spending her weeks in London, and persuades Tony to finance a small flat, which she rents from John's mother, Mrs Beaver, an unscrupulous property developer. Although the Brenda–Beaver liaison is well known to their London friends, Tony remains uxorious and oblivious; attempts by Brenda and her friends to set him up with a mistress are absurdly unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger {{forces were}} assembled. Bernard Shaw, {{in his role}} as a music critic, commented, [...] "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, [...] "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous <b>dullness</b> of a Handel Festival does not {{somebody}} set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in St James's Hall with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." [...] The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had [...] the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that [...] "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion." ...|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1930s, {{representatives from}} Lancashire County Cricket Club twice {{approached}} Constantine {{with a view}} to him joining the club—his time in Nelson meant that he qualified to play for Lancashire, having lived in the county for the required time. There was a precedent for such a course, as the Australian Ted McDonald had joined Lancashire after playing as Nelson's professional in the 1920s. In the case of Constantine nothing happened, as members of the Lancashire Board and, later, players in the team opposed the idea of a black man playing for the county. In any case Constantine preferred league cricket to what he perceived was the negativity and <b>dullness</b> of county cricket. He found the standard of play very high, stating: [...] "Never in my life have I played harder than in Lancashire." [...] In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley writes that league cricket at this time was intense and unrelenting, but: [...] "it was in this special atmosphere of League cricket that Constantine was supreme." ...|$|E
