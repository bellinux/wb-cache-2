Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher than hers in math; {{if she is}} successful, Chanda promises {{to drop out of}} school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set their judgment on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

500|$|Joyce {{tested the}} sea-ice on 18 April {{and found it}} firm, but the {{following}} day a blizzard from the south swept all the ice away. The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how these people are so anxious to risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E
500|$|Strength of mind, {{by which}} Wollstonecraft meant [...] "the {{degree to which}} [...] can {{independently}} reach its own conclusions" [...] (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the [...] "correct" [...] actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful sensibility and a harmful sensualism. She writes: [...] "sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses." [...] Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able {{to understand what the}} poor around her require.|$|E

IOS successfully petitioned the Delhi High Court to bar him from entering into any deal with Percept.|$|E
500|$|Traditional Chinese {{literary}} criticism emphasized {{the life of}} the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to [...] "the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, [...] "The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that we either misunderstand the poem or <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it altogether". [...] Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the [...] "reductive" [...] categorizations used for more limited poets.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Schumpeter was an {{economist}} {{of the same}} age as Keynes and one of his main rivals. He was among the first reviewers to argue that Keynes's General Theory was not a general theory, but in fact a special case. He said the work expressed [...] "the attitude of a decaying civilisation". After Keynes's death Schumpeter wrote a brief biographical piece Keynes the Economist – on a personal level he was very positive about Keynes as a man, praising his pleasant nature, courtesy and kindness. He assessed some of Keynes's biographical and editorial work as among the best he'd ever seen. Yet Schumpeter remained critical about Keynes's economics, linking Keynes's childlessness to what Schumpeter saw as an essentially short term view. He considered Keynes to have a kind of unconscious patriotism that caused him to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the problems of other nations. For Schumpeter [...] "Practical Keynesianism is a seedling which cannot be transplanted into foreign soil: it dies there and becomes poisonous as it dies." ...|$|E

500|$|Duerr {{provides}} additional ethnographic examples {{showing how}} societal rules were reversed at special {{times of the}} year. In shamanic terms, societies which espouse an [...] "archaic mentality" [...] understand who they are by understanding who they are not; according to Duerr, modern societies <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> this concept. [...] Datura, a plant that contains toxic hallucinogens is discussed. [...] The plant was introduced to Europe in the early modern period. [...] Among the Huichol people of central Mexico, shamans have told anthropologists that Datura is used by malevolent witches. Duerr makes note of the anthropologists who have undertaken shamanic experiences with the people they are studying, such as Barbara Myerhoff and Carlos Castenada, but argues that such ethnographers have failed to truly understand what shamans mean when they describe their experiences as [...] "flying". In Duerr's view, shamans learn to evaporate their [...] "ego boundaries", thereby experiencing themselves in a different way; it is this feeling that {{can be described as}} shamanic flying. Duerr ties these shamanic practices into the werewolves of early modern Europe, arguing that these werewolves did not physically transform into wolves, but that they embraced their [...] "wolf nature" [...] by crossing over the boundary from [...] "civilisation" [...] to [...] "wilderness".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Stephen's brother-in-law, Alexander, {{seized the}} Principality of Theodoro in the Crimea {{at the head}} of a Moldavian army. Stephen also decided to expel his former protégé, Basarab Laiotă, from Wallachia, because Basarab had {{supported}} the Ottomans during their invasion of Moldavia. He made an alliance with Matthias Corvinus in July, persuading him to release Basarab's rival, Vlad Dracula, who had been imprisoned in Hungary in 1462. Stephen and Vlad made an agreement to put an end to the conflicts between Moldavia and Wallachia, but Corvinus did not support them to invade Wallachia. The Ottomans occupied the Principality of Theodoro and the Genoese colonies in the Crimea before the end of 1475. Stephen ordered the execution of the Ottoman prisoners in Moldavia to take vengeance for the massacre of Alexander of Theodoro and his Moldavian retainers. Thereafter the Venetians, who had waged war against the Ottomans since 1463, regarded Stephen as their principal ally. With their support, Stephen's envoys tried to persuade the Holy See to finance Stephen's war directly, instead of sending the funds to Matthias Corvinus. The Signoria of Venice emphasized, [...] "No one should <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the extent to which Stephen could influence the evolution of events, one way or another", referring to his preeminent role in the anti-Ottoman alliance.|$|E
500|$|Peter Gaston of Spin {{wrote that}} the video for [...] "Hard" [...] resembles [...] "Janet Jackson's 'Rhythm Nation' meets Christina Aguilera's 'Dirrty' phase—Rihanna vamps in dimly lit outposts, dodges explosions in the desert, and, quite enticingly, takes a break from boot camp to smother herself with mud. Morale-boosting, indeed!" [...] James Dinh of MTV News showed the video, on a small player, to fans in Times Square in New York City to ask their opinions. Most said she looked [...] "sexy" [...] in the video, and {{agreed that it was}} {{different}} from previous videos and shows where she came from and where she is going in her personal life. Bill Lamb of About.com wrote, [...] "I must confess that I do <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the point of Rihanna humping the gun turret of a pink tank dressed in Mickey Mouse ears. It seems pains were taken to make the setting look like Afghanistan or Iraq with the other actors looking as close to real military personnel as possible." [...] Lamb criticized the video's lack of sensitivity and respect for using an army and weapons of destruction to glamorize war, saying, [...] "Does Def Jam, Rihanna's label, need to be reminded that this comes on the heels of sadly sending off an additional 30,000 troops from our country to real war? In my mind {{this is one of the}} most tasteless, offensive moves by a major pop artist in recent memory." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will still be there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E
500|$|Le Guin {{described}} {{the role of}} magic in the novel in the following manner: [...] "in Gifts, the powers of magic are kind of warped. They are mostly used aggressively and destructively and defensively, actually. You know, it’s like having that secret weapon that they use against each other. It’s all gone kind of sour." [...] The characters in the novel often <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the responsibility {{that goes along with}} their power; only {{by the end of the}} story do Orrec and Gry come to terms with their gifts, and understand the best way to use them. Orrec's power is misunderstood for much of the novel: he has inherited his mother's ability to tell stories, rather than his father's ability to unmake things. However, he also has power in his reputation, as a person to be feared. Much of the novel is concerned with the abuse of power, and the problems with following without thinking of consequences, as well as the violence that is contained in the Upland society. Although Orrec's father Canoc he too does not hesitate to use his power for his own ends: his wife Melle was taken in a raid, over the course of which Canoc slew another man. He nonetheless shows more forethought than some of the other characters in the novel, and actually asks Melle to be his wife; he also gives gifts to her town in return. Melle's stories form an important part of the children's morality, featuring as they do a number of characters exhibiting kindness and altruism, in contrast to the Upland culture. The violence within the Upland society is exemplified in the person of Ogge Drum, who is depicted as a thief and a bully. He lusts after Melle, and kills her with his gift when he realizes he cannot have her.|$|E
