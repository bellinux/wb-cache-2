5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious <b>field.</b> <b>Current</b> classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications {{rely heavily on}} the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms (molecular phylogenetics). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla, the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Other groups have been tentatively created. For example, the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans, which was discovered in 2003, has been given its own phylum, the Nanoarchaeota. A new phylum Korarchaeota has also been proposed. It contains a small group of unusual thermophilic species that shares features of both of the main phyla, but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota. Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN, comprising Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known.|$|E
25|$|Early {{automobile}} {{generators and}} alternators had a mechanical voltage regulator using one, two, or three relays and various resistors {{to stabilize the}} generator's output at slightly more than 6 or 12 V, independent of the engine's rpm or the varying load on the vehicle's electrical system. Essentially, the relay(s) employed pulse width modulation to regulate {{the output of the}} generator, controlling the <b>field</b> <b>current</b> reaching the generator (or alternator) and in this way controlling the output voltage producing back into the generator and attempting to run it as a motor. The rectifier diodes in an alternator automatically perform this function so that a specific relay is not required; this appreciably simplified the regulator design.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon pile}} {{resistor}} {{is made of}} a stack of carbon disks compressed between two metal contact plates. Adjusting the clamping pressure changes the resistance between the plates. These resistors are used when an adjustable load is required, for example in testing automotive batteries or radio transmitters. A carbon pile resistor {{can also be used}} as a speed control for small motors in household appliances (sewing machines, hand-held mixers) with ratings up to a few hundred watts. A carbon pile resistor can be incorporated in automatic voltage regulators for generators, where the carbon pile controls the <b>field</b> <b>current</b> to maintain relatively constant voltage. The principle is also applied in the carbon microphone.|$|E
40|$|Totally {{symmetric}} arbitrary spin {{fields in}} AdS space, conformal <b>fields,</b> conformal <b>currents,</b> and shadow <b>fields</b> in flat space are studied. Light-cone formulation for such <b>fields,</b> <b>currents,</b> and shadows is obtained. Use of the Poincare parametrization of AdS space {{allows us to}} treat fields in flat and AdS spaces on equal footing. Light-cone gauge realization of relativistic symmetries for <b>fields,</b> <b>currents,</b> and shadows is also obtained. The light-cone formulation for fields is obtained by using the gauge invariant Lagrangian which is presented {{in terms of the}} modified de Donder divergence, while the light-cone formulation for currents and shadows is obtained by using gauge invariant approach to currents and shadows. This allows us to demonstrate explicitly how ladder operators entering the gauge invariant formulation of <b>fields,</b> <b>currents,</b> and shadows manifest themselves in the light-cone formulation for <b>fields,</b> <b>currents,</b> and shadows.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} wave-current {{numerical model}} is presented for the simulation of irregular wave characteristics in a <b>current</b> <b>field.</b> The model {{is based on}} the Madsen type extended Boussinesq equation and a wave-current dispersion relationship (Mohiuddin et al. 1999, 2000). The model is applied to the following current and adverse <b>current</b> <b>fields.</b> Numerical results show the modification of spectral density in a <b>current</b> <b>field</b> and it is also found that modification of spectral density depends on the current direction and its magnitude. Spectral densities decrease in a following <b>current</b> <b>field</b> and increase in an adverse <b>current</b> <b>field.</b> In an adverse <b>current</b> <b>field,</b> the spectral peak shifts towards to the higher frequency, but there is no substantial shift of the spectral peak for waves on following currents.

50|$|A shunt {{generator}} {{is a type}} {{of direct}} current electric generator in which field winding and armature winding are connected in parallel, and in which the armature supplies both the load current and the <b>field</b> <b>current.</b> A direct current (DC) generator, not using a permanent magnet, requires a DC <b>field</b> <b>current</b> for excitation.

40|$|Based on {{theoretical}} {{investigation on}} {{characteristics of the}} <b>field</b> emission <b>current</b> of Dirac/Weyl semimetals, the dependence of the <b>field</b> emission <b>current</b> on the applied bias is deduced and studied. This theoretical study demonstrates that the <b>field</b> emission <b>current</b> of a Dirac semimetal is much smaller {{than that of a}} conventional material when they have similar carrier parameters. This makes Dirac semimetal a better candidate for gate/base electrode material than gold and other conventional metals for an ultra-thin gate oxide metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor. The <b>field</b> emission <b>current</b> of a Dirac semimetal decreases with the effective electron mass, while it increases for a conventional material.

50|$|Automotive alternators {{require a}} voltage {{regulator}} which operates by modulating the small <b>field</b> <b>current</b> to produce a constant voltage at the battery terminals. Early designs (c.1960s-1970s) used a discrete device mounted elsewhere in the vehicle. Intermediate designs (c.1970s-1990s) incorporated the voltage regulator into the alternator housing. Modern designs {{do away with the}} voltage regulator altogether; voltage regulation is now a function of the electronic control unit (ECU). The <b>field</b> <b>current</b> is much smaller than the output current of the alternator; for example, a 70 A alternator may need only 7 A of <b>field</b> <b>current.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>current</b> is supplied to the rotor windings by slip rings. The low current and relatively smooth slip rings ensure greater reliability and longer life than that obtained by a DC generator with its commutator and higher current being passed through its brushes.|$|E
50|$|DC drives are DC {{motor speed}} control systems. Since {{the speed of}} a DC motor is {{directly}} proportional to armature voltage and inversely proportional to motor flux (which is a function of <b>field</b> <b>current),</b> either armature voltage or <b>field</b> <b>current</b> can be used to control speed. Several types of DC motors are described in the electric motor article. The electric motor article also describes electronic speed controls used with various types of DC motors.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternator}} rotor {{is made up}} of a {{wire coil}} enveloped around an iron core. The magnetic component of the rotor is made from steel laminations to aid stamping conductor slots to specific shapes and sizes. As currents travel through the wire coil a magnetic field is created around the core, which is referred to as <b>field</b> <b>current.</b> The <b>field</b> <b>current</b> strength controls the power level of the magnetic field. Direct current (DC) drives the <b>field</b> <b>current</b> in one direction, and is delivered to the wire coil by a set of brushes and slip rings. Like any magnet, the magnetic field produced has a north and a south pole. The normal clockwise direction of the motor that the rotor is powering can be manipulated by using the magnets and magnetic fields installed {{in the design of the}} rotor, allowing the motor to run in reverse or counterclockwise.|$|E
