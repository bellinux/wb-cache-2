40|$|Realizing that {{conduction}} currents couldn’t sufficiently {{explain the}} behavior of capacitors, Maxwell postulated the existence of <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> and {{changed the face of}} electromagnetics forever. Conduction currents (Jf) involve the transport of “free ” electrical charges, and in Ampere’s law (∇ × H = Jf) they are the sole source of curled magnetic fields.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of mechanical}} activation of intact fibres were examined with a voltage-clamp technique. Tetracaine (2 mM) increases fifteen- to seventyfold {{the time required}} to produce a just visible contraction by cell membrane depolarization. 2. <b>Displacement</b> <b>currents</b> thought to be related to contractile activation remain in 2 mM tetracaine. Their characteristics are virtually identical to those found {{in the absence of the}} drug. <b>Displacement</b> <b>currents</b> also remain in fibres immobilized by treatment with 10 mM formaldehyde. 3.

It is estimated that 2 mM tetracaine diminishes more than tenfold the capacity for Ca 2 +-release in response to cell membrane depolarization. 5. If muscle <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> represent events linking depolarization to Ca 2 +-release, then tetracaine must be able to block the release without affecting the potential-sensing portion of the release regulating mechanism. 6.

40|$|Abstract − Power {{distribution}} {{lines are}} {{a major source of}} interference in ECG recordings obtained with surface electrodes. <b>Displacement</b> <b>currents</b> coupled to electrodes, their leads and directly into the body, and stray capacitance in power supply transformers, result into differential-mode, common-mode and isolation-mode interference. Shielding electrode leads reduces <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> coupled to them. Amplifiers with high common-mode and isolationmode rejection ratio reduce common-mode and isolationmode interference, but interference coupled in differential mode cannot be reduced by shielding neither by amplifier design. We propose the use of a grounded electrode close to each recording electrode instead of the customary “rightleg” ground electrode, to reduce differential-mode interference. We provide a qualitative model to explain that interference reduction, and experimental evidence to show its effectiveness even for non-isolated recording systems in the presence of strong power-line interference...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the lipophilic, {{cationic}} fluorescent dyes R 18 and Dil translocate from one monolayer of a phospholipid bilayer membrane to {{the other in a}} concentration and voltage-dependent manner. When the probes were incorporated into voltage-clamped planar membranes and potentials were applied, <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> resulted. The charged probes sensed a large fraction of the applied field. When these probes were added to only one monolayer, <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> were symmetrical around 0 mV, indicating that the probes distributed equally between the two monolayers. Charge translocation required that the bilayer be fluid. When membranes were in a condensed gel phase, <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> were not observed; raising the temperature to above the gel-liquid crystalline transition restored the currents. Translocation of R 18 was also shown by fluorescence measurements. When R 18 was in the bilayer at high, self-quenching concentrations, voltage pulses led to voltage-dependent fluorescence changes. The kinetics of the fluorescence changes and charge translocations correlated. Adding the quencher I- to one aqueous phase caused fluorescence to decrease or increase when voltage moved R 18 toward or away from the quencher at low, nonquenching concentrations of R 18. In contrast to R 18, Dil incorporated into bilayers was a carrier fo I-, and hence I- altered Dil currents. Voltage-driven translocations allow R 18 and Dil to be used to probe membrane potential changes...|$|R
40|$|A {{modelling}} of interface construction {{relating to}} power-line interference phenomenon was described. Source of interference was <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> which flowed from AC power-line configuration (APC) to a model. The interference depends on some factors: {{distance between the}} APC and a model; length of unshielded leads; position of the APC in vertical or horizontal direction; and skin-electrode impedances which were balance or unbalanced. The position of APC and skin-electrode impedances were important in contributing of the interference. The interference was still large even though skin-electrode impedances were balance. This {{was caused by the}} disagreement in two <b>displacement</b> <b>currents.</b> It was overcame by adjustment of APC in vertical direction. As a result, total interference would be very small or zero. The result shows that interference in ECG signal recording can be eliminated to about 10 μV. Although interference of power-lines is a complicated phenomenon, the problem is easier to understand by using this modelling. 生体電気信号の測定における電力線からの誘導障害についての研究が多く報告されているが，この現象についての説明が十分なされていなかった。本研究では，この現象を簡単なインターフェイスモデルを用いて説明した。誘導障害の原因として，電極の導線が作るループ内に発生する誘導起電力，システムの変位電流，生体アンプ内で発生する雑音等があげられる。本研究においては，電力線と導線との静電結合によってその間を流れる変位電流と被験者と電極間のインピーダンスに注目した。この変位電流による誘導は，いくつかの要素に依存している。それらは，・被験者と電力線との距離，・被験者に対する電力線の方向，・導線のシールドされていない部分の長さ，・被験者と電極間のインピーダンスである。そこで，被験者と電力線との距離や導線のシールドされていない部分の長さなどを変化させて，心電図の測定を行った。被験者と電極間のインピーダンスを調整できるように，可変抵抗を用いたRC並列回路をそれぞれの導線に直列に接続した。また，導線のループに発生する誘導起電力をできるだけ小さくするために，導線を互いに撚ってループ面積を小さくした。誘導雑音は，以下の場合に大きくなった。・電力線の距離が近い。・導線のシールドされてない部分が長い。・被験者と電極間のインピーダンスが大きく，不均衡である。また，被験者と電極間のインピーダンスを等しくした場合でも，誘導雑音が観測された。電力線の位置により各導線と電力線との静電結合状態が異なり，各導線に流れる変位電流が等しくないことが誘導雑音の原因であることを示した。本研究では被験者と電極間のインピーダンスおよび変位電流による誘導雑音の影響について検討した。この現象の理解は誘導障害の除去に大変有益なものである...|$|R

This letter addresses this issue and reports the application of the complete and standard, three-dimensional full-vector Maxwell’s equations FDTD method to modeling CSEM hydrocarbon detection.

40|$|The {{approach}} to calculating the effective dielectric and magnetic response in bounded composite materials is developed. The method is essentially {{based on the}} renormalisation of the dielectric matrix parameters {{to account for the}} surface polarisation and the <b>displacement</b> <b>currents</b> at the interfaces. This makes it possible the use of the effective medium theory developed for unbounded materials, where the spatially-dependent local dielectric constant and magnetic permeability are introduced. A detailed mathematical analysis is given for a dielectric layer having conducting fibres with in-plane positions. The surface effects are most essential at microwave frequencies in correspondence to the resonance excitation of fibres. In thin layers (having a thickness of the transition layer), the effective dielectric constant has a dispersion region at much higher frequencies compared to those for unbounded materials, exhibiting a strong dependence on the layer thickness. For the geometry considered, the effective magnetic permeability differs slightly from unity and corresponds to the renormalised matrix parameter.

Uniqueness {{and stability of}} the 2 -D models are assessed with a model variance and resolution analysis that allows for the non-linearity of the inverse problem. Model variance and resolution are estimated with a truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD) of the sensitivity matrix.

Non-linear error estimates are verified with most-squares inversions. For the obtained truncation levels, model resolution matrices are computed. For RMT data, non-linear error appraisals are smaller than linearized ones. Hence, the consideration of the non-linearity in RMT data leads to reduced model errors or enhanced model resolution. The dielectric effect on RMT data is investigated with a new 2 -D forward and inverse code that allows for <b>displacement</b> <b>currents.</b> As compared to the quasi-static approximation, apparent resistivities and phases of the impedance tensor elements are found to be significantly smaller and the vertical magnetic transfer function exhibits more distinct sign reversals.
