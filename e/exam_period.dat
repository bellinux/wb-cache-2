40|$|Background—Analysis {{of dietary}} {{patterns}} is prominent in nutrition literatures, yet {{few studies have}} taken advantage of multiple repeated measurements {{to understand the nature of}} individual-level changes over time in food choice, nor the relation between these changes and BMI. Objective—To investigate changes in eating patterns at the individual level across three <b>exam</b> <b>periods,</b> and to prospectively examine the relation of eating trajectories to BMI at the cohort level. Design—The study included 3 418 participants at baseline. Clinically measured BMI and dietary intake were assessed during three <b>exam</b> <b>periods</b> between 1991 and 2001 using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. An individual’s eating trajectory across <b>exam</b> <b>periods</b> was analyzed using sequence analysis and then used to estimate outcomes of continuous BMI and categorical obesity status. OLS regression models with robust standard errors adjusted for socioeconomic and demographic confounders, baseline BMI, and baseline eating. Results— 66. 2 % (n= 1 614) of participants change their diet pattern during the study period; 33. 8 % (n= 823) remain stable. After accounting for potential confounders, an unhealthful trajectory is significantly associated with a 0. 42 kg/m 2 increase in BMI (CI: 0. 1, 0. 7). Those wit...|$|R
