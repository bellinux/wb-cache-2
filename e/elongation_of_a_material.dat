40|$|The {{stress-strain}} curve of a material is calculated on {{the hypothesis that}} when flow occurs {{a section of the}} molecular chain constituting the material changes from a configuration A to a con-figuration B and thereby becomes unable to elongate again. Except for a small elastic deformation of both structures, the elongation is proportional to the fraction of the material in the B configura-tion. The two components are assumed to be in solution with one another, and the rates of trans-formation are then proportional to the relative abundance of the transformed species. These rates are written in the manner of the Eyring theory of reaction rates. Systems of more than two com-ponents are discussed and several examples are calculated. The calculated curves show good qualitative agreement with {{stress-strain curve}}s of the nylon-wool-rubber type. TWO extreme types of visco-elastic behavior can be recognized. If <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>material</b> is ac-companied by an increase in potential energy be-cause the molecules are strained uniformly into new positions, and this transformation is accompanie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It has {{frequently}} been {{observed that the}} ductility or <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>material</b> can significantly be affected by its grain size. Poor ductility with low elongation {{has been found in}} ultrafine-grained (UFG) steels when their grain size is smaller than a critical value. The so called instability of plasticity is a well known drawback for UFG steels and has greatly prevented them from wider application. Although the instability has been attributed to the lack of strain hardening capacity of ultrafine-grained materials, its mechanism is still unclear. In this paper, a newly developed model for predicting the dependence of uniform elongation on grain size is described, using which the instability of plasticity in UFG steels can be explained. The model is based on a strain hardening model for polycrystalline metals that was previously developed by the present author and was modified in the present study to take the grain size effect into account. The uniform elongation calculated using the model is in good agreement with that experimentally measured in two steels. It was found that the elongation begins to decrease rapidly when the grain size is reduced to below 2 µm- a clear sign of the occurrence of the instability of plasticity...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} onset of "necking" and {{subsequent}} filament failure during the transient uniaxial <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> viscoelastic fluid samples in extensional rheometers. In the limit <b>of</b> rapid <b>elongation</b> (such that no molecular relaxation occurs), the external work applied is all stored elastically and the Considere criterion originally developed in solid mechanics {{can be used to}} quantitatively predict the critical Hencky strain to failure. By comparing the predictions of the Doi-Edwards model for linear homopolymer melts with those of the "Pom-Pom" model for prototypical branched melts we show that the critical strain to failure in rapid <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rubbery <b>material</b> is intimately linked to the molecular topology of the chain, especially the degree of chain branching. The onset of necking instability is monotonically shifted to larger Hencky strains as the number of branches is increased. Numerical computations at finite Deborah numbers also show that there is <b>an</b> optimal range <b>of</b> deformation rates over which homogeneous extensions can be maintained to large strain. We also consider other rapid homogeneous stretching deformations, such as biaxial and planar stretching, and show that the degree of stabilization afforded by inclusion of material with long-chain branching is <b>a</b> sensitive function <b>of</b> the imposed mode of deformation...|$|R
40|$|Low pulling forces applied locally to cell surface {{membranes}} produce viscoelastic cell surface protrusions. As {{the force}} increases, the membrane can locally {{separate from the}} cytoskeleton and a tether forms. Tethers can grow to great lengths exceeding the cell diameter. The protrusion-to-tether transition {{is known as the}} crossover. Here we propose a unified approach to protrusions and tethers providing, to our knowledge, new insights into their biomechanics. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a crossover to occur, a formula for predicting the crossover time, conditions for a tether to establish a dynamic equilibrium (characterized by constant nonzero pulling force and tether extension rate), a general formula for the tether material after crossover, and a general modeling method for tether pulling experiments. We introduce two general protrusion parameters, the spring constant and effective viscosity, valid before and after crossover. Their first estimates for neutrophils are 50 pN μm− 1 and 9 pN s μm− 1, respectively. The tether elongation after crossover is described as <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> viscoelastic-like <b>material</b> with <b>a</b> nonlinearly decaying spring (NLDs-viscoelastic material). Our model correctly describes the results of the published protrusion and tether pulling experiments, suggesting that it is universally applicable to such experiments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceStretching and {{compression}} of material fluid elements is key for the understanding and quantification of the dispersionand mixing dynamics in heterogeneous porous media flows, because {{they represent the}} support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transportedsolute. The <b>elongation</b> and compression <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>material</b> strip determine the mixing volume and mixing rateand thus the concentration content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heterogeneous mixture. While linear and exponential elongation dynamicstypical for shear and chaotic flows, respectively, are well understood, the mechanisms that lead toobserved powerlawelongation in heterogeneous porous media are in general unknown. We cast the fluid deformation problem instreamline coordinates, which reveals that the principal elongation mechanism for non-helical steady flows is dueto shear deformation and velocity fluctuations along the streamline. The impact of this coupling on the elongationdynamics is quantified within a continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The CTRW describes the movementof fluid particles in porous media flows through a random in both space and time, in which the transition time over a characteristic velocity length scale `c is coupled kinematically to streamline velocity vs as = `c=vc. In this framework, the elongation process isidentified as a coupled CTRW in which the elongation increment isrelated to the transition time through the velocity-shear coupling. For <b>a</b> broad distribution <b>of</b> transition, as foundin strongly heterogeneous porous media, the elongation is a Lévy process. These dynamics describe a broad rangeof algebraic stretching behaviors with mean strip elongations h`(t) i / t with 1 = 2 < 2.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{thermodynamic}} formulae relating to simple <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> highly elastic <b>material,</b> first obtained by Flory (1) by appeal to the statistical mechanics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Gaussian network, can be derived, without approximation, from <b>a</b> refined form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> phenomenological model <b>of</b> rubberlike thermoelasticity proposed by Chadwick (2). The modification consists of including in the Helmholtz free energy a second distortional response function which implies an energetic contribution to the retractive force / in a stretched strip. Flory's formulae are recovered when neo-Hookean forms of the two distortional response functions are chosen, and corresponding results for non-Gaussian functions are readily drawn from the general analysis given here. As an example, {{the connection between the}} isometric tempera-ture derivatives of / at constant pressure and at constant volume found by Flory (1) is generalized to the case in which the first distortional response function is analogous to Mooney's strain-energy function. 1.

In protrusive structures, multiple actin filaments are arranged in cross-linked webs (as in lamellipodia or pseudopodia) or parallel bundles (as in filopodia). We have used an optical trap to directly measure the forces generated by <b>elongation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few parallel-growing actin filaments brought into apposition with a rigid barrier, mimicking the geometry of filopodial protrusion.
