5|$|A {{prominent}} <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian {{black and}} Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally {{given to the}} First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} door into the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E

The 80-room Algo Inn, the town's largest hotel and retirement residence, was also built into the mall.

5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, dancing was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the dancing armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic dancing was a <b>feature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis.

40|$|Abstract. In <b>the</b> {{second half}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 90 s {{interest}} grew on <b>the</b> complex <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetospheric dynamics in re-sponse to solar wind changes. An important series of pa-pers were published on <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> chaos, turbulence and complexity. Among them, particularly interesting was <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bursty and fractal/multifractal character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high latitude energy release during geomagnetic storms, which was evidenced by analyzing <b>the</b> <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Auroral Electrojet (AE) indices. Recently, <b>the</b> multifractal <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small time-scale increments of AE-indices have been crit-icized {{in favor of}} a more simple fractal behavior. This is par-ticularly true for <b>the</b> scaling <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability den-sity functions (PDFs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AE index increments. Here, after a brief review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractal/multifractal <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnetospheric response to solar wind changes, we in-vestigate <b>the</b> multifractal nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scaling <b>features</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AE index increments PDFs using the Rank Ordering Mul-tifractal Analysis (ROMA) technique. The ROMA results clearly demonstrate <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a hierarchy of scaling indices, depending on the increment amplitude, for <b>the</b> data collapsing <b>of</b> PDFs relative to increments at different time scales.
