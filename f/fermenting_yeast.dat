2500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{a new style}} of wine known as ripasso (meaning [...] "repassed") emerged.

An alternative method is to use partially dried grapes, instead of leftover pomace, which contain less bitter tannins and even more phenolic compounds.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholic {{fermentation}} is {{not completely}} finished when the wine is bottled. It follows that the carbon dioxide is produced by the <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeasts,</b> and where malolactic fermentation has not yet taken place. Unlike the traditional method there is no disgorging and dosage, but the wine is normally filtered. To accomplish this the bottles are emptied, then cleaned and refilled.|$|R
50|$|This pathway is {{also called}} the “Xylose Reductase-Xylitol Dehydrogenase” or XR-XDH pathway. Xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol {{dehydrogenase}} (XDH) are the first two enzymes in this pathway. XR is reducing D-xylose to xylitol using NADH or NADPH. Xylitol is then oxidized to D-xylulose by XDH, using the cofactor NAD. In the last step D-xylulose is phosphorylated by an ATP utilising kinase, XK, to result in D-xylulose-5-phosphate which is an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.Because of the varying cofactors needed in this pathway {{and the degree to}} which they are available for usage, a cofactor imbalance can result in an accumulation of the intermediate xylitol when there is insufficient regeneration of NAD. This typically occurs under oxygen limiting conditions or when non-native xylose <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeasts</b> are engineered with the oxido-reductase pathway. It is less common in native xylose <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeasts</b> that have biochemical mechanisms for regenerating NAD under oxygen limitation.|$|R

50|$|The {{isomerization}} of xylose to xylulose {{has its own}} commercial applications {{as interest}} in biofuels has increased. This reaction is often seen naturally in bacteria that feed on decaying plant matter. Its most common industrial use is {{in the production of}} ethanol, achieved by the fermentation of xylulose. The use of hemicellulose as source material is very common. Hemicellulose contains xylan, which itself is composed of xylose in β(1,4) linkages. The use of glucose isomerase very efficiently converts xylose to xylulose, which can then be acted upon by <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeast.</b> Overall, extensive research in genetic engineering has been invested into optimizing glucose isomerase and facilitating its recovery from industrial applications for re-use.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: In the {{classification}} of yeasts it is customary to use an infusion of bakers’ yeast as the basal medium for fermentation tests. This extract frequently contains variable amounts of trehalose. A number of yeasts were observed to <b>ferment</b> <b>yeast</b> ex-tract and trehalose. The fermentationof yeast extract is serious from a taxonomic point of view, since it gives the impression of positive fermentation of a sugar which actually may not be fermentable. Dilute yeast autolysate should {{be used as the}} basal fermenta-tion medium since during autolysis trehalose is destroyed. The fermentation of yeast extract (without added sugar) is easily observed in Durham tubes by the collection of gas in the inserts, but when Einhorn fermentation tubes are used gas production is seldom apparent. One culture (N- 18) isolated from spoiled apricots, and identified as Candida tropicalis showed adaptive trehalose fermentation. The ability of various <b>yeasts</b> to <b>ferment</b> trehalose was investigated, using 133 cultures, representing twenty genera and seventyTthree species.

40|$|The {{flocculation}} behaviour {{of a large}} set of top {{and bottom}} <b>fermenting</b> brewing <b>yeasts</b> was investigated. Bottom and top fermenting strains flocculated according to different mechanisms.

Top strains flocculated in the stationary growth phase without addition of Ca 2 +, only in the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of ethanol. Some of the top strains were inhibited with mannose, but not with sucrose or galactose, while others were not inhibited by any of these sugars.

Though biodiversity exploration of Enggano {{has been done}} since 1944, {{but there is no}} report for yeast diversity from this island. Due to its industrial interest, xylose <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeast</b> is target for many scientists. This present study aims to isolate xylose assimilating yeast from island of Enggano.

One strain Candida sp. that was isolated from soil could be assigned as a candidate of novel species on base on its morphological and biochemical characteristics along with analyses of gene sequence from D 1 /D 2 domain.

30|$|Cellulose is {{the primary}} {{component}} of lignocellulosic biomass.

Glucuronoxylans (O-acetyl- 4 -O-methylglucuronoxylan) are the most abundant type of hemicellulose, and they make up 15 - 30 % of the dry mass in hardwoods (Girio et al. 2010). Although conventional ethanol <b>fermenting</b> <b>yeasts</b> cannot utilize xylose, we have developed efficient xylose-fermentable Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (Matsushika et al., 2009).
