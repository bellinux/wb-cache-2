5|$|Stress in Mongolian is nonphonemic (does not {{distinguish}} <b>different</b> <b>meanings)</b> {{and thus is}} considered to depend entirely on syllable structure. But scholarly opinions on stress placement diverge sharply. Most native linguists, regardless of which dialect they speak, claim that stress falls on the first syllable. Between 1941 and 1975, several Western scholars proposed that the leftmost heavy syllable gets the stress. Yet other positions were taken in works published between 1835 and 1915.|$|E
5|$|There is no widely agreed criterion-based {{definition}} of a heavy metal. <b>Different</b> <b>meanings</b> may {{be attached to the}} term, depending on the context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, and a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Harvey Greenberg {{presents}} a Freudian reading in his The Movies on Your Mind, {{in which the}} transgressions which prevent Rick from returning to the United States constitute an Oedipus complex, which is resolved only when Rick begins {{to identify with the}} father figure of Laszlo and the cause which he represents. Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that {{the most important aspect of}} the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the <b>different</b> <b>meanings</b> which he has for each person.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{confusion}} and ambiguity in the creation–evolution debate {{is the definition of}} evolution itself. In the context of biology, evolution is genetic changes in populations of organisms over successive generations. The word also has a number of <b>different</b> <b>meanings</b> in different fields, from evolutionary computation to molecular evolution to sociocultural evolution to stellar and galactic evolution. When biological evolution is conflated with other evolutionary processes, this can cause errors such as the claim that modern evolutionary theory says anything about abiogenesis or the Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have <b>different</b> <b>meanings.</b> Fish {{is used as}} a {{singular}} noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe different species or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three different species, it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{he began a}} {{business}} partnership with producer Martine Marignac, who produced all his subsequent films. Rivette's output increased from then on, with films such as Gang of Four and La Belle Noiseuse receiving international praise. He continued making films until 2009, retiring after the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease made the production of 36 vues du pic Saint-Loup too {{difficult for him to}} continue. Many of his films are known for their long running time, including the 760-minute Out 1. Almost always at the insistence of the distributors, Rivette edited shorter versions of five of his films and considered some of them to be entirely new films with <b>different</b> <b>meanings.</b>|$|E

40|$|The verbs with {{same basic}} word (stem) which are affixed with meN-i or meN-kan {{do not always}} show clear <b>different</b> <b>meaning.</b> This problem give rise to an {{important}} question: {{is that kind of}} pair of verbs have the same or <b>different</b> <b>meaning?</b> What are the criteria in defining the sam or the <b>different</b> <b>meaning?</b> The aim of this research is to identify these criteria that can be applied to classify the verbs with meN-i or meN-kan. This study is qualitative research. The objects of research are the pair of verbs with meN-i or meN-kan. Meanwhile, the units of analysis are sentences. This analysis is based on semantic role (beneficiary, objective, locative and instrument 0 and syntactic structures. The corpus in this research is Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (1999). The result shows that the pair of verbs can be divided to several categories. The first category consist of verbs with the sam meaning. The second includes the pair of verbs that have <b>different</b> <b>meaning</b> due to polysemi. The third category consist of the pair of verbs having the same meaning due to the <b>different</b> <b>meaning</b> of affixes. The fourth category shows the same <b>meaning</b> but <b>different</b> in syntactic structure and semantic role. The fifth category involves the pair of verbs having the same <b>meaning,</b> but <b>different</b> in extra-linguistic characteristic. The sixth category consist of pair of verbs with    <b>different</b> specific <b>meaning.</b> The seventh category includes the pair of verbs with <b>different</b> <b>meaning</b> due to etimology characteristic of the stem. In the first category, meN-i or meN-kan looses its basic meaning.  ...|$|R

5|$|National anthems {{are usually}} {{written in the}} most common {{language}} of the state, whether de facto or official. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics {{for each of the}} country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and Romansh. The New Zealand national anthem is commonly now sung with the first verse in Māori ("Aotearoa") and the second in English ("God Defend New Zealand"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have <b>different</b> <b>meanings.</b> South Africa's national anthem is unique in that five of the eleven official languages are used in the same anthem, in which each language comprises a stanza.|$|E
5|$|Carol Vernallis, {{author of}} Experiencing Music Video, found homoerotic connotations between Madonna and the mermen. The mermen {{in the video}} exist in a {{self-contained}} world of their own, where they procreate with their own kind, both biologically and socially. The fact that the mermen {{did not seem to}} possess genitalia led Vernallis to believe that the video associated them with other works by Ritts – namely homoerotic sculptural images without penises. Their tails drew <b>different</b> <b>meanings,</b> including sexual ones and Christian symbolism. Since in contemporary art, images of mermen are rare while mermaids are common, they are sometimes called fairies partly because it is not known how they came to be. Vernallis believed that the mysteriousness and the elusiveness of the mermen in the video played a crucial role. They never address the camera directly and are often shown disappearing from view. Vernallis believed that since invisibility was a central theme in the homosexual community, this actually portrayed oppression and the desire to watch but never be seen.|$|E
5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two <b>different</b> <b>meanings</b> in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E
