It has the highest Tc value among the <b>intermetalic</b> compounds. MgB 2 has many properties make it very attractive for superconducting applications; these are large coherence length, high critical current density (Jc), high critical magnetic field (Bc) values. There are several methods developed to produce high quality MgB 2 superconducting thin films. Magnetron sputtering system is a widely used method to deposit thin films. In this study, an MgB 2 /Mg target was produced by using MgB 2 and Mg powders with a hot press technique. Prepared sputtering target used to grow MgB 2 superconducting thin films on Al 2 O 3 polycrystal and LaAlO 3 single crystal substrate by a high vacuum magnetron sputtering system. To enhance the superconducting properties of as-grown films and to increase the crystal quality of the as-grown film an ex-situ anneal process was examined.

Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved using several techniques including conventional metallography, SEM, BSE, EDX and precision measurements of mass loss. The oxides scales and their effects were investigated and compared for two test temperatures, i. e. 900 ºC and 950 ºC. Findings: This investigation confirms that oxidation in 9 %O 2 + 0. 3 %SO 2 +N 2 atmosphere causes {{an increase in the}} rate of oxidation in comparison to the pure oxidation in air. The main conclusion is that combined oxidation and sulfidation at temperature between 900 ºC and 950 ºC results in the formation of specific phases at the product-substrate and product-oxide boundaries. Research limitations/implications: The basic limitations concern alloys with different chemical composition, especially with different percentage of niobium (between 4 - 10 at %), not only with 7 at % as in the present investigation. Also, atmosphere with higher content of SO 2 should be tested. Another problem is to optimize the surface integrity including surface roughness and sublayer properties. Practical implications: One of practical outcomes is to select the thermal conditions and surface preparation technology which guarantee the reduction of oxidation in 9 %O 2 + 0. 3 %SO 2 +N 2 atmosphere.

One of the materials were composites based on the AlMg 12 Si alloy, reinforced with ceramic particles (SiC, Al 2 O 3), {{and the other was}} spheroidal cast iron. Design/methodology/approach: For the investigations of wear under technically dry friction conditions the pin-on-disc measuring system was applied. Findings: It has been shown that Al based composites reinforced with intermetallic phases are characterized by considerable resistance to tribological wear under technically dry friction conditions in a cooperation with composites based on the Al alloy (AlSi 12 CuNiMg). The tribological systems in which composites of the Al +intermetallic phases type are used, are characterized by a stable course of the friction coefficient value as a function of friction distance, irrespective of the type of material cooperating with them.
