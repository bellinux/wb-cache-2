The roof, a fine combination of hammerbeam and tie-beam is carried by an arcade with clustered columns. The chancel {{floor and the}} aisles in the nave are adorned with brightly coloured mosaic and Minton tiles. The sanctuary contains a late C19 painted and gilded reredos, topped with a carving of the pelican in her piety. The apse is enriched with painted panels (1888). There is also much fine woodwork including the choir stalls, many intricately carved with small figures, and a tall architectural cover to the stone font. The stained glass in the apse and in the Lady Chapel is by Hardman, while {{the windows of the}} nave are by Clayton and Bell. The tower contains a group of 19th century memorials, including one with a walrus and elephant commemorating Lieutenants Robert and George Hood (d 1821 and 1823). The church is a very fine example of Crowther's work, displaying his great skill in the design of timberwork and enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>mosaic</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mortars {{have been}} widely used even in prehistoric periods in making {{pavements}} in open areas or floors inside dwellings. They are found as surface layers well-compacted and polished, as sub-bases on which stone or ceramic units has been applied (as well as the mortar between the units), and as multilayer substrates <b>for</b> <b>floor</b> <b>mosaics.</b> Repairing <b>flooring</b> mortars constitutes a great part of restoration projects of archaeological sites. In particular, the repair of mosaics attracts great interest since they could be considered as non-detachable work of art. This paper considers aspects of the performance requirements for repair mortars <b>for</b> <b>mosaic</b> substrates and joints in historic pavements and stairs. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Unusually <b>for</b> a <b>mosaic</b> <b>floor</b> of this age, {{the mosaic}} is in near-perfect condition. The {{exception}} is damage {{to one of}} the two ships depicted, done when an Ottoman-era cesspit was dug into the mosaic. Despite the damage, students of maritime history have been able to glean {{a great deal of information}} from the images. The ships are of the navis oneraria type, Roman merchant ships typically displacing 80-150 tons, used to carry such commodities as garum and grain from Egypt to Rome.|$|R

60|$|Furniture.--The luxuries and elegances {{practicable}} in tent-life, {{are only}} {{limited by the}} means of transport. Julius Cæsar, who was a great campaigner, carried parquets of wooden <b>mosaic</b> <b>for</b> his <b>floors!</b> The articles that make the most show for their weight, are handsome rugs, and skins, and pillows; canteens of dinner and coffee services; and candles, with screens of glass, or other arrangements {{to prevent them from}} flickering. The art of luxurious tenting is better understood in Persia than in any other country, even than in India.|$|R

Other Paulist Fathers are entombed in crypt off a chapel on the lower level of the church.|$|R
