30|$|Different from NSGA-II, the {{parallel}} selection {{method is adopted}} for random population optimization to improve the convergence speed of a GA. The specific strategies are as follows: (1) a population with M <b>individuals</b> <b>is</b> randomly generated for iMTSP and (2) the M <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> ordered by different objectives and the best m individuals of each objective function are preserved. If the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>is</b> not achieved, the best m+ 1 <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> preserved until M <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> generated. It {{is worth noting that}} duplicate <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> deleted in the preservation of optimal individuals. The new population is the initial population of the subsequent genetic algorithm.|$|R
30|$|In this work, the {{big five}} factors model is opted for {{measuring}} personality traits that classify personality of users into five agents: Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness to Experience. Highly extraverted <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> self-assured and warm, rather than calm and cautious. Agreeable <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> coordinated and courteous. Conscientious <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> organized and precise. Neurotic <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> not prone to be emotionally resilient. Lastly, highly openness <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> receptiveness and prefer innovation to the routine. The Big Five can state {{as much of the}} variation in individuals’ personalities as possible, using a small set of trait dimensions.|$|R

5|$|Across the Philippines, Typhoon Lee killed 188 people. In addition, 674,619 {{people were}} {{directly}} affected by the typhoon. Furthermore, 76,169 dwellings were demolished while 39,586 families, or 208,336 people, were rendered as homeless. A total of 53,314houses were partially damaged. Also, 548,525people sought refuge in shelters. Additionally, 1,586 <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> injured due to Lee.

Healthy <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E

Throughout Queensland, the cyclone {{isolated}} small towns, cut off telephone service, inflicted severe damage to crops, and generated widespread flooding.

Service of the Sunlander between Gordonvale and Babinda was interrupted after tracks were inundated, and travelers {{were forced to}} travel by bus instead.
