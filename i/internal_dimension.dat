40|$|We {{consider}} {{some aspects of}} inflation in models with large <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> If inflation occurs on a 3 D wall after the stabilization of <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the models with low unification scale (M ~ 1 TeV), the inflaton field must be extremely light. This makes {{it very difficult to}} obtain realistic models with the proper amplitude of density perturbations after inflation. This problem may not appear in models with intermediate (M ~ 10 ^{ 11 } GeV) to high (M ~ 10 ^{ 16 } GeV) unification scale. However, in all of these cases the wall inflation does not provide a complete solution to the horizon and flatness problems. To solve these problems, there must be a stage of inflation before the compactification of <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> Without it, a generic universe would have lasted only a time M^{- 1 }, which is much shorter than the age of our Universe {{at the beginning of the}} wall inflation...|$|R

40|$|We study two (4 +n) -dimensional branes {{embedded}} in (5 +n) -dimensional spacetime. Using the gradient expansion approximation, {{we find that}} the effective theory is described by (4 +n) -dimensional scalar-tensor gravity with a specific coupling function. Based on this theory we investigate the Kaluza-Klein two-brane-worlds cosmology at low energy, in both the static and the nonstatic <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions.</b> In the case of the static <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions,</b> the effective gravitational constant in the induced Friedmann equation depends on the equations of state of the brane matter, and the dark radiation term naturally appears. In the nonstatic case we take a relation between the external and internal scale factors of the form b(t) =a^γ(t) in which the brane world evolves with two scale factors. In this case, the induced Friedmann equation on the brane is modified in the effective gravitational constant and the term proportional to a^- 4 β. For dark radiation, we find γ=- 2 /(1 +n). Finally, we discuss the issue of conformal frames which naturally arises with scalar-tensor theories. We find that the static <b>internal</b> <b>dimensions</b> in the Jordan frame may become nonstatic in the Einstein frame. Comment: 11 pages, minor typos corrected, published versio...|$|R
