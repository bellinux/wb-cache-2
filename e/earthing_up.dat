The experiment was comprised of six weed management tactics including untreated control and these were T 1 = Control, T 2 = No weeding + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE (Days after emergence) T 3 = Spading along with hand weeding at 20 DAE + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE, T 4 = two spading along with hand weeding at 10 and 20 DAE + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE, T 5 = application of pre emergence herbicide magnum gold (mencozeb) @ 2 1 ml L water) + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE and T 6 = Application of post-emergence herbicide (U- 46 (2, 4 D amine) 1 @ 6 ml L water) + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE. The best weed control efficiency was observed when pre-emergence herbicide (magnum gold) + <b>Earthing</b> <b>up</b> at 30 DAE were followed.

Data collected on tuber quality parameters were subjected to analysis of variance. Significantly {{the highest number of}} green potatoes (41 tubers/plot) was observed at the interaction of 10 cm with no <b>earthing</b> <b>up</b> whereas the highest number of large tubers (6 tubers/hill) was found at the interaction of 40 cm with <b>earthing</b> <b>up</b> after 15 days. The effect of plant spacing was highly significant on all tuber quality parameters studied: Number of small, medium, large and green tubers, tuber dry matter and specific gravity. For majority of tuber quality parameters 40 and 30 cm were preferable while significantly the highest tuber dry matter (21. 53 %) and specific gravity (1. 082) was found at 30 cm.
