500|$|Humphries {{said his}} point of view of these {{struggled}} sessions in a 2014 interview: “There were <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> didn’t do anything. I don’t think they knew what they wanted to do. We had a dartboard and an air rifle and we’d play these word games, sit around, get drunk, go home and return the next day. That’s all we were doing until suddenly everything started falling into place.” ...|$|E
500|$|According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre [...] "was {{particularly}} strong in cutting and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that [...] "there {{was something about}} Ollivierre that reminded {{one of the great}} Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace." [...] A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a [...] "great batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: [...] "Geniuses who have just lost their way...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one of them really intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer".|$|E
500|$|When portraying Ellie, Johnson faced {{challenges}} in performing scenes {{that made her}} feel uncomfortable. [...] "There were some <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would shoot things that even at my age made me feel a little uncomfortable," [...] Johnson described. Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie, and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason. When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature, Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2: Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them, creating a [...] "beautiful" [...] relationship through gameplay alone. Though this concept was never {{included in the final}} game, the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project, ultimately inspiring Ellie. Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries, which is similar to Ellie's view.|$|E

500|$|Additionally {{described}} as [...] "a spark of Gallic vaudeville that lights a flame to both [...] Maurice Chevalier and Yves Montand," [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] depicts both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "humour." [...] Extending a warm, energetic invitation towards Belle, the first verse {{of the song}} is preceded by a spoken introduction. It reads, at first in French, [...] "Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now {{we invite you to}} relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents: your dinner," [...] immediately succeeded by the sung lyrics [...] "Be our guest, be our guest, put our service to the test," [...] continuing with [...] "Go on, unfold your menu / take a glance and then you'll / be our guest / oui, our guest / be our guest." [...] A nostalgic Lumiere muses about being human, pining for the [...] "good old <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were useful."

2500|$|Miyamoto {{explained}} at the Game Developers Conference in 1999, {{that prior}} {{to the presence of}} an original soundtrack and sound effects, [...] "sounds in the game consumed CPU power, so in early development we would include dummy sounds so that we could estimate the processing speed of the final product.

2500|$|In 2017, Lord Tebbit criticised a Lords {{amendment}} to the Brexit bill which would guarantee the rights of EU citizens {{to live and work}} within the UK after Brexit. He also attacked the Lords for [...] "thinking of nothing but the rights of foreigners" [...] and [...] " [...] after the foreigners and not the British", as Theresa May had hoped to leave this amendment out of the bill in order to secure the rights of British citizens living in EU countries post-Brexit. His comments produced [...] "loud gasps" [...] from the majority of peers (but gained audible support by a number on the Conservative benches), adding that [...] "Of course we don't have the power to look after our citizens overseas, not in these <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> don't have many gunboats".|$|E
2500|$|Sidney Gambier-Parry, {{the son of}} Thomas Gambier-Parry and {{his second}} wife Ethelinda Lear, was born on 9 January 1859 at Highnam Court, Highnam, Gloucestershire. His father was an artist, philanthropist, and art collector. His brother Major Ernest Gambier-Parry {{was wounded in the}} Suakin Expedition of 1885. His {{half-brother}} was composer Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry. Sidney Gambier-Parry was educated at Eton. His education also included one year at the Gloucester School of Art. In addition, he was a student of Sir Arthur William Blomfield for three years, from 1878 to 1881. The architect Henry Woodyer was another influence on Gambier-Parry, who became an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects (ARIBA) on 23 May 1881. His brother Ernest dedicated his book, The Spirit of the Old Folk, to Sidney. [...] "To my brother Sidney Gambier-Parry in recollection of the golden <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> trudged the fields together in fullest health and strength." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early <b>days</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
