The purposes of this thesis is to conceptually explore a better understanding of what a resilient food system might entail within the dynamics of social, cultural, economic and environmental phenomena. Based on this, by applying personal resilience valuation criteria from a longitudinal study in the field of Psychology, the this thesis uses the Transition Town Totnes Food Group, in the town of Totnes, England, as a case study to evaluate existing understandings of resilience. The evaluation found that the resilience of food systems being linked to social, cultural, economic and environmental phenomena is a crucial, contemporary concern which may be better understood when considered in parallel to the resilience of the self. Findings illustrate that while Totnesians have a high level of awareness of environmental and food-related issues, this is not matched by their patterns of behaviour which can be primarily attributed to three factors: 1) the cost and convenience of food production and consumption largely define patterns of behaviour, 2) the attraction to choice and exotic variety is difficult to resist, 3) the lack of social cohesion, landownership and political will are three major structural factors preventing the realisation of food-related, visible outcomes for the TTT Food Group. While there are a number of food-related attempts by the TTT Food Group such as the Garden Share, the Food <b>Guide,</b> <b>Nut</b> Tree Planting and Seed Swops, due to their scope, contributions for resilience building have a symbolic meaning at this stage. These are largely manifested in the consideration of mindsets and not in attitudes, and patterns of behaviour. As a result, the TTT Food Group has thus far not been effective...|$|E
5000|$|Some North American {{manufacturers}} offer soy-, almond-, rice- or coconut milk-based {{alternatives for}} vegans {{and those with}} dairy allergies, lactose intolerance or other dietary restrictions. The history of non-dairy eggnogs goes back to 1899 when Almeda Lambert, in her <b>Guide</b> for <b>Nut</b> Cookery, gave a recipe for [...] "Egg Nog" [...] made using coconut cream, eggs, and sugar. In 1973, Eunice Farmilant, in The Natural Foods Sweet-Tooth Cookbook, gave a more modern non-dairy eggnog recipe using 3 eggs separated, 2 tablespoons of barley malt extract or Amasake syrup, four cups of chilled soy milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and nutmeg, (p. 138-39) ...|$|R
40|$|Bob Sutor, Vice President of the Open Source and Linux {{division}} at IBM, recently stated that "there doesn't {{seem to be}} very many good <b>guides</b> about the <b>nuts</b> and bolts of starting an open source business". He speculates that one reason is that "there is no one way to start and run a business that involves open source". The authors in this issue of the OSBR are serial entrepreneurs, startup founders, and professionals who provide services to and interact daily with startups...|$|R
40|$|Bachelor thesis {{describes}} the design {{technology for the}} production of <b>guide</b> screw and <b>nut</b> tool carrier for mechanical lathe SV 18 RA. The batch size is 200 units per year and production will be carried out on conventional machines. For the production of the guide screw will be used steel ČSN 411700. 1 and for the nut a copper alloy ČSN 423123. To produce the components were processed manufacturing drawings, technologicall process of producing the two components and design of machines and tools. At the conclusion it has been incorporated economic evaluation of the whole production...|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{that frequently}} use(d) a zero fret are Gretsch, Kay, Selmer, Höfner, Mosrite, Framus, Vox, Vigier and bass guitar manufacturer MTD. Now very few manufacturers use this design {{and those who}} do list it as a feature. Steinberger uses a zero fret with their headless guitars but omit the nut; strings are mounted in place where the head would normally be, so {{there is no need for}} the string <b>guides</b> that the <b>nut</b> provides. 2015 model year Gibson guitars incorporate a zero fret in order to accommodate a brass adjustable nut, which the manufacturer claims causes better sustain and intonation.|$|R
40|$|The Social Change Initiative, Belfast and the Working Group on Philanthropy for Social Justice and Peace have {{released}} a new resource Funding In Conflict-Affected Environment. Authored by Avila Kilmurray, the resource {{serves as a}} guide that addresses the question - how can independent philanthropy fund activities and initiatives in conflict-affected areas {{in order to promote}} and support peacebuilding? A core objective {{of this study is to}} highlight the positive contribution that independent grantmaking trusts and foundations can make to peacebuilding. Evidence shows that they do make a positive contribution, although many are still wary of working in situations of violent conflict-fearing that interventions can have negative as well as positive consequences. It is with this in mind that the study looks at the importance of conflict sensitivity for independent donors, in addition to detailing how donors can support peacebuilding through different stages of conflict and peace processes. This study is made up of five sections: 1) Understanding the context  do no harm, 2) supporting peacebuilding and positive change 3) crafting the grant portfolio 4) how do we know that we are contributing to 4) positive change? 5) summary notes. It is accompanied by a 16 -page summary guide Conflict-Affected Environments: Notes For Grantmakers drawn from the bigger study. The <b>guide</b> presents the <b>nuts</b> and bolts of grantmaking for peacebuilding work: [URL]...|$|R
