30|$|In summary, RAAS {{has a high}} local {{recurrence}} rate even if {{the surgical}} margin was negative, because it spreads throughout the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> In the current case, the patient had repeated local recurrences of RAAS that arose in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> on three successive occasions. Therefore, we suggest resecting {{as much as possible}} of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> as the most effective treatment for RAAS. Although this patient could not be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy due to her age and history of cerebral infarction, she was completely cured {{as a result of the}} “extensive” surgery. We conclude that the resection of the entire <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> is the most effective treatment for control of local recurrence and extension of survival time in RAAS patients.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ternary lyotropic {{liquid crystal}} (LLC), was {{prepared}} by mixing tetradecyltrimethylamonium bromide (MTAB), water and azobenzene (Az). The phase transition of the LLC was induced from LC phase to isotropic (I) one upon Ar+ laser, which was {{owing to the}} trans-cis-trans phoisomerizaion cycle of Az during the irradiation. After that, the LC phase gradually recovered from I phase to nematic (N) phase when being exposed to dark condition. It was also suggested that the recovery time from I to N was different with the Az structures, temperature and ratio of MTAB/Az in the ternary system. Then, the effect of light irradiation on the motion behavior of micron objects dispersed in the ternary LLC film was studied. It {{was found that the}} micron objects which dispersed in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> moved {{toward the center of the}} <b>irradiated</b> <b>area,</b> while the micron objects which dispersed around the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> moved away from the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area...</b>|$|R
30|$|As can be {{seen from}} AFM image (Fig.  7 a), the size of the damaged area is about 2  μm in {{diameter}} and there is a clear topological contrast between the <b>irradiated</b> and non-irradiated <b>areas.</b> Raman scanning from the center of <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> to its edge shows gradual decrease in intensity of the broadened components of the D- and G bands (Fig.  7 b), increase in intensity of the G− component and 2 D band (Fig.  7 c), and decrease in intensity of the G+ component of the G band. It {{should be noted that the}} spatial distribution of Raman D-band intensity in Fig.  7 b is in good agreement with the AFM image of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> in Fig.  7 a. These observations confirm our previous assumption about coexistence within the Raman probe of more disorder graphene in the central part of heavily <b>irradiated</b> <b>area,</b> which is featured by presence of broadened D- and G bands and also by high intensity of the G+ component, and less damaged area near the edge of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area,</b> which is reflected by increase in intensity of the G band and relative intensity of the 2 D band.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a three-dimensional nanostructure on a silicon surface {{was investigated in}} this study. The silicon surface <b>area</b> <b>irradiated</b> by focused ion beam (FIB) was selectively etched in HF, whereas the non-irradiated area was scarcely etched, and consequently, a concave nanostructure was fabricated on the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> To control {{the depth of the}} nanostructure, the depth dependence on ion irradiation parameters was investigated. As a result, {{it was found that the}} depth of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> can be controlled by changing ion irradiation parameters, such as dose and ion energy. Under a low-dose condition, the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> was scarcely etched, due to the formation of an amorphous layer on the interior of silicon. Subsequently, it was etched in KOH to evaluate the mechanism of this phenomenon. In addition, the surface roughness dependence on ion irradiation parameters was investigated.

30|$|Li et al. {{reported}} on surgery-specific risk stratification {{in the context}} of RAAS. In this retrospective study, 76 women with RAAS were enrolled and randomized into two groups, the “radical group” and a “conservative group.” The “radical” resection was defined as resection of all the previously <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> plus mastectomy. Consequently, the “conservative group” was defined as standard resection such as mastectomy or tumorectomy without total resection of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> The radical surgery group had a lower 5 -year cumulative local recurrence incidence compared to the conservative surgery group (23 % vs. 76 %, P[*]<[*] 0.001) and distant metastasis incidence (18 % vs. 47 %, P[*]=[*] 0.02). Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) for the radical group was much higher than that for the conservative group (86 % vs. 46 %, P[*]<[*] 0.001). In addition, patients who underwent conservative surgery with negative margins had a worse DSS than those in the radical group [15].

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a microscope for the simultaneous acquisition of optical sum frequency (SF) and second harmonic (SH) intensity images in UHV conditions, and observed resonant electronic and vibrational images of the H–Si(1 1 1) surface after IR light irradiation of pulse width 6 μs. The SH intensity images showed a spatial distribution of resonant electronic states, associated with the dangling bonds formed after hydrogen desorption induced by the IR light pulses. This result indicates that the hydrogen coverage decreased to less than 0. 6 ML in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> The SF intensity images before the IR light pulse irradiation showed signals attributed to Si–H stretching vibration on the H–Si(1 1 1) surface. After the IR light pulse irradiation, non-resonant SF signals appeared in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> The non-resonant SF signals may originate from a nonlinear optical transition involving the surface electronic levels in the dangling bonds.

40|$|TiO 2 film {{deposited}} on glass was irradiated in air with single-shot KrF excimer laser pulse. The surface roughened {{as the result}} of the laser ablation. It is further noted that single-pulse irradiation with fluence ranging from 400 to 1200 mJ/cm 2 gave rise to protrusion of the irradiated surface above the original surface, which is in contrast to usual expectation that irradiated surface is below the unirradiated surface. The surface protrusion is mainly attributed to the effect of surface tension. At the laser fluence of 1000 mJ/cm 2, cracks were formed in the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> and severe film exfoliation was observed at the periphery of the <b>irradiated</b> <b>area</b> due to the release of internal stress. With higher laser fluence above 1000 mJ/cm 2, patches of film were observed to peel off within the <b>irradiated</b> <b>areas.</b> Hydrodynamic ablation is proposed to account for film exfoliation.

Ultrashort pulse laser (USPL) machining/structuring is a promising technique for obtaining the dual-scale roughness. Sheets of stainless steel (AISI 304 L SS) and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys were laser-machined with ultraviolet laser pulses of 6. 7 ps, with different numbers of pulses per <b>irradiated</b> <b>area.</b> The surface energy of the laser-machined samples was reduced via application of a layer of perfluorinated octyltrichlorosilane (FOTS).
