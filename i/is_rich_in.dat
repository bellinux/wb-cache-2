5|$|Fruit <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> sugar but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must}} be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough Ironworks. Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (dolomite, limestone or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|E
60|$|I {{told you}} before, that good works must flow from faith: and now I tell you, {{that the best}} way to be {{fruitful}} in them, is to be much in the exercise of the doctrine of justification by grace; and they both agree; for as faith animates to good works, so the doctrine of grace animates faith. Wherefore, the way to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> good works, it <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> faith; and the way to <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> faith <b>is</b> to be conscientiously affirming the doctrine of grace to others, and believing it ourselves.|$|R

5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
5|$|The panel <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> Christian iconography, which {{reflects}} {{the shift in}} religious attitudes to a more meditative and solitary devotion in the 14th century, exemplified by the Devotio Moderna movement. The painting is devotional; its iconography clearly juxtaposes Old and New Testament imagery, conveying themes of punishment and redemption, against the belief that a second chance is available through the birth of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The work <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> {{symbolism}} and iconographic elements, {{to an extent}} far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows {{to the side of}} the aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, and on the other side a columbine, recalling the Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E

5|$|While {{historically}} pure, {{the stream}} now suffers from urban stream syndrome, partially {{due to the}} amount of impervious surfaces within its watershed.

As of 2016, a Vassar–Cornell University program is monitoring the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill.|$|E

The parsnip <b>is</b> <b>rich</b> <b>in</b> vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375mg per 100g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since {{most of the}} vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter.|$|E
