40|$|Four {{distinctive}} dental porcelain {{fused to}} metal (PFM) crown artefacts were received {{in connection with}} a <b>forensic</b> <b>matter.</b> It was suspected that these crowns had been immersed in hydrochloric acid for seven days. Previous analysis using scanning electron microscopy and EDS (Electron Dispersive Spectroscopy) had demonstrated that the items had been immersed in a corrosive substance, but could not determine specifically what the corrosive had been 1. Examination of the evidential crowns was then undertaken using XPS (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) and it was demonstrated that the specific corrosive was indeed hydrochloric acid. The technique is discussed and its strengths and limitations are outlined. This analytical technique may be of relevance to forensic analysts who are required to make similar determinations.

Although the books are addressed to different primary audiences 5 and their authors come from a variety of disciplines and from distant points of the English-speaking world, 6 all three help draw the connection between underlying theory and presentation in the courtroom. Though Schum uses numerous examples from litigation and discusses the legal literature of probability and evidence, he focuses primarily not on <b>forensic</b> <b>matters</b> but on the broader question of inference 2 ̆ 2 in our work and in other parts of our daily lives 2 ̆ 2 (Schum, p. xiii). Accordingly, he examines in depth the structure of inference, emphasizing conventional probability theory and alternatives to it.

40|$|In {{this article}} we have {{attempted}} {{to make the case}} for continued participation by appropriately qualified mental health professionals in the adjudication of reconstructive subjective issues of the criminal law. In Part I, we outlined the reasons why imprecision and speculation is and must be tolerated in doctrines of exculpation and mitigation. In Part II, we developed the case for evidentiary rules which permit "informed speculation" by qualified clinical experts so as to enable defendants to explore and present subjective defenses and assist triers of fact to assess the plausibility and significance of such claims. We recognize that many mental health professionals have no special training or expertise in <b>forensic</b> <b>matters</b> and are not adequately sensitive to the risks of unreliability and imprecision in the evaluation process. We believe, accordingly, that the primary focus of reform should be on improving the quality of clinical participation in the criminal process, an effort which depends primarily on collaboration between the bar and the mental health professions to define the necessary qualifications of expert witnesses and to establish criteria for acceptable evaluation procedures. We sought in Part III to contribute to this collaborative effort by outlining some general guidelines that might facilitate objectivity in forensic evaluation...|$|E

40|$|Vocational {{experts are}} {{increasingly}} being called upon to provide testimony {{in a variety of}} legal arenas. To ensure that experts possess appropriate qualifications and apply valid and reliable methodologies, courts have introduced strict standards to prevent incompetent professionals from testifying on <b>forensic</b> <b>matters.</b> Despite the recent growth of the field, no formal training program exists that is designed to prepare individuals for providing vocational testimony. Further, no universally accepted certification exists specifically for vocational witnesses which attest to their attained status as an expert in the field. Professionals in the field of vocational testimony were surveyed to assess the need for formal training and certification. Four primary questions were posed to identify the need for training, the content to be included, the means of disseminating training, and whether certification should be required of the field. Results indicate that a training program is indeed desired, with a variety of topics offered through a blend of on-site and web-based instruction. It was further found that certification remains a controversial topic, with mixed support {{for the creation of a}} valid certification process, currently seen as lacking in the field. This dissertation makes recommendations for the creation of a formal training program and certification process for professionals testifying on vocational matters in a court of law. iii To my wife and children, my inspiratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of forensic odontology regularly requires the forensic dental expert {{to establish a}} degree of concordance between two objects, {{one or both of}} which have undergone minimal degrees of warping, shrinkage and distortion collectively described as deformations. These comparisons can be between the suspect’s or victim’s dentition and bite marks on inanimate objects/skin, two radiological images, palatal rugae patterns, dental arches, lip prints and other unique scenarios which are presented in forensic odontological cases. This paper will define the mathematical concept of affine transformation as it pertains to <b>forensic</b> <b>matters</b> and explains how it can be applied to a case study involving pattern deformations. Although the deformation of the evidence may be minimal in extent, it creates a measure of uncertainty when expert evidence is given in court cases. Any metric discrepancy caused by deformation of the evidence will necessitate the application of pattern association and negate the use of metric analysis. It has been shown that a pattern association analysis of evidence will not be affected by minimal amounts of deformation. The mathematical limits of these deformations which will significantly affect the comparisons have not yet been determined. In the case study presented the deformations were considered minimal and thus explainable by a pattern association analysis. The mathematical concepts will empower the expert to explain to a court of law how two samples which were not a perfect match, could in fact be deformed equivalents of common origin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{advances}} of the ICT industry {{in recent years}} has led to huge popularity of Cloud Computing Services. Due {{to the fact that the}} Cloud is distributed and hosts numerous users, its use to commit crimes becomes a critical issue. Proactive cloud <b>forensics</b> becomes a <b>matter</b> of urgency: its capability to collect critical data before crimes happen, thus saving time and energy for the investigations is its primary objective. In this paper, we discuss the basis of Cloud Forensic Readiness, because we believe that such a system is of huge necessity. We begin by carefully defining Digital Forensic Readiness in the Cloud Computing context. We propose a reference architecture for a Cloud Forensic Readiness System (CFRS) together with its features, components, and challenges...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{reasoning}} practices of forensic scientists, with specific {{focus on the}} application of the Bayesian form of probabilistic reasoning to <b>forensic</b> science <b>matters.</b> Facilitated in part by the insights of evidence scholarship, Bayes Theorem has been advocated as an essential resource for the interpretation and evaluation of forensic evidence, and has been used to support the production of specific technologies designed to aid forensic scientists in these processes. In the course of this research I have explored the ways in which Bayesian reasoning can be regarded as a socially constructed collection of practices, despite proposals that it is simply a logical way to reason about evidence. My data are drawn from two case studies. In the first, I demonstrate how the Bayesian algorithms used for the interpretation of complex DNA profiles are themselves elaborately constructed devices necessary for the anchoring of scientific practice to forensic contexts. In the second case study, an investigation of a more generalised framework of forensic investigation known as the Case Assessment and Interpretation (CAI) model, I show how the enactment of Bayesian reasoning is dependent on a series of embodied, experiential and intersubjective knowledge-forming activities. Whilst these practices may seem to be largely independent of theoretical representations of Bayesian reasoning, they are nonetheless necessary to bring the latter into being. This is at least partially due to the ambiguities and liminalities encountered in the process of applying Bayesianism to forensic investigation, and also may result from the heavy informational demands placed on the reasoner. I argue that these practices, or 'forms of Bayes', are necessary in order to negotiate areas of ontological uncertainty. The results of this thesis therefore challenge prevailing conceptions of Bayes Theorem as a universal, immutable signifier, able to be put to work unproblematically in any substantive domain, Instead, I have been able to highlight the diverse range of practices required for 'Bayesian' reasoners to negotiate the sociomaterial contingencies exposed in the process of its application.

40|$|Recent trends show digital devices {{utilized}} {{with increasing}} frequency in most crimes committed. Investigating crime involving these devices is labor-intensive for the practitioner applying digital forensics tools that present possible evidence with results displayed in tabular lists for manual review. This research investigates how enhanced digital forensics tool interface visualization techniques can be shown to improve the investigator 2 ̆ 7 s cognitive capacities to discover criminal evidence more efficiently. This paper presents visualization graphs and contrasts their properties with the outputs of The Sleuth Kit (TSK) digital forensic program. Exhibited is the textual-based interface proving the effectiveness of enhanced data presentation. Further demonstrated is {{the potential of the}} computer interface to present to the digital forensic practitioner an abstract, graphic view of an entire dataset of computer files. Enhanced interface design of digital forensic tools means more rapidly linking suspicious evidence to a perpetrator. Introduced in this study is a mixed methodology of ethnography and cognitive load measures. Ethnographically defined tasks developed from the interviews of digital <b>forensics</b> subject <b>matter</b> experts (SME) shape the context for cognitive measures. Cognitive load testing of digital forensics first-responders utilizing both a textual-based and visualized-based application established a quantitative mean of the mental workload during operation of the applications under test. A t-test correlating the dependent samples 2 ̆ 7 mean tested for the null hypothesis of less than a significant value between the applications 2 ̆ 7 comparative workloads of the operators. Results of the study indicate a significant value, affirming the hypothesis that a visualized application would reduce the cognitive workload of the first-responder analyst. With the supported hypothesis, this work contributes to the body of knowledge by validating a method of measurement and by providing empirical evidence that the use of the visualized digital forensics interface will provide a more efficient performance by the analyst, saving labor costs and compressing time required for the discovery phase of a digital investigation...|$|R
