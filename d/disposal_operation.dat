40|$|Retrievability of {{radioactive}} waste {{is a subject}} {{playing a role in}} the policies on underground disposal in a number of countries. Important time scales are the period during which the waste can be regarded as retrievable (order of 100 years), and the period allowed for the actual retrieval operation (1 to 2 years). For disposal in rock salt, two disposal configurations are available: the salt-mine repository and the deep-boreholes/cavern combination. Both for the salt-mine repository and the deep boreholes, the <b>disposal</b> <b>operation</b> can be carried out {{in such a way that}} waste retrieval remains possible. Incorporation of retrievability is achieved through a number of technical modifications.

Laboratory experiments were conducted with different initial fluid mud concentrations in three different experimental set-ups: rectangular flume for constant volume release, rectangular flume for constant flux release, and a square pool for radial constant flux release of fluid mud. The experiments in the rectangular flume generated two-dimensional underflows. The experiments in the pool simulated typical open water pipeline disposal operations with submerged vertical discharge configuration in the field and radially axisymmetric three-dimensional fluid mud underflows were generated in these experiments.

Pure fluorine or fluorine diluted with nitrogen to concentrations as low as 0. 3 percent fluorine may be disposed of efficiently within the rate limitation.

Moisture content in the charcoal had no appreciable effect on the disposal efficiency after the reaction zone was established and the moisture was driven off by the heat of reaction.

40|$|PURPOSE: A {{method of}} dredged {{material}} disposal used by site managers on inland rivers is called mechanical redistribution. This involves initially placing the dredged {{material on the}} adjacent banks of the channel where the material is dredged. With the onset of high flows moving down the river, the material is then either pushed back into the stream or {{is expected to be}} eroded by the overbank flows. There is a need for a numerical predictive capability for the fate of dredged material disposed in this manner. This technical note (TN) describes such a capability. BACKGROUND: Dredging and the subsequent disposal of the dredged material occur in most of the nation's inland waterways that are used for commercial navigation. An important aspect in determining the impact of these operations is predicting where and how the disposed material is dispersed and/or deposited after the <b>disposal</b> <b>operation.</b> The initial deposition may take place over a time frame ranging from minutes to hours. A second major consideration is the longer-term sediment movement patterns (over a time frame of perhaps days or months) in or near the disposal sites and waterways. One method of dredged material disposal that is sometimes used on inland waterways involves the placement of the dredged material {{along the banks of the}} waterway. During high-water periods...|$|E
40|$|Since December 2010, a new French Law on Space Operations (LSO) must be {{complied}} with by any entity related to space activities. It imposes, for instance, that any satellite operator shall demonstrate his capability {{to control the}} space vehicle, whatever the mission phase from the launch up to its End Of Life (EOL). The French Space Agency (CNES) is currently operating several remote sensing satellites (the last one called PLEIADES 1 A), among a larger fleet of satellites. In that context, CNES has decided to perform several specific studies in order to define satellite <b>disposal</b> <b>operation</b> plans in any situation. The typical scenario of EOL operations consists in implementing five phases: disposal orbital manoeuvres, fluidic passivation, electrical passivation, transmitter disconnection and EOL orbit computation. One shall point out that these satellites (except PLEIADES 1 A and 1 B) were not originally designed to conform with the constraints imposed by the LSO. Thus, detailed analysis were conducted to identify the on-board and the on-ground improvements, {{as well as the}} operations chronology, without compromising in any way the security in the conduct of the operations. Depending on the context (nominal, contingency or emergency case) and the satellite subsystems status, different scenarios have been defined and compare...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to bolster {{confidence}} and protect the nation the U. S. government through agencies like the Department of Homeland Security is identifying vulnerabilities and evolving strategies for protection. Agricultural food supply is one identified vulnerable area, and animal disease defense {{is one of the}} major concerns there under. Should an outbreak of animal disease occur, it is likely to have a mass slaughter and disposal of animal carcasses. The current existing policy, mainly including slaughter policy and strict movement bans, may be not sufficient to control disease spread at reasonable cost. We address the issue modeling vaccination as a supporting strategy with later slaughter of animals and argue that vaccination can decrease slaughter and disposal cost in the case of emergency. Our results show that (a) Vaccination gains time to slow down the flow of slaughter, thereafter the <b>disposal</b> <b>operation</b> of animal carcasses. By smoothing slaughter/disposal flow, vaccination likely decreases slaughter and disposal cost; (b) Vaccination likely reduce the total amount of slaughter and disposal of animals mainly because vaccinated animals shed less and disease spread slower; and (c) Vaccination becomes more valuable in reducing slaughter and disposal costs when the marginal cost of vaccination falls, the even size of disease outbreak is larger, the disease is more contagious and spreads faster, and/or vaccines are more effective in controlling disease spread.

During 12 years of practical <b>disposal</b> <b>operation</b> in the Asse mine and 25 years of disposal in the disused former salt mine Morsleben, it was demonstrated that low-level wastes (LLW) and intermediate-level wastes (ILW) can be safely handled and economically disposed of in salt repositories without a great technical effort.

Additionally, an in-situ solidification of liquid LLW was applied in the Morsleben mine. Concepts and techniques for the disposal of heat generating high-level waste (HLW) are advanced as well. The feasibility of both borehole and drift disposal concepts have been proved by about 30 years of testing in the Asse mine.

40|$|The {{work of the}} BioNormII on Fuel {{specification}} {{and classes}} (Task IV) has very valuable in upgrading of EN 14961 to European standard. Testing of the draft versions of EN 14961 in companies and collecting feedback from associations has provided useful information from practise in setting threshold values for property tables in Part 1 of EN 14961 and proposal for classification of product standards. The Task IV has also made a comprehensive study of current classification of used wood (waste wood) including implementation of European legislations and standards. The study included also analysis of different used wood sortiments and their composition especially con­ taminants. It is necessary to define the impact of possible contaminants on the energy utilisation of used wood. This is helpful for categorisation, {{as well as for}} identification and characterisation of the contaminants. From an environ­ mental point of view, the risks of used wood combustion are air pollution from flue gases or leaching of hazardous substances from ash after <b>disposal.</b> <b>Operation</b> failure, normally appearing as boiler deposit formation or corrosion, is a technical issue that also needs to be considered. Mechanically, problems in fuel conveyors may occur due to glass, fittings, and various fastening systems that are attached to �used wood� products.

The project also made a proposal for overall categorisation of chemically treated industrial wood residues and used wood. In this clas­ sification used wood is divided in 4 categories A, B, C and D.
