K{sub eff}, the major parameter of interest in such a type of calculations, can be <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> both <b>on</b> the quality of the resonance data as well as on the accuracy achieved in the processing of these data. If reasonable uncertainty values are available, in conjunction with their correlation in energy and among type of resonance parameters, one can exploit existing methodologies, based on perturbation theory, in order to evaluate their impact on the integral parameter of interest, i. e., K{sub eff} in our case, in practical applications. In this way, one could be able to judge if the uncertainty on specific quantities, e. g., covariances on resonance data, have {{a significant}} impact and, therefore, deserve a careful evaluation. This report, first, will recall the basic principles that lie behind an uncertainty evaluation and review the current situation in the field of covariance data. Then an attempt is made for defining a methodology that allows calculating covariances values for resolved resonance parameters. Finally, practical applications, of interest for criticality safety calculations, illustrate the impact of different assumptions on correlations among resolved resonance parameters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Variability {{in modern}} digital {{integrated}} circuits {{is emerging as}} an important area of research as it can cause pro-found impacts on chip performance and power consumption. We found that memory power consumption in a mainstream Atom-based computer can {{be as much as}} 18. 5 % of the total system power. We investigated the power consumption of DDR 3 SDRAM DIMMs, finding that power usage in memory is <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> both <b>on</b> operation type (write, read, and idle) as well as data. A low-level benchmark was constructed for DIMM power consumption to analyze power variability in mainstream memory products from various vendors and suppliers. Temperature had little effect (on the order of 1 - 3 %) across the- 50 C to 50 C range. Variations between specimens of the same model and different models of the same vendor were on the order of 5 - 15 %. In the scope of all tested modules, devi-ations were up to approximately 20 % in write and idle power. Furthermore, we found that capacity has a direct effect on power consumption of a DIMM. These power deviations could be exploited by an operating system to improve overall system power efficiency, particularly for memory-bottlenecked systems and applications. We propose several possible approaches to implement power and variability-aware modifications to a kernel. Keywords-DDR 3; DRAM; DIMM; variability; variability-aware; power-aware; kerne...|$|R

40|$|Employment in {{the wood}} {{products}} industry in Oregon has declined {{over the past decade}} despite a recent resurgence in demand for the industry 2 ̆ 7 s products. Reviewing employment and productivity data over the last decade, it is apparent that wood products employment in the state has been reduced as a result of productivity increases. Thus the industry processed more timber in 1986 than in 1979, but with about fifteen percent fewer workers. Continued reductions in wood products employment pose potentially serious adjustment problems because much of rural Oregon remains <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> economically <b>on</b> the industry. There are also indications that timber supply reductions will occur in the future, which would limit the industry 2 ̆ 7 s output and further reduce employment. This paper examines the dynamics of employment change in Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s wood products industry. We decompose the change in employment over the past decade into categories associated with structural and productivity factors. An input-output analysis of changes in the composition of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s output is also undertaken to estimate the economic consequences of structural change. Following the more general analysis, we then examine several issues of recent importance in the state, namely, a ban on the export of logs harvested from state forests and the economic impacts of harvest limitations in the federal forests associated with the spotted owl controvers...|$|R

5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} 18th century, the {{inhabitants}} of Chadderton raised domestic farm animals, supplementing their incomes by the spinning and weaving wool in the domestic system. Primitive coal mining was established by the 17th century, and the factory system adopted in the late-18th century. During the Victorian era, Chadderton's economy was <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> manufacturing industries, especially the spinning of cotton, but also the weaving of silk and production of hats. By the 20th century the landscape was covered with over 50 cotton mills. Industries ancillary to these sectors, including coal mining, brick making, mechanical engineering, and bleaching and dyeing were present. Chadderton developed an extensive coal mining sector auxiliary to Chadderton's cotton industry and workforce. Coal was transported out of the township via the Rochdale Canal. The amount of coal was overestimated however, and production began to decline even before that of the local spinning industry; Chadderton's last coal mine closed in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Real {{advantages}} of the peace came in the economic field. As an open economy, the Republic needed unhindered trade. It was <b>heavily</b> <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> exports of agricultural products to the British markets, and on its services sector (especially its large merchant fleet, and the banking sector), whereas its industry (whatever remained of it after a century of being confronted by foreign protectionism) also was dependent on exports. All these sectors had suffered enormously from the war: the British blockade and French and British privateering had almost brought marine trade to a standstill, whereas a commercial treaty with France (which would have ended French discrimination of Dutch trade in industrial goods) proved an ever-receding fata morgana. True, much of the trade had shifted to flags of convenience (especially that of the U.S.A. and European neutrals like Prussia), but the peace made the resurgence of the Dutch carrying trade fully practicable. Nevertheless, some changes proved irreversible, like the shift of trade patterns to German ports, {{and the decline of}} the fisheries.|$|E
