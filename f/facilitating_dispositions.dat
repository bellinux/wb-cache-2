40|$|Abstract: Accurate and {{efficient}} evaluation of acute chest pain remains clinically challenging because traditional diag-nostic modalities have many limitations. Recent improvement in non-invasive imaging technologies could potentially im-prove both diagnostic efficiency and clinical outcomes {{of patients with}} acute chest pain while reducing unnecessary hos-pitalizations. However, there is still controversy regarding much of the evidence for these technologies. This article re-views the role of coronary artery calcium score and the coronary computed tomography {{in the assessment of}} individual coronary risk and their usefulness in the emergency department in <b>facilitating</b> appropriate <b>disposition</b> decisions.

25|$|A signal {{event in}} the Roman medical {{community}} was {{the construction of the}} first Aesculapium in the city of Rome, on Tiber Island. In 293 BCE some officials consulted the Sibylline Books concerning measures to be taken against the plague and were advised to bring Aesculapius from Epidaurus to Rome. The sacred serpent from Epidaurus was conferred ritually on the new temple, or, in some accounts, the serpent escaped from the ship and swam to the island. Baths have been found there as well as votive offerings (donaria) in the shape of specific organs. In classical times the center covered the entire island and included a long-term recovery center. The emperor Claudius had a law passed granting freedom to slaves who had been sent to the institution for cure but were abandoned there. This law probably <b>facilitated</b> state <b>disposition</b> of the patients and recovery of the beds they occupied. The details are not available.|$|R

The Environmental Management Office of Science and Technology requested that a systems study be performed to better define the potential role of portable treatment with respect to mixed low-level waste, highlight obstacles to implementation, and identify opportunities for future research and development emphasis. The study was performed by first establishing a representative set of mixed waste, then formulating portable treatment system concepts to meet the required processing needs for these wastes. The portable systems that were conceptualized were evaluated and compared to a fixed centralized treatment alternative. The system evaluations include a life-cycle cost analysis and an assessment of regulatory, institutional, and technical issues associated with the potential use of portable systems. The {{results of this study}} show that when all costs are included, there are no significant cost differences between portable systems and fixed systems. However, it is also emphasized that many uncertainties exist that could impact the cost of implementing portable treatment systems. Portable treatment could be made more attractive through private sector implementation, although there is little economic incentive for a commercial vendor to develop small, specialized treatment capabilities with limited applicability. Alternatively, there may also be valid reasons why fixed units cannot be used for some problematic wastestreams. In any event, there are some site-specific problems that still need to be addressed, and there may be some opportunity for research and development to make a positive impact in these areas...|$|R

40|$|A {{strategy}} for the National Facility Deactivation Initiative (NFDI) was issued in July 1999. A key element of the strategy is to facilitate the transfer of excess contaminated facilities from operating programs to the Environmental Management (EM) Program in accordance with DOE Order 430. 1 A, Life Cycle Asset Management (LCAM) and DOE-STD- 1120 - 09, Integration of Environment, Safety and Health into Facility Disposition Activities. According to the LCAM Order, the operating programs are responsible for placing the surplus facilities in a stable and known condition prior to transfer to EM. The Surplus Facility Program at the Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant has established a process for dispositioning surplus facilities. This paper describes the decision process for surplus facilities with emphasis on the facility walkdown assessments that are {{the cornerstone of the}} process. The facility walkdown assessment process identifies existing conditions and activities required to place facilities into a stable and known condition. The walkdown assessment process captures the facility’s operating history, divides the facility into functional areas and utilizes checklists which address health, safety, fire protection, waste management, environmental, and operational issues. The walkdown assessment establishes the facility’s baseline for the stabilization and deactivation end-point requirements. In effect the walkdown assessment process is the building block for transferring facilities to EM or for Defense Programs to manage non-contaminated facilities which will not be transferred to EM. Another key element of the program is also to realize that throughout the process there needs to be close coordination and communication between DP and EM to <b>facilitate</b> the <b>disposition</b> of excess facilities in a timely and cost effective manner...|$|R

Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he {{had been forced to}} over-extend his forces. Moreover, this disposition - concave in relation to the Allied army - gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘horns’ of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke’s <b>disposition</b> <b>facilitated</b> the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded. Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille - threatening to encircle their army - the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.|$|R

This is done through coordination with the repository program and by assisting DOE Site owners of SNF with needed information, standardized requirements, packaging approaches, etc. The High Integrity Can (HIC) will be manufactured to provide a substitute or barrier enhancement for normal fuel geometry and cladding. The can would be nested inside the DOE standardized canister {{which is designed to}} interface with the repository waste package. The HIC approach may provide the following benefits over typical canning approaches for DOE SNF. (a) It allows ready calculation and management of criticality issues for miscellaneous. (b) It segments and further isolates damaged or otherwise problem materials from normal SNF in the repository package. (c) It provides a very long term corrosion barrier. (d) It provides an extra internal pressure barrier for particulates, gaseous fission products, hydrogen, and water vapor. (e) It delays any potential release of fission products to the repository environment. (f) It maintains an additional level of fuel geometry control during design basis accidents, rock-fall, and seismic events. (g) When seal welded, it could provide the additional containment required for shipments involving plutonium content in excess of 20 Ci. (10 CFR 71. 63. b) if integrated with an appropriate cask design. Long term corrosion protection is central to the HIC concept. The material selected for the HIC (Hastelloy C- 22) has undergone extensive testing for repository service. The most severe theoretical interactions between iron, repository water containing chlorides and other repository construction materials have been tested. These expected chemical species have not been shown capable of corroding the selected HIC material. Therefore, the HIC should provide a significant barrier to DOE SNF dispersal long after most commercial SNF has degraded and begun moving into the repository environment...|$|R

This organ initiated in the buccal mass cavity, crossed the skull (by analogy with the vertebrates) and ended behind the head. Histologically, its external wall was surrounded by extended straight muscular fibers, whereas the inner part, near the lumen, was formed by muscular fibers arranged in circular form (Figure  3 F). It is possible that this <b>disposition</b> <b>facilitates</b> the ingested food transport by contraction of the esophageal regions, throughout the whole structure, until arriving at the crop. In the anterior portion of the crop, adjacent to the brain, were the posterior salivary glands. These glands were formed by cubical secretory cells with apparent mucus secretion (Figure  3 G). In accordance with the affinity of the cellular types to the dyes used, it was deduced that there were different types of secretions. The secretions of the glands were transported directly to the buccal mass cavity of the organism through a tube that ran parallel to the esophagus (observation in an adult of O. bimaculatus). This tube was formed by cubical cells with basal nuclei (Figure  3 H).|$|R

We compared the diagnostic accuracy of a novel cTnI test (Minicare cTnI, Philips), with current POC cTnI (I-Stat, Abbott) and high-sensitivity central laboratory cTnI (hs-cTnI; Architect, Abbott) assays. Methods: The clinical performance of the assays were compared in samples from 450 patients from a previous clinical evaluation of Minicare cTnI. Results: Minicare cTnI correlated with Architect hs-cTnI (r(2) = 0. 85, p < 0. 0001) and I-Stat cTnI (r(2) = 0. 93, p < 0. 0001). Areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves were 0. 87 - 0. 91 at admission (p = ns) and 0. 96 - 0. 97 3 h after admission (p = ns). The negative predictive values (NPV) at admission were 95 % ((92 - 97 %, 95 % CI) for Minicare cTnI and increased to 99 % (97 - 100 %) at 2 - 4 h, and similar to Architect hs-cTnI (98 %, 96 - 100 %), but higher than I-Stat cTnI (95 %, 92 - 97 %; p < 0. 01). Negative likelihood ratios (LR) after 2 - 4 h were 0. 06 (0. 02 - 0. 17, 95 % CI) for Minicare cTnI, 0. 11 (0. 05 - 0. 24) for Architect hs-cTnI (p = 0. 02) and 0. 28 (0. 18 - 0. 43) for I-Stat cTnI (p < 0. 0001). The clinical concordances between Minicare cTnI and Architect hs-cTnI were 92 % (admission) and 95 % (2 - 4 h), with lower concordances between Minicare cTnI and I-Stat cTnI (83 % and 78 %, respectively; p = 0. 007).

40|$|Currently each Department Of Energy (DOE) Program office manages its own nuclear {{materials}} through {{activities such as}} production, processing, storage, transportation, and disposition. However, recognizing the need to strengthen its strategic approach to the integrated life-cycle management of {{nuclear materials}}, DOE established the Nuclear Materials Management Stewardship Initiative (NMMSI) in January 2000. The NMMSI's first visible product was the Integrated Nuclear Material Management Plan {{in which it was}} generally recommended that DOE take a cross-cutting look at managing its nuclear materials, and specifically recommended that four Nuclear Material Management Groups (NMMGs) be formed. These groups were established to facilitate management of nuclear materials for which DOE has or may have responsibility, including many presently not in DOE's direct control. One of these NMMGs, the Heavy Isotope Management Group (HIMG) was established at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Dec ember 2000, to facilitate management of (a) actinide and their decay products (except sealed sources) and (b) isotopically enriched stable and radioactive isotopes except uranium and lithium, but excluding thorium, uranium, spent fuel, and weapons or reactor grade plutonium which are addressed by other NMMGs. Despite its short duration and relatively limited funding, the HIMG has <b>facilitated</b> the <b>disposition</b> of heavy isotopes from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL).

This approach has the dual advantages of avoiding custodian disposal costs plus cost to the user of obtaining newly produced material. The HIMG has also prepared issue papers on neptunium and americium/curium that identify the resources, potential uses, and disposal pathways for the materials across the DOE Complex. In the future the HIMG expects to comprehensively identify the status of the U. S. heavy isotope inventory, prepare additional issue papers and plans charting the future of this inventory, and to facilitate execution of the plan...|$|R

The GTRI Remote Monitoring System (RMS) is a standalone security system that includes radiation and tamper alarms, and CCTV; which can be transmitted securely over the Internet to multiple on-site and off-site locations. Through our experiences during installation of the system at 162 sites, plus feedback received from Alarm Response Training course participants, site input to project teams and analysis of trouble calls; indications were that current system training was lacking and inconsistent. A survey was undertaken to gather information from RMS users across the nation, to evaluate the current level of training and determine what if any improvements needed to be made. Additional questions were focused on the operation of the RMS software. The training survey was initially sent electronically to 245 users at the RMS sites and achieved a 37. 6 % return rate. Analysis of the resulting data revealed that 34. 6 % of the respondents had not received training or were unsure if they had, despite the fact that vendor engineers provide training at installation of the system. Any training received was referred to as minimal, and brief, not documented, and nothing in writing. 63. 7 % of respondents said they were either not at all prepared or only somewhat prepared to use the RMS software required to effectively operate the system. As a result of this analysis, a formal training curriculum will be designed and implemented to include several blended learning delivery options. This training will be piloted at RMS sites; initial training will become a required element of RMS installation and refresher training will be considered for sustainability of operations...|$|R

Some of the key species that have previously been studied are krypton, iodine, and cesium. All of these species have been shown to volatilize during melting experiments however, the degree to which they are released is highly dependent upon atmosphere, fuel burnup, temperature, and fuel composition. With this in mind an analytical and experimental program has been undertaken to assess the volatility and capture of species under the melt-dilute operating conditions...|$|R

Questions concerning the role of disposition predicates in inquiry are more central to him than those concerning the nature and reality of dispositions. It has not stopped him from giving me and others very useful metaphysical advice. Currently, where empirical metaphysics is in vogue, {{there is every reason to}} see whether the two forms of philosophical interest might interlock substantially. Levi has stimulating ideas indeed on the two forms of philosophical interest, and has recently summarized them in the slogan: “The reality of dispositions is a work in progress” (Levi 2003, p. 152). We can learn much about what kinds of dispositions are acceptable from tracing and comparing the histories of successful and less successful disposition predicates in scientific inquiry. Levi explores one route along which dispositions become real. His idea is that the introduction of <b>dispositions</b> <b>facilitates</b> covering law explanation by increasing the number of laws. The successful disposition predicate eventually becomes integrated in scientific theory, much like an ordinary theoretical term, whereas the unsuccessful does not. My impression is that Levi thinks that this is the only way a disposition can become real. To evaluate this claim, an alternative course suggested by Jon Elster is introduced.

This study develops several major policy initiatives designed to responsibly <b>facilitate</b> real estate <b>disposition</b> programs that maximize the benefits to the sponsoring authority, but concludes that real estate cannot be treated as a primary source of financing for an authority's capital or operating programs. The policy initiatives proposed in this study include: revised institutional approaches to the development process, new legislation to allow for greater flexibility in negotiating development arrangements and project procurements, and an innovative program intended to make authority-owned development parcels accessible to a broader real estate investment and development market by breaking down the existing barriers to entry in to authority-sponsored development processes. The study includes three case studies that demonstrate challenges and complexities currently facing the real estate development and disposition programs of the Commonwealth's three major transportation authorities. These challenges include high procedural barriers to entry that present the private sector with significant disincentives to participate in authority-sponsored disposition processes, statutory restrictions that hinder the negotiation of creative development arrangements, the potential for real estate disposition programs to distract agencies from their core public function, and the general impression among the private sector development community that state-sponsored development processes are inherently prone to significantly greater risks and uncertainty than private deals.

Zimmerman, like many game scholars, uses the Latin for “game,” ludus, to capture part of the complex human {{experience}} of playing games. He argues that games help to develop literacy for a world based on increasingly dynamic, flexible systems. This dissertation follows the implications of a similar claim about games with respect to political life and to the virtue of democratic citizenship identified in classical thought – pleasure found in ruling and being ruled in turn. I introduce the concept of “ludic attention” to describe the particular disposition that one brings to games. I establish a framework for understanding ludic attention through critical engagement with the Nicomachean Ethics, reassessing Aristotle’s elevation of seriousness in order to posit a virtuous mean that includes a measure of playfulness. Instead of treating seriousness and playfulness as binary conditions, Aristotle elucidates a continuum of potential dispositions between polar extremes of attention. Ludic attention describes the liminal experience of the possibilities between these poles, and games are structures that <b>facilitate</b> such a <b>disposition.</b> Subsequent chapters illustrate how this framework enhances {{our understanding of the}} relationship between games and political life. I consider three contexts in Homer’s Iliad – the assembly, battlefield, and funeral games for Patroclus – to show how games function as distinct sites of action. I then uncover how the dramatic qualities of Plato’s Laws demonstrate the persuasive importance of games and their attendant dispositions. Here I identify ludic attention as an important disposition {{in the development of a}} capacity for the types of attention required by democratic citizenship. I conclude by demonstrating the value of considering these classical texts alongside the emerging literature in game studies, by considering contemporary examples that reveal the enduring importance of game structures for the relationship between persuasion and attention. Irrespective of the ludic character of the twenty-first century, games have mattered to political beings for millennia. These cornerstones of political thought indicate how games, and those dispositions that they inspire, matter to democratic citizens...|$|R
40|$|This {{life history}} {{constitutes}} a phenomenological analysis of trauma {{as it has}} occurred over one woman's lifetime. My subject's life was somewhat atypical. At 21 years of age she {{had to deal with}} facial disfigurement after losing an eye in an accident with a pair of scissors. When she was 35, her mother whom she had nursed for several years died from cancer after a long illness. The death of her father when she was 61 was more traumatic; they had had a salient and positive relationship and she had been his caregiver for almost thirty years. At 66 she was critically injured in a car accident in which her husband was killed, and began living alone {{for the first time in}} her life. At 78 she was raped, and her brother killed in the aggravated burglary of his home and surgery. She described this most recent event as the most traumatic experience of her life. I have used the life history method(s) of in-depth interviews, and participant observer techniques to record her narrative. It was apparent that our close familial relationship and her phenomenological attitude influenced her disclosure during the interviewing process. The issue of truth was exacerbated because I was unable to triangulate the early years of her narrative with another person who had known her during this period. There has also been distortion of her narrative when I have intruded with my idiographic propositions which explained how some of these traumatic experiences and her successive recoveries became significant turning points, facilitating subsequent changes in the biological, cultural, social and psychosocial dimensions of her life. As her socio-cultural context was changed by these experiences, so too was her disposition toward subsequent trauma. She seemed to develop a degree of crisis competence and stoicism which appeared to reflect the socio-cultural context in which she had matured and the cumulative experience of trauma which had been such a feature of her life. It was also apparent that her Christian faith <b>facilitated</b> a fatalistic <b>disposition</b> toward recovery from trauma, bolstering her self-confidence and determination to survive adversity...|$|R
6000|$|When the {{advantages}} of the possession and of the project are on a par, there is no motive for a change. But in the present case, perhaps, they are not upon a par, and the difference is in favor of the possession. It does not appear to me that the expenses of those whom you are going to expel do in fact take a course so directly and so generally leading to vitiate and degrade and render miserable those through whom they pass as the expenses of those favorites whom you are intruding into their houses. Why should the expenditure of a great landed property, which is a dispersion of the surplus product of the soil, appear intolerable to you or to me, when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast libraries, which are the history of the force and weakness of the human mind,--through great collections of ancient records, medals, and coins, which attest and explain laws and customs,--through paintings and statues, that, by imitating Nature, seem to extend the limits of creation,--through grand monuments of the dead, which continue the regards and connections of life beyond the grave,--through collections of the specimens of Nature, which become a representative assembly of all the classes and families of the world, that by <b>disposition</b> <b>facilitate,</b> and by exciting curiosity open, the avenues to science? If by great permanent establishments all these objects of expense are better secured from the inconstant sport of personal caprice and personal extravagance, are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed in scattered individuals? Does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter, who toil in order to partake the sweat of the peasant, flow as pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the majestic edifices of religion as in the painted booths and sordid sties of vice and luxury? as honorably and as profitably in repairing those sacred works which grow hoary with innumerable years as on the momentary receptacles of transient voluptuousness,--in opera-houses, and brothels, and gaming-houses, and club-houses, and obelisks in the Champ de Mars? Is the surplus product of the olive and the vine worse employed in the frugal sustenance of persons whom the fictions of a pious imagination raise to dignity by construing in the service of God than in pampering the innumerable multitude of those who are degraded by being made useless domestics, subservient to the pride of man? Are the decorations of temples an expenditure less worthy a wise man than ribbons, and laces, and national cockades, and petit maisons, and petit soupers, and all the innumerable fopperies and follies in which opulence sports away the burden of its superfluity? ...|$|R
