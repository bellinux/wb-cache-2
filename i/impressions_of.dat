40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether the}} <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed from static images influences time perception. In Experiment 1, we used three pictures of cheetahs and manipulated their background images {{to change the}} <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed, and conducted a time reproduction task. The result showed that the reproduced durations of horizontal blur stimuli, which were estimated the highest <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed by participants, were shorter than those of other stimuli. However, the reproduced durations were not influenced by the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed derived from dynamic posture of cheetahs. In Experiment 2, we used geometric figures with action lines and examined whether the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed derived from the shape information influences time perception. The result showed that the reproduced durations were not influenced by the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed. These {{results suggest that the}} <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> speed derived from the texture information shortened the perceived time...|$|R

5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} his discussions of Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment.

5|$|By 2003, around 1,044casts {{made from}} <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> {{bodies in the}} ash {{deposits}} had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100. The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980). What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or {{the percentage of the}} dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.|$|E
50|$|These tools {{create a}} curved <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> {{a series of}} short, closely spaced lines. They may be used interchangeably, the only {{difference}} being that the veiner creates a simple curved line, while the shell tool has a pattern resembling {{the edge of a}} scallop along the inside edge. They are used to continue to create the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> depth created by the beveler, and to create the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a curved surface. These tools are used in the usual way, but like the pear shader, may also be tilted to help create the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> depth where they are used beside a cut.|$|R
50|$|Raster scan on CRTs {{produces}} {{both the}} <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> a steady image {{from a single}} scanning point (only one point is being drawn at a time) through several technical and psychological processes. These images then produce the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> motion in largely {{the same way as}} film - a high enough frame rate of still images yields the <b>impression</b> <b>of</b> motion - though raster scans differ in a few respects, particularly interlacing.|$|R

5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs {{is derived}} {{from a variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{compare their}} {{perceptions}} of To Kill a Mockingbird as adults with when they first read it as children.

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. <b>Impressions</b> <b>of</b> {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have been}} smooth and well-provided with glands.

5|$|The first {{complete}} specimen {{was announced}} in 1861, and ten more Archaeopteryx fossils have been found since then. Most of the eleven known fossils include <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> feathers—among the oldest direct evidence of such structures. Moreover, because these feathers take the advanced form of flight feathers, Archaeopteryx fossils are evidence that feathers began to evolve before the Late Jurassic.|$|E
5|$|A long {{heritage}} {{of ethnic and}} cultural bands have come from Omaha. The Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame celebrates the city's long history of African-American music and the Strathdon Caledonia Pipe Band carries on a Scottish legacy. Internationally renowned composer Antonín Dvořák wrote his Ninth ("New World") Symphony in 1893 based on his <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> the region after visiting Omaha's robust Czech community. In the period surrounding World War I Valentin J. Peter encouraged Germans in Omaha to celebrate their rich musical heritage, too. Frederick Metz, Gottlieb Storz and Frederick Krug were influential brewers whose beer gardens kept many German bands active.|$|E

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie I asked the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Body <b>impressions</b> <b>of</b> Early Carboniferous temnospondyls from Pennsylvania {{suggest that}} some {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls mated on land like some modern amphibians. They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water. The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the temnospondyls were gregarious. The head of one individual rests under the tail of another {{in what may be}} a courtship display. Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern salamanders.|$|E
