5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors would read can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have <b>it</b> <b>read</b> aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Joseph Stalin's {{manoeuvres}} {{inside the}} Bolshevik party moved Gramsci {{to write a}} letter to the Comintern in which he deplored the opposition led by Leon Trotsky but also underlined some presumed faults of the leader.

This caused a difficult conflict between Gramsci and Togliatti which they never completely resolved.|$|E

25|$|Visual memory, in an {{academic}} environment, entails work with pictures, symbols, numbers, letters, and especially words. Students {{must be able to}} look at a word, form an image of that word in their minds and be able to recall the appearance of the word later. When teachers introduce a new vocabulary word, generally they write it on the chalkboard, have the children spell <b>it,</b> <b>read</b> it and then use it in a sentence. The word is then erased from the chalkboard. Students with good visual memory will recognize that same word later in their readers or other texts and will be able to recall the appearance of the word to spell it.|$|E
25|$|To {{replace the}} lights, in July 2015 the MTA began {{overhauling}} the front destination signs of buses {{to display the}} route in a blue background, {{as well as a}} completely blue background that flashes twice when it says +Select Bus (formerly <b>it</b> <b>read</b> +Select Bus Service). At night on some routes, the front destination sign is blue text on an unlit black background. Starting with the Q44 in November 2015, the blue background is kept when the front signage transitions to show the terminal of the route and the main streets traveled. As of July 2017, the SBS fleet on all routes have had their front destination signs overhauled, and new routes that launched after that date came with the new destination signs.|$|E

Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs {{on a piece of paper}} and had <b>it</b> <b>read</b> aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place.

25|$|The company {{moved to}} have the case {{dismissed}} and compel arbitration. When that was denied, it petitioned the Florida Fourth District Court of Appeal which ruled that arbitration was required because the entire contract had been challenged, not the severable arbitration clause. But then that decision was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court, which reversed {{on the grounds that}} the contract was illegal ab initio and thus the arbitration clause was unenforceable. <b>It</b> <b>read</b> Prima Paint to distinguish between void contracts that could never have legal standing, such as the one at issue, and voidable contracts where that result could come to pass later as a result of dispute resolution but where the contract was legal on its face.

Upon hearing this, the Exarchate of Ravenna rose in revolt against the imperial imposition of iconoclasm. The armies of Ravenna and the Duchy of the Pentapolis mutinied, denouncing both Exarch Paul and Leo III, and overthrew those officers who remained loyal. Paul rallied the loyalist forces and attempted to restore order, but was killed. The armies discussed electing their own emperor and marching on Constantinople, but were dissuaded by Pope Gregory from acting against Leo. At the same time, the self described “duke” Exhilaratus and his son Hadrian rebelled in Naples, sided with the emperor and marched on Rome in order to kill Gregory, but were overthrown by the people and killed.|$|E
