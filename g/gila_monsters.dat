5|$|Urban sprawl {{and habitat}} {{destruction}} have adversely affected Gila monster numbers. In 1952, {{they became the}} first venomous animal to be given legal protection. <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> are listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN. In 1963, the San Diego Zoo became the first zoo to successfully breed <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Prey may {{be crushed}} to death if large or eaten alive if small, {{swallowed}} head-first, and helped down by muscular contractions and neck flexing. Unusually, after food has been swallowed, the Gila monster immediately resumes tongue flicking and search behavior, probably {{as a result}} of a history of finding clumped prey such as eggs and young in nests. <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> are able to climb trees and cacti in search of eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Gila monster {{is found}} in the Southwestern United States and Mexico, a range {{including}} Sonora, Arizona, parts of California, Nevada, Utah, and New Mexico (potentially including Baja California). They inhabit scrubland, succulent desert, and oak woodland, seeking shelter in burrows, thickets, and under rocks in locations with ready access to moisture. In fact, <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> seem to like water and can be observed immersing themselves in puddles of water after a summer rain. They avoid living in open areas such as flats and farmland.|$|E
500|$|Though the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is venomous, its laggard {{movement}} {{means it}} poses little threat to humans. However, it {{has earned a}} fearsome reputation and is often killed by humans because of fear. Among Native American tribes, the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> had a mixed standing. The Apache believed its breath could kill a man, and the Tohono O'Odham and the Pima believed it possessed a spiritual power that could cause sickness. In contrast, the Seri and the Yaqui believed the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster's</b> hide had healing properties. The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> has even starred as a monster in a B movie, The Giant <b>Gila</b> <b>Monster</b> (though the titular monster was actually portrayed by a Mexican beaded lizard). It played a minor role in the motion picture The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. [...] Myths about the animal include that the animal's breath is toxic enough to kill humans, that it can spit venom and that it can leap several {{feet in the air}} to attack. Another myth held that the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> did not have an anus and therefore expelled waste from its mouth, the source of its venom and [...] "fetid breath". The official mascot of [...] Eastern Arizona College located in Thatcher, Arizona, is Gila Hank, a gun-toting, cowboy-hat-wearing <b>Gila</b> <b>monster.</b> A similar character as an old western outlaw was seen in 2011 animated film Rango, called Bad Bill; the character was voiced by Ray Winstone.|$|R
50|$|Lizards {{such as the}} <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> produce toxins {{with medical}} applications. Gila toxin reduces plasma glucose; the {{substance}} is now synthesised {{for use in the}} anti-diabetes drug exenatide (Byetta). A toxin from <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> saliva has been studied for use as an anti-Alzheimer's drug.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> has one close living relative, the {{beaded lizard}} (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history of which may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the <b>Gila</b> <b>monster</b> is better placed in a separate family.|$|R
5|$|Its wild creatures include black bear, bobcat, Mexican wolves, elk, <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters,</b> coyotes, rattlesnakes, cougars, skunks, and red foxes, {{as well as}} cranes, golden eagle, red-tailed hawk, {{and great}} horned owls. In keeping with Navajo tradition, none of the zoo's birds were {{captured}} {{for the purpose of}} being exhibited, but were rather rescued after sustaining injuries from vehicles or electrical lines and are thus unable to fly; the majority of the other specimens are also non-releasable and unable to survive in the wild due to being orphaned or having been confiscated as illegal pets from their former owners.|$|E
5|$|The park's 36 reptile species include desert tortoises, diamondback rattlesnakes (one of {{the more}} {{commonly}} seen snakes), coral snakes, <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters,</b> short-horned lizards, spiny lizards, and zebra-tailed lizards. Despite the aridity, three amphibian species inhabit the park: the canyon tree frog, the lowland leopard frog, and Couch's spadefoot, which lives in underground burrows, emerging to breed during summer rains. Forest fires, which create erosion-prone burned areas, have destroyed many of the leopard frog's breeding pools, which fill with sediment. The Arizona Game and Fish Department lists the lowland leopard frog as a species of special concern.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} animals reside within the preserve. Among them are hooded skunks, spotted skunks, hog-nosed skunks, stink badgers, coyotes, mule deer, javelina, raccoons, <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters,</b> ringtails, rock squirrels, spiny lizards leopard frogs, Clark’s spiny lizard, ornate tree lizard, Gilbert’s skink, ring-necked snake, western diamondback rattlesnake, gray fox, bobcats, and {{mountain}} lions.|$|E

25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; salivary amylase {{is found in}} many, {{but by no means}} all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters,</b> and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E

500|$|<b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> spend 90% {{of their}} time {{underground}} in burrows or rocky shelters.

They are preyed upon by coyotes and raptors.|$|E
500|$|The Gila monster {{produces}} venom in modified {{salivary glands}} in its lower jaw, unlike snakes, whose venom {{is produced in}} the upper jaw. The Gila monster lacks the musculature to forcibly inject the venom; instead, the venom is propelled from the gland to the tooth by chewing. Capillary action brings the venom out of the tooth and into the victim. The teeth are loosely anchored, which allows them to be broken off and replaced throughout life. <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> have been observed to flip over while biting the victim, presumably to aid {{the flow of the}} venom into the wound. Because the Gila monster's prey consists mainly of eggs, small animals, and otherwise [...] "helpless" [...] prey, the Gila monster's venom is thought to have evolved for defensive rather than for hunting use. A defensive use would explain the Gila monster's bright warning coloration.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Handy's friend, Dr. George Goodfellow of Tombstone, {{was among}} the first to {{research}} the actual effects of Gila monster venom. Scientific American reported in 1890 that [...] "The breath is very fetid, and its odor can be detected at some little distance from the lizard. It is supposed that this is one way in which the monster catches the insects and small animals which form a part of its food supply—the foul gas overcoming them." [...] Goodfellow offered to pay local residents $5.00 for Gila monster specimens. He bought several and collected more on his own. In 1891 he purposefully provoked one of his captive lizards into biting him on his finger. The bite made him ill and he spent the next five days in bed, but he completely recovered. When Scientific American ran another ill-founded report on the lizard's ability to kill people, he wrote in reply and described his own studies and personal experience. He wrote that he knew several people who had been bitten by <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> but had not died from the bite.|$|E
500|$|The Gila monster {{emerges from}} {{hibernation}} in January or February and mates in May and June. The male initiates courtship by flicking his tongue {{to search for}} the female's scent. If the female rejects his advances, she will bite him and crawl away. When successful, copulation has been observed to last from 15 minutes to as long as two and a half hours. The female lays eggs in July or August, burying them in sand [...] below the surface. The clutch consists of two to 12 eggs: five is the average. The incubation lasts nine months, as the hatchlings emerge during April through June the following year. The hatchlings are about [...] long and can bite and inject venom upon hatching. The juveniles typically have larger bands of pink scales than adults, although the banded Gila monster (H. s. cinctum) has a tendency to retain the band pattern. H. suspectum sexually matures at three to five years old. After egg-laying, adult <b>Gila</b> <b>monsters</b> gradually spend less time on the surface to avoid the hottest part of the summer (although they may be active in the evening), eventually starting their hibernation around November.|$|E
