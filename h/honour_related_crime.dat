40|$|The {{murders of}} Pela Atroshi, Sara Abed Ali and Fadime Sahindal, started a debate {{concerning}} the underlying motives of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence. This paper aimed {{to describe and}} explain in what way <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence is perceived in publications by academics, public authorities and voluntary organisations to name a few. Different types of literature were thematically analysed as well as analysed using a model by Lorentzon. The scope {{of this paper was}} narrowed down to Swedish conditions and excluded men as victims of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> <b>crimes.</b> The conclusion suggests a definition of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence as a result of general patriarchy with different features. For example, men’s honour is connected to women’s behaviour and retaining of virginity. The only way to restore a lost honour is to eliminate the woman physically or socially. The use of postcolonial theories in analyzing the definition resulted in an understanding of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence perceived as something different from Swedish culture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> and {{the judicial}} process within the legal system in a Swedish context. The empirical base {{of the study is}} four cases, with an honour background, and we have used discourse analysis as our method. We have developed four tools for analysing the sentences with which we observed aspects such as; language, the roles of victim and perpetrator that the involved can undertake, the different identities that the sentence might create and finally how the stories change when they enter the legal context. We connect our results to our theoretic backgrounds such as Kolfjord who discusses the legalization of conflicts, the holistic and individual perspective, the legal system as a theoretic background and finally the UN:s definition of honour crimes. These four theoretic perspectives have helped analyse the empiric base. The study reveals that the courts handle cases of honour without discussing that fact. It emerges aspects from the stories that are specific for honour crimes. The courts show a difficulty when handling cases with an honour background, there is a conflict between the group norms and the individualistic perspective. The courts describe honour in the empirical material despite the fact that honour has no legal grounds in the Swedish laws...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} has been to investigate possible reasons for why <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression exist in Sweden {{as well as to}} find out how some voluntary organisations work to change <b>honour</b> oppression <b>related</b> attitudes. The questions that the reserachers were trying to answer were (1) What are the possible causes for <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression in Sweden? (2) How can <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression be identified? (3) What are the voluntary organisations doing to change these attitudes? To answer these questions a qualitative method was used. The reserachers examined what leading researchers in this area thought were the reasons to why <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression exist and then carried out interviews with participants from four voluntary organisations. A social constructional approached were chosen as the theoretical framework for this research and the results were also analysed from several perspectives. The reserachers found that the reasons for the <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression links to the upkeep of old traditions and customs as well as gaps in the Swedish integration of immigrants. The researchers concluded that the <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> oppression exist due to old habits that can change over time...|$|R
40|$|Objective: It {{was aimed}} {{in this study}} to draw the illicit drug profile of our region by {{collecting}} the data of the last 30 years regarding the illicit drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> in Bursa and its vicinity. Method: The universe of the study comprised of drug <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> facts (crime fact is the drug <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> committed by a criminal who is arrested by the narcotic bureau) in the archives of Narcotic Bureau of Bursa Police Department between the years 1974 - 2003. A special form was prepared for the study and this form was completed for each registered drugs crime fact. Results: In the result of criminal record screening, 3. 664 drug <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> facts were analyzed. The average age of drug production crime {{was significantly higher than}} the average age of dealing, possession and using drug crimes. Ratio of males was higher in the total of each crime type. 53, 5 % of drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> committed by females and 35, 1 % of drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> committed by males was associated with dealing crimes. A statistically significant difference was found between the distribution of the type of drugs and the type of crime. Discussion and Conclusion: It was found out that the majority of drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> are committed by males with a lower socio-cultural and economical level, who are young or in their mids, born and living in Bursa, and that the committed drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> are to a very great extent associated with cannabis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Among {{numerous}} {{types of}} criminal activities, vehicle <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> contributes to personal injury {{as well as}} to economic losses. Over the last 10 years vehicle <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> continuously constitutes over 10 % of all crime in Germany. However, vehicle <b>related</b> <b>crime</b> is not particularly a German phenomenon but even more a worldwide problem which does not respect national borders. Meanwhile, connected mobility gains importance and vehicles are increasingly equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Additionally, the penetration of consumer electronics (CE) increases constantly. Hence, it seems promising to use these new technologies to tackle vehicle <b>related</b> <b>crime.</b> But to be able to apply these new technologies successfully against vehicle <b>related</b> <b>crime,</b> a systematic approach to understand these crimes in detail is necessary. To address this challenge, we apply two criminological theories, Rational Choice Perspective and Situational Crime Prevention, to the vehicle related context. We also provide an innovative idea for a countermeasure based on information and communication technologies (ICT) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{domestic}} violence pertains to different definitions of violence, {{one of which is}} the concept of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence and oppression. This paper looks at <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence and oppression, as defined in policy documents at a central political level, and how various discourses stand in relation to social categories and power relations. Consequently, the theoretical and methodological premise of the paper has been based on discourse analysis and an intersectional perspective has been applied to gain further depth and breadth in the analysis of the material. The intersectional perspective houses various approaches to the understanding of specific phenomena based on factors of gender, ethnicity, sexuality and class. The analysis concludes that the concept of <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence and oppression is a concept without a single scientific definition. There is, however, a general consensus in the political context that <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence and oppression is a collective force that can be directed at both sexes. The explanations for the violence in the studied documents vary from this kind of violence being seen as a cultural condition, to it being seen as part of the universal patriarchal oppression aimed at all women regardless of their background. Socio-economic factors are not mentioned as a possible explanatory factor...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects on}} crime of a localized policing experiment that decriminalized cannabis possession in the London borough of Lambeth between 2001 and 2002. We find that decriminalization led to a surge in drug related offences, and a collapse in arrest and clear-up rates for drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> in Lambeth. These effects are quantitatively large and persist well after the policy experiment ends. However, the policy does allow the Lambeth police to reallocate their effort towards non-drug <b>related</b> <b>crimes,</b> leading to permanent reductions in nearly all other crime types. We also find the policy to have spillovers onto boroughs neighboring Lambeth. As drug consumers and suppliers relocate to Lambeth after decriminalization, drug crime rates significantly fall in neighbors to Lambeth. To understand the benefits of coordinating drugs policies across jurisdictions, we compare these results to the effects on crime of the nationwide decriminalization of cannabis in the UK from 2004 to 2009. We find that nationwide decriminalization {{does not lead to}} a growth in drugs <b>related</b> <b>crime,</b> but does allow the police to reallocate effort towards non-drug <b>related</b> <b>crime.</b> We interpret the results through a Hotelling-style model that makes precise the behavioral response to decriminalization of the police, suppliers and demanders of drugs...|$|R

We have conducted six interviews with school counselors in the southern Sweden. We have used a semi structured interview technique with questionnaires that have been a support to us during the interviews. The results of our study showed that some of our respondents knew that they had limited education and knowledge in <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> violence and also that they wanted more experience about the problemarea. Other respondents said that they had experience enough about the problemar ea. The results also show that the respondents believe that there is more <b>honour</b> <b>related</b> problems in the adolescents families than what the counselors find out about, and that some of the respondents didn´t even know in wich way they could provide help to theese students...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this study is}} to explore the {{relationship}} between structural factors of a specific society and occurrence of terror <b>related</b> <b>crimes.</b> Accordingly, the objective {{of this study is to}} examine how or to what extent social disorganization theory, which is the basic theoretical foundation of this study, can explain terrorism <b>related</b> <b>crimes</b> in Turkey. Although several previous studies investigated the social and structural dimensions of terrorism in a country, many of those studies did not go beyond investigating the impacts of traditional structural factors such as poverty, inequality, and education on terrorism. This study goes a step further by adding the mediating factors between those primary social disorganization variables and terror <b>related</b> <b>crimes.</b> Direct, indirect and, total effects of structural variables on terrorism through the mediating variables, that is prevalence of voluntary associations and religious institutions, are examined. Findings obtained from multivariate and mediation analyses show that while some structural variables such as education and poverty are directly related to distribution of terror <b>related</b> <b>crimes,</b> this relationship became indirect through the mediating variables for other structural variables such as residential mobility and unemployment. Results suggest that rather than overreliance on traditional antiterrorism strategies which are mostly depending on the public level control such as law enforcement process, programs supported by other levels of social control, that is, parochial and private levels must be encouraged...|$|R
