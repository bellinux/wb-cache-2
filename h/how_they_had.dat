5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{located the}} origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and the trail of accelerant had ended {{at the door of}} the master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{set out a}} {{detailed}} study of common descent with modifications by expanding {{on the theme of}} coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in On the Origin of Species. He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.|$|E

5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations.|$|E

25|$|Accusations and recriminations flew around.

Simon stated that, besides Hudson (an accomplished saxophonist), the others had only rudimentary horn skills, and achieved their sound simply by creatively utilizing their limited technique.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{exploration}} of the female contribution to contemporary comedy specifically focusing on the women within Saturday Night Live (SNL). It will examine the inequalities and discrimination the women on the show <b>have</b> faced and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> challenged this in recent years. It will look at the common misconception that women aren’t funny and will identify the many funny women the show <b>has</b> produced and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> succeeded in mainstream contemporary comedy. It will also examine the remarkable rise of fledgling female comedians within a patriarchal environment that is network television. This study will look at the rise of the women in Saturday Night Live and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> created a chain reaction for the success of all women in comedy...|$|R
25|$|Whatever Mao's {{opinion of}} Zhou may have been, there was general {{mourning}} among the public. Foreign correspondents reported that Beijing, shortly after Zhou's death, {{looked like a}} ghost town. There was no burial ceremony, as Zhou had willed his ashes to be scattered across the hills and rivers of his hometown, rather than stored in a ceremonial mausoleum. With Zhou gone, it became clear how the Chinese people had revered him, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> viewed him {{as a symbol of}} stability in an otherwise chaotic period of history. Zhou's death also brought condolences from nations around the world.|$|E

He drove them personally to Banja Luka and later on they were transferred to the Islamic Humanitarian Association Merhamet.

25|$|Generally, {{customers}} speak positively about 99p Stores, {{with most}} reviewers only criticising customer and product overcrowding, {{as well as}} a lack of cleanliness in many of their stores. Some reviewers note that they have seen several items cheaper from other retailers; however mostly the products on offer at 99p Stores are of good value. Reviews on dooyoo.co.uk (a shopping advice and review site) show an average rating of 4/5. Upon opening one of their stores at Muswell Hill, customers were commenting <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> wanted a shop like 99p Stores for some time, with very strong sales reported for their first day of trading.|$|E
25|$|His work led Congress to {{commission}} {{a study in}} 1926–1927 of the overall condition of Native Americans in the United States. The results were called the Meriam Report. Published in 1928 as The Problem of Indian Administration, the Meriam Report revealed the failures of federal Indian policies and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> contributed to severe problems with Native American education, health, and poverty. Collier's efforts, including {{the publication of the}} report, raised the visibility of Native American issues within the federal government. The Great Depression brought a harsher economic environment for most Native Americans. The administration of President Herbert Hoover reorganized the BIA and provided it with major funding increases.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November 1793, {{the arrest}} of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defence, refuting the {{financial}} accusations, reminding the court of <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court was however inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing their goods, it would recover huge sums for the state.
