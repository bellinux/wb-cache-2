40|$|During {{the last}} decade, strarlings {{have built up}} {{considerable}} urban populations {{in the city of}} Liège,causing much trouble to inhabitants {{in the vicinity of the}} roosting sites. This success migh be attribuable to the sheltered situation of the city in a deep valley, abundance of large trees in green spaces along bank of the river Meuse and in public parks, good situation amid pastures in the countryside, and on important migration routes. Before any attempt to reduce this underisable population, the city's authorithies have promoted a research on the localisation, evaluation, evolution of roosting groups, as well as on pre-roosting routes and diurnal dispersion, It is clear that fluctuations in the attendance at one peculiar roosting site is understandable only in beeing replaced in the context of breeding cycle, migration influx, weather conditions, food <b>disponibilities,</b> and man-made disturbance.

40|$|Optimal {{foraging}} {{is one of}} {{the capital}} topics nowadays in Sahelian region. The vast majority of feed consumed by ruminants in Sahelian region is still formed by natural pastures. Pastoral constraints are the high variability of available forage and drinking water in space and especially in time (highly seasonal, interannual variability) and the scarcity of water resources. The mobility is the main functional and opportunistic adaptation to these constraints. Our goal in this paper is to formalize two dynamical models for interactions between a herd of domesticate animals, forage resources, and water resources inside a given Sahelian area, in order to confirm, explain, and predict by mathematical models some observations about pastoralism in Sahelian region. These models in some contexts can be similar to predator-prey models as forage and water resources can be considered as preys and herd’s animals as predators.

40|$|Situated {{within the}} {{theatrical}} turn in Christian theology, this project explores theatre {{as a model}} for theological ethics, looking particularly at the dynamic interplay between formation as <b>disponibility</b> (availability) and performance as fittingness (appropriateness). A primary goal is to demonstrate how disponible formation and fitting performance are multi-dimensional realities oriented simultaneously toward the triune God (as playwright-producer-protagonist), Scripture (as transcript and prescript), the church (as characters in company), tradition (as performance paradigms), unbelievers (as audience), and local context (as theatrical environment and place). As a result, this theodramatic approach seeks to integrate theology and ethics, describing and resourcing everyday Christian practice with reflection on the theodrama. In addition, focusing on the dynamic interplay between formation and performance represents an attempt to unify agent-oriented with action-oriented theological ethics within a holistic, theodramatic framework. Finally, through attentive interaction with theatrical theory and practice, this project contributes to a fruitful and growing dialogue between Christian theology and the arts, particularly how theatre provides imaginative, heuristic models for theological ethics pursued within the liberating constraints of confessional Christianity...|$|E

Excess cytoplasmic Zinc is toxic to the cells so there are cell-entry and intracellular buffering mechanisms that control intracellular Zinc <b>disponibility.</b> Tubulin and actin are two Zinc-scavenging proteins that are essential components of the cellular cytoskeleton implicated in cell division, migration and cellular architecture maintenance. Here we demonstrate how exposure to different ZnO nanostructures, namely ZnO commercial nanoparticles and custom-made ZnO nanowires, produce acute cytotoxic effects in human keratinocytes (HaCat) and epithelial cells (HeLa) triggering a dose-dependent cell retraction and collapse. We show how engulfed ZnO nanoparticles dissolve intracellularly, triggering actin filament bundling and structural changes in microtubules, transforming these highly dynamic 24 nm diameter polymers into rigid macrotubes of tubulin, severely affecting cell proliferation and survival. Our results demostrate that nano-ZnO causes an acute cytoskeletal collapse that triggers necrosis, followed by a late reactive oxygen species (ROS) -dependent apoptotic process.

The construct of agency, defined as the capacity to make decisions and to address situations depending on the individual’s future plans, reflects a specific normative criterion: individuals are expected to live in an active and productive way, while those who are unable to live up to this expectation are considered dependent, passive, unproductive, weak. From a social constructionist perspective, the current study proposes a critical reflection on the qualities usually attributed to the construct of agency that are liable to appear reductive and oppressive when applied to an elderly population. Once the basic premises underlying agency, as it is commonly defined in the Western tradition, have been deconstructed, a different conceptualisation, based on interviews with older individuals, will be presented. The current work aims to produce a different conceptual framework that will permit examination of experiences and organisational modalities of agency typifying later life.

40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) is {{a staple}} crop for {{over half of}} the world’s population. In {{numerous}} areas of South and South-east Asia, soils and aquifers are arsenic contaminated leading to a potential health risk to populations due to As accumulation in rice. In most As-affected areas of South and South-east Asia, groundwater is rich in iron. Excess of both elements are serious threat to sustainable agriculture, in relation to a decrease of rice yield and a contamination of rice grains by toxic As. Nevertheless, the ability of rice species to carry oxygen from the air down its stem through aerenchyma and discharge it through its roots, creates an oxidised zone around individual roots in which Fe is oxidised to the Fe(III) state and forms a coating called “iron plaque”. This Fe plaque may retain As and reduces it <b>disponibility</b> for the plant. We aimed to investigate the impact of combined As and Fe stresses on rice growth and yield and study the influence of the Fe plaque on As uptake and speciation. Twenty five days old rice seedlings were exposed to As (V) (50 mM and 100 mM), Fe(II) (125 ppm) or combined treatments until plant maturation. The presence of Fe allowed the development of a Fe plaque on the rice roots that limited the As accumulation and modified its speciation in the different plant organs.

It provides specific information's about the evolution of the system in a certain period of time and also the future directions of development. Therefore, to remedy certain dysfunctions that occurred in the system it is important to determine the factors which influenced the evolutionary trends of this component. Purpose of StudyThe aim of the current study follows two directions: 1. to determinate the main causes leading to the geodemographic changes occurred in the last years in the region; 2. which is the role of the place attachment of the community in terms of current geodemographic phenomena's?MethodsFor the first part of the study we conducted from a comparative perspective a secondary analysis using data available from the National Institute of Statistics. In the second part we appealed to the analysis and interpretation of data provided by the 53 respondents that were questioned. The questionnaire covers mainly questions on the migration phenomenon and place attachment. ResultsThe values of the calculated indicators for the Land of Dorna revealed that they are below the average values of Suceava County. This aspect reinforces the balance status of the region in terms of geodemographic phenomena's. Another issue identified is the interrelationship between the place attachment of the population and their <b>disponibility</b> to emigrate.

Constant but not frequent were the bees (Apidae) Plebeia droryana (Friese, 1900), Friesella schrottkyi (Friese, 1900), Nannotrigona testaceicornis (Lepeletier, 1836), Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811), the wasps (Vespidae) Polybia paulista Ihering, 1896, Protopolybia exigua (de Saussure, 1854), Agelaia pallipes (Olivier. 1791), the ant (Formicidae) Pseudomyrmex sp. and the beetle (Chrysomelidae) Diabrotica speciosa (Germar, 1824). E. speciosa flowers were visited by hummingbirds (Trochilidae) : Eupetomena macroura (Gmelin, 1788), Clorostilbon aureoventris (d'Orbigny & Lafresnaye, 1838) and Amazilia sp. The birds Passer domeslicus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Ploceidae) and Coereba flaveola (Linnaeus, 1758) (Emberizidac), also are present. The frequency and insect distribution were influenced by ambiental factors. Temperature, light, time, barometric pressure, relative humidity and wind velocity were significantly correlated with insect numbers. There is a visit sequence, by floral resource <b>disponibility</b> during the day, conditioned by transport ability, insect numbers and colony necessity, which begins by A. mellifera followed by meliponid bees. These bees make the pollination when they collect the pollen. There is a great animal variety which are sustained by flowers. It is suggested that E. speciosa is one important food source for urban fauna in winter, and so it should be utilized more frequently in streets, parks and gardens arborization...|$|E
40|$|Modern civilization, {{in recent}} years, has {{increased}} the requirement of products derived from iron and steel, stimulating {{the growth of the}} national siderurgical sector and, consequently, the generation of industrial residue called basic slag. In this context, the recycling of residues can contribute to solve problems of the industries that give priority to the excellence of the production with quality. On the other hand, there is a sector of primary production in Brazil, the agriculture, with a great cultivated area in acid ground and with low fertility, being these factors admittedly determinative for vegetal production, under tropical conditions. Thus, there is a scenery of two primary sectors of production, although distinct ones, that present interaction potential, for, on one hand, there is <b>disponibility</b> of a product with similar properties to the liming materials and traditional fertilizers and, on the other hand, a production sector that is highly dependent of these products. And the interaction between these two sectors helps in the preservation of the environment, bringing, thus, a certain sustainability in the production systems of the postmodern civilization that will be the challenge of this new century. Considering the current possibility of recycling these industrial residues in agriculture, three important factors have to be taken into account. The first would be the proper use of the abundant, available and promising industrial residue; the second, in a propitious agricultural environment, acid soil and low fertility; and third, in a responsive and important socio-economic culture, the sugar cane, considering its vast cultivated area. In national literature, few works have dealt {{with the use of the}} basic slag and have evaluated the reply of the cultures to its application. Thus, the present work had as its aim to gather information from literature concerning the characterization and production of basic slag in Brazil, as well as the agronomic viability of its use in sugar cane, pointing benefits in the liming of the soil and in the supply of nutrients and silicon...|$|E
