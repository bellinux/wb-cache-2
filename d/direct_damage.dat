5|$|Unlike other London termini, Marylebone {{saw little}} <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> during the Blitz. It was closed between 5 October and 26 November 1940 after the {{approach}} tunnels were breached, and the goods depot was bombed on 16 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fueling Hero actions, Bezels {{act as a}} safeguard to character defeat. Characters will not receive any <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> {{as long as there}} is at least one Bezel. If there are enough Bezels remaining, receiving damage that would otherwise defeat the character instead causes the character to be knocked into the air and the Bezel is shattered into shards that scatter across the battlefield. If the player does not have any Bezels remaining, the characters go into critical mode. Critical mode causes the characters to become extremely scared, leaving them unable to shoot quickly, unable to use Hero actions, and taking <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> from every attack. Four Bezel Shards must be collected by the characters in order to restore a Bezel and replenish their power, and enemies can even pick up Bezel Shards to regenerate health and shields. The game ends if any character is killed and there are no intact Bezels to protect them.|$|E

50|$|To {{resolve a}} combat round, the {{offensive}} rating factors for each ship/unit are summed {{to produce the}} battleforce's compot, or combat potential. Each player also chooses a Battle Intensity Rating reflecting how aggressively the ship captains handle their ships. A die is thrown; when indexed with the BIR and adjusted for electronic warfare, a percentage is obtained. This multiplied by the compot produces the number of damage points scored on the enemy battleforce. The attacking player has the option of allocating some of this <b>damage</b> as <b>directed</b> <b>damage</b> on one (and only one) of his opponent's units. The unit chosen is crippled by turning its counter over to its crippled (reverse) side. The attacker may expend more of his damage score to finish off (destroy) the enemy unit. When using <b>directed</b> <b>damage</b> the attacker must expend two points of his damage score to produce each point of <b>directed</b> <b>damage</b> (one ship can be designated by its owner {{to be in a}} protected position in the battleforce and is attacked by <b>directed</b> <b>damage</b> at a three-to-one ratio. Usually this ship is the flagship or an especially valuable unit like a fleet tug. The fleet scout and any drone bombardment ships also enjoy this advantage). After <b>directed</b> <b>damage</b> is resolved, remaining damage points are absorbed by the defender as he chooses at a one-to-one ratio of damage inflicted to damage taken.|$|R

5|$|By June 1992, {{approximately}} 800 {{people had}} been killed by the bombardment. By the end of the Croatian War of Independence in 1995, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> occurring {{as a consequence of the}} 1991–92 bombardment. Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{assessments}} of Belfasts damage showed that, while the mine had done little <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> {{to the outer}} hull, causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms, {{the shock of the}} explosion had caused severe warping, breaking machinery, deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog (bend upwards) by three inches. On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status, becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard, and her crew dispersed to other vessels. By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport, arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson.|$|E
5|$|The attack caused little <b>direct</b> <b>damage,</b> but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected Gambier to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but Gambier refused. Cochrane continued {{the battle over the}} next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier. This allowed most of the French fleet to refloat and retreat up the Charente to safety. Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E

Players who are playing as Monster Characters in a PvP zone also {{gain access to the}} Fellowship Manoeuvres panel. Although the same {{principles}} apply, they are instead renamed Warband Manoeuvres. The four contributions that can be made are Troll's Brutality, which deals <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> to a target, Spiders Venom, which deals direct and periodic damage, Wight's Rot, which deals <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> and saps power from the target, and Fell-Spirit's Terror which deals <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> and saps morale.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{specific}} features of the mechanisms responsible {{for the development of}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>damaging</b> factors and to reveal its differential diagnostic signs. Materials and methods. Lung morphological changes were studied creating experimental models of ARDS of various genesis in 75 outbred male albino rats weighing 300 — 400 g, which included the <b>direct</b> <b>damaging</b> factor acidine-pepsin aspiration (Group 1, n= 25) and the indirect damaging factor blood loss (Group 2, n= 50). Prospective examinations were made in 73 patients (43 men and 30 women, whose age was 21 to 69 years) with ARDS caused by <b>direct</b> <b>damaging</b> factors, such as aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, blunt chest injury, and pulmonary contusion (37 patients, including 21 men and 16 women) and in those with ARDS caused by indirect damaging factors, such as abdominal sepsis, severe concomitant injury, and hemorrhagic shock (36 patients, including 22 men and 14 women). Results. The study has shown that ARDS caused by <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>damaging</b> factors is characterized by different developmental mechanisms and lung morphological changes that underlie the specific features of functional impairments. Conclusion. The findings made it possible to substantiate and propose new approaches to the differential diagnosis and treatment of ARDS caused by <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>damaging</b> factors.

25|$|In 2000, a {{year after}} the bombing ended, Group 17 {{published}} a survey dealing with damage and economic restoration. The report concluded that <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> from the bombing totalled $3.8 billion, not including Kosovo, of which only 5% had been repaired at that time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Direct</b> DNA <b>damage</b> {{is reduced}} by sunscreen. This {{prevents}} sunburn. When the sunscreen is at {{the surface of the}} skin, it filters the UV rays, which attenuates the intensity. Even when the sunscreen molecules have penetrated into the skin, they protect against <b>direct</b> DNA <b>damage,</b> because the UV light is absorbed by the sunscreen and not by the DNA.|$|R
50|$|The {{increased}} {{production of}} melanin is {{the reaction of}} the skin to UVB-induced <b>direct</b> DNA <b>damage.</b> Several substances are known {{to increase the amount of}} <b>direct</b> DNA <b>damage</b> (thymine dimers). In order to produce this action they have to penetrate into the skin, and this is in contrast to the assumptions which are made by those who endorse sunscreen use (see sunscreen controversy).|$|R
50|$|The pageant {{organizers}} initiated an arbitration proceeding against Monnin for defamation and damages, {{arguing that}} they lost sponsorship and reputation {{because of her}} allegations. On December 30, 2012, an arbitrator ruled that she must pay the pageant organization $5 million for <b>direct</b> <b>damages</b> caused by lose of sponsorship, but has not awarded the other demands of the organizers which was affirmed by the district court.|$|R
25|$|Overexposure to UVB {{radiation}} {{not only}} can cause sunburn but also some forms of skin cancer.

25|$|Ultraviolet light, {{specifically}} UVB, {{has been}} shown to cause cataracts, and some evidence indicates sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life. Microwave radiation has also been found to cause cataracts. The mechanism is unclear, but it may include changes in heat-sensitive enzymes that normally protect cell proteins in the lens. Another possible mechanism is <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> to the lens from pressure waves induced in the aqueous humor.|$|E
25|$|Depending upon {{seasonal}} {{weather conditions}} {{at the time of}} a major event a seismic event could be followed by urban wildfires compounded by damage to water systems or massive landslides in saturated soils. In addition to <b>direct</b> <b>damage</b> the effects on commerce due to damaged infrastructure would also be substantial. Experience with large area urban destruction such as caused by earthquake, hurricane, and firestorms has shown that complete rebuilding can take up to a decade, owing to various factors.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{clinical}} efficiency of escalation and de-escalation procedures for optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from direct and in indirect damaging factors. Subjects and methods. During a prospective study, 46 examined patients (30 men, 16 women; their age was 21 to 67 years) with ARDS of different genesis were divided into 2 groups: 1) 22 patients (14 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were <b>direct</b> <b>damaging</b> factors: gastric content aspiration, blunt chest injury with lung contusion, and acute bilateral bacterial pneumonia; 2) 24 patients (16 men and 8 women) in whom the causes of ARDS were indirect damaging factors: abdominal sepsis, severe nonthoracic injury, and acute massive blood loss. In Groups 1 and 2, {{the efficiency of the}} escalation and de-escalation procedures for PEEP optimization was compared during controlled MV with a managed object. Results. In the patients with ARDS caused by <b>direct</b> <b>damaging</b> factors, the escalation procedure for PEEP optimization was more effective than the de-escalation one. In those with ARDS caused by indirect damaging factors, the de-escalation procedure for PEEP optimization was more effective than the escalation one. Conclusion. It is expedient to use a differential approach to choosing an escalation or de-escalation procedure for PEEP optimization in patients with ARDS induced by <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>damaging</b> factors.
