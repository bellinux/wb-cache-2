5000|$|Vitis labrusca, the <b>fox</b> <b>grape,</b> is {{a species}} of grapevines {{belonging}} to the Vitis genus in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The vines are native to eastern North America and {{are the source of}} many grape cultivars, including Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Isabella, Niagara, and many hybrid grape varieties such as Agawam, Alexander and Onaka. Among the characteristics of this vine species in contrast to the European wine grape Vitis vinifera are its [...] "slip-skin" [...] that allows the skin of the grape berries to easily slip off when squeezed, instead of crushing the pulp, and the presence of tendrils on every node of the cane. Another contrast with European vinifera is the characteristic [...] "foxy" [...] musk of V. labrusca, best known to most people through the Concord grape. This musk is not related to the mammalian fox, but rather to the earthy, redolent aromas characteristic of the grapes that were known by early American settlers in the New World. The term [...] "foxy" [...] became a sort of catchall for the wine tasting descriptors used for these American wines that were distinct from the familiar flavors of the European viniferous wines.|$|E

The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of different substrates during the acclimatization of <b>fox</b> <b>grape</b> cv. Bordô. The experiment was carried out at the greenhouse during February and March of 2009. Five substrates were tested: Plantmax® HT, Plantmax® HT: Coconut fiber (7, 5 : 2, 5 v/v), Plantmax® HT: Coconut fiber (1 : 1 v/v), Plantmax® HT: Coconut fiber (2, 5 : 7, 5 v/v) and Coconut fiber. The process of acclimatization consisted of three phases. After 20 days of in vitro culture, it was removed the PVC film (Polyvinylchloride) that covered the flasks and after two days, flasks had lids partial opening for two hours at the growth room conditions. The plants were transferred for the different substrates and placed in a greenhouse with intermittent nebulization during 16 days proceeded by 20 days of daily manual irrigation. The best substrate for acclimatization of <b>fox</b> <b>grape</b> cv. Bordô was Plantmax® HT, benefitting the formation of roots and aerial part of the plants.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of sucrose and glucose, amino acids and BAP (6 -Benzylaminopurine) levels on in vitro shoot regeneration of <b>fox</b> <b>grape</b> cv. Bordô and grapevine cv. Chardonnay. The nodal segments from micropropagated material were used as explants and half-strength MS medium as the basal medium. Sucrose and glucose at 15, 30 and 45 g. L- 1 were tested as a carbon source and the supplementation of adenine, asparagine, alanine, glycine, cysteine, glutamine, arginine was tested at 40 g. L- 1. The BAP levels (1 and 5 &# 956;M) in solid and double-phase media were evaluated and compared with a control medium without BAP. Bordô had best in vitro growth than Chardonnay. Sucrose was a better carbohydrate source than glucose for both the cultivars. Bordô and Chardonnay had different amino acid preferences for some parameters. In conclusion, for in vitro shoot regeneration from the nodal segments, culture on solid medium with 5 &# 956;M BAP, 15 g. L- 1 sucrose for Bordô and 45 g. L- 1 sucrose for Chardonnay showed better results. Similarly, the supplementation of 40 g. L- 1 arginine for Bordô and 40 g. L- 1 arginine or glycine for Chardonnay showed better results...|$|E

It is reported to possess antiviral, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, hypoglycaemic, anticancer and diuretic activity etc. The present study was carried out to establish the pharmacognostical studies, physico-chemical parameters along with preliminary phytochemical screening of petroleum ether, chloroform, methanolic and aqueous extracts of Cayratia trifolia (Linn.) Domin. The macroscopical and microscopical characters were studied. The transverse section (T. S.) of stem indicated the arrangement of various cells in cork, cortex, phelloderm and pith region. The histochemical color reaction of T. S with different chemical reagents and preliminary phytochemical screening of various extracts revealed the presence of carbohydrate, flavonoids sterols, phenolic & tannins compounds. The physico-chemical parameters such as total, acid insoluble, water insoluble and sulphated ash (6. 85, 0. 47, 5. 45 and 4. 45 %w/w respectively), loss on drying (8. 17 %w/w) extractive values and fluorescence analysis of extracts and powder treated with different chemical reagents were studied under ordinary light, short and long UV lights.

40|$|Cayratia trifolia Linn. Domin Syn. Vitis trifolia (Family: Vitaceae) is {{commonly}} known as <b>Fox</b> <b>grape</b> in English; Amlabel, Ramchana in Hindi and Amlavetash in Sanskrit. It is native to India, Asia and Australia. It is a perennial climber having trifoliated leaves with 2 - 3 cm long petioles and ovate to oblong-ovate leaflets. Flowers are small greenish white and brown in color. Fruits are fleshy, juicy, dark purple or black, nearly spherical, about 1 cm in diameter. It is found throughout the hills in India. This perennial climber is also found in the hotter part of India from Jammu and Rajasthan to Assam extending into the peninusular India upto 600 m height. Whole plant of Cayratia trifolia has been reported to contain yellow waxy oil, steroids/terpenoids, flavonoids, tannins upon preliminary phytochemical screening. Leaves contain stilbenes (piceid, reveratrol, viniferin, ampelopsin). Stem, leaves, roots are reported to possess hydrocyanic acid, delphinidin and several flavonoids such as cyanidin is reported in the leaves. This plant also contains kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, triterpenes and epifriedelanol. Infusion of seeds along with extract of tubers is traditionally given orally to diabetic patients to check sugar level of blood. Paste of tuberous is applied on the affected part in the treatment of snake bite. Whole plant is used as diuretic, in tumors, neuralgia and splenopathy. Its climbers wrapped around the neck of frantic bullock and poultice of leaves are used to yoke sores of bullock. The bark extract shows the antiviral, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, hypoglycemic, anticancer and diuretic activity.
