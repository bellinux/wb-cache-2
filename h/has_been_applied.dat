5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the most}} {{extensive}} collection of phonetic data so far in Mongolian studies <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to a partial account of stress placement in the closely related Chakhar dialect. The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable. But if their first syllable is long, then the data for different acoustic parameters seems to support conflicting conclusions: intensity data often {{seems to indicate that}} the first syllable is stressed, while F0 seems to indicate that it is the second syllable that is stressed.|$|E
5|$|Technological adaptations {{have also}} {{utilised}} living beetles as cyborgs. For example, a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency funded project implanted electrodes into adult male Rhinoceros beetles, {{allowing them to}} be remotely controlled via a radio receiver held on its back. Electrical signals delivered via the electrodes command the insect to take off, turn left or right, or hover in midflight. The research was intended to suggest proof-of-concept for surveillance purposes. Similar technology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to the flower beetle Mecynorhina torquata to stimulate different walking gaits and lengths of a live beetle controllable by a human operator.|$|E

5|$|Weh Island {{is a part}} of Aceh province. A 1993 census {{reported}} 24,700 inhabitants.

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, gold leaf <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>applied</b> lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks.
