She talked to the television show Hard Copy for $5,000, after which prosecutors declined to use her testimony at trial.|$|E
25|$|When the Pharaoh {{freed the}} Israelites, {{it is said}} that they left <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> that they could not wait for bread dough to rise (leaven). In commemoration, for the {{duration}} of Passover no leavened bread is eaten, for which reason Passover was called the feast of unleavened bread in the Torah or Old Testament. Thus matzo (flat unleavened bread) is eaten during Passover and it is a tradition of the holiday.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{had forced}} the British out of Pensacola {{and left the}} Spanish in control, angered by the British, who had fled <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> once Jackson's force had attacked, for their {{destruction}} of the fortifications {{and the removal of}} part of the Spanish garrison. Jackson suspected the squadron which had left Pensacola harbor would return to strike at Mobile, Alabama. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish and set out to Mobile, and upon reaching the town he received requests to hurry to the defense of New Orleans. American casualties were negligible; around seven dead and eleven wounded. The Spanish and British suffered at least 15 dead or wounded. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Nicolls states there were no deaths among the British, and is of the opinion that the Americans suffered 15 fatalities and numerous casualties.|$|E

500|$|L'Arianna was {{composed}} as a festive {{piece for the}} wedding of {{the heir to the}} duchy, Francesco Gonzaga, to Margherita of Savoy, in May 1608. Monteverdi received the commission following L'Orfeos successful premiere at the court in February 1607. The libretto for L'Arianna was by Rinuccini, whose literary skills had earlier impressed Duke Vincenzo I of Mantua after a performance of Euridice. The composition of L'Arianna became a fraught affair for Monteverdi, being only one of three works that the duke required from him for the wedding—he had also to compose a musical prologue for Giovanni Battista Guarini's play L'idropica, and write the music for a dramatic dance, Il ballo delle ingrate. His life had been disrupted by the fatal illness of his wife Claudia; she died on 10 September 1607, but Monteverdi was given no respite by the duke. L'Arianna was largely composed {{in the last two months}} of 1607, an exertion that Monteverdi's biographer Hans Redlich describes as [...] "superhuman". Monteverdi felt slighted by the lack of acknowledgement from the duke for his efforts; nearly 20 years later, in a letter to the Mantua court secretary Alessandro Striggio the Younger, he wrote that he had almost killed himself when writing L'Arianna <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry.</b>|$|E
500|$|Later on, Meg knocks Brian out, {{puts him}} {{in the trunk of}} his car and drives away. Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not know what she needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I know what she needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E

Susanna urges him to sing the song he wrote for the Countess (aria: Voi che sapete che cosa è amor – [...] "You ladies who know what love is, is it what I'm {{suffering}} from?"). After the song, the Countess, seeing Cherubino's military commission, notices that the Count was <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> that he forgot to seal it with his signet ring (which {{would be necessary to}} make it an official document).|$|E
2500|$|The narrator remains unsuspected, {{though he}} {{occasionally}} reassures himself by repeating under his breath, [...] "I am safe". One day, {{he notes that}} he will remain safe only {{if he is not}} foolish enough to openly confess. In saying so, however, he begins to question if he is capable of confessing. He fearfully runs through the streets, arousing suspicion. When finally stopped, he feels struck by some [...] "invisible fiend". He reveals his secret with [...] "distinct enunciation", though <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> as if afraid of being interrupted. He is quickly tried and convicted of murder and sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

'Stop, stop, my dear Sir; not {{the least}} {{occasion}} for being <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> violent <b>hurry</b> {{to get into a}} place that most other men are as eager to get out of,' said the good-natured little attorney.

2500|$|In August 1953, Mosaddegh's {{government}} was overthrown by a CIA-orchestrated coup d'état. On 15 August, Fatemi {{was to be}} arrested along with Mosaddegh and other close associates, but the first U.S.-led coup attempt failed. Fatemi was arrested by a Royalist group of officers and soldiers who were <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hurry</b> {{that he was not}} allowed to put shoes on, but he was eventually released and went directly to Mosaddegh's residence. Fearful of the apparent failure of the coup, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi immediately fled to Baghdad. In the morning after the first coup attempt, while Mosaddegh still remained a strong proponent of constitutional monarchy, Fatemi advised Mosaddegh to declare a republic in light of the failed coup attempt. In the evening of that same day, Fatemi, in a fiery editorial in his newspaper Bakhtar-e Emruz and a public speech, denounced the Shah as [...] "capricious and bloodthirsty", a [...] "servant of the British", and a [...] "thief of Baghdad". On 19 August, the offices of Fatemi's newspaper were attacked and burnt down by mobs incited by an Iranian CIA agent. Later that day the second coup attempt succeeded. With Mosaddegh arrested, Fatemi went underground, taking shelter in a Tudeh safe house.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a certain}} degree of pride and {{importance}} about being wanted by one's lawyers <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> monstrous <b>hurry,</b> that was by no means displeasing to Mrs. Bardell, especially as it might be reasonably supposed to enhance her consequence {{in the eyes of the}} first-floor lodger.
