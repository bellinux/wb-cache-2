40|$|Prime lamb has not {{received}} {{the same level of}} economic research as Australia's other major livestock markets and knowledge of the lamb market's operations remains relatively limited. This market has experienced increasing problems including highly variable saleyard prices, strong retail competition and calls for market reform. To date, there has been no quantitative mechanism for assessing the potential impacts of these issues on the state or national lamb markets. This paper reports the development of a quarterly econometric model of the New South Wales prime lamb market. The model considers prime lamb as a separate market entity and places emphasis on the demographic influences on supply response. The estimated model is validated under historical dynamic simulation which generates simultaneous equilibrium solutions for twelve endogenous variables. The model's ability to respond to exogenous shocks is established under impact analysis and some proposed uses for the model are <b>indicated.</b> <b>Demand</b> and Price Analysis,...|$|E
40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} and degradation of ecosystem services from agricultural lands remain important {{challenges in the}} United States despite decades of spending on natural resource management. To date, conservation investment has emphasized engineering practices or vegetative strategies centered on monocultural plantings of nonnative plants, largely excluding native species from cropland. In a catchment-scale experiment, we quantified the multiple effects of integrating strips of native prairie species amid corn and soybean crops, with prairie strips arranged to arrest run-off on slopes. Replacing 10 % of cropland with prairie strips increased biodiversity and ecosystem services with minimal impacts on crop production. Compared with catchments containing only crops, integrating prairie strips into cropland led to greater catchment-level insect taxa richness (2. 6 -fold), pollinator abundance (3. 5 -fold), native bird species richness (2. 1 -fold), and abundance of bird species of greatest conservation need (2. 1 -fold). Use of prairie strips also reduced total water runoff from catchments by 37 %, resulting in retention of 20 times more soil and 4. 3 times more phosphorus. Corn and soybean yields for catchments with prairie strips decreased only {{by the amount of}} the area taken out of crop production. Social survey results <b>indicated</b> <b>demand</b> among both farming and nonfarming populations for the environmental outcomes produced by prairie strips. If federal and state policies were aligned to promote prairie strips, the practice would be applicable to 3. 9 million ha of cropland in Iowa alone...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} ability of five {{structural}} demand systems to predict demands when estimated with cross sectional data spanning countries with widely varying per capita expenditure levels. Results <b>indicate</b> <b>demand</b> systems with less restrictive income responses are superior to demand systems with more restrictive income effects.

Given differences in the characteristics of AIDADS and QUAIDS, it is concluded the former is better suited to instances where income exhibits wide variation and the latter to cases when prices exhibit considerable variation.

50|$|Market monetarists {{maintain}} a nominal income target is the optimal monetary policy. Market monetarists are skeptical that interest rates or monetary aggregates are good indicators for monetary policy and hence look to markets to <b>indicate</b> <b>demand</b> for money. Echoing Milton Friedman, {{in the market}} monetarist view, low interest rates are indicators of past monetary tightness not current easing, and as such, are not an indicator of current monetary policy. Regarding monetary aggregates, they believe velocity is too volatile for a simple growth in base money to adequately accommodate market demand for money. In contrast, a nominal income target accommodates fluctuations in velocity by ensuring monetary policy is loose or tight enough in order to hit the target. This approach leaves interest rates {{to be decided by}} the market, while addressing inflation concerns as nominal GDP is also not allowed to grow faster than the level specified.|$|R

40|$|Price {{changes in}} any market are {{essentially}} due to shifts in supply relative to demand. In a global market {{there can be}} several simultaneous supply and demand shifts in different geographical locations, all affecting prices to different extents. This dissertation focuses on procedures for measuring such shifts and their relative effects on prices {{by looking at the}} global market for farmed salmon in the period between 2002 and 2011. Farmed salmon is a relatively homogeneous, globally traded product whose market size has burgeoned over the last 30 years. The first paper determines the magnitude of the shifts in annual demand across all salmon-importing regions. Results <b>indicate</b> that <b>demand</b> varies considerably between years and regions and does not appear to follow a smooth trend - as usually assumed in empirical demand analysis. The second paper uses the same approach to determine the size of annual regional supply and demand shifts from exporting and importing regions. The impacts of these shifts on prices are determined through an Equilibrium Displacement Model. This allows the decomposition of annual price movements into the effects of regional supply and demand shifts. We find large variation in supply and demand shifts and price impacts between regions and within regions over time. The third paper extends the procedure of the first. We disentangle the impacts from income growth and price changes in substitute products from the total demand shift. The remaining, residual shift in demand is due to other, unknown or omitted factors. Results <b>indicate</b> <b>demand</b> shifts due to unknown factors account for a large portion of total demand growth in all salmon-consuming regions and residual demand growth is not smooth in any region...|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{some writers}} utilise {{indicators}} that are essentially {{driven by the}} proportion of graduates in the occupation (e.g. Mason et al. 2009; Wilton 2012). This approach follows the tradition that measures unit group skill requirements by the mode or median educational level of the individuals doing them, in order to contribute to an indicator for overeducation (Verdugo and Verdugo 1989). Perhaps the most sophisticated approach of this kind was that of Elias and Purcell (2004 a, 2004 b), whose classification distinguished between different kinds of graduate jobs. Distinction was made between “traditional”, “modern”, and “new” graduate jobs, according to age cohorts and the differences between them. Use was also made of source materials on job titles to identify “niche” graduate jobs. A similar approach has been applied in Portugal (Figueiredo et al. 2011). This method was a step forward because it highlighted {{the breadth of the}} types of skilled work that graduates were doing, moving away from the traditional definition that was starting to look outdated. Nevertheless, the reliance on supply to <b>indicate</b> <b>demand</b> became increasingly questionable following the massification of higher education (Elias and Purcell 2013).|$|R
