25|$|When done in high productivity, {{press forging}} is more {{economical}} than <b>hammer</b> <b>forging.</b> The operation also creates closer tolerances. In <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> {{a lot of}} the work is absorbed by the machinery; when in press forging, the greater percentage of work is used in the work piece. Another advantage is that the operation can be used to create any size part because there is no limit {{to the size of the}} press forging machine. New press forging techniques have been able to create a higher degree of mechanical and orientation integrity. By the constraint of oxidation to the outer layers of the part, reduced levels of microcracking occur in the finished part.|$|E
25|$|The G36 {{employs a}} {{free-floating}} barrel (the barrel does not contact the handguard). The barrel is {{fastened to the}} receiver with a special nut, which can be removed with a wrench. The barrel is produced using a cold <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> process and features a chrome-lined bore with 6 right-hand grooves and a 1 in 178mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate. The barrel assembly consists of the gas block, a collar with a bayonet lug that {{is also used to}} launch rifle grenades and a slotted flash suppressor.|$|E
50|$|Part of the {{difference}} may be that most polygonal rifling is produced by <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> the barrel around a mandrel containing a reverse impression of the rifling. <b>Hammer</b> <b>forging</b> machines are tremendously expensive, far {{out of the reach}} of custom gunsmiths (unless they buy pre-rifled blanks), and so are generally only used for production barrels by large companies. The main advantage of a <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> process is that it can rifle, chamber, and contour a bored barrel blank in one step. First applied to rifling in Germany in 1939, <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> has remained popular in Europe, but was only later used by gunmakers in the United States. The <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> process produces large amounts of stress in the barrel that must be relieved by careful heat treatment, a process that is less necessary in a traditionally cut or button rifled barrel. Due to the potential for residual stress causing accuracy problems, precision shooters tend to avoid hammer forged barrels, and this limits them in the type of available rifling. From a practical standpoint, any accuracy issues resulting from the residual stresses of <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> are extremely unlikely to be an issue in a defense or service pistol, or a typical hunting rifle.|$|E

50|$|Generally bolt-action {{and break}} barrel hunting rifles in C.I.P. {{regulated}} countries are not {{cut to the}} minimum C.I.P. chamber dimensions so this problem is mostly theoretical. The arms manufacturer SIG Sauer brands Blaser and Mauser are however known for <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> tight (but still C.I.P. conform) chambers in their Blaser R93 straight pull bolt-action and Mauser M03 bolt-action switch barrel rifles and some rifle owners reported ΔL problems with those rifles. These problems can also occur with other European made rifle brands.|$|E
50|$|Magnesium alloys harden rapidly {{with any}} type of cold work, and {{therefore}} cannot be extensively cold formed without repeated annealing. Sharp bending, spinning, or drawing must be done at about 500 to 600 F, although gentle bending around large radii can be done cold. Slow forming gives better results than rapid shaping. Press forging is preferred to <b>hammer</b> <b>forging,</b> because the press allows greater time for metal flow. The plastic forging range is 500 to 800 F. Metal worked outside this range is easily broken.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Precision Castparts Corporation (PCC) {{acquired}} Carlton Forge Works in a $850 {{million deal}} that broadens the company’s forging operations. The transaction also includes another <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> operation in Oxnard, CA called Arcturus Manufacturing Corporation. The CEO of PCC Mark Donegan said that Carlton {{had been a}} target for acquisition for a long-time because {{the company has been}} doing several big aerospace projects, including the Boeing 787 and Airbus aircraft. Furthermore, the acquisition enables PCC to provide a full range of products to the current customers and increases the forging capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|A metalsmith {{or simply}} {{smith is a}} {{craftsman}} fashioning useful items (for example, tools, kitchenware, tableware, jewellery, and weapons) out of various metals. [...] Smithing {{is one of the}} oldest metalworking occupations. Shaping metal with a <b>hammer</b> (<b>forging)</b> is the archetypical component of smithing. Often the hammering is done while the metal is hot, having been heated in a forge. Smithing can also involve the other aspects of metalworking, such as refining metals from their ores (traditionally done by smelting), casting it into shapes (founding), and filing to shape and size.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{machining}} process on a barrel, whether it's boring, rifling, or turning the outside contour, will produce some {{stress in the}} steel of the barrel. This stress can cause the barrel to expand unevenly as it heats, causing shots to [...] "walk" [...] as the barrel heats and cools. To prevent this, careful post-machining heat treatment {{is often used to}} stress-relieve the barrels. The amount of good this does depends on the technique used to make the barrel. For example, the <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> method of manufacture leaves a significant amount of stress in the barrels, which could be addressed through stress-relieving heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The Zwillingsteich, {{consisting}} of two linked ponds, was created in 1909. An airship hangar was constructed in Amalienau in 1913. An old <b>hammer</b> <b>forge</b> was converted into a cafe and Gasthaus. The football club SV Prussia-Samland Königsberg played at Sportplatz Prussia-Samland on Steffeckstraße on the western outskirts of the quarter.|$|R
50|$|Due to the river's very steep descent, many {{mills and}} <b>hammer</b> <b>forges</b> {{have been built}} along its course. Its {{catchment}} area is used almost entirely for agricultural purposes {{with the result that}} the water of the Luhe is of good quality, enabling many species of fish, crustaceans and mussels to thrive there.|$|R
50|$|The SAR 21 {{is made of}} a rugged, {{high impact}} polymer, most of the {{manufacturing}} is done utilising CNC machines, with ultrasonic welding for the steel-reinforced receiver halves and the gun barrel being cold <b>hammer</b> <b>forged.</b> It uses a modified Stoner operating system, boasting higher reliability and lower recoil. The translucent magazine allows precise assessment of current ammo load.|$|R
50|$|The {{lightweight}} barrel is chrome lined {{and manufactured}} by the <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> {{process at the}} Beretta factory in Gardone Val Trompia, Lombardy. Barrel lengths for this rifle are 16 in (40.6 cm) for its standard barrel, and a 12 in (30.48 cm) barrel for special operators. The flash hider has 5 radial cuts and 4 smaller cuts to control muzzle climb in automatic firing. Barrels have a 1:7 twist to fire NATO standard ball and tracer rounds. The non-free-floated barrel is easily removed simply by pulling on slide levers and pulling it out. A bayonet lug, designed for the Extrema Ratio Fulcrum bayonet is positioned above the barrel rather than underneath it.|$|E
5000|$|The last common {{method used}} is <b>hammer</b> <b>forging.</b> In this process, a {{slightly}} oversized, bored barrel is placed around a mandrel {{that contains a}} negative image of {{the entire length of}} the rifled barrel. The barrel and mandrel are rotated and hammered by power hammers, which forms the inside of the barrel all at once. This is the fastest (and in the long run, cheapest) method of making a barrel, but the equipment is prohibitively expensive for all but the largest gun makers. Hammer-forged barrels are strictly mass-produced, so they are generally not capable of top accuracy as produced, but with some careful hand work, they can be made to shoot far better than most shooters are capable of.|$|E
5000|$|Song Yingxing {{wrote that}} ancient rulers of early China cast {{inscriptions}} of writing onto bronze tripods {{since this was}} a much more durable method of preserving the written record than using the perishable materials found in books and scrolls. He noted that musical and announcing bells of higher quality were made of different copper alloys, while those of lesser quality were made of iron. He also provided weighted formulas of different metal compositions for certain bells, for example, the casting a large bell in an audience hall or pavilion that required 47,000 catties of copper, 4,000 catties of tin, 50 oz. of gold, and 120 oz. of silver in its composition. In the smelting process, long pits for the liquid metal flow had to be dug, having a drymold construction of lime and mortar that was dried and covered in ox fat and beeswax. Then he noted the following process of pounded earth and charcoal powder that was screened and mixed into a mud paste that would be gradually spread {{on the surface of}} the wax several inches thick. When dried and heated so that the melted fat and wax could flow out entirely by means of apertures at the base, the bell or tripod could be cast in the vacated cavity between the core and the mold. With the individual casting process for bells and tripods, Song Yingxing also described the intricate individual casting processes for making cooking pots and pans, metal statues, metal barrels of cannons, metallic mirrors, and different metallic coins of copper or iron. He described the processes of <b>hammer</b> <b>forging</b> with the initial casting of an anvil, and noted that in the heating process of forging, coal accounted for 70% of the fuel, charcoal taking the rest at 30%. He also outlined the quench-hardening process of rapid cooling in clear water immediately after iron and steel products were forged. He outlined the different types of knives, axes, hoes, file tools, awls, saws, wood chisels, anchors, and metal needles that could be forged and produced. For the making of the finest swords, he said, they are coated with steel after [...] "a hundred smeltings," [...] but the core of the sword was still made of wrought iron; this was because a sword made entirely of steel would easily break when making hard strikes.|$|E
50|$|Current model AK's {{are made}} using modern {{manufacturing}} processes and have many component parts produced by investment casting. This method gives a detailed and accurate product with excellent metallurgical properties. They come in 7.62×39mm (AK-103), 5.45×39mm (AK-74M) and 5.56×45mm (AK-101), with cold <b>hammer</b> <b>forged</b> barrels. They are also {{made with the}} use of synthetic/plastic furniture, such as folding stocks, handguards and pistol-grips.|$|R
50|$|Thin Strip Nyby (see also Nyby bruk) {{produces}} {{cold rolled}} stainless steel, concentrating on special grades, {{part of the}} Special Coil business line. Nyby Ironworks in Torshälla was founded in 1829 by Adolf Zethelius, but ironworking on the site is first documented in the 15th century when the Bishop of nearby Strängnäs founded <b>hammer</b> <b>forges</b> by the waterfall near Nyby.|$|R
50|$|The name Hammerwood {{comes from}} the Wealden iron {{industry}} and relates to the numerous hammer-ponds found in the area. Streams in the locality can still run red with the colour of iron in the water. A hammer-pond is a water reservoir created specifically for providing power to water-powered <b>hammers,</b> <b>forges</b> or blast furnaces. There were many Medway watermills in the area.|$|R
