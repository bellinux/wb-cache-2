5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies and moths {{are able}} to see ultra-violet (UV) light, and wing colours and {{patterns}} are principally observed by Lepidoptera in this region. The patterns seen on their wing under UV light differ considerably from those seen <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> light.

5|$|Detestation of {{existing}} policies is easily transformed into forcible {{resistance of the}} authority which puts them in execution, {{and it would be}} folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E

5|$|On 4 November, Benfica hosted P.A.O.K. for {{the second}} leg of their European qualifier. They lost 2–1 <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> time, {{requiring}} extra time and a penalty shootout to decide the match. The Lisbon side converted all their shots, progressing into to the next round. Four days later, the club defeated S.C. Braga by one goal in a league match to open a three-point lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{shedding}} {{of scales}} is called ecdysis, or, <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> usage moulting or sloughing. In {{the case of}} snakes, the complete outer layer of skin is shed in one layer. Snake scales are not discrete but extensions of the epidermis hence they are not shed separately, but are ejected as a complete contiguous outer layer of skin during each moult, akin to a sock being turned inside out.|$|E

5|$|Xenon gas can {{be safely}} kept <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> sealed glass or metal {{containers}} at standard temperature and pressure. However, it readily dissolves in most plastics and rubber, and will gradually escape from a container sealed with such materials. Xenon is non-toxic, although it does dissolve in blood and belongs to {{a select group of}} substances that penetrate the blood–brain barrier, causing mild to full surgical anesthesia when inhaled in high concentrations with oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. <b>In</b> <b>normal</b> main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. Brown dwarfs can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass brown dwarfs will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of brown dwarfs still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. <b>In</b> <b>normal</b> circumstances this meant the club would have been relegated to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no demotion.|$|E

5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum.

As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

The Fatah list won five seats, the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) list won one, and a socialist party won the remaining seat.|$|E
5|$|EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, {{was first}} noticed in 1978 and officially {{described}} in 1980.

The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 <b>in</b> <b>normal</b> outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. Nova Trianguli Australis 2008 was a slow nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} digital {{systolic}} blood pressure (DBP) and flow (DBF) measure-ments for a quantitative diagnosis of Primary Raynaud’s Phenomenon (PRP) was evaluated {{by comparing the results}} obtained in 10 patients and 20 normals. Digital skin temperature (DST), DBP and brachial {{systolic blood pressure}} (BBP) and DBF were measured at room temperature, at maximal vasodilatation and during cold provocation. At room temperature DST discriminates between normals and patients with an accuracy of 77 %. On maximum vasodilatation no significant differences can be found in DBP and DBF between normals and patients. However, DBF was significantly different between male and females both <b>in</b> <b>normals</b> and <b>in</b> patients. During gradual cooling a decrease in DBF (a closing phenomenon) was observed both <b>in</b> <b>normals</b> and patients. <b>In</b> contrast DBP did not show a substantial pressure drop. Calculating digit to brachial systolic pressure indexes (DBI) a slight significant increase can be found during cold provocation both <b>in</b> <b>normals</b> and <b>in</b> patients.
