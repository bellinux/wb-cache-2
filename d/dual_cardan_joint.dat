50|$|The term <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> {{appears to}} be a latecomer to the English language.

30|$|The working {{principle}} is quite simple. When {{submitted to the}} sea waves the buoy floats and moving upwards {{under the influence of}} a wave crest and moves downwards under the effect of a wave trough.

50|$|Double <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> {{are similar}} to double Cardan shafts, except that {{the length of the}} {{intermediate}} shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four wheel drive vehicles. Double <b>Cardan</b> <b>joints</b> require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts for true constant velocity rotation. This centering device requires additional torque to accelerate the internals of the joint and does generate some additional vibration at higher speeds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} new {{architectural}} shapes may lead to schemes of bridges which cannot {{be traced back to}} known and tested typologies. In these cases, a new aesthetics requires new static views. The novelty of the De Gasperi Bridge, located in Milan, consists of two steel arches diverging towards the lateral sides of the deck. Such a choice involved particular structural problems as regards to both the vertical loads and the lateral ones due to wind and earthquake. Another delicate issue was posed by the array of joints connecting the tubular hangers and the arches, for which <b>cardan</b> <b>joints</b> have been employed in order to avoid any flexural stresses. The paper illustrates the criteria which led to the conception of a structural system which, while respecting the shape determined by architectural choices, activates an effective and natural force path.

50|$|The Klien-Lindner axle uses a double, or hollow, axle, one {{inside the}} other. It has a hollow axle (Hohlachse) on the outside, {{connected}} at its centre by a <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> to a fixed driving axle running through it. The <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> comprises two spherical {{elements that are}} interlinked - a solid one on the fixed axle and a hollow one on the outer hollow axle, each oriented at 90° to the other that transfer the driving forces from the rigid axle to the hollow one. The hollow spheroid acts {{as a sort of}} link motion. In this way the hollow axle can be turned by the fixed axle. In addition, the connecting link is shaped so that the axles can slide relative to one another, parallel to their axes, to a small extent. The degree to which the hollow axle can swivel is set by the outer diameter of the fixed axle and the internal diameter of the hollow one.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} their {{relatively}} simple design Klien-Lindner axles were not widely used. Derailments were common when they were used as leading axles. The axles often caused uneven, jerky running {{as a result of}} the resistance forces that arise from this type of <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint,</b> and they were expensive to maintain, something which was not offset by the reduced wear and tear on wheel flanges and rails.|$|R

50|$|A {{universal}} joint (universal coupling, U-joint, <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint,</b> Spicer or Hardy Spicer joint, or Hooke's joint) {{is a joint}} or coupling in a rigid rod whose axis are inclined to each other, and is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion. It consists {{of a pair of}} hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft. The {{universal joint}} is not a constant-velocity joint.|$|R
50|$|This joint was {{extensively}} {{tested for}} possible automotive application but {{proved to be}} unable {{to cope with the}} articulation needed for such a use. It was widely used in Italy in agriculture, as it was better suited than a <b>Cardan</b> <b>joint</b> to rotate at high speed and cheaper than a Rzeppa joint. By the early '90s, with the appearance on the market of Rzeppa joints produced in Asia, its production became uneconomic and it was discontinued.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{constant}} velocity joint (TCVJ), {{also known as a}} Thompson coupling, assembles two <b>cardan</b> <b>joints</b> within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft. A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical pantograph scissor mechanism to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced shear stresses and vibration inherent in double cardan shafts. While the geometric configuration does not maintain {{constant velocity}} for the control yoke that aligns the <b>cardan</b> <b>joints,</b> the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration. Continuous use of a standard Thompson coupling at a straight-through, zero-degree angle will cause excessive wear and damage to the joint; a minimum offset of 2 degrees between the input and output shafts is needed to reduce control yoke wear. Modifying the input and output yokes so that they are not precisely normal to their respective shafts can alter or eliminate the [...] "disallowed" [...] angles.|$|R
