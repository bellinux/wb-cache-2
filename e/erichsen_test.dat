40|$|A {{conventional}} stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) setup involves two {{cameras to}} reconstruct a 3 D surface view. The field of view, however, is in practice often {{confined to a}} small region of the specimen. Indeed, in particular when large deformation occurs and sharp edges are present, {{a large part of}} the testing specimen is obscured. Accordingly, the full-field testing method is not capable to provide a global measurement in such cases. In this contribution, we present a multiple camera stereo DIC setup for obtaining a full deformation field, where "multiple" refers to the use of three or more cameras. The setup is applied to measure the deformations of a flat specimen subject to an <b>Erichsen</b> <b>test.</b> The specimen is made of a deep-drawing steel DC 06, and cut into a rectangular geometry. As a result of the <b>Erichsen</b> <b>test,</b> the specimen is bulged due to biaxial strain conditions.

The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP steel sheets under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP steel sheets were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP steel sheets through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (<b>Erichsen</b> <b>test)</b> was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP steel sheets in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position.

This work aims at a robust design of forming die using numerical analysis and the Taguchi method. A three dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of a sheet metal forming process of SPCEN steel has been successfully developed using the material flow stress obtained from the modified <b>Erichsen</b> cup <b>test.</b> The model was validated with the actual forming experiment and the results agreed well. The influence of draw bead parameters on splitting and thinning distributions were examined using the Taguchi method. Four parameters, namely the friction coefficient, draw bead height, radius and shoulder radius were investigated. The Taguchi main effect analysis and ANOVA {{results show that the}} height and shoulder radius of the draw bead are the most important factor influencing the thinning distribution. Applying the Taguchi method and using the minimum thinning percentage as the design criteria, the optimum die design was identified as height, radius, shoulder radius and the friction coefficient of 4, 8, 8 mm and 0. 125 respectively. The verified finite element model using the optimum die design was conducted. The predicted Taguchi response was within 5. 9 % from finite element analysis prediction. The improvement in the reduction of thinning percentage was 22. 35 %...|$|R
