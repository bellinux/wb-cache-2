5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs.

A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late Kimmeridgian stage, about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E
