In addition, the analyzed data for inorganic nutrients over the last 10 years were obtained from the Korea Coast Guard (KCG) and the National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI). The chemical environment of the study area revealed increases in concentrations of inorganic nutrients, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS) in the bottom layer.

The increases appears to be due to the disposal of large amounts of organic waste.

To assess the fresh solid waste composition, a total of 60 fresh solid waste samples (three samples from each zone per day) from the four different zones of Trichy city were collected for 5  days from the truck discharge point to the dumping site. For composition of {{municipal solid}} waste in the old <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> (greater than 3  years), samples were collected using auger boring. For representative sample collection, the entire old <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> was divided into number of grids and boreholes were drilled with a 15 -cm manual auger up to 3  m. Solid waste samples were collected at every 1.5  m interval (top surface, 1.5  m and 3  m depth from top surface). Samples were properly labeled and brought to the laboratory for analysis. A total of 30 samples were collected from the dumping site from ten locations. The solid waste sampling locations in old <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> are also shown in Fig.  1. The collected fresh solid waste and waste from old <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> were segregated into different categories viz. paper, plastics, metals, glass, debris, vegetables, textiles, etc. The segregated samples were weighed individually.

The solid waste was characterized with regard to its constitutive moisture content by oven drying (at 105  °C during 24  h).

50|$|A handle, {{located on}} the first floor, {{controls}} a trap door {{on the bottom of}} the hopper, which allows the fruit to fall thru to the first floor chute. On their way down the chute, the apples are chopped into small pieces, about four bushels at a time, and are then placed in a special nylon blanket. This process continues until up to 12 blankets are stacked on top of one another.The layers of chopped apples are on a large turntable that rotates under the apple press. The press used at Yates Cider Mill is called a ‘screw press’ because large screws turn to make the press go down, putting 50 tons of pressure on the blankets of chopped apples for 15 minutes. As the press goes down on the blankets, the cider comes thru the weave in the cloth leaving the seeds, peelings and pulp inside the blanket. All by-products are then discarded down a chute in the floor and into a small railroad car under the mill. Periodically, the car is transferred to the <b>dump</b> <b>area.</b> The cider then flows from the press to chilled mixing tanks. From there, the cider is filtered to remove any and all small apple particles. Flash pasteurization is the last step before bottling. The cider is heated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for six seconds and then immediately cooled back down to 35 degrees and bottled. In one autumn weekend, the mill juices over half a million apples and can produce 300 gallons of cider an hour.|$|E

Funded by the international cooperation project Novel Indicator Technologies for Minesite Rehabilitation and sustainable development, a hierarchical object oriented land cover classification is produced in this study.

There are two steps in object oriented information extraction: image segmentation and classification. First, the image is segmented using chessboard segmentation and multi-resolution segmentation method. Second, NDVI is used to distinguish vegetation and non-vegetation; vegetation is classified as high density vegetation, middling density vegetation and low density vegetation using spectral information, object oriented image texture analysis; non-vegetation is classified as vacant land and main road using length/width.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{issues related to}} the removal of {{man-made}} space debris (SD) from the near-Earth space. SD is divided into observed (a typical size of over 100 mm) and unobserved ones. When encountering the observed SD, a spacecraft takes evasive maneuvers by changing the height. The International Space orbital station used to commit this maneuver more than once. Panels protect a spacecraft from unobserved debris. SD has emerged from the former used satellites, vehicle stages, and boosters still available on orbit, as well {{as a result of their}} destruction in case of explosion and collision. A large number of projects on removal of the near-Earth space from both the observed and the unobserved fragments of SD have been recently under development. There are offerings to remove SD via grapple fixtures, mesh-works, harpoons, etc. All anti-debris means are placed in the spacecraft (SC) and boosted into an orbit, and vehicle stages and boosters still remain on the orbit. Russia has set a Standard, which specifies the SD counter-measures. It gives recommendation for choosing the way of its disposal and dimensioning the fuel mass required for disposal in the <b>dumping</b> <b>area.</b> Selection of the <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> depends on the altitude of a SD fragment. For high orbits the <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> is selected according to GOST formulas. From the low orbits the fragments should be taken away to the Earth's atmosphere where they should be burned up. The calculations presented in the article show that with <b>dumping</b> <b>area</b> chosen properly the fuel mass required for maneuver is 10 - 15 %. However, given the high cost of the spacecraft and its launch into orbit it is advisable to use the shuttle type vehicles similar to "Buran" and "Space Shuttle" to retrieve the spacecraft from the orbit. Space Shuttles were used to do similar work. This will allow preventing from near-Earth’s space debris due to available final vehicle stages and boosters, and, what is most important, after modernization and renovation the shuttle-retrieved spacecraft can be re-launched into space by the Space Shuttle. The special devices decelerate unobserved space debris of small size, which is moved to the low orbits and then into the Earth's atmosphere. </p...|$|R
