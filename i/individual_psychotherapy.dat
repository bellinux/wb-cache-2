500|$|Psychodrama is {{an action}} method, {{often used as}} a psychotherapy, in which clients use {{spontaneous}} dramatization, role playing, and dramatic self-presentation to investigate and gain insight into their lives. [...] Developed by Jacob L. Moreno, psychodrama includes elements of theater, often conducted on a stage, or a space {{that serves as a}} stage area, where props can be used. [...] A psychodrama therapy group, under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist, reenacts real-life, past situations (or inner mental processes), acting them out in present time. Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior, reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives. [...] Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems. It may be used in a variety of clinical and community-based settings, and is most often utilized in a group setting, in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama. [...] Psychodrama is not, however, a form of group therapy, and is instead an <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> that is executed from within a group. There are [...] "side-benefits" [...] that the other group members may experience, as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another. A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method, called a psychodrama director.|$|E
2500|$|Opponents of Twelve Step {{programs}} {{argue that}} members become cult-like in their {{adherence to the}} program, which can have a destructive influence, isolating those in the programs. Moreover this kind of fanaticism may lead to perception that other treatment modalities are unnecessary.

This is evidence that participants do not avoid other useful therapeutic interventions outside of Twelve Step programs.|$|E

It describes the characteristics of a psychodynamic intervention that is complementary to the psychiatric approach while sharing a common goal –the suffering patient – and enhancing the knowledge and understanding of several domains like psychopathology, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and integration. Furthermore it describes how the use of Psychological Assessment led to the formulation of specific <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapies,</b> spanning 14 years of clinical practice. The paper concludes with some considerations regarding the integration of Psychodynamic Psychology in a multidisciplinary mental health team, addressing issues such as the boundaries between technical characteristics, the appropriateness of language to other disciplines and psychodynamic implications of the different features of this clinical setting. </span...|$|R

2500|$|From {{the mid-1980s}} to the present, {{the field has}} been marked by a {{diversity}} of approaches that partly reflect the original schools, but which also draw on other theories and methods from <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> and elsewhere – these approaches and sources include: brief therapy, structural therapy, constructivist approaches (e.g., Milan systems, post-Milan/collaborative/conversational, reflective), solution-focused therapy, narrative therapy, a range of cognitive and behavioral approaches, psychodynamic and object relations approaches, attachment and Emotionally Focused Therapy, intergenerational approaches, network therapy, and multisystemic therapy (MST). Multicultural, intercultural, and integrative approaches are being developed. Many practitioners claim to be [...] "eclectic," [...] using techniques from several areas, depending upon their own inclinations and/or the needs of the client(s), and there is a growing movement toward a single “generic” family therapy that seeks to incorporate the best of the accumulated knowledge in the field and which can be adapted to many different contexts; however, there are still a significant number of therapists who adhere more or less strictly to a particular, or limited number of, approach(es).|$|E
2500|$|Mentalization based treatment, {{developed}} by Peter Fonagy and Antony Bateman, {{rests on the}} assumption that people with BPD have a disturbance of attachment due to problems in the early childhood parent-child relationship. [...] Fonagy and Bateman hypothesize that inadequate parental mirroring and attunement in early childhood lead to a deficit in mentalization, [...] "the capacity to think about mental states as separate from, yet potentially causing actions"; in other words the capacity to intuitively understand the thoughts, intentions and motivations of others, and the connections between one's own thoughts, feelings and actions. Mentalization failure is thought to underlie BPD patients' problems with impulse control, mood instability and difficulties sustaining intimate relationships. Mentalization based treatment aims to develop patients' self-regulation capacity through a psychodynamically informed multi-modal treatment program that incorporates group psychotherapy and <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapy</b> in a therapeutic community, partial hospitalization or outpatient context. In a randomized controlled trial, a group of BPD patients received 18 months of intensive partial-hospitalization MBT followed by 18 months of group psychotherapy, and were followed up over five years. The treatment group showed significant benefits across a range of measures including number of suicide attempts, reduced time in hospital and reduced use of medication.|$|E

40|$|Findings from {{numerous}} studies suggest {{an association between}} low cholesterol levels and suicidal behavior in patients with different psychiatric diagnoses. The aims of this case-control study were to test whether cholesterol levels in male suicidal patients (N= 20) with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are lower than in male non-suicidal patients (N= 20) with BPD and male healthy control group (N= 20), and to evaluate the influence of structured <b>individual</b> psychoanalytic <b>psychotherapy</b> on suicidal behavior. The groups were matched for age and body mass index (BMI). Results showed that serum cholesterol levels {{did not differ significantly}} between suicidal and non-suicidal BPD patients and healthy controls. The level of psychopathology (measured by Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) was significantly higher in the group of suicidal patients, which indicates the importance of evaluating particular clinical symptoms in BPD, in order to prevent suicidal behavior. Non-suicidal male patients suffering from BPD received more frequently structured <b>individual</b> psychoanalytic <b>psychotherapy</b> prior to the hospitalization than suicidal group.

40|$|Fifty <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapies</b> of {{schizophrenic}} patients, {{supervised by}} {{a control group}} for fourteen years, are examined. 80 {{percent of the patients}} have shown important clinical progress and, in many cases, have been healed, especially those who continued therapy {{for more than two years}} and who had a deep and reciprocal emotional involvement with the therapist during and after treatment; there was a reduction by 70 percent of hospitalizations during this treatment and only one of these had a relapse. Other data confirm the efficacy of psychotherapy; however, to give a new instrument of scientific confirmation to this type of individual and subjective work, we tried to observe how the psychopathological and therapeutic mechanism of "symbiosis" induces personal dynamics in the therapist which are reflected in the control group. The psychopathological symbiotic disturbance of the patient, the therapeutic symbiotic relationship, and the way in which the group reacts to these permit the creation of a useful triangle, both for the therapist to understand his position toward the patient and to confirm or correct the subjective aspects of such a deep and emotional relationship...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is {{a serious}} {{psychiatric}} illness associated with significant medical and psychiatric morbidity, psychosocial impairment, increased risk of death, and chronicity. Given {{the severity of the}} disorder, the establishment of safe and effective treatments is necessary. Several treatments have been tried in AN, but few favorable results have emerged. This paper reviews randomized controlled trials in AN, and provides a synthesis of existing data regarding the efficacy, safety, and adherence associated with pharmacologic and psychological interventions. Randomized controlled trials for the treatment of AN published in peer-reviewed journals were identified by electronic and manual searches. Overall, pharmacotherapy has limited benefits in the treatment of AN, with some promising preliminary findings associated with olanzapine, an antipsychotic agent. No single psychological intervention has demonstrated clear superiority in treating adults with AN. In adolescents with AN, the evidence base is strongest for the use of family therapy over alternative <b>individual</b> <b>psychotherapies.</b> Results highlight challenges in both treating individuals with AN and in studying the effects of those treatments, and further emphasize the importance of continued efforts to develop novel interventions.
