New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich</b> for the rear fuselage, a cambered vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor.

25|$|The Avro Type 720 {{was a small}} {{tailless}} delta-winged aircraft. It {{was constructed}} of metal <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich.</b> The Avro 720's main power-plant was an 8,000lbf (36kN) Armstrong Siddeley Screamer rocket engine, using liquid oxygen as oxidant and kerosine fuel. This differed from the competing Saunders-Roe SR.53, which used a de Havilland Spectre rocket engine which was powered by Hydrogen Peroxide and kerosine. Both types were equipped with a single 1,750lbf (7.8kN) Armstrong-Siddeley Viper as the auxiliary turbojet engine; on the Avro design, airflow for the Viper engine was provided via a small chin inlet installed under the aircraft's nose. Operationally, the Avro 720 {{was to have been}} armed with a pair of de Havilland Firestreak Infrared homing air-to-air missiles, which could be carried upon underwing pylons.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The wing sweep varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich</b> panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E
25|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} were developed as flat sandwich sheets used for bulkheads and decking.

25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the deck of a warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich</b> structure and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc rotor head). In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} {{is usually}} manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A {{variety of different}} materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well damped, to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped {{with little or no}} audible ringing due to its resonance frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves trade-offs. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some carbon fiber, Kevlar, glass, hemp or bamboo fibers have been added; or it might use a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich</b> construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.|$|E

40|$|International audienceElastic wave {{propagation}} in honeycomb thin layers and sandwiches is investigated theoretically and numerically {{by using the}} Bloch wave transform, so the modeling of a unique primitive cell is sufficient to understand the {{wave propagation}} phenomena through the whole periodic structure. Both in-plane (with respect to {{the plane of the}} honeycomb layer) and out-of-plane waves are analyzed by developing finite element models formulated {{within the framework of the}} Mindlin–Reissner theory of plates. The dispersion relations and the phase and group velocities as function of frequency and of direction of propagation are calculated. The anisotropic behaviors and the dispersive characteristics of the studied periodic media with respect to the wave propagation are then analyzed. According to our numerical investigation, it is believed that the existence of bandgaps is probably not possible in the frequency domain considered in the present work. However, as an important and original result, the existence of the “backward-propagating” frequency bands, within which Bloch wave modes propagate backwards with a negative group velocity, is highlighted. As another important result, the comparison is made between the first Bloch wave modes and the membrane and bending/transverse shear wave modes of the classical equivalent homogenized orthotropic plate model of the honeycomb media. A good comparison is obtained for honeycomb thin layers while a more important difference is observed in the case of <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwiches,</b> for which the pertinence of finite element models is discussed. Finally, the important role played by the honeycomb core in the flexural dynamic behaviors of the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwiches</b> is confirmed...|$|R
50|$|All cone {{materials}} have advantages and disadvantages. The three chief properties designers {{look for in}} cones are light weight, stiffness, and lack of coloration (due to absence of ringing). Exotic materials like Kevlar and magnesium are light and stiff, but can have ringing problems, depending on their fabrication and design. Materials like paper (including coated paper cones) and various polymers will generally ring less than metal diaphragms, but can be heavier and not as stiff. There have been good and bad woofers made with every type of cone material.

2500|$|The basic IU {{structure}} {{is a short}} cylinder, 36inches high and [...] in diameter, fabricated of an aluminum alloy <b>honeycomb</b> <b>sandwich</b> material [...] thick. The cylinder is manufactured in three 120-degree segments, which are joined by splice plates into an integral structure.

The IU supported the components mounted on its inner wall {{and the weight of}} the Apollo spacecraft above (the Lunar Module, the Command Module, the Service Module, and the Launch Escape Tower). To facilitate handling the IU before it was assembled into the Saturn, the fore and aft protective rings, 6inches tall and painted blue, were bolted to the top and bottom channels.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{honeycomb}} fiber {{reinforced plastic}} (FRP) sandwich panels have been increasingly used in various industries. Low weight, low price and high mechanical strength are the benefits of these structures. However, their mechanical properties and behavior have not been fully explored. The objective {{of this study is}} to conduct a combined numerical-statistical investigation of <b>honeycomb</b> FRP <b>sandwich</b> beams subject to torsion load. In this paper, the effect of geometric parameters of sandwich panel on maximum shear strain in both face and core and angle of torsion in a <b>honeycomb</b> FRP <b>sandwich</b> structures in torsion is investigated. The effect of Parameters including core thickness, face skin thickness, cell shape, cell size, and cell thickness on mechanical behavior of the structure were numerically investigated. Main effects of factors were considered in this paper and regression equations were derived. Taguchi method was employed as experimental design and an optimum parameter combination for the maximum structure stiffness has been obtained. The results showed that cell size and face skin thickness have the most significant impacts on torsion angle, maximum shear strain in face and core.
