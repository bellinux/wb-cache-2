25|$|Nuclear {{medicine}} gained public {{recognition as}} a potential specialty on December 7, 1946 when an article {{was published in the}} Journal of the American Medical Association by Sam Seidlin. The article described a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). This is considered by many historians as the most important article ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a <b>generator</b> <b>system</b> to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed {{in a wide variety of}} nuclear medicine imaging studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of electrical conversion systems for wind turbines. First, the basics of wind energy conversion with wind turbines are reviewed and requirements {{with respect to the}} electric system are considered. Next, the three classical conversion systems are described with their strengths and weaknesses: constant speed, variable speed with doubly-fed induction generator and variable speed with direct-drive generator. The applied electric converters are shortly addressed. Finally, alternative <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> and trends are discussed. There is a clear trend towards variable speed <b>systems.</b> Doubly-fed induction <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> are increasingly equipped with grid fault ride through capabilities. For direct-drive turbines, the radial flux permanent-magnet synchronous generator is cheaper and more efficient than the electrically excited synchronous generator. It is expected that the voltage level of generators will increase up to values in the order of 5 kV.

40|$|Power {{converters}} play a {{vital role}} in the integration of wind power into the electrical grid. Variable-speed wind turbine <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> have a considerable interest of application for grid connection at constant frequency. In this paper, comprehensive simulation studies are carried out with three power converter topologies: matrix, two-level and multilevel. A fractional-order control strategy is studied for the variable-speed operation of wind turbine <b>generator</b> <b>systems.</b> The studies are in order to compare power converter topologies and control strategies. The studies reveal that the multilevel converter and the proposed fractional-order control strategy enable an improvement in the power quality, in comparison with the other power converters using a classical integer-order control strategy.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare five different <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> for wind turbines, namely the doubly-fed induction generator with three-stage gearbox (DFIG 3 G), the direct-drive synchronous generator with electrical excitation (DDSG), the direct-drive permanent-megnet generator (DDPMG), the permanent-magnet generator with single stage gearbox (PMG 1 G), and the doubly-fed induction generator with single-stage gearbox (DFIG 1 G). The comparison is based on cost and annual energy yield for a given wind climate. The DFIG 3 G is a cheap solution using standard components. The DFIG 1 G seems the most attractive in terms of energy yield divided by cost.

40|$|A {{review on}} the Mo sources {{available}} today {{and on the}} Tc generators developed up to date for increasing the effectiveness of Mo utilisation is performed in the format of {{detailed description of the}} features and technical performance of the technological groups of the Mo production and Tc recovery. The latest results of the endeavour in this field are also surveyed in regard of the technical solution for overcoming the shortage of Mo supply. The technological topics are grouped and discussed in a way to reflect the similarity in the technological process of each group. The following groups are included in this review which are high specific activity Mo: the current issues of production, the efforts of more effective utilisation, and the high specific activity Mo-based Tc generator and Tc concentration units; low specific activity Mo: the Mo production based on neutron capture and accelerators and the direct production of Tc and the methods of increasing the specific activity of Mo using Szilard-Chalmers reaction and high electric power isotopic separator; up-to-date technologies of Tc recovery from low specific activity Mo: the solvent extraction-based Tc generator, the sublimation methods for Mo/Tc separation, the electrochemical method for Tc recovery, and the column chromatographic methods for Tc recovery. Besides the traditional Tc-generator systems, the integrated Tc <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> (Tc <b>generator</b> column combined with postelution purification/concentration unit) are discussed with the format of process diagram and picture of real <b>generator</b> <b>systems.</b> These systems are the technetium selective sorbent column-based generators, the high Mo-loading capacity column-based integrated Tc <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> which include the saline-eluted <b>generator</b> <b>systems,</b> and the nonsaline aqueous and organic solvent eluent-eluted <b>generator</b> <b>systems</b> using high Mo-loading capacity molybdategel and recently developed sorbent columns.
