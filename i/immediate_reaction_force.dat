2500|$|In the 2010s, the Armed Forces of Portugal {{created the}} <b>Immediate</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Force</b> (FRI, Força de Reação Imediata), {{with the main}} mission of {{conducting}} operations of evacuation of Portuguese citizens from foreign geographies under crisis or tension, to participate in humanitarian operations {{in defense of the}} national interests and to assure the responsibilities of the Armed Forces in case of severe catastrophes in the National Territory. The FRI includes the ground, the special operations, the naval and the air components, with the Army assuring the first component and participating in the second one. The initial core of the ground component - with an operational readiness of 48 hours - includes a battalion headquarters, a maneuver company, an EOD team, a signal detachment, a CIMIC tactical team and a sanitary module. Most of this core is assured by one of the paratrooper battalions of the Rapid Reaction Brigade, which also maintains a second maneuver company ready to serve as reinforcement. The Army also provides a special operations detachment to the initial core of the special operations component. In April 2012, the FRI was activated {{for the first time in}} a real situation, when a military coup occurred in Guinea-Bissau allowed the FRI to be deployed and pre-positioned in Cape Verde, ready to intervene in the previous [...] mentioned country if needed.|$|E

50|$|Rotating forces {{through the}} NRF {{requires}} nations {{to meet the}} demanding standards needed for collective defence and expeditionary operations. As the standards are very high, participation in the NRF is preceded by a six-month NATO exercise program in order to integrate and standardize the various national contingents. Generally, nations carry out a pre-training period {{in preparation for the}} NATO exercises of between 6-18 months. Once activated Reconnaissance Teams deploy within 5 days. This is the first of a number of deployment phases that lead to the deployment of the entire HQ Joint Task <b>Force</b> and <b>Immediate</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Forces</b> within 30 days.|$|R

The next day, one person attending the funeral of the protester killed on 14 February was shot dead and 25 more were hurt when security officers opened fire on mourners. The same day, thousands of protesters marched to the Pearl Roundabout in Manama and occupied it, setting up protest tents and camping out overnight. Sunni activist Mohamed Albuflasa was secretly arrested by security forces after addressing the crowd, making him the first political prisoner of the uprising.|$|R
40|$|Arguing for the {{positive}} disruptive nature of interruption, this paper concentrates on my current performative and pedagogic usage of interruption within my teaching {{as the means}} to achieve three aims: 1) develop aspects of practice discussed in my doctoral thesis ‘Tactics of Interruption: Provoking Participation in Performance Art’ (Campbell 2016) related to the focused usage of interruptive processes in contemporary art practice (Arlander 2009 : 2) provide students with direct experience of how interruption may command <b>immediate</b> <b>reaction</b> and <b>force</b> collaborative means of working, i. e. collective survival tactics to deal with interruption; and 3) theorise, articulate and demonstrate how interruption relates to critical reflection (on {{the part of both}} student and teacher), extending the ideas of Maggi Savin-Baden (2007) to propose interruption as reflection. To achieve these aims, the paper discusses how I have implemented interruption into learning activity design and evidences how I have created activities that aim to help students understand collaborative learning in cross-disciplinary projects through an effective use of realia (interruption is part of real life). I discuss one first year teaching seminar at Loughborough University in March 2015 (and subsequent related iterations) combining performance, fine art and collaboration methodologies where students directly engaged in a range of activities not displaced from their own life experiences; there was heavy student engagement in digital technologies, and interruption. The main outcomes of the teaching session support and go beyond the aims by relating to: a) experiential learning related to the interplay between ‘collaboration’ and ‘interruption’; b) performative pedagogy and inclusion; c) the interplay between teaching, liveness and interruption; and d) performative pedagogy and the exchange of power relation...|$|R

40|$|Background: Individuals post hip {{fracture}} decrease {{force on}} the involved limb during sit to stand tasks, creating an asymmetry in vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> Joint specific differences that underlie asymmetry of the vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> are unknown. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare differences in vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and joint kinetics at the hip and knee in participants post-hip fracture, who were recently discharged from home care physical therapy to controls. Methods: Forty-four community-dwelling older adults, 29 who had a hip fracture and 15 elderly control participant’s completed the sit to stand task on an instrumented chair with 3 force plates. T-tests were used to compare clinical tests (Berg Balance Scale, activity balance confidence and gait speed, isokinetic knee strength) and vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables. Two-way analyses of variance compared vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and kinetics at the hip and knee between hip fracture and elderly control groups. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine correlations between clinical and vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables. Findings: Vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables were significantly lower on the involved side for the hip fracture group compared to the uninvolved side and controls. Lower involved side hip and knee moments and power contributed to lower involved side vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> Vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and strength had moderate to high correlations with clinical measures. Interpretation: Uninvolved side knee movements and powers were the largest contributors to asymmetrical vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> in participants post-hip fracture. The association of vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> variables and clinical measures of function suggesting reducing vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> asymmetry may contribute to higher levels of function post-hip fracture.

Anaphylactic reactions caused by contact with persulfates are rare. The mechanism of <b>immediate</b> <b>reactions</b> caused by persulfates is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To report 2 cases with systemic reactions after skin contact with persulfates, and to propose a test protocol for diagnosing <b>immediate</b> <b>reactions</b> caused by persulfates. METHODS: Prick tests with serial dilutions of ammonium and potassium persulfate were performed. Patch tests were also performed with the two agents. Persulfate-specific IgE was detected with two different IgE immunoblotting techniques. RESULTS: Prick tests were positive with ammonium and potassium persufate, but no specific IgE was detected in the serum. Patch tests showed early positive reactions to both persulfates in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Prick tests and patch tests can be valuable in the testing of patients with a suspicion of an immediate-type reaction caused by persulfates. The mechanism of these reactions remains unclear...|$|R
