5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E

5|$|At a Sunday {{church service}} in mid-December, in what Marshall {{believed}} {{was an attempt}} by other officials {{to force him to}} assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.|$|E
5|$|From 2002 to 2006 Stephen Listfield was the rabbi; for the {{previous}} eight years <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> rabbi of Congregation Beth Shalom in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey. Listfield led protests by the congregation against the posthumous induction into the Alabama Military Hall of Honor of prominent United States Navy officer, frequent political candidate, and outspoken antisemite John G. Crommelin. Listfield moved to Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Congregation in August 2006.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's {{earnings}} have exponentially increased {{following his}} death. According {{to a report}} by Forbes in 2016, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> top-earning dead celebrity each year since his death, with triple-digit millions per annum ($825 million in 2016). In December 2015, Thriller became the first album in the United States to surpass 30 million shipments, certifying it 30× platinum. One year later, the album was certified again at 33× platinum, surpassing 33 million shipments after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album certifications.|$|E

5|$|That same year, he {{illustrated}} the pro-occupation book Zóó zag Brussel de Dietsche Militanten under the pen name Kaproen. In the 1970s Willy denied rumors, based on drawing style, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> real artist behind Kaproen, but in 2010 these allegations were confirmed after an investigation demanded {{by his own}} family. Unlike his partners, Vandersteen was later not persecuted {{for his part in}} publishing the antisemitic drawings, which were considered collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> most important Democrat in Washington {{ever since his}} brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first {{did not have a}} full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans {{lost their}} {{offensive}} coordinator, Lane Kiffin, on January 23, 2007, {{when he was}} hired {{to be the new}} head coach of the Oakland Raiders; the 31-year-old Kiffin became the youngest head coach in Raiders history, and the youngest head coach since the formation of the modern NFL. The following week, Pete Carroll named Steve Sarkisian as his team's new offensive coordinator. Sarkisian had interviewed with the Raiders for their vacant head coach position but withdrew from the process to stay at USC, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} for American breeders was the {{presence}} of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once, and he was not the only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|After Gemini 7, Kraft {{stepped back}} from his work at Mission Control, {{allowing}} other flight directors {{to take charge of}} the remaining missions so that he could devote more time to planning for the Apollo program. He served on two review boards at North American Aviation, the contractor responsible for the Apollo capsule. Yet Kraft still felt pangs at not being {{at the center of the}} action, particularly after the emergency re-entry of Gemini 8. Both astronauts and mission controllers had made the right decisions, but, as Kraft confessed to Robert Gilruth, he found himself wishing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> one on the spot.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff {{qualified}} for 1927 FA Charity Shield, where they defeated amateur team Corinthian by two goals to {{one with the}} winning goal once again by Ferguson. Their fortunes subsequently declined occurred quickly afterwards. Within four years, they had been relegated to the Football League Third Division South. Keenor remained captain during this period, and left the club after 19 years to transfer to Crewe Alexandra F.C. during the 1930–31 football season. In 1934, Cardiff slipped further and were required to petition the Football Association {{to allow them to}} remain in the league after they finished last and were eligible to be removed from the competition. Cardiff's Ernie Curtis, who died in November 1992 at the age of 85, was the last surviving player from the final. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> youngest player in the match, aged 19 years and 317 days. Cardiff reached the FA Cup Final once more in 2008 FA Cup Final; where they lost by one goal to nil against Portsmouth.|$|E

5|$|Corzine {{was born}} in central Illinois, the son of Nancy June (née Hedrick) and Roy Allen Corzine, Jr. His {{grandfather}} Roy A. Corzine served in the Illinois General Assembly. He is of Italian descent from paternal side. He {{grew up on a}} small family farm in Willey Station, Illinois, and near Taylorville. After completing high school at Taylorville High School, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> football quarterback and basketball captain, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and graduated in 1969, earning Phi Beta Kappa honors. While in college, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and served from 1969 until 1975, attaining the rank of sergeant. In 1970 he enrolled in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, from which he received a Master of Business Administration degree in 1973.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many serials the title role was played by a {{different}} actor, this time by André Morell; the part had initially been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.|$|E
5|$|He {{administered}} for {{the king}} {{a large proportion of}} the vacant ecclesiastical offices. He personally managed sixteen abbeys or bishoprics. Eventually he obtained the wealthy see of Durham for himself in May 1099, being consecrated on 5 June 1099. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> custodian of the see since the death of the previous bishop in early 1096. At his consecration, he managed to avoid giving a profession of obedience to Thomas the Archbishop of York, just as his predecessor had done. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, accused Ranulf of paying 1,000 pounds for the bishopric. He was given ecclesiastical jurisdiction over Carlisle and Cumbria, because his predecessors had done so as bishops of Lindisfarne, but he only exercised this for a short time, as after the accession of Henry I jurisdiction over these areas was transferred to the diocese of York.|$|E

5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated {{motionless}} in a standing posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he was adamant and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Fletcher {{left the}} Flames {{to become the}} general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> team's general manager since its {{inception}} in 1972. He was succeeded in Calgary by Doug Risebrough, and the two quickly completed a ten player mega-trade that saw disgruntled forward Doug Gilmour dealt to Toronto with four other players for former 50 goal scorer Gary Leeman and four others. The trade transformed both clubs. The formerly inept Leafs turned into a contender almost immediately, while Leeman scored only eleven goals in a Flames uniform. Despite the blossoming of Theoren Fleury into an NHL star, the Flames missed the playoffs entirely in 1992, only a year after finishing with their third 100-point season in franchise history. It {{was the first time the}} Flames had missed the playoffs since 1975, when they were still in Atlanta. It was also only the third time out of the playoffs in the franchise's 20-year history.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers in the salt pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} of the Commission for Taking Archival Professional Exam in the FBiH since 2007, and from 2009 onwards <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Chairman of the Board of the Association of Archival and Administrative Workers of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of two professional association of archivists.|$|R
