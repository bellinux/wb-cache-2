40|$|Abstract. As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>heads</b> are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing a biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity. So a new design for biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> with mechanical spindle, gear transmission and swinging fork structure is proposed. An integral supporting axis is applied to increase the rigidity of A-axis; through the closed numerical loop control based on precise encoder and the decoupling technology of feed motion of A/C axis, the contradiction between large reduction ratio and high precision transmission is solved, and then the requirement of high positioning accuracy (10 ") is met. Theoretical calculation and simulated analysis shown, the new design not only can guarantee transmission accuracy and dynamic characteristics of biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head,</b> but also can improve its structural stiffness and meet the high demands of large torque, high precision and high rigidity...|$|R

The {{spindle shaft}} of heavy load {{deflection}} angle <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> {{is an important}} functional component of 5 -axis CNC machine tool, which has characteristics of high torque and high power, used for large and complex free-form surface processing. The spindle shaft is modeled as Timoshenko’s beam by including the centrifugal force and gyroscopic effects. The effects on inherent characteristic of the spindle shaft of heavy load deflection angle <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> are analyzed owing to axial force and spindle shaft speed.

During the practical work ， there is an thermal deformation in a CNC machine because of many kinds of heat sources. This deformation affects the relative displacement between the work piece and the cutter, caused the manufacturing errors, and influences the machining accuracy of the part. So is of great importance to research the thermal characteristics.

For the manufacture of worms are not required special tools, all that is required in the roughing process on the NC Lathes are standard tools such as <b>milling</b> <b>heads</b> with removable plates or mono-block frontal-cylindrical milling tools.

50|$|One is an {{adaptation}} of the method used with the Drift Sight. Prior to approaching the target, the bomb aimer would have the pilot turn onto the expected wind line, and dials in zero wind speed and due north wind direction, which points the drift bar straight forward. With the bar in this position, the bomb aimer uses the drift wires to tune out any sideways drift and thereby find the exact wind direction. The bearing plate is rotated to the compass heading and locked, thereby recording the wind direction for future reference. The pilot then turned 90 degrees to {{one side or the}} other, placing the wind directly {{off the side of the}} aircraft. The bomb aimer then rotated the <b>milled</b> <b>head</b> to the same 90 degrees. At this point the wind speed knob is adjusted, pushing the drift bar sideways until objects on the ground could be seen moving directly along the drift wires.
