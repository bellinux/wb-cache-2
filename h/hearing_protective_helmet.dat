40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} physiological and cognitive decrements following heat stress. Of particular concern in cricket are the possible negative effects of sustained <b>protective</b> <b>helmet</b> use, as this leads {{to an increase in}} heat-related stress. Correct and rapid decision making, and focused attention are essential for efficient performance whilst batting, and it is possible that helmet usage could impair such processes. In a repeated-measures, randomized crossover study, physiological, self-report, and cognitive measures were taken from 16 teenage cricketers before and after moderately intense (batting) exercise. Participants underwent the assessments twice, once while wearing a standard <b>protective</b> <b>helmet,</b> and again, when not wearing a helmet (counterbalanced). While helmet use did not lead to significant physiological changes, wearing a helmet led to some cognitive impairments in attention, vigilance and reaction times. These preliminary findings could have significance for cognitively demanding sports (and perhaps military and industrial settings) in which participants perform cognitively demanding operations under conditions of physical exercise whilst wearing <b>protective</b> <b>helmets.</b> Additional factors of hydration, exercise duration, and helmet design are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Thompsons found {{evidence}} that if you bang your head the consequences will be less severe if you are wearing a <b>protective</b> <b>helmet.</b> 1 Based on this review they recommend that cyclists should be “encouraged ” to wear helmets. The form of encouragement that they favour is compulsion. We accept the principal finding of their review—that <b>protective</b> <b>helmets</b> protect {{in the event of}} an accident—but not the policy conclu-sions that they derive from it. The issue that divides us is risk compensation—does the behaviour of cyclists change as a consequence of wearing a helmet in ways that oVset the pro-tective benefit of helmets in accidents?

40|$|Background: <b>Protective</b> <b>helmets</b> {{in sport}} are {{important}} for {{reducing the risk of}} head and facial injury. In cricket and other sports with projectiles, national test standards control the minimum helmet performance.

50|$|Cowboy hats {{remain the}} primary {{headwear}} used. While the professional organizations permit <b>protective</b> <b>helmets</b> and masks, some riders {{continue to believe}} that this equipment can detrimentally affect balance, and many professionals still avoid wearing them. However, the trend is changing, as more champion riders begin to wear helmets for added safety.|$|R
