25|$|Rather than {{ending with}} the {{conviction}} and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, {{the investigation into the}} break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>know</b> he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so {{in a way that was}} least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make them talk, Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.|$|E
