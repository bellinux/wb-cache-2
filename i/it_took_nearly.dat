5|$|Greatest five-by-fives (most of each stat): Hakeem Olajuwon, on March 10, 1987, {{became the}} first in NBA history to record a five-by-six (at least 6 each of all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals). <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were not quite as impressive as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
5|$|Liguria {{was built}} by the Ansaldo {{shipyard}} in Genoa; her keel was laid on 1 July 1889. Shortages of funding slowed the completion Liguria and her sister ships. Tight budgets forced the Navy to reduce the pace of construction so that the funds {{could be used to}} keep the active fleet in service. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> four years to complete the hull, which was launched on 8 June 1893. Fitting-out work proceeded much more quickly, and the new cruiser was ready for service {{a year and a half}} later. She was commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1894. That year, Liguria was assigned to the Third Division of the Italian fleet, along with , an ancient center battery ironclad, which had been launched in 1862.|$|E

50|$|A {{single thread}} {{filament}} is too thin {{to use on}} its own, so Thai women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of raw silk. The process is a tedious one as <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>nearly</b> 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of Thai silk.|$|R
5|$|The alpine runs (Le piste alpine) {{were built}} {{on the slopes of}} Monte Tofana and Monte Faloria in the nearby Dolomite alps. The men's and women's {{downhill}} and slalom races were held on Tofana. Faloria was the site of the two giant slalom events. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> two years to complete construction of the runs. In previous years, lack of snow was never an issue, but in the winter of 1956 there was insufficient snowfall for skiers to safely navigate the runs. As a consequence, snow had to be transported {{from other parts of the}} mountains by the Italian army.|$|E
5|$|The {{stand down}} order had meant RAF Bomber Command's {{contribution}} to the proceedings came relatively late in the day. It dispatched a total of 73 bombers at between 13:55 and 14:50 (GMT). None of the attackers succeeded in hitting their targets. At 14:35 nine Bristol Beauforts from No. 42 Squadron led by W.H Cliff took off. Arriving over Manston at 14:50 they found other aircraft from No. 407 RCAF orbiting. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> 30 minutes to form a proper formation. With several other squadrons they attacked the Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen at heights of between 60 and 100 feet but their torpedoes missed. No losses were suffered by No. 42 Squadron. The Hudsons struck at between 400 and 900 feet. Two RCAF bombers were lost without success. No. 217 Squadron nearly achieved a hit on Gneisenau, but the ship turned away, just missing the salvo. Later, another wave of 134—137 bombers intercepted the ships between 16:00 and 17:05. Only 20 crews managed to make attacks owing to poor training (Bomber Command crews were not trained to hit naval targets), a low cloud base (700 metres) and poor visibility (sea level visibility was between 1,000 and 2,000 yards). Nine bombers were lost. Another formation of 35 Vickers Wellington aircraft attempted a strike between 17:50 and 18:15, losing two of their number. The most notable raid in this action was by six Beauforts from No. 86, three from No. 217 and three from No. 22 Squadron. Wing Commander C. Flood, No. 86 Squadron led the attack in the only ASV-loaded aircraft. Locating the German ships in the darkness they attacked, but heavy AAA fire scattered the bombers and no successes were achieved. Of the 242 bombers that {{took part in the}} missions, it is likely only 39 conducted attacks, though it is possible that a further 16 carried out attacks, suggesting a total of 54 aircraft actually released their bombs against the ships. Of this total 15 of those were shot down. RAF Fighter Command also threw in fighter-bombers to try and inflict damage, operating Hawker Hurricanes over the Dover area.|$|E

25|$|Until the 20th century, Dithmarschen {{had been}} a rather secluded spot on the map with little influx from the outside world. This changed {{drastically}} during World War II, when it became home to evacuees from Hamburg and other bombed cities in Schleswig-Holstein as well as war refugees from the east. The constant stream of newcomers nearly doubled the population, {{with many of the}} refugees living in barracks for years. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> a decade before life in Büsum and other towns returned to normal.|$|E

In the local 2011 county elections the party won 1.7% of the votes. In the 2009 parliamentary election, the result was 1.3%, giving the party no seats in the parliament.

Fear of becoming the Buccaneers’ first victim provided motivation to opposing teams. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> two seasons for the Buccaneers to achieve their first franchise victory, a 33–14 win over the New Orleans Saints in the second-to-last game of the year. A crowd of 8,000 celebrating fans gathered at team headquarters to greet the team on their return from New Orleans. The very next week, the Bucs earned their first home victory, over the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
25|$|Miyamoto {{produced}} two major Mario titles for the system. The first, Super Mario World, was a launch title and was bundled with Super Nintendo Entertainment System consoles. It featured an overworld as in Super Mario Bros. but {{introduced a new}} character, Yoshi, who {{would go on to}} appear in various other Nintendo games. The second Mario game for the system, Super Mario RPG, went in a somewhat different direction. Miyamoto led a team consisting of a partnership between Nintendo and Square Co.; <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> a year to develop the graphics.

25|$|Each nest {{has only}} one entrance, and the opening is only about 1.56mm in {{diameter}}. The diameter of the galleries is only approximately 2.31mm.

During simulated inundation, in which the nest entrances were blocked, the oxygen concentration dropped to less than 0.5% after one hour. After opening the nest entrance, the oxygen concentration increased again, but for a 100mm long nest <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> 20 minutes before the concentration was back to the normal depressed level.|$|E
25|$|Hall {{started work}} on his history of Nantwich in the mid-1870s; <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>nearly</b> a decade to complete. The {{research}} included many visits to churches to document their architecture and to transcribe church registers and memorial inscriptions; he also consulted many library collections, travelling as far afield as Oxford and London. The text was finished on 10 December 1883, the 300th anniversary of the Great Fire of 1583 that destroyed much of the town. The manuscript ran to 1154 foolscap sheets; indexing it took a further month. Walter Hall states that shortly after the book's publication, the Society of Antiquaries offered to confer its fellowship on Hall, but his father declined the honour.|$|E
