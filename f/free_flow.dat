5|$|Damage to {{the brain}} (such as from a massive stroke, {{non-penetrating}} head injury, intoxication or poisoning) {{may result in a}} depressed level of consciousness. When this becomes severe to the point of stupor or coma (defined as a score on the Glasgow Coma Scale of less than 8), dynamic collapse of the extrinsic muscles of the airway can obstruct the airway, impeding the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of air into the lungs. Furthermore, protective airway reflexes such as coughing and swallowing may be diminished or absent. Tracheal intubation is often required to restore patency (the relative absence of blockage) of the airway and protect the tracheobronchial tree from pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.|$|E

Firms with low q (less than one) and high cash flows are identified as firms with <b>free</b> cash <b>flows.</b> We find that firms with <b>free</b> cash <b>flows</b> earn significantly higher abnormal returns than all other firms. Cross-sectional regression analyses provide robust empirical support for the <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> hypothesis even after controlling for other variables that can affect the announcement-period abnormal returns. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{the effect}} of firm growth opportunities and earnings quality on the market valuation of <b>free</b> cash <b>flow,</b> defined as the difference between operating cash flows and capital expenditures. Equity valuation theory prescribes that <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> should not be associated with stock returns {{because it does not}} add value. However, <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> could become a value-relevant construct in certain contexts. This study considers growth opportunities and transitory earnings as two such contexts and examines the valuation of <b>free</b> cash <b>flow.</b> An accounting-based valuation framework is developed where stock returns are regressed on <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> interacted with growth and earnings quality proxies, after controlling for book values, dividends, and current earnings realisations. Findings reveal that firms with a positive <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> and attractive growth opportunities command a valuation premium. Furthermore, <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> is found to be positively associated with stock returns when earnings are transitory. The results are robust to alternative definitions of both <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> and growth opportunities...|$|R

If there is no <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> valve, as on a full face mask, the purge button should clear the demand valve and oro-nasal mask, and the mask can be rinsed by lifting the bottom edge away from the face to let in some water, before purging again.|$|E

The analysis in this paper is motivated by the so-called <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> anomaly previously documented e. g. in Hackel, Livnat and Rai (2000). Using annual financial statement information, we identify large-capitalization companies with positive <b>free</b> cash <b>flows,</b> low <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> multiples, and low financial leverage. Since a portfolio of these companies is found to consistently outperform the market index, our {{results suggest that the}} <b>free</b> cash <b>flow</b> anomaly also exists in the Finnish stock market...|$|R

25|$|Unger has {{presented}} {{a number of}} general institutional proposals that aim to restructure the world trade regime and introduce new alternatives in the market economy. For international and global trade, Unger calls for the need to experiment with different property rights regimes, where multiple forms will coexist in the same market system and not be tied to individual property rights and contractual labor. Generally, rather than maximizing the free trade as the goal, Unger sees the need to build and open the world economy in way that reconciles global openness with national and regional diversification, deviation, heresy, and experiment, where {{the idea is to}} support alternatives by making the world safer for them. For national economies, he rejects the need to require the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of capital, for there are times when {{it may be necessary to}} restrict capital flows. Rather, he puts the emphasis on the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> of people. Labor should be allowed to move freely throughout the world.|$|E
