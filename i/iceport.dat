5000|$|Norsel <b>Iceport</b> {{was used}} by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE) to moor and unload the {{expedition}} ship [...] in 1949. The NBSAE established Maudheim Station about 1 mile south of the <b>iceport.</b>|$|E
50|$|U.S. Navy {{engineers}} {{constructed the}} first floating ice pier at McMurdo Station, Antarctica’s southernmost sea port, in 1973. Since that time, {{the use of}} <b>iceports</b> has declined but not been completely eliminated.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Iceports</b> {{have played}} a {{critical}} role in Antarctic exploration. For example, the Bay of Whales (discovered and named by Ernest Shackleton in the Nimrod in 1908) served as the base for several important Antarctic expeditions, including: ...|$|R
25|$|U.S. ships {{discharged}} cargo at temporary <b>iceports</b> in McMurdo Sound {{prior to}} the military’s invention of the ice pier. Ships during that time moored alongside seasonal pack ice where military longshoremen offloaded cargo onto large snow sleds. Equipment operators then used snow cats and tractors to tow the freight over ice to McMurdo, a difficult and potentially dangerous operation. Tankers arriving with oil, diesel fuel, and gasoline were forced to dock {{as far away as}} ten miles (16km) from the harbour and pump their fuel ashore.|$|R
50|$|Atka <b>Iceport,</b> {{also known}} as Atka Bay, is an <b>iceport</b> about 10 mi long and wide, marking a more-or-less {{permanent}} indentation {{in the front of}} the Ekstrom Ice Shelf on the coast of Queen Maud Land.|$|E
50|$|An <b>iceport</b> is a more-or-less {{permanent}} indentation in {{the front}} of an ice shelf, that can serve as a natural ice harbor. Though useful, they are not always reliable, as calving of surrounding ice shelves can render an <b>iceport</b> temporarily unstable and unusable.|$|E
50|$|To {{the south}} of this area lies the Princess Astrid Coast and Princess Ragnhild Coast of Queen Maud Land. In the western part is the Lazarev Ice Shelf, and further east are Erskine <b>Iceport</b> and Godel <b>Iceport,</b> and the former Belgian Roi-Baudouin Station.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the ice pier, U.S. ships participating in Operation Deep Freeze discharged cargo at temporary <b>iceports</b> in McMurdo Sound. At that time, freighters and tankers arriving with supplies and fuel were forced to dock as far away as 16 km from the harbor. Ships would moor alongside seasonal pack ice, where longshoremen would offload cargo onto large sleds. Snowcats and tractors would then be used to tow the freight over ice to McMurdo Station, a difficult and potentially dangerous operation.|$|R

5000|$|The {{greatest}} {{part of this}} southern continent (supposing {{there is}} one), must lie within the polar circle, where the sea is so pestered with ice, that the land is thereby inaccessible. Captain James Cook. A Voyage Towards the South Pole and Round the World, etc. The force of moving ice is considerable; it can crush ships that {{are caught in the}} ice pack, and severely limits the areas where ships can reach the land, even in summer. Icebreakers, <b>iceports</b> and ice piers are used to land supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Erskine <b>Iceport</b> (...) , {{also known}} as Erskine Bay or General Erskine Bay, is an <b>iceport</b> about 3 nmi km wide and 6 nmi km long, which marks a more-or-less {{permanent}} indentation extending southeast into the seaward front of the extensive ice shelf fringing Queen Maud Land.|$|E

25|$|Air Development Squadron Six (VX-6) was {{formally}} established on 17 January 1955 at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. The squadron's {{mission was to}} conduct aviation operations in support of United States Department of Defense responsibilities {{in connection with the}} United States Antarctic Program. On 1 February, Task Force 43 was activated to plan Antarctic operations scheduled to begin in the fall under the code name Operation Deep Freeze, with Captain George J. Dufek as commanding officer. Dufek would remain as commanding officer through Operation Deep Freeze IV, which concluded in 1959. The mission of Task Force 43 was to provide all the logistical support necessary for the successful U.S. participation in the upcoming International Geophysical Year (19578). More specifically, this meant that Task Force 43 was responsible for the construction of airstrips and <b>iceports</b> and the establishment of bases on Antarctica that would enable scientists to conduct geophysical studies upon that continent. On 14 November, the flagship of the recently promoted RADM Dufek, Commander Task Force 43, steamed from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia to rendezvous in New Zealand with other ships of the task force for the onward voyage to Antarctica.|$|R
5000|$|This feature {{was named}} by the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (NBSAE), 1949-52, which used it to moor and unload the {{expedition}} ship [...] The low ice front permitted easy access onto Quar Ice Shelf, where the NBSAE established Maudheim Station about 1 nautical mile south of the <b>iceport.</b>|$|E
50|$|Godel <b>Iceport</b> {{was named}} by United States Navy Operation Deep Freeze I {{personnel}} on the USS Glacier (AGB-4), {{who made a}} running survey of this coast in March 1956, for William H. Godel, {{deputy director of the}} Office of Special Operations, Department of the Navy, who assisted in formulating expedition plans and policy.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>iceport</b> {{was first}} {{suggested}} by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) in 1956 to denote [...] "ice shelf embayments, subject to configuration changes, which may offer anchorage or possible access to the upper surface of an ice shelf via ice ramps along one or more sides of the feature".|$|E
50|$|Atka <b>Iceport</b> was mapped {{in detail}} by Norwegian cartographers from surveys and air {{photographs}} {{taken by the}} Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition (1949-1952), led by John Schjelderup Giæver. It was named by personnel of the USS Atka, under U.S. Navy Commander Glen Jacobsen, which moored here in February 1955 while investigating possible base sites for International Geophysical Year operations.|$|E
50|$|For the 1999-2000 season, {{she was the}} goaltending {{coach of}} the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey program. In 2000, she entered into the {{business}} world, serving as marketing director for Mission Hockey in Irvine, California, for three years, developing and promoting girls' hockey equipment. She later worked in marketing at the Powerade <b>Iceport</b> in Milwaukee and with the Central Collegiate Hockey Association.|$|E
50|$|In {{connection}} with the Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition, the <b>iceport</b> Norselbukta on the Quar Ice Shelf in Queen Maud Land was named after Norsel. Norsel Point, near Arthur Harbour in the British Antarctic Territory was named after the vessel following Norsels {{work on behalf of}} the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1954-55. The road Norselvegen in Tromsdalen, Tromsø is also named after the ship.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the Bay of Whales is continuously changing. A survey by the second Byrd expedition in 1934 determined that the feature lay at the junction of two separate ice systems, the movements of which {{are influenced by the}} presence of Roosevelt Island. Commander Glen Jacobsen, USN, who visited aboard the USS Atka in January 1955, found that calving of the ice shelf rendered the <b>iceport</b> temporarily unusable.|$|E
50|$|The Bay of Whales was {{a natural}} ice harbor, or <b>iceport,</b> {{indenting}} the front of Ross Ice Shelf just north of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica. It is the southernmost point of open ocean {{not only of the}} Ross Sea, but worldwide. The Ross Sea extends much further south—as far as the Gould Coast, some 320 km from the South Pole—but most of that area is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf rather than open sea.|$|E
50|$|Kainan Bay is an <b>iceport</b> which indents {{the front}} of the Ross Ice Shelf about 37 nmi km {{northeast}} of the northwestern end of Roosevelt Island, Antarctica. It was discovered in January 1902 by the British National Antarctic Expedition under Robert Falcon Scott. It was named by the Japanese Antarctic Expedition under Lieutenant Shirase Nobu which, in January 1912, effected a landing on the ice shelf here from the ship Kainan Maru. Little America V, the main base of U.S. Navy Operation Deep Freeze, 1955-56, was established at this site in late December 1955.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There is a {{promising}} middleware framework for robot systems called RT-Middleware (and its open source implementation named OpenRTM-aist). A rising demand exists for extending the existing OpenRTM-aist middleware with the fast communication capability of ICE overcoming the communication speed {{issues of the}} original version. With the help of ICE extension the communication among components has been direct and fast, on the other hand, the modularization, and creation of systems stay simple and easy. Another important improvementof the suggested extension is the embadded possibility for creating a connection among one consumer to multiple providers. The installation of ICE extension is a simple file copy operation, so the base system can still work futher with no changes in the original configuration. Upgrading the existing components to the the suggested new extension is simple by replacing the CorbaPort type to <b>IcePort.</b> The main contribution of {{the paper is the}} detailed introduction of the suggested changes for the OpenRTM-aist middleware. The paper also discuss the concept of this extension...|$|E
