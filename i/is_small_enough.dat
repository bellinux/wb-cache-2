5|$|Phosphorus {{could be}} {{intentionally}} introduced into diamond grown by {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) at concentrations up to ~0.01%. Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the ionization energy of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> for room-temperature thermal ionization. This important property of phosphorus in diamond favors electronic applications, such as UV light emitting diodes (LEDs, at 235nm).|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> to be preyed upon by a {{range of}} other predators. Least weasel remains {{have been found in}} the {{excrement}} of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black rat snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the strong nuclear force, which is much less well understood.|$|E

25|$|The same {{advantage}} exists {{with regards}} to other hierarchical storage systems, such as NUMA or virtual memory, {{as well as for}} multiple levels of cache: once a sub-problem <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough,</b> it can be solved within a given level of the hierarchy, without accessing the higher (slower) levels.|$|E
25|$|Another idea {{of recent}} {{interest}} is the ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes.

25|$|Divide-and-conquer {{algorithms}} naturally {{tend to make}} {{efficient use}} of memory caches. The reason is that once a sub-problem <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough,</b> it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache {{in this way is}} called cache-oblivious, because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter.|$|E
25|$|If {{the size}} of the {{undercut}} <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> and the material is flexible enough a side action is not always required. In these cases the undercut is stripped or snapped out of the mold. When this is done usually a stripping plate or ring is used instead of stripper pins so that the part is not damaged. This technique can be used on internal and external undercuts.|$|E
25|$|Most natural {{satellites}} of {{the planets}} undergo tidal acceleration to some degree (usually small), except for the two classes of tidally decelerated bodies. In most cases, however, the effect <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> that even after billions of years most satellites will not actually be lost. The effect is probably most pronounced for Mars's second moon Deimos, which may become an Earth-crossing asteroid after it leaks out of Mars's grip.|$|E

25|$|If {{the error}} rate <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough,</b> {{it is thought}} to be {{possible}} to use quantum error correction, which corrects errors due to decoherence, thereby allowing the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time. An often cited figure for required error rate in each gate is 10−4. This implies that each gate must be able to perform its task in one 10,000th of the coherence time of the system.|$|E
25|$|In the Dodge type jaw crushers, {{the jaws}} are farther {{apart at the}} top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the {{material}} is crushed progressively smaller and smaller as it travels downward until it <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> {{to escape from the}} bottom opening. The Dodge jaw crusher has a variable feed area and a fixed discharge area which leads to choking of the crusher and hence is used only for laboratory purposes and not for heavy duty operations.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is similar in}} basic concept to a jaw crusher, {{consisting}} of a concave surface and a conical head; both surfaces are typically lined with manganese steel surfaces. The inner cone has a slight circular movement, but does not rotate; the movement is generated by an eccentric arrangement. As with the jaw crusher, material travels downward between the two surfaces being progressively crushed until it <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> to fall out through {{the gap between the}} two surfaces.|$|E

It is common for a web to be about 20 times the size of the spider building it.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, a {{computer}} model was developed to simulate the physical oceanographic effects of one or several 100 megawatt OTEC plant(s). The model suggests that OTEC plants can be configured such that the plant can conduct continuous operations, with resulting temperature and nutrient variations that are within naturally occurring levels. Studies to date suggest that by discharging the OTEC flows downwards at a depth below 70 meters, the dilution is adequate and nutrient enrichment <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> so that 100 megawatt OTEC plants could be operated in a sustainable manner on a continuous basis.|$|E
25|$|A player's {{choice of}} which scale to {{use is a}} direct {{reflection}} {{of the scope of}} the game to be played. For historical games, 15mm seems to be the most popular scale, because it <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>enough</b> to allow for large battles. Smaller scaled miniatures are typically mounted in groups and moved as groups. This creates the visual effect of a large mass of combatants, allowing games simulating platoon, company, battalion, and even corps level actions. In these cases, the miniatures are often mounted on trays, or bases, for ease of mass movement.|$|E
