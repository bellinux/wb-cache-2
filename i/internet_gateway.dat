5|$|The {{previous}} state {{internet traffic}} are routed through a hub in Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur, {{passing through a}} submarine cable connecting the Peninsular with Kota Kinabalu. The systems are considered as costly and inefficient especially due {{to the price of}} leasing bandwidth with the large distance. In 2000, there is a plan to establish Sabah own internet hub but the plan was unreachable due to the high cost and low usage rates in the state. Other alternative plan including using the Brunei <b>internet</b> <b>gateway</b> in a short term before establishing Sabah own gateway. By 2016, the federal government has start to establish the first <b>internet</b> <b>gateway</b> for East Malaysia with the laying of 60 terabyte submarine cable which are developed by a private company named Xiddig Cellular Communications Sdn. Bhd. {{at a cost of about}} RM850 million through the Private Funding Initiative (PFI). Under the 2015 Malaysian Budget project of 1Malaysia Cable System Project (SKR1M), a new submarine cable for high speed internet has been built from Kota Kinabalu to Pahang in the Peninsular which completed in 2017. The 1Malaysia submarine cable system linking the state capital with Miri, Bintulu and Kuching in Sarawak together with Mersing in Johor with an increase of bandwidth capacity up to 12 terabyte per second. Another submarine cable, the BIMP-EAGA Submarine and Terrestrial (BEST) Cable Project is currently being built from Kota Kinabalu to Tawau to connecting Sabah with Brunei, Kalimantan and Mindanao which will be completed in 2018. In early 2016, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the state government and China's largest networking company, Huawei to set Sabah to become information and communications technology (ICT) hub by leveraging on Huawei's ICT expertise. More free high speed Wi-Fi hotspots are being planned in Sabah, especially to the state capital.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for interconnecting isolated clouds of {{an ad hoc}} network that form a scatternet topology using <b>Internet</b> <b>gateways</b> as intermediate nodes. The architecture developed is intended to augment FleetNet, a highly dynamic ad hoc network for inter-vehicle communications. This is achieved by upgrading FleetNet capabilities to establish a communication path between moving vehicles and the <b>Internet</b> via <b>Internet</b> <b>gateways</b> to facilitate direct gateway to gateway communications via the Internet, thus bridging gaps in the network topology and relaying packets closer towards their geographical destination at the same time. After outlining the overall FleetNet approach and its underlying geographical multi-hop routing, {{we focus on the}} FleetNet gateway architecture. We describe required modifications to the gateway architecture and to the FleetNet network layer in order to use these gateways as intermediate nodes for FleetNet routing. Finally, we conclude the paper by a short discussion on the prototype gateway implementation and by summarizing first results and ongoing work on inter scatternet communication. ...|$|R
