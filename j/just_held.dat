5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which <b>just</b> <b>held,</b> but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E

25|$|The {{run-up to}} the first Test match {{involved}} two drawn games. The match with Nottinghamshire was a low-scoring and slow-scoring match, in which the New Zealanders <b>just</b> <b>held</b> on to draw with one wicket left and 38 runs to make. By contrast, Cambridge University posted a first innings of 364 for nine declared, and then forced the New Zealanders to follow on, dismissing the team for just 137. In the follow-on, Sinclair made 130, Dowling 87 and Congdon 63, and the match petered out to a draw.|$|E

Since the IFWU had <b>just</b> <b>held</b> its biennial convention in May 1935, new elections for officers of the international union could not be held until 1937. So, despite overwhelming member support, Gold had to wait {{to run for president}} of the IFWU. He was not idle, however. Relations between various New York City locals were acrimonious after years of inter-union warfare, many employers were openly ignoring provisions of the contract because the union's attention was elsewhere, and organized crime had infiltrated many union shops.|$|E

Zionist leader Dr. Menahem Ussishkin used the occasion to deliver a keynote address in which he expressed the urgency for an institution of higher education in Palestine. The convention supported a resolution {{for the establishment of a}} polytechnical institute in Palestine and the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (at least on paper) was born.|$|E

500|$|On {{the same}} weekend {{as the more}} prestigious Milan–San Remo, to which the team was not invited, they picked up two wins in single-day races. Veilleux won La Roue Tourangelle beating 's Anthony Delaplace in a two-up sprint five seconds ahead of the main field. Chavanel led the field across the line, giving Europcar two out of the three podium spots. That same day, team leader Voeckler won Cholet-Pays de Loire by foiling a field sprint. With [...] left in the race, Voeckler went on the attack. He opened up a ten-second time gap very quickly and <b>just</b> <b>held</b> on to win, having no appreciable gap over the peloton at the finish. Since Cholet-Pays de Loire is a UCI Europe Tour race, Voeckler had to wear the all-white jersey of Europe Tour leader and not the French {{national}} champion's jersey, something which spectators expecting to see the tricolor jersey found absurd. While Voeckler was nonetheless happy to come away with a win, he stressed after the race {{that it was not}} Milan–San Remo, and that the victory should be viewed with the proper perspective.|$|E

500|$|The {{dismissal}} of Daryll Cullinan in 1999 {{was the second}} instance in ODIs: facing the West Indian spinner Keith Arthurton, Cullinan fended the ball off into the ground. It bounced high in the air, and Cullinan removed his right hand from his bat to catch it as it fell again. Despite {{the fact that it}} was unlikely that the ball would land near the stumps, the West Indies captain, Brian Lara, appealed, and Cullinan was dismissed. The next occurrence was two years later, in a Test match between Australia and India. In the first innings of the match, Steve Waugh was struck on the pads by a delivery from Harbhajan Singh. The umpire turned down the appeal, but as he did so, the ball bounced and spun towards the stumps. Waugh was alerted by a shout from the non-striking batsman, and instinctively swept the ball away with his free hand. The most recent instance came during the same year as Waugh's dismissal, in another Test match involving India. England's Michael Vaughan missed an attempted sweep against Sarandeep Singh, and the ball trickled along the ground after striking his pads. Vaughan brushed the ball away with his hand, despite {{the fact that it was}} not travelling towards the stumps. Initially, he claimed that he was attempting the give the ball back to the fielder at short leg, but he later admitted that he [...] "should have <b>just</b> <b>held</b> up [...] hands and said 'I got it all wrong, I'm an idiot.'" ...|$|E

State authorities believed that Clement planned and led the first daylight peacetime armed bank robbery in U.S. history when {{he held up the}} Clay County Savings Association on February 13, 1866.

A state militia unit entered the town shortly thereafter and killed Clement when he resisted arrest.|$|E
