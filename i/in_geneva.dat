The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin <b>in</b> <b>Geneva.</b> By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months.

5|$|Knox led a busy life <b>in</b> <b>Geneva.</b> He preached three sermons a week, each lasting {{well over}} two hours. The {{services}} used a liturgy that was derived by Knox and other ministers from Calvin's Formes des Prières Ecclésiastiques.

5|$|In 1542, Calvin adapted {{a service}} book used in Strasbourg, {{publishing}} La Forme des Prières et Chants Ecclésiastiques (The Form of Prayers and Church Hymns).

The original Strasbourg psalter contained twelve psalms by Clément Marot and Calvin added several more hymns of his own composition in the Geneva version. At the end of 1542, Marot became a refugee <b>in</b> <b>Geneva</b> and contributed nineteen more psalms.
