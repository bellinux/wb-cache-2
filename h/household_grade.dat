40|$|Studies {{focusing}} on Catholic schools {{as a proxy}} for all private education or all private religious education miss important variances within the private school sector, especially at the first grade level.

I augment the scope of a <b>household’s</b> first <b>grade</b> schooling choice by offering a rich model that includes the public schooling option and the most detailed typology of private schools to date: Catholic, Evangelical or Fundamental Protestant, Mainline Protestant or Other Faith, and Secular. Upon selecting a school type, I evaluate a student’s performance within this selected sector. While critics argue that selection and omitted variable biases generat...|$|R
50|$|This order {{distinguished}} {{those who}} proved {{their loyalty to}} the Portuguese Royal House {{in the war against}} the Bonapartist occupying forces. Later, in 1818, a royal decree stated that the Order would be given as a military award in four (4) classes of Grand Cross, Commander, Knight, and Servant. Knighthood was given to those who were servants to the king and devoted Catholics to the pope and the Holy Mother. The Order was originally limited to twelve Grand Crosses, forty Commanders and one hundred Knights, with the provision for the award of supernumerary Grand Crosses. Grand Crosses were usually given to higher nobles who had positions in the Royal <b>Household.</b> Lower <b>grades</b> (Commander and below) were granted to lesser nobles who had provided personal service to the King.|$|R

According to Levine, many of these teens suffered debilitating neuroses, such as anxiety, depression, drug addiction, anorexia, and self-harm. She noted two key indicators of this dysfunction: achievement pressure and emotional isolation from parents. In affluent communities, according to Levine, external accomplishments such as prestige, power, and money for adults, or grades, clothes, and electronics for kids, become more important than happiness or human agency.|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of an {{evaluation}} of the state of Texas GEAR UP project implemented in six school districts from 1998 to 2005. The intent of the program was to enhance preparation for post-secondary education among low-income, Hispanic students. The program was comprised of practical interventions including vertical curriculum alignment, training teachers in advanced placement techniques, encouraging students to take rigorous courses, and increasing outreach about college attendance to students and parents. The central dependent variable is reports by parents of graduating seniors about whether their children would be attending college. A multivariate analysis, controlling for <b>household</b> SES, student <b>grades</b> and attendance, <b>household</b> composition, and language spoken in the home indicates that increased student exposure to the GEAR UP program markedly increases the probability that parents will report that their children are going to attend college.

40|$|Background: Trachoma {{is known}} {{to be one of the}} major causes of {{blindness}} in Ethiopia. However recent data that indicate the disease burden were lacking. Objective: To determine the prevalence of active trachoma and trachomatous trichiasis at national and regional levels. Methods: A population based cross sectional design with multistage sampling strategy was used. All nine regional states and two city administrations of the country were involved in the survey. Survey subjects were drawn from permanent <b>households.</b> Trachoma <b>grading</b> was done by standardized ophthalmic nurses following the WHO grading system. Results: The national prevalence of active trachoma (either TF or TI) for children in the age group 1 - 9 year is 40. 14 %. Considerable regional variations are observed in the occurrence of active trachoma; the highest prevalence is in Amhara (62. 6 %), Oromia (41. 3 %), SNNP (33. 2 %), Tigray (26. 5 %), Somali (22. 6 %) and Gambella (19. 1 %). The rural prevalence of active trachoma is almost fourfold compared to the urban (42. 5 % rural Vs 10. 7 % urban). The national prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) is 3. 1 % with the highest prevalence in Amhara regional state (5. 2 %). Trachomatous trichiasis is higher in females compared to males (4. 1 % Vs 1. 6 %). Over 9 million 1 - 9 year old children live with active trachoma, and 1. 3 million people 15 years and older have trachomatous trichiasis...|$|R
40|$|We assess factors {{affecting}} primary {{and middle school}} dropout in rural Punjab and NorthWest Frontier Province over 6 years (1997 - 2004). These data are unique in a developing-country setting in longitudinally tracking changes in both school and <b>household</b> environments. While <b>grade</b> retention has improved, girls' dropout rates remain fairly high. Results suggest the importance of both household and school factors. For girls, arrival in the family of an unwanted birth in the last 6 years and enrollment in a government (not private) primary school significantly {{increase the likelihood of}} dropout, whereas availability of post-primary schooling, having a mother who attended school, and living in a better-off household reduce the probability of dropout. For boys, school quality, measured by the percent of residential teachers in the primary school, and living in a more developed community significantly reduce the probability of dropping out; loss of household remittances significantly increases the likelihood of dropout.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis analyses {{the impact}} of selected factors {{on the amount of}} food delivery services ordered by 81 clients of non-profit organization called Oblastní charita Strakonice during the period from 1. 11. 2013 to 30. 10. 2014. Based on analysis by random effect method, the thesis confirms correlation of monthly number of ordered services with two explanatory variables: number of <b>household</b> members and <b>grade</b> of care subsidy. The analysis implies that increase of number of household members by one member leads to decrease of monthly number of ordered services by 2 - 3 tasks. On the other hand, increase of grade of care subsidy by one grade leads to increase of monthly number of ordered services by approximately two tasks. Other factors included to the models are not correlated with explained variable at level below alpha = 0, 1. Findings mentioned above are consistent with information said in the theoretical part of my thesis...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of epidemic hepatitis {{occurred in the}} district of a rural Central School in Yates and Ontario Counties of Central New York. The epidemic comprised 176 cases of which 135 were jaundiced, and extended from September 1949 to May 1950, with most cases in March 1950. No common source could be demonstrated and the transmission was believed to be due to human contact alone. The overall morbidity rate was about 5 %, attack rate among school children 22 %, and among the adults and pre-school family contacts of infected school children the attack rate was 18 %, with no significant age difference in attack rate. Differences in attack rate in the various school grades were explained by higher number of siblings of children in certain <b>grades.</b> <b>Household</b> attack rates among non-school persons were related to number of sick school children, family size, and hygienic standard of the home. The first of these factors seemed most important. More jaundiced cases occurred in families where the exposure was heavies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{is more common}} in socially disadvantaged groups. Inequalities in household wealth are currently widening and may contribute to the increasing prevalence of the {{metabolic syndrome}}. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of 1, 509 women and 4, 090 men (aged 45. 2 - 68. 9 years) of an occupational cohort study of 20 civil service departments located in London, U. K. Components of the metabolic syndrome were measured in 1997 - 1999 and defined using a modified World Health Organization definition. RESULTS: Own income, household income, and wealth were each strongly and inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome in both sexes (P(trend) < 0. 001). Within each group of household wealth, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was higher in men than in women. Sex differences became smaller with decreasing household wealth, with the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome rising from 12. 0 and 5. 7 % in the wealthiest men and women, respectively, to corresponding values of 23. 6 and 20. 1 % in the poorest group. The odds ratio (95 % CI) associated with each decrease of one category in household wealth was 1. 25 (1. 03 - 1. 50) in men and 1. 69 (1. 18 - 2. 41) in women, adjusting for age, <b>household</b> members, occupational <b>grade,</b> education, father's social class, personal and household income, ethnic group, smoking, alcohol intake, diet, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Household wealth, a measure of assets accumulated over decades and generations, is strongly and inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome. Future research should explore the potential mechanisms by which wealth inequalities are associated with the metabolic syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Committee Chair: Edward Frongillo Committee Members: David Pelletier, Martha StipanukFood {{insecurity}} {{remains a}} persistent {{public health problem}} for children in the U. S. and {{is thought to have}} consequences for child physical, social and academic development. The School Breakfast Program, the National School Lunch Program, and Supplemental Food and Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) are federally funded programs intended to avert food insecurity and its consequences for children. These nutrition programs have also been associated with child physical, social and academic developmental outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate the complex relations between variables and to establish greater plausibility that associations are causal in nature. This study investigated the causal effects of household food insecurity and child nutrition program participation by using longitudinal data and statistical methods to account for potential bias. Fixed-effects modeling was utilized to minimize bias resulting from selection to participate and to take advantage of dynamic changes in household food insecurity status and program participation between kindergarten and 3 rd <b>grade.</b> <b>Household</b> food insecurity, independent of household income and other child- and household-level factors, was associated with poorer social skills and reading performance development among girls, and with greater weight gain among boys. National School Lunch Program participation was associated with better mathematics and reading performance for children. The effects of National School Lunch Program participation were stronger for children with greater socioeconomic need compared to those with less socioeconomic need, suggesting that food assistance participation may impact child development by modifying the effects of stress-related hardships. Neither school breakfast participation nor school lunch participation was associated with greater weight gain. In conclusion, food insecurity may exert its detrimental effects through nutritional and non-nutritional (i. e., stress-related) mechanisms. Similarly, school nutrition programs may protect children against the effects of food insecurity through nutritional and non-nutritional mechanisms. Further research into potential mechanisms underlying these associations is warranted. Policy implications of the findings are discussed. U. S.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. To provide information on consumers' experience, knowledge and attitudes in relation to insurance policies of five different types. The types of policy covered are: 1. Life assurance policies 2. Endowment assurance policies 3. Home insurance (buildings) (Householders survey only) 4. Home insurance (contents) (Householders survey only) 5. Motor vehicle insurance Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions a) How people have taken out their present policy(ies) b) Who advised them and what advice they were given c) Policy holders' awareness of specific clauses in their policies d) Problems that have arisen when making a claim on their policy e) Other difficulties {{members of the public}} have had to face in connection with insurance f) Attitudes of non-policy holders to each type of policy {{and the way in which}} they would obtain such a policy. Survey consists of 4 separate questionnaires. Variables common to all include: whether informant holds a policy or whether he/she has ever held a policy - if applicable; reason for no longer having one is given. If respondent has never considered taking out a policy, 'reason' is stated and a record is made of how he/she would go about obtaining one should he/she so decide. Particulars of policy held: company with which policy is held; annual yearly premium on policy; method of payment (e. g. by Giro); whether paid by instalments; if so, frequency of payment is recorded; total sum assured on policy; date policy was taken out. Procedures followed when taking out policy: whether and by whom prompted to take out policy; objectives in taking out policy; decision stages involved in first taking out policy; from whom received advice (8 categories). There is a separate section on insurance brokers, where applicable. Knowledge of policy: particularly, cover of policy; facilities linked with policy (e. g. life insurance policy and mortgage facility); amount which would be received if respondent stopped paying premiums before policy maturation date. Also, familiarity with policy document is tested (e. g. the last time that holder read or even looked at the document, and where it is normally kept). Claims (except in life insurance questionnaire) : number of claims made on policy; value of claim; whether handled by self; circumstances leading to claim; difficulties experienced; eventual outcome (e. g. claim met in full) and knowledge of the term 'averaging' on claims. Attitudes: circumstances in which respondent might decide to increase the value of his/her policy; whether he/she has ever contacted the insurance company with a view to modifying policy (if yes, who contacted and number of times is recorded); whether respondent thinks that the company should contact policy holders from time to time or whether it should be left to the holder to contact the company. Satisfaction with people who may have been contacted at some stage in connection with policy is gauged on a 7 -point scale (people listed are: insurance broker; insurance agent; bank manager; solicitor; other professional adviser). Background Variables Sex, age cohort, marital status, occupational details (including industry, job description and status, qualifications obtained), social <b>grade,</b> <b>household</b> status (i. e. sex, ages, number, occupational status, marital status, relationship to informant), home tenure and area of residence...|$|R
