5|$|<b>Ecology</b> <b>and</b> {{evolutionary}} biology are considered sister disciplines {{of the life}} sciences. Natural selection, life history, development, adaptation, populations, and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study {{the historical development of}} a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy. The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal Trends in <b>Ecology</b> <b>and</b> Evolution. There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus. Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization. While the boundary between <b>ecology</b> <b>and</b> evolution is not always clear, ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes, and evolution can be rapid, occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation.|$|E

5|$|Rasmussen’s {{early work}} was largely focused on {{studies of the}} systematics, <b>ecology</b> <b>and</b> {{behaviour}} of Patagonian seabirds, notably cormorants.

She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous cormorants.|$|E

5|$|After {{several years}} of public {{controversy}} regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested {{that in addition to}} protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, fire <b>ecology,</b> <b>and</b> other issues, the report suggested that the National Park Service (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.|$|E
40|$|Urban soundscape {{installations}} applying ecosophical approaches challenge homogeneity {{by creating}} diverse acoustic ecologies, where acoustic ecologies are {{understood as the}} subjective experiences of listeners immersed in variable sound environments. In environmental ecology homogeneity threatens diversity through the spread of destructive agents (weeds, feral animals, aircraft noise); similarly, homogenising agents in urban soundscapes (mediatisation, motorised traffic and ventilation systems) threaten the diversity of social <b>ecologies</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>ecologies.</b> This paper describes two public soundscape installations that challenge homogenisation by creating multiplicities of acoustic ecologies through transformations of everyday sounds for the diversification of social <b>ecologies</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>ecologies...</b>|$|R
