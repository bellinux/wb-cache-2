25|$|Trainz Railway Simulator has a Settle & Carlisle {{package for}} editions Trainz Classics 3, TS2009, TS2010, TS12, and T:ANE. This is {{modelled}} {{on the line}} under British Railways ownership in the fading days of steam power in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Locomotives range from the L Class 23s and BR Class 24s to LNER A3 Pacifics and BR Class 40s. Simulator sessions are provided in two versions: ride (all railway operations are performed under AI control) and <b>drive</b> (<b>you</b> take control of one train in the session). The route actually begins at Skipton, rather than Settle, since {{the latter is a}} junction. Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 included a demo version of the route, featuring the mainline from Ais Gills summit to a fictional colliery town called Wharton. Dent, Garsdale and the Hawes branchline were also included.|$|E

500|$|Blackburn {{served as}} Second Unit Director {{on the film}} Reverb, written and {{directed}} by Eitan Arrusi, and produced by Frank Mannion. Reverb stars Leo Gregory, Eva Birthistle, Margo Stilley, Luke de Woolfson, Stephen Lord, and Neil Newbon. The Guardian noted, [...] "In the end, this looks like just another crass, unimaginative and heavy-handed British horror." [...] A review in The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "Eitan Arrusi's movie appears to have been shot through dirty glass and edited in a blender– it may <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> mad." [...] Total Film observed, [...] "Hidden sounds lead to haunted rooms and tedious occult mythology".|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{had more}} mixed to negative {{responses to the}} song. The Tartan's Laura Scherb commended the track as [...] "adding to the beautiful representation {{of the destruction of}} Simba’s kingdom and the peace of the paradise in which he hides", but he noted that the audience felt at unease due to their lack of familiarity with the new material. Brandon Jones of The Global Dispatch criticized [...] "The Madness of King Scar" [...] and [...] "Chow Down" [...] as [...] "a bit too tedious", and felt that the beginning of the second act was too long. Heather Violanti was critical of the song's content, writing that its [...] "disgusting jokes about intestinal worms may <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> mad yourself", and negatively compared it to the Lebo M.-written [...] "One by One".|$|E
500|$|Official Xbox Magazine {{gave the}} game a 4.5 {{out of a}} {{possible}} 10, stating, [...] "Whether you're swinging a pipe or a scalpel, the controls never feel responsive, and rotten collision detection will <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> mad before Jigsaw's twisted games even have the chance." [...] David Clayman, writer for IGN, gave Saw a 7.5 {{out of a possible}} ten, earning it a rating of [...] "Good". Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw is a welcome entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills. Depending on your tolerance for repetition, it's a good way to test your nerves and scare yourself silly during a dark and stormy night.|$|E

500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E
500|$|Later reviews {{have been}} positive. Jess Harvell of Pitchfork opined that Quique [...] "still sounds timeless." [...] Glenn Swan of AllMusic gave the album {{four and a}} half stars out of five, stating [...] "this is Seefeel at their most ornate. They squint by staring into the {{geometric}} refractions of light and record the results." [...] Jason Ferguson of Harp described Quique as [...] "shimmered with a futuristic ethereality that was far more substantial than the electro-ambience of the era, but also much less assaultive than the shoegazers Seefeel was affiliated with early on." [...] and that the 2007 re-issue was [...] "a fitting tribute to a very unique sound." [...] The Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "underrated" [...] and [...] "that even 20 years later sounds like nothing else." [...] The Sunday Times gave the Redux edition a positive review, referring to Quique as the group's [...] "finest moment" [...] and [...] "If you like music to have structure, Quique will <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> barmy; but if you consider the presence of the word [...] "texture" [...] in an album review to be a positive, you might well enjoy this languid landmark." [...] Cam Lindsay wrote in Exclaim! that [...] "While it doesn't feel like a timely release, the re-discovery of Seefeel (no word yet on a reunion) certainly verifies their relevance in today's music, especially in light of neo-gazers like Ulrich Schnauss and Tim Hecker." [...] In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked the album at number 34 on his list of [...] "The Top 136 or So Albums of the Nineties". In 2016, Pitchfork placed Quique at number 13 on its list of [...] "The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|Hearst never forgave Montague {{for moving}} to the World, yet {{continued}} {{to try to persuade}} him to return. Years later the publisher met him in the street and asked when he would come back. [...] "Never," [...] Montague said. [...] "Yes, you will," [...] Hearst replied. [...] "Hunger will <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> back." [...] The year after Montague left Hearst, a collection of [...] "More Truth than Poetry" [...] columns was published by the George H. Doran Company.

2500|$|The piano, Gould said, [...] "is not an {{instrument}} for which I have any great love as such... I have played it all my life, {{and it is the}} best vehicle I have to express my ideas." [...] In the case of Bach, Gould admitted, [...] " [...] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on—and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed—so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn't <b>drive</b> <b>you,</b> you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Subsequent to his {{dismissal}} from The Cowsills, Billy Cowsill {{was briefly}} {{considered as a}} replacement for Brian Wilson in The Beach Boys' live performances,. [...] Cowsill was dissuaded by Wilson, who reportedly cautioned Cowsill that [...] "They'll <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> crazy." [...] He was also in demand for his production talents, developed during his time as a producer of recordings by The Cowsills. In 1971, having relocated to Tulsa, Oklahoma Cowsill released a solo album, Nervous Breakthrough, on MGM Records. [...] The album, on which Cowsill had also acted as producer, failed to chart. [...] The album had been recorded with the encouragement of MGM producer Mike Curb. [...] As his own recording contract was ending, Cowsill recommended that Curb record The Osmonds, whom Cowsill had encountered at Disneyland, singing barbershop music, while wanting to commence a career in pop music. [...] Curb acted on Cowsill's recommendation.|$|E
2500|$|November 1977 saw {{the release}} of the jazz-funk {{oriented}} Having a Party [...] which would be the final album release featuring the Pointer Sisters in their original four-woman format: in fact it was only on the title cut that all four members sang, the album's other cuts featuring Anita, Bonnie and Ruth but not June Pointer. Recorded in 1976 the album's release was so delayed as to cause an eighteen-month gap between Having a Party and the precedent Pointer Sisters' album Steppin - the compilation album The Best of the Pointer Sisters had been issued in July 1976 - and without the impetus of a major hit single the Having a Party album itself caused scant commercial interest. One track, [...] "Don't It <b>Drive</b> <b>You</b> Crazy" [...] with Bonnie Pointer on lead, would become a cult hit in the UK as part of the rare groove phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E

According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They <b>drive</b> <b>you</b> around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique.
