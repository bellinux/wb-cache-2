2500|$|... "I {{think he}} (Benito Mussolini) must do something, if he cannot make a graceful dive he {{will at least}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> in somehow; he can hardly put on his dressing-gown and walk down the stairs again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the German {{conquest of}} Poland, Mussolini would {{change his mind}} {{repeatedly}} {{as to whether he}} would enter the war. The British commander in Africa, General Archibald Wavell, correctly predicted that Mussolini's pride would ultimately cause him to enter the war. Wavell would compare Mussolini's situation to that of someone {{at the top of a}} diving board: [...] "I think he must do something. If he cannot make a graceful dive, he will at least <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> in somehow; he can hardly put on his dressing-gown and walk down the stairs again." ...|$|E
50|$|Restlessness (uddhacca) is {{compared}} to being a slave, continually <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.|$|R

2500|$|The first American {{attempt to}} design such an escape capsule {{was for the}} U.S. Navy F4D Skyray. It was tested in 1951-52 but was never {{installed}} in the aircraft. The Bell X-2, designed for flight in excess of Mach 3, could jettison the cockpit, though the pilot would still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> out and descend under his own parachute. The first production aircraft with an escape crew capsule was the Mach 2 B-58 Hustler. It {{was developed by the}} Stanley Aviation Company for Convair. [...] The capsule was pressurized, sheltered the pilot from the airstream, and contained food and survival supplies. [...] During testing of the [...] "Stanley Capsule" [...] in 1962, a bear became the first living creature to survive a supersonic ejection.|$|E
2500|$|The {{higher levels}} of competition, such as [...] "A" [...] or [...] "AA" [...] rated shows in the United States, or the {{international}} [...] "Grand Prix" [...] circuit, present more technical and complex courses. Not only is {{the height and width}} ("spread") of an obstacle increased to present a greater challenge, technical difficulty also increases with tighter turns and shorter or unusual distances between fences. Horses sometimes also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> fences from an angle rather than straight on. For example, a course designer might set up a line so that there are six and a half strides (the standard measure for a canter stride is twelve feet) between the jumps, requiring the rider to adjust the horse's stride dramatically {{in order to make the}} distance.|$|E
2500|$|While {{with the}} T.I. Group Dolphin invented and {{patented}} a 'Jumping apparatus' {{consisting of a}} tubular post with footrests supported by a spring on a post, mounted on a three-wheeled carriage. [...] The user would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> up and down to 'establish a forward drive to wheels through a free-wheel device'. More successful was his invention of an exercising machine [...] consisting of 'a flywheel rotatably mounted in fixed bearings, a winding spool fixed to rotate with the flywheel and a cable one end of which {{is connected to the}} core of the spool {{in such a way that}} on rotation of the flywheel with the cable fully unwound, the cable winds onto the spool in one or other direction depending on the direction of rotation of the flywheel.' From the patent it can be seen that this was the principle used for rowing machines and exercise equipment.|$|E

In this Leg's Detour, teams <b>had</b> <b>to</b> choose between Cama elástica (Trampoline) and Palos chinos (Chinese sticks). In Cama elástica, {{one of the}} team members <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> in the {{trampoline}} to reach their next clue, which was hanging from the roof. In Palos chinos, {{one of the team}} members <b>had</b> <b>to</b> climb a pole and get their next clue, which {{was at the top of}} the pole.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, riders rode this {{attraction}} 2 at a time, {{in yellow}} inflatable dinghies. [...] This was later replaced with large circular 4-person rafts. [...] In the Mountain Creek era, a lift {{was put in}} place that carried rafts {{to the beginning of the}} ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. [...] Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. [...] It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to Weird NJ how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall. [...] On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck – requiring riders to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> out, and push the raft – or wait for the raft behind them to hit them. [...] Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out.|$|E

(Livy will be certain to read this letter.) ...|$|E
60|$|They walked {{another half}} a mile, across a reedy swamp. Every {{now and then}} they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> across a small dyke, and once they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a detour to avoid an osier bed. They came at last to the river.|$|R
50|$|Because {{a defender}} often <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> block a <b>jump</b> shot, an {{offensive}} player {{can try to}} get his defender {{in the air at}} the wrong time by using a pump fake. If the offensive player then jumps into the defender, it is a defensive foul on the defensive player.|$|R
