5|$|Although the Eskaya <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> {{to people}} living in the {{vicinity}} of Bohol’s southeast highlands prior to World War II, {{it was only in the}} early 1980s that they came to wider public attention when government agricultural advisers toured the province to introduce Green Revolution policies. Local journalists and researchers have since suggested various theories on the origins of the Eskaya but there is still no broad consensus on the subject.|$|E
5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
5|$|It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> {{that under}} the church was a vault {{containing}} the remains of {{some members of the}} Stanley family but its whereabouts were not known until they were discovered by an architect in 2007. A stone slab was removed exposing steps leading to a crypt under the chancel. This contained six coffins, four of which contained the bodies of the first and second LordsStanley and their wives. Once the details had been recorded, the crypt was resealed.|$|E
50|$|The Serbian {{place name}} of the village is Banatsko Novo Selo and means Banatian New Village, but it <b>has</b> {{previously}} also <b>been</b> <b>known</b> by different names throughout its history. Older Serbian {{name of the}} village was simply Novo Selo, while in German it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as Banater Neudorf, in Hungarian it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as Révújfalu and in Romanian it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as Satu Nou.|$|R
50|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> {{since the}} early 13th century. The town does not retain many marks of antiquity, apart from several 17th-century churches. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> for its {{textiles}} since the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Almost all of Thrym's worshippers are frost giants, but he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> {{to approve}} clerics of other races if they fit his ideals. Some neanderthals and {{northern}} barbarians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to worship him.|$|R
5|$|After {{releasing}} The Sting (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album {{over a period of}} three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time with}} six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E
5|$|Bridges over {{waterways}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> in China {{since the}} ancient Zhou dynasty. During the Song dynasty, large trestle bridges were constructed, {{such as that}} built by Zhang Zhongyan in 1158. There were also large bridges made entirely of stone, like the Ba Zi Bridge of Shaoxing, built in 1256 and still standing today. Bridges with pavilions crowning their central spans were often featured in such paintings as the landscapes of Xia Gui (1195–1224). Long, covered corridor bridges, like the 12th-century Rainbow Bridge in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, which has wide stone-based piers and a wooden superstructure, were also built.|$|E
50|$|More {{recently}} these <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{called the}} ferropnictides. The first ones found {{belong to the}} group of oxypnictides. Some of the compounds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> since 1995, and their semiconductive properties <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> and patented since 2006.|$|R

5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a {{milestone}} in the careers of Sullivan and Mansfield. Sullivan left his banking job to become a full-time writer. He wrote three more plays (none successful), several novels, and a two-volume collection of short stories, {{many of which have}} Gothic elements. Sullivan attempted one more stage collaboration with Mansfield, a drama about the Roman emperor Nero, but they became estranged after its failure. For the actor, playing Jekyll and Hyde helped establish his reputation for dramatic roles; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> primarily for comedies. Mansfield continued to struggle financially (in part because of his elaborate, expensive productions) before he achieved financial stability in the mid-1890s with a string of successful tours and new productions.|$|E
5|$|Flamethrower, {{double piston}} and gunpowder-activated: Although the single piston {{flamethrower}} was first {{developed in the}} Byzantine Empire during the 7th century, the 10th-century Chinese flamethrower, or Pen Huo Qi, boasted a continuous stream of flame by employing double piston syringes (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> since the Han Dynasty) spouting Greek fire which had been imported from China's maritime trade contacts in the Middle East. It was first used in battle 932 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907–960), and the earliest illustration {{is found in the}} early Song Dynasty military manuscript Wujing Zongyao of 1044, which also described the device in full. Unlike the Greek model which employed a furnace, the Pen Huo Qi was ignited by an incendiary gunpowder fuse.|$|E

5|$|In 1218 and 1219, Jocelin also {{ended the}} dispute between his diocese and Glastonbury Abbey. Jocelin gave up any claim to {{control of the}} abbey, and the abbey gave the bishopric a number of estates. Previously, the bishops, {{as part of their}} attempt to annexe Glastonbury to their bishopric, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as the Bishop of Bath and Glastonbury. They also had held the office of abbot. In 1218, as part of the settlement, a new abbot was elected at Glastonbury. The papacy had never {{acknowledged}} Jocelin's claiming of the title of abbot. The historian J. A. Robinson felt that as part of the settlement, Jocelin began to use the title Bishop of Bath and Wells, but another historian, David Knowles, disagreed.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Tower Building was renovated due to {{the efforts}} of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It became the new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum {{remained}} in the tower building for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the Tower Building <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due {{to the efforts of}} Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|That hops {{could be}} used for {{flavoring}} beer <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> at least since Carolingian times, but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions. Before the widespread use of hops, gruit, a mix of various herbs, had been used. Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops, though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it, and the end result was much more variable. Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content, but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant. Hops may have been widely used in England in the tenth century; they were grown in Austria by 1208 and in Finland by 1249, and possibly much earlier.|$|E

5|$|The Burbank studio's {{remaining}} hand-drawn productions, Treasure Planet and Home on the Range, continued production. Treasure Planet, {{an outer}} space retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, was a pet project of writer-directors Ron Clements and John Musker. It received an IMAX release and generally positive reviews but was financially unsuccessful upon its November 2002 release, {{resulting in a}} $74 million write-down for The Walt Disney Company in fiscal year 2003. The Burbank studio's 2D departments closed {{at the end of}} 2002 following completion of Home on the Range, a long-in-production feature that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as Sweating Bullets.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is home to}} the South Bend Cubs, a Class A Minor League Baseball team, {{which plays}} at Four Winds Field at Coveleski Stadium in {{downtown}} South Bend. In 2014, the franchise changed its name and logo to the South Bend Cubs and became affiliated with the Chicago Cubs; prior to this, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> as the South Bend Silver Hawks and affiliated with the Arizona Diamondbacks. In 2005, the franchise nearly moved to Marion, Illinois, but a group of investors, led by former Indiana Governor and South Bend Mayor Joe Kernan, bought the Silver Hawks in order to ensure the team stayed in South Bend.|$|E
5|$|To market Zorro, TriStar {{purchased}} a 30-second advertising spot at Super Bowl XXXII for $1.3 million. Sony, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> for their low-key {{presence at the}} ShoWest trade show, showed clips from the film, while actors Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins presented a panel at the conference on May 10, 1998. The studio also attached Zorros trailer to prints of Godzilla. Sony launched an official website in June 1998. Internet marketing was an emerging concept in the late-1990s, and Zorro was Sony's first film to use VRML.|$|E

5|$|Walter Lehmann {{began the}} study of the sculptures of Takalik Abaj in the 1920s. In January 1942 J. Eric S. Thompson visited the site with Ralph L. Roys and William Webb on behalf of the Carnegie Institution while {{undertaking}} a study of the Pacific Coast, publishing his accounts in 1943. Further investigations were undertaken by Suzanna Miles, Lee Parsons and Edwin M. Shook. Miles bestowed the name Abaj Takalik to the site, which appeared in her contributed chapter in volume2 of the Handbook of Middle American Indians published 1965. Previously it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> by various names, including San Isidro Piedra Parada and Santa Margarita, after the names of the plantations in which the site lies, and also by the name of Colomba, a village to the north in the department of Quetzaltenango.|$|E
5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides}} of other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E
5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>known</b> to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
