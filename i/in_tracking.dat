5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems {{keeping up with the}} latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, in spite of its relatively low speeds. It was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip-to-scan ratio, and any reduction <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, {{with the}} help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell, a wealthy Bostonian, founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, {{convinced}} he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus's orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named PlanetX, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, PlanetX would have been the ninth planet). Lowell's hope <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> down PlanetX was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.|$|E

In a visit to Priesack to assess his collection of Nazi documents, Irving found out Stiefel's phone number, from which he worked out the address; he also obtained photocopies of some of the diary pages from Priesack. Irving visited Stiefel unannounced and tried to find out the name of the source, but the collector misled him as to the origin. Irving examined Priesack's photocopies and saw a number of problems, including spelling mistakes and the change in writing style between certain words.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically we expect this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01.

His plan is complicated when Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) challenges a Tellarite to a duel, causing Archer to step in. After he defeats Shran, the races work together and force the retreat of the Romulan vessel and the missing crewman are recovered.|$|E
30|$|For the {{following}} 3 -week block, the two tracks ran simultaneously, with students <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> A {{moving on to}} the second unit, while students <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> B had the opportunity to engage with the Unit 1 material once again, in a smaller class setting. At the close of this 3  week period, Track A students wrote a test for Unit 2, while Track B students wrote a second Unit 1 test covering the same content as their first attempt but with different questions. Students <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> A passing for the second time moved on to the third unit <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> A, while those who did not achieve the passing score (or who were not happy with their score) moved into <b>Track</b> B. Those <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> B who passed moved on to the second unit; however, those who failed any unit test for the second time while <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> B were informed that they did not satisfy the requirement of the course to successfully pass all three unit tests, and thus would not be eligible to receive a passing grade in the course. Students had the option of voluntarily withdrawing from the course had they received a failing grade on the Unit 1 or 2 tests while <b>in</b> <b>Track</b> B.|$|R
40|$|Resilient railpads in {{a variety}} of {{materials}} and with different surface profiling have been tested in the laboratory and <b>in</b> <b>track.</b> A laboratory impact test based on that initially developed at the Battelle Columbus Laboratories provides a reliable ranking {{of the extent to which}} railpads attenuate dynamic strain in concrete sleepers <b>in</b> <b>track.</b> The test is also a good indication of the average attenuation provided by a pad <b>in</b> <b>track.</b> Ifdynamic loads <b>in</b> <b>track</b> are particularly severe the fractional attenuation provided by a pad is greater than that indicated by the laboratory impact test. Laboratory resonance apparatus, in which the pad is the principal resilient element in a simple dynamic system, has been made tofind the railpad’s effective dynamic stiffness. There is good correlation between the stiffness measured <b>in</b> <b>track</b> and that measured in this apparatus. A pad’s dynamic stiffness is consistently at least as great as its tangent stiffness foundfrom the static loadldeflection curve.

5|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! {{tracked the}} final mixes {{of the songs}} at Caribbean Sound Basin. Its main studio used a 64-channel SSL 4064 G mixing console, the {{secondary}} studio used a 48-track Neve console with flying faders, and its third studio used an Amek BC2 console. The group mostly used the older Neve console. <b>In</b> <b>tracking</b> the songs, they started with a drum machine groove as a basic track and recorded it. The parts recorded with live instrumentation were then added to the mix. Live drums and horn sections were included to attain the sound of performing live.

5|$|Walsh was on {{the team}} that {{captured}} criminal Arthur Barker, son of gangster Ma Barker, in Chicago in 1935 and was later involved <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> Public Enemy Number One Al Brady in 1937. On October 12 of that year, {{he was with the}} group of FBI agents who ambushed and killed Brady in a shoot-out at a Bangor, Maine sporting goods store. While waiting for Brady to arrive, he acted as a clerk in the store for several days and arrested Brady Gang member James Dalhover. As the operation leader, Walsh's job was to alert thirteen other agents, as well as over 30 other state and local policemen, of any gang member's arrival by pulling a cord on the window. As they were interrogating Dalhover in the store Clarence Lee Shaffer, Jr., another gang member, entered the building and began firing at the agents. While arresting Dalhover, Walsh took bullets to his hand, shoulder and right chest, but quickly returned to work.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the game engine's source code, the {{possibilities}} of changing the game greatly opened up, and the fan community made use of the code to update the game using recent technology. Led by Edward Gardner and Ian Warfield, the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project was formed to standardize changes and maintain a core engine for others to take advantage of. Using the new fan-updated engine, projects such as Beyond the Red Line, based on the new Battlestar Galactica, and The Babylon Project, based on Babylon 5, have become possible. PXO, the free Internet gaming service handling SquadWar, was initially acquired by THQ in their 2002 acquisition of Outrage Entertainment (renamed as Outrage Games). The service was continued until July 2003, when Outrage Games was dissolved and PXO terminated. The components of its website were, however, later handed over to the FreeSpace 2 Source Code Project to help them create a similar service <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> statistics and rankings.|$|E

5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara effect with a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians <b>in</b> <b>tracking</b> both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
