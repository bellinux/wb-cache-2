The impact of an <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroid</b> at 15 km/sec on a gabbroic anorthosite lunar crust is examined in detail. The high-speed impact-induced flow is described over the entire hydrodynamic regime from a time where the peak pressures are 6 Mbar until the stresses everywhere in the flow are linearly elastic, and less than 5 kbar. For 5 cm radius projectile the latter condition is achieved some 0. 5 msec after impact.

40|$|Hugoniot {{measurements}} on 15, 418, a recrystallized and brecciated gabbroic anorthosite, yield {{a value of}} the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) varying from - 45 to 70 kbar as the final shock pressure is varied from 70 to 280 kbar. Above the HEL and to 150 kbar the pressure-density Hugoniot is closely described by a hydrostatic equation of state constructed from ultrasonic data for single-crystal plagioclase and pyroxene. Above - 150 kbar, the Hugoniot states indicate that a series {{of one or more}} shock-induced phase changes are occurring in the plagioclase and pyroxene. From Hugoniot data for both the single-crystal minerals and the Frederick diabase, we infer that the shock-induced high-pressure phases in 15, 418 probably consist of a 3. 71 g/cm^ 3 density, high-pressure structure for plagioclase (An_(93)) and a 4. 70 g/cm^ 3 perovskite-type structure (En_(64)) for pyroxene. Using the Kelly Truesdell mixture theory we separately calculated the entropy production in each phase, and predict incipient and complete melting in the plagioclase occurs upon release from 500 and 600 kbar. For the pyroxene component, incipient and complete melting occurs upon release from 700 and 850 kbar. The onset of shock-induced vaporization will occur upon release from 1300 kbar and would require the impact of an <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroid</b> traveling at a velocity of 8 km/sec...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} stress, strain, and breakup in solid {{satellites}} and stray bodies subject to tidal perturbations is presently addressed {{in view of}} three novel considerations. After presenting a new analytic solution for the stress tensor in a homogeneous and compressible elastic sphere, where the inclusion of compressibility alters stresses by several percent, realistic failure criteria are noted to demonstrate the general failure of such ductile bodies as <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> by plastic shear, while brittle ice bodies fail by either tensile or shear fracture. A reexamination of crack propagation after initial failure allows the diverse breakup criteria to be reconciled...|$|R
40|$|The {{axisymmetric}} {{distribution of}} stress, internal energy and particle velocity {{resulting from the}} impact of an <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroid</b> with a gabbroic anorthosite lunar crust has been calculated for the regime in which shock-induced melting and vaporization takes place. Comparison of impact flow fields, with phase changes in silicates taken into account, with earlier results demonstrate that in the phase change case when the 15 -km/s projectile has penetrated some two projectile radii into the moon, the peak stress in the flow is ∼ 0. 66 Mbar {{at a depth of}} 66 km, and the stress has decayed to ∼ 66 kbar at a depth of 47 km. Rapid attenuation occurs because of the high rarefaction velocity of the high-pressure phases associated with a 35 % (zero-pressure) density increase. This feature of the phase-change flow tends to strongly concentrate the maximum shock pressures along the meteoroid trajectory (axis) and makes the conical zone along which high internal energy deposition occurs, both shallow and narrow. Examination of the gravitational energies required to excavate larger craters on the moon indicates the importance of gravity forces acting during the excavation of craters having radii in the range greater than ∼ 2 – ∼ 140 km. It is observed that the “hydrodynamic” energy vs. crater radius relation approaches those for various “gravitational” energy vs. radius relations at the radii values corresponding to the larger mare basins. Cratering energy values in the range of (1. 0 – 9. 4) • 10 ^(32) erg are inferred on this basis for the Imbrium crater. Using these values and the criteria that all rocks exposed to ∼ 100 kbar or greater shock pressures are included in the ejecta (some of which falls back) implies that the maximum depth of sampling expected to be represented within the Apollo collection lies in the range 148 – 328 km...|$|E
2500|$|Large meteoroids may {{strike the}} earth with a {{significant}} fraction of their escape velocity (second cosmic velocity), leaving behind a hypervelocity impact crater. The kind of crater {{will depend on the}} size, composition, degree of fragmentation, and incoming angle of the impactor. The force of such collisions has the potential to cause widespread destruction. The most frequent hypervelocity cratering events on the Earth are caused by <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids,</b> which are most easily able to transit the atmosphere intact. Examples of craters caused by <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> include Barringer Meteor Crater, Odessa Meteor Crater, Wabar craters, and Wolfe Creek crater; iron meteorites are found in association with all of these craters. In contrast, even relatively large stony or icy bodies like small comets or asteroids, up to millions of tons, are disrupted in the atmosphere, and do not make impact craters. Although such disruption events are uncommon, they can cause a considerable concussion to occur; the famed Tunguska event probably resulted from such an incident. Very large stony objects, hundreds of meters in diameter or more, weighing tens of millions of tons or more, can reach the surface and cause large craters, but are very rare. Such events are generally so energetic that the impactor is completely destroyed, leaving no meteorites. (The very first example of a stony meteorite found in association with a large impact crater, the Morokweng crater in South Africa, was reported in May 2006.) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} {{height of}} a meteor varies by approximately 10 km depending on the rotation state of a spherical meteoroid {{as long as the}} body sustains a temperature gradient. Such gradients build up in friable stony meteoroids larger than approximately 0. 1 cm and in <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> that are approximately 1 cm or larger. The height where 100 microns or smaller zodiacal dust particles ablate is nearly independent of rotation. Stony particles in the 100 microns size range ablate near 120 km while both larger and smaller meteoroids penetrate deeper. All calculations were made with a nominal speed of 30 km/s and a zenithal distance equal to z(sub r) = 0 deg. Larger meteoroids cool their surface by conduction to the interior while smaller meteoroids decelerate significantly due to their large surface area to mass ratio so that the surface receives a lower energy flux. Some micro-meteoroids smaller than approximately 10 microns may escape abalation altogether at the nominal velocity. The effect of rotation on particle temperature during atmospheric flight is significant on meteoroids larger than 0. 1 cm but may be negligible on micro-meteorites that are typically 10 - 50 microns in diameter...|$|R
40|$|Noble gas {{analyses}} of the Ni-Fe of 9 L, 5 H, and 2 LL chondrites quantitatively support previous suggestions of radiogenic He- 4 recoil and He- 3 deficits. Furthermore, noble gases in the Ni-Fe show evidence for in situ produced radiogenic He- 4 {{and in some cases}} for recoil loss of Ar- 38 and gain of Ne- 21. The ratio of spallogenic Ar- 38 and Ne- 21 in the metal phase is found to correlate strongly with He- 3 /Ne- 21 and Ne- 22 /Ne- 21 in bulk samples of these chondrites. This is proof of the dependence of these ratios on the irradiation hardness experienced by the meteoroid in space. 'Hardness indices' n equals 1. 9 - 2. 2 are found, indicating that on the average the stone meteoroids from which the samples came were smaller in mass than <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids.</b> The spallogenic Ne- 21 /Ar- 38 ratio in metallic Ni-Fe can be used with the semi-empirical production model deduced from the Grant iron meteorite to calibrate spallogenic He- 3 /Ne- 21 and Ne- 21 /Ar- 38 in bulk samples of L, LL and H chondrites for meteoroid size and sample location allowing the estimation of minimal meteoroid masses...|$|R
40|$|The Earth's {{extraterrestrial}} dust flux {{includes a}} wide variety of dust particles that include FeNi metallic grains. During their atmospheric entry iron micrometeoroids melt and oxidize to form cosmic spherules termed I-type spherules. These particles are chemically resistant and readily collected by magnetic separation and are thus the most likely micrometeorites to be recovered from modern and ancient sediments. Understanding their behavior during atmospheric entry is crucial in constraining their abundance relative to other particle types {{and the nature of the}} zodiacal dust population at 1 AU. This paper presents numerical simulations of the atmospheric entry heating of <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> in order to investigate the abundance and nature of these materials. The results indicate that iron micrometeoroids experience peak temperatures 300 - 800 K higher than silicate particles explaining the rarity of unmelted iron particles which can only be present at sizes of < 50 m. The lower evaporation rates of liquid iron oxide leads to greater survival of iron particles compared with silicates, which enhances their abundance amongst micrometeorites by a factor of 2. The abundance of I-types is shown to be broadly consistent with the abundance and size of metal in ordinary chondrites and the current day flux of ordinary chondrite-derived MMs arriving at Earth. Furthermore, carbonaceous asteroids and cometary dust are suggested to make negligible contributions to the I-type spherule flux. Events involving such objects, therefore, cannot be recognized from I-type spherule abundances in the geological record...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} cosmogenic nuclides {{in metal}} and/or silicate (primarily olivine) {{separated from the}} main-group pallasites Admire, Ahumada, Albin, Brahin, Brenham, Esquel, Finmarken, Glorieta Mountain, Huckitta, Imilac, Krasnojarsk, Marjalahti, Molong, Seymchan, South Bend, Springwater, and Thiel Mountains and from Eagle Station. The metal separates contained an olivine fraction which although small, < 1 wt% in most cases, nonetheless contributes significantly to the budgets of some nuclides (e. g., up to 35 % for Ne- 21 and Al- 26). A correction for olivine is therefore essential and was made using model calculations and/or empirical relations for the production rates of cosmogenic nuclides in <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> and/or measured elemental concentrations. Cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) ages for the metal phases of the main-group pallasites range from 7 to 180 Ma, {{but many of the}} ages cluster around a central peak near 100 Ma. These CRE ages suggest that the parent body of the main-group pallasites underwent a major break-up that produced most of the meteorites analyzed. The CRE age distribution for the pallasites overlaps {{only a small fraction of}} the distribution for the IIIAB iron meteorites. Most pallasites and IIIAB irons originated in different collisions, probably on different parent bodies; a few IIIABs and pallasites may have come out of the same collision but a firm conclusion requires further study. CRE ages calculated from noble gas and radionuclide data of the metal fraction are higher on average than the Ne- 21 exposure ages obtained for the olivine samples. As the metal and olivine fractions were taken in most cases from different specimens, the depth-dependency of the production rate ratio Be- 10 /Ne- 21 in metal, not accounted for in our calculations, may explain the difference...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the orbits}} and ablation characteristics {{in the atmosphere}} of 59 earth-impacting fireballs, produced by meteoroids one meter in diameter or larger, described here as meter-scale. Using heights at peak luminosity {{as a proxy for}} strength, we determine that there is roughly an order of magnitude spread in strengths of the population of meter-scale impactors at the Earth. We use fireballs producing recovered meteorites and well documented fireballs from ground-based camera networks to calibrate our ablation model interpretation of the observed peak height of luminosity as a function of speed. The orbits and physical strength of these objects are consistent with the majority being asteroidal bodies originating from the inner main asteroid belt. We find a lower limit of ~ 10 - 15 % of our objects have a possible cometary (Jupiter-Family comet and/or Halley-type comet) origin based on orbital characteristics alone. Only half this number, however, also show evidence for weaker than average structure. Two events, Sumava and USG 20131121, have exceptionally high (relative to the remainder of the population) heights of peak brightness. These are physically most consistent with high microporosity objects. We also find three events, including the Oct 8, 2009 airburst near Sulawesi, Indonesia, which display comparatively low heights of peak brightness, consistent with strong monolithic stones or <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids.</b> Based on orbital similarity, we find a probable connection among several events in our population with the Taurid meteoroid complex; no other major meteoroid streams show probable linkages to the orbits of our meter-scale population. Our impactors cover almost four orders of magnitude in mass, but no trend in height of peak brightness as a function of mass is evident, suggesting no strong trend in strength with size for meter-scale impactors.

Of 24 independent irons from Antarctica, eight are ungrouped, a much higher fraction than that among all classified irons. The difference is probably related {{to the fact that}} the median mass of Antarctic irons is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of non-Antarctic <b>irons.</b> Smaller <b>meteoroids</b> may tend to sample a larger number of asteroidal source regions, perhaps because small meteoroids tend to have higher ejection velocities or because they have random-walked a greater increment of orbital semimajor axis away from that of the parent body...|$|R

Elemental <b>iron</b> occurs in <b>meteoroids</b> and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust.

40|$|Thick spherical targets made of gabbro (R = 25 cm) and {{of steel}} (R = 10 cm) were {{irradiated}} isotropically with 1. 6 GeV protons at the Saturne synchrotron at Laboratoire National Saturne (LNS) /CEN Saclay {{in order to}} simulate the interaction in space of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) protons with stony and <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids.</b> Proton fluences of 1. 32 x 10 (14) cm(- 2) and 2. 45 x 10 (14) cm(- 2) were received by the gabbro and iron sphere, respectively, which corresponds to cosmic-ray exposure ages of about 1. 6 and 3. 0 Ma. Both artificial meteoroids contained large numbers of high-purity target foils of up to 28 elements at different depths. In these individual target foils, elementary production rates of radionuclides and rare gas isotopes were measured by x- and gamma-spectrometry, by low-level counting, accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), and by conventional rare gas mass spectrometry. Also samples of the gabbro itself were analyzed. Up to now, {{for each of the}} experiments, similar to 500 target-product combinations were investigated of which the results for radionuclides are presented here. The experimental production rates show a wide range of depth profiles reflecting the differences between low-, medium-, and high-energy products. The influence of the stony and iron matrices on the production of secondary particles and on particle transport, in general, and consequently on the production rates is clearly exhibited by the phenomenology of the production rates as well as by a detailed theoretical analysis. Theoretical production rates were calculated in an a priori way by folding depth-dependent spectra of primary and secondary protons and secondary neutrons calculated by Monte Carlo techniques with the excitation functions of the underlying nuclear reactions. Discrepancies of up to a factor of 2 between the experimental and a priori calculated depth profiles are attributed to the poor quality of the mostly theoretical neutron excitation functions. Improved neutron excitation functions were obtained by least-squares deconvolution techniques from experimental thick-target production rates of up to five thick-target experiments in which isotropic irradiations were performed. A posteriori calculations using the adjusted neutron cross sections describe the measured depth profiles of all these simulation experiments within 9 %. The thus validated model calculations provide a basis for reliable physical model calculations of the production rates of cosmogenic nuclides in stony and iron meteorites as well as in lunar samples and terrestrial materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our work is to {{determine}} the bulk density of meteoroids. Unlike previous works which focused either on the dynamical properties of the meteoroids (deceleration), ignoring fragmentation; or on fitting solely the lightcurves, neglecting the dynamics of the meteoroids, we use both the photometry and astrometry to constrain our model. Our model, based on the dustball model, considers the meteoroid to be a collection of grains held together by a lower boiling point 2 ̆ 7 glue 2 ̆ 7. It uses conservation of energy and momentum to model the change in velocity and the light production as a function of time. The free parameters in the model (mass, density, heat of ablation, temperature of fragmentation, boiling temperature, specific heat, molar mass, and thermal conductivity) are varied from values consistent with fragile cometary material, through asteroidal chondritic material, to solid iron, and the entire parameter space is explored, giving all possible solutions which are consistent with the data. An initial study used cameras with small fields of view to achieve high spatial resolution. 42 meteors were detected, but only six meteors were entirely captured in the common observing volume of the cameras, and were therefore suitable for modelling. The modelling revealed that taking fragmentation into account does not necessarily produce high bulk density values, but the fraction of high density (nearly <b>iron</b> composition) <b>meteoroids</b> observed was higher than expected. This study showed that the fraction of small meteoroids with high bulk density (almost iron density) may be underestimated. In order to analyse more data, a model of detector saturation was developed to correct for meteors which were saturated on the 8 -bit camera systems. The model was tested on data collected in a special campaign, and found to reproduce the unsaturated lightcurves correctly. This saturation correction was found to be very important in correctly modelling the brighter meteors in the dataset for the final study. Finally, 92 meteors were recorded on wider field systems using higher resolution detectors to measure deceleration precisely. Densities for each meteoroid was calculated, and the meteoroids were grouped by their orbital characteristics for analysis. As expected, meteoroids with asteroidal origins had high densities of 4200 kg m- 3 in average, and those with Halley-type cometary orbits had low densities ranging from 380 kg m- 3 to 1510 kg m- 3. The asteroidal densities are higher than chondritic, suggesting that some have significant <b>iron</b> content. <b>Meteoroids</b> from the Perseid meteoroid stream had densities of 620 ± 200 kg m- 3, consistent with the sporadic Halley-type meteoroids. Most surprising result was the high density of Jupiter-family comets (3100 ± 300 kg m- 3 for Jupiter-family sporadics, and 3200 kg m- 3 in average for the North Iota Aquariids, which are linked to Comet 2 P/Encke). This suggests that refractory material may be a major component of Jupiter family comets in agreement with the surprising results of the Stardust mission on comet 81 P/Wild 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{fragmentation}} {{of a small}} asteroid in the atmosphere greatly increases its cross sections for aerodynamic braking and energy dissipation. At a typical impact velocity of 22 km/s, the atmosphere absorbs {{more than half the}} kinetic energy of stony meteoroids with diameters, D(sub m), less than 220 m and <b>iron</b> <b>meteoroids</b> with D(sub m) less than 80 m. The corresponding diameter for comets with impact velocity 50 km/s is D(sub m) less than 1600 m. Most of the atmospheric energy dissipation occurs in a fraction of a scale height, so large meteors appear to 'explode' or 'flare' {{at the end of their}} visible paths. This dissipation of energy in the atmosphere protects the earth from direct impact damage (e. g., craters), but it produces a blast wave that can do considerable damage. The area of destruction around the impact point in which the over-pressure in the blast wave exceeds 4 lb/sq in = 2. 8 x 10 (exp 5) dynes/cu cm, which is enough to knock over trees and destroy buildings, increases rapidly from zero for chondritic meteoroids less than 56 m in diameter (15 megatons) to about 200 sq km for those 80 m in diameter (48 megatons); the probable diameter of the tunguska impactor of 1908 is about 80 m. Crater formation and earthquakes are not significant in land impacts by stony asteroids less than about 200 m in diameter because of the air protection. A tsunami is probably the most devastating type of damage for asteroids 200 m to 1 km in diameter. An impact by an asteroid this size anywhere in the Atlantic would devastate coastal areas on both sides of the ocean. An asteroid a few kilometers across would produce a tsunami that would reach the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in the upper half of the East Coast of the United States. Most of Florida is protected from a tsunami by the gradual slope of the ocean off its coast, which causes most of the tsunami energy to be reflected back into the Atlantic. The atmosphere plume produced by asteroids with diameters exceeding about 120 m cannot be contained by the atmosphere, so this bubble of high-temperature gas forms a new layer on top of the atmosphere. The dust entrapped in this hot gas is likely to have optical depths exceeding tau = 10 for asteroids with diameters exceeding about 0. 5 to 1 km. The optical flux from asteroids 60 m or more in diameter is enough to ignite pine forests. However, the blast wave from an impacting asteroid goes beyond the radius in which the fire starts. The blast wave tends to blow out the fire, so it is likely that the impact will char the forest, as at Tunguska, but the impact will not produce a sustained fire. Because comets dissipate their energy much higher in the atmosphere than asteroids, they illuminate a much larger region and their blast wave is weaker. So they are much more effective in producing large fires. This suggests that the KT impactor was a comet rather than an asteroid...|$|R
