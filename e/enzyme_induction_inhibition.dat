40|$|The {{increase}} {{in the use of}} herbal products, particularly in patients taking conventional medicine, has increased the likelihood of drug-herb interactions. Herbal products sold to the public are often not a single chemical compound, but rather a complex mixture of hundreds of different constituents. Human microsomal systems have been employed as a cost and time efficient approach to prospectively evaluate individual constituents for the potential for interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} certain herbal constituents are capable of direct inhibition of drug metabolizing enzymes in this system. However, extrapolation of the drug interaction potential to cellular systems or whole organisms is often difficult because the preparation of microsomes necessitates the destruction of the integrity of the living cell and the physiologically relevant processes within. The primary goal of this dissertation research was to investigate the effect of herbal products on human hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters using primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Cultured hepatocytes were exposed to the various herbal constituents acutely, to evaluate the direct effect on enzyme activity, or chronically, to evaluate the indirect effect on enzyme expression and subsequent activity. Additionally, in order to assess to scalability of our in vitro UGT 1 A results to humans, healthy human subjects were administered acetaminophen, a general UGT 1 A probe, before and after a 7 -day course of milk thistle. These data demonstrate that herbal constituents can directly inhibit enzyme activity but also influence activity by indirectly modulating gene expression. In the case of St. John's wort, human hepatocytes showed that while constituents were capable of <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction,</b> <b>inhibition</b> also occurred. However, in vivo, it is the former that predominates over the latter. Furthermore, our predictions of interactions in vivo for St. John's wort have been validated through a number of clinical studies. The case of milk thistle, however, proved more complex. While our in vitro data showed the possibility of drug interactions with several drug metabolizing enzymes, little effect was found in vivo. The latter demonstrates the value of consideration of the entire pharmacologic profile of an herb before conclusions about clinical relevance are made...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the primary types of antiepileptic drug (AED) interactions {{by using a}} mechanistic approach. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE and bibliographies of recent review articles and published abstracts. DISCUSSION: AEDs {{are associated with a}} wide range of drug interactions, including hepatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition</b> and protein-binding displacement. Hepatic induction by AEDs affects the metabolism of a limited number of drugs with low therapeutic indices. Anticipation of induction interactions and careful clinical monitoring may alleviate potential problems. Most commonly used AEDs are eliminated through hepatic metabolism catalyzed by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes. Phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine induce CYP and UGT enzymes. Lamotrigine is a weak inducer of UGT. Valproate is a broad-spectrum inhibitor o...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} various {{drugs on the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of tolbutamide have been examined in the rat. Phenobarbitone pretreatment caused {{a significant decrease in}} half life and area under the curve (AUC) and a significant increase in clearance and volume of distribution (Vd). Acute administration of primaquine significantly increased half life and AUC and decreased clearance. In contrast, the related animoquinolone chloroquine, was without effect. Acute administration of cimetidine produced similar changes to primaquine but of lesser magnitude. Formation of the major metabolite hydroxytolbutamide, was markedly enhanced by phenobarbitone and reduced by primaquine and cimetidine. We conclude that due to its single pathway of metabolism, tolbutamide is a good substrate to use when examining pharmacokinetic interactions involving hepatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition...</b>|$|R

Limitations to knowledge about the mechanisms of toxicity render incomplete the detection of hepatotoxic potential during preclinical development.

Aging, preexisting liver disease, <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> or <b>inhibition,</b> genetic variances, local O 2 supply and, above all, the intrinsic molecular properties of the drug may affect this process. Necrotic death follows antioxidant consumption and oxidation of intracellular proteins, which determine increased permeability of mitochondrial membranes, loss of potential, decreased ATP synthesis, inhibition of Ca 2 +-dependent ATPase, reduced capability to sequester Ca 2 + within mitochondria, and membrane bleb formation. Conversely, activation of nucleases and energetic participation of mitochondria are the main intracellular mechanisms that lead to apoptosis.

40|$|Background: It is {{critical}} for providers caring for HIV-positive methadone recipients to have accurate information on pharmaco-logic interactions between methadone and antiretroviral therapy. If providers do not have these data, symptoms of narcotic with-drawal or excess due to medication interactions may be mismanaged, and antiretroviral regimens may be suboptimal in efficacy or associated with increased side effects and toxicities. This review was undertaken to clarify {{what is known about}} interactions between pharmacotherapies of opiate dependence and HIV-related medications, to suggest clinically useful approaches to these issues, and to outline areas which need further study. Methods: A search for relevant published papers and abstracts presented at scientific meetings was conducted using electronic databases. These documents were obtained and reviewed, and additional publications referenced in them were also reviewed. Results: Pharmacokinetic interactions between methadone and zidovudine, didanosine, stavudine, abacavir, nevirapine, efavirenz and nelfinavir have been documented. The mechanisms, clinical implications and management of these interactions are reviewed. Conclusions: Interactions between methadone and some HIV-related medications are known to occur, yet their characteristics cannot reliably be predicted based on current understanding of metabolic <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition,</b> or through in vitro studies. Only carefully designed and conducted pharmacologic studies involving human subjects can help us define the nature of the interactions between methadone (and other pharmacotherapies for opiate dependence) and specific HIV-related medications.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare azithromycin, a novel 15 -membered ring azalide, and erythromycin estolate for the potential to cause hepatic microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition</b> in Sprague-Dawley rats. The daily oral administration of 800 mg of erythromycin estolate per kg for 7 days resulted in statistically significant elevations of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, erythromycin N-demethylase (3. 2 -fold), and total cytochrome P- 450 content. Approximately 40 % of cytochrome P- 450 was complexed with erythromycin metabolite. In contrast, the daily administration of 200 mg of azithromycin per kg for 7 days caused significant elevations of N-demethylase (2. 5 -fold) only and did not produce any increases in total cytochrome P- 450 content or NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. No complexed cytochrome P- 450 was detected in the azithromycin-dosed rats despite liver concentrations of azithromycin that were 118 times greater than the liver concentrations of erythromycin estolate in erythromycin estolate-dosed rats. Although the short-term oral administration of azithromycin produced hepatic accumulation of the drug and elevated azithromycin demethylase activity, there was no other evidence of hepatic cytochrome P- 450 induction or inactivation via cytochrome-metabolite complex formation. In contrast to erythromycin estolate, azithromycin is not expected to inhibit its own metabolism or that of other drugs via this pathway...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} that structurally unrelated food additives could show either joint actions or interactions has been assessed {{based on their}} potential to share common sites and mechanisms of action or common pathways of elimination. All food additives approved in the European Union and allocated numerical acceptable daily intake values were studied, initially based on the reports by the FAO-WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives. Target organs were identified based on the effects reported at doses above the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal and human studies. The descriptions of the pathological and other changes reported {{were used to assess}} whether different additives, sharing the same target organ, would produce a common toxic effect. In all but a very few cases, the possibility of joint actions or interactions could be excluded on scientific grounds. The exceptions were on the liver (curcumin, thiabendazole, propyl gallate, and BHT), the kidney (diphenyl, o-phenylphenol, and ferrocyanide salts), the blood (azorubine and propyl gallate), and the thyroid (erythosine, thiabendazole, and nitrate). Toxicokinetic interactions were considered unlikely because of the low dosages involved, the diverse nature of the routes of metabolism and elimination, and the fact that <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> or <b>inhibition</b> would have influenced selection of the NOAEL. Many of those additives which could not be excluded from showing joint actions or interactions would have low intakes; in some cases they were alternatives for the same application, thereby further lowering the combined intake. In consequence, joint actions or interactions between additives do not represent a significant health concern. (C) 2000 International Life Sciences Institute...|$|R
40|$|Herbal {{medicines}} {{are often}} used in combination with conventional drugs, and this may give rise to the potential of harmful herb-drug interactions. This paper updates our knowledge on clinical herb-drug interactions with an emphasis of the mechanistic and clinical consideration. In silico, in vitro, animal and human studies {{are often used}} to predict and/or identify drug interactions with herbal remedies. To date, a number of clinically important herb-drug interactions have been reported, {{but many of them}} are from case reports and limited clinical observations. Common herbal medicines that interact with drugs include St John 2 ̆ 7 s wort (Hypericum perforatum), ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba), ginger (Zingiber officinale), ginseng (Panax ginseng), and garlic (Allium sativum). For example, St John 2 ̆ 7 s wort significantly reduced the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and blood concentrations of cyclosporine, midazolam, tacrolimus, amitriptyline, digoxin, indinavir, warfarin, phenprocoumon and theophylline. The common drugs that interact with herbal medicines include warfarin, midazolam, digoxin, amitriptyline, indinavir, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and irinotecan. Herbal medicines may interact with drugs at the intestine, liver, kidneys, and targets of action. Importantly, many of these drugs have very narrow therapeutic indices. Most of them are substrates for cytochrome P 450 s (CYPs) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The underlying mechanisms for most reported herb-drug interactions are not fully understood, and pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms are implicated in many of these interactions. In particular, <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition</b> may {{play an important role in}} the occurrence of some herbdrug interactions. Because herb-drug interactions can significantly affect circulating levels of drug and, hence, alter the clinical outcome, the identification of herb-drug interactions has important implications...|$|R
40|$|Cyclophosphamide (CP) {{is widely}} used in {{high-dose}} chemotherapy regimens in combination with thioTEPA. CP is a prodrug and is activated by cytochrome P 450 to 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide (HCP) which yields the final cytotoxic metabolite phosphoramide mustard (PM). The metabolism of CP into HCP exhibits autoinduction but is inhibited by thioTEPA. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a population pharmacokinetic model for the bioactivation route of CP incorporating the phenomena of both autoinduction and the drug-drug interaction between CP and thioTEPA. Plasma samples were collected from 34 patients who received high-dose CP, thioTEPA and carboplatin in short infusions during 4 consecutive days. Elimination of CP was described by a noninducible route and an inducible route leading to HCP. The latter route was mediated by a hypothetical amount of enzyme. Autoinduction leads to a zero-order increase in amount of this enzyme during treatment. Inhibition by thioTEPA was modeled as a reversible, competitive, concentration-dependent inhibition. PM pharmacokinetics were described by first-order formation from HCP and first-order elimination. The final models for CP, HCP, and PM provided an adequate fit of the experimental data. The volume of distribution, noninducible and initial inducible clearances of CP were 31. 0 L, 1. 58 L/hr and 4. 76 L/hr, respectively. The enzyme amount increased with a zero-order rate constant of 0. 041 amount * hr- 1. After each thioTEPA infusion, however, approximately 80 % of the enzyme was inhibited. This inhibition was reversible with a half-life of 6. 5 hr. The formation and elimination rate constants of PM were 1. 58 and 0. 338 hr- 1, respectively. The developed model enabled the assessment of the complex pharmacokinetics of CP in combination with thio TEPA.

40|$|Induction of drug {{metabolizing}} enzymes, {{such as the}} cytochromes P 450 (CYP) {{is known}} to cause drug-drug interactions due to increased elimination of co-administered drugs. This increased elimination may lead to significant reduction or complete loss of efficacy of the co-administered drug. Due to the significance of such drug interactions, many pharmaceutical companies employ screening and characterization models which predict CYP <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> to avoid or attenuate the potential for drug interactions with new drug candidates. The most common mechanism of CYP induction is transcriptional gene activation. Activation is mediated by nuclear receptors, such as AhR, CAR, and PXR that function as transcription factors. Early high throughput screening models utilize these nuclear hormone receptors in ligand binding or cell-based transactivation/reporter assays. In addition, immortalized hepatocyte cell lines {{can be used to}} assess <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> of specific drug metabolizing enzymes.

In contrast, lumicolchicine {{had no effect}} on pinocytosis or amino acid transport. Thus, a role for intact microtubules in lysosomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction,</b> pinocytosis, and amino acid uptake in these cells is suggested.

40|$|With {{more than}} 500 million cases {{and at least}} 1 million deaths each year, malaria is a major global health problem. The main problem with malaria control is the {{emerging}} drug resistance among parasites causing the infection. Consequently, there is an urgent need for new drugs. The artemisinin endoperoxide antimalarials are highly effective, well tolerated and have {{become the most important}} class of drugs in the treatment of malaria. The parent compound, artemisinin, exhibits remarkable time-dependent pharmacokinetics, resulting from a pronounced capacity for auto-induction. Artemisinin has also been shown to influence the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) mediated metabolism of other drugs, increasing the risk of drug–drug interactions. The artemisinin antimalarials are recommended to be used in combination treatment. It is therefore crucial to elucidate which principal CYP enzymes are affected by these drugs. 	Using the cocktail approach it was demonstrated that several principal CYP enzymes were affected by the antimalarials artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artemether, arteether and artesunate in healthy volunteers. Metabolic changes were moderate but in several cases shared by all five endoperoxides studied, suggesting a class effect. At therapeutic doses artemisinin appeared {{to be associated with the}} strongest capacity for <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> and <b>inhibition.</b> The time-dependent metabolism of artemisinin was described in both healthy volunteers and malaria patients by a previously developed pharmacokinetic auto-induction model. Further results indicate artemisinin to induce the activity of CYP 2 A 6 in healthy subjects, but to which extent could not be demonstrated. Problems with studying induction of CYP 2 A 6 using available probe compounds were highlighted. Pharmacogenetic data of genes coding for principal CYP enzymes involved in antimalarial treatment obtained in healthy Vietnamese volunteers, were in general agreement with reports from other Asian populations. Artemisinin is suggested to be an alternative marker to assess the activity of CYP 2 B 6. Further studies are needed to investigate the metabolic fate of artemisinin, and evaluate its potential use as an in vitro and in vivo CYP 2 B 6 probe. 	In conclusion, this thesis has contributed with pharmacokinetic and metabolic information on the artemisinin antimalarials, useful in the development of new derivatives and combination treatments. The potential of these drugs to affect CYP enzymes has to be considered in order to reduce the risk of drug-drug interactions and achieve optimal treatments of malaria...|$|R

However, enhanced DNA strand breaks did not correspond with contamination gradients, expressed as concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) or polyaromatic hydrocarbons. MO <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> in the hepatic 1 3, 000 g fraction of male dab, measured as 7 -ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity, was significantly enhanced in response to low ambient temperatures. Some evidence was found for the facilitation of benzola]pyrene hydroxylase activity expressing the <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> in the microsomal fraction of pyloric caeca of seastars, at increasing PCB concentrations. DNA integrity and <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> elucidate the physiologic status and might be indicative for ambient impairment within restricted areas, and not necessarily related {{to the presence of}} anthropogenic or xenobioti...|$|R

40|$|<b>Enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that describes increased microsomal enzyme synthesis caused by the administration of enzyme inducing substances. In {{order to avoid the}} disadvantages of <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> it is helpful to have a simple and reliable indicator of microsomal enzyme activity in patients exposed to enzyme inducing drugs. Measurement of serum gamma glutamyl- transferase (gammaGT) activity is the most common indirect method of assessing the phenomenon since serum is easily obtainable and assay methods are readily available. However previous studies of the measurement of serum gammaGT activity as an index of microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> have been contradictory. This study investigates factors that may influence the individual variations of gammaGT activity in response to the administration of anticonvulsants. Ethical and practical considerations permitted only limited studies to be performed on epileptic patients taking anticonvulsant drug therapy. However a series of extensive investigations involving dietary factors and drug manipulations were conducted on male wistar rats. The factors chosen were known to affect drug metabolism, <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> or protein synthesis. The process {{of the effects of the}} dietary factors on induction of gammaGT by phenobarbitone were studied using anatomical, biochemical, histological and electron microscopic techniques. The study showed that the age and sex of the patients, choice of drugs, daily drug dose and duration of therapy may influence the induction of gammaGT activity. The results also showed that administration of phenobarbitone to rats causes a marked but temporary decrease in hepatic glutathione concentration followed by the induction of gammaGT. It was also demonstrated that the dietary factors markedly affect the induction of gammaGT by phenobarbitone. Evidence is presented to indicate that both polyunsaturated fat and proteins potentiate gammaGT induction at the glutathione level whilst carbohydrate and folic acid inhibit at the cyclic AMP level. Evidence from both the clinical and experimental results suggests that gammaGT is a reasonable indicator of microsomal <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> if these factors are taken into account...|$|R
30|$|Substitution of {{high cost}} {{synthetic}} substrates with raw solid substrates such as agro-industrial wastes in enzyme industry based-bioprocesses is somehow feasible task implying some challenges. The prospect or the scope that a solid waste could cover all {{needs of a}} microorganism from organic and inorganic substances mandatory for microbial growth and <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> {{is considered to be}} one of the major obstacles in this respect. The greater that essential nutritional elements, mandatory for microbial growth and <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction,</b> exist in suboptimal levels in raw solid substrates, the more indispensable need is to add external supplements in the fermentation broth (Sneath 1986). As a consequence, the cost of the production medium will elevate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Two {{parameters}} of <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> in vivo (urinary glucaric acid and the ratio between urinary 6 -beta-OH-cortisol and 17 -OH-corticosteroids) were followed {{in a population}} of chemical workers exposed to styrene and acetone (maximum air concentrations 164 and 571 mgm" 3, respectively) and in a control group. The exposed workers showed significantly higher excretion of glucaric acid and a higher ratio of 6 -beta-OH-cortiso!/ 17 -OH-corticosteroids. The variations of the two parameters were significantly correlated. An increase of urinary mercapturic acids was also found that was correlated to glucaric acid and 6 -beta-OH-cortisol excretion. The data show that simultaneous styrene and acetone exposure induces mono-oxygenases in humans. The possibility that <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> may modify {{the long-term effects of}} styrene exposure is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{activity}} of soluble protein kinase (ATP:protein phosphotransferase,EC 2. 7. 1. 37) and pattern of nuclear protein phosphorylation was monitored in cultured rat pineal glands during the induction of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (acetyl-CoA:serotonin N-acetyltransferase;EC 2. 3. 1. 5) by l-isoproterenol. A nuclear protein {{appears to be}} phosphorylated {{during the early stages}} of <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction</b> but is not phosphorylated at later stages of induction. This correlates well with the need for RNA synthesis associated with the induction process. The nuclear protein was also phosphorylated when the pineal glands were treated with dibutyryl 3 ': 5 '-cyclic AMP. The soluble protein kinase activity appeared to decline during mid-to-late stages of <b>enzyme</b> <b>induction,</b> but there was no concomitant increase in the particulate protein kinase activity...|$|R
