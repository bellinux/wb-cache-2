5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny was planned, which {{revolved around the}} Spear of Longinus. Development was outsourced to a small Canadian studio, but eventually stopped as LucasArts did not have experience with the supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story <b>into</b> <b>another</b> four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E
5|$|At the {{intersection}} with Montgomery Street, MD 2 splits <b>into</b> <b>another</b> one-way pair with the northbound direction running east on Montgomery Street and then turning north on Light Street, intersecting MD 2 Truck (Key Highway) and passing by the Maryland Science Center, and the southbound direction following Hughes Street to Hanover Street. Along this one-way pair, the route carries one lane {{in each direction}} {{with the exception of}} Light Street, where the northbound direction has four lanes. Both directions of MD 2 join again along eight-lane divided Light Street and the route heads toward the Inner Harbor. Near Harborplace, the route splits <b>into</b> <b>another</b> one-way pair with northbound MD 2 running along three-lane Calvert Street and southbound MD 2 running along four-lane St. Paul Street. The route crosses many streets in downtown Baltimore, including Pratt Street, Lombard Street, Baltimore Street, Fayette Street, and Saratoga Street. The one-way pair passes by Mercy Medical Center before coming to US 40. Calvert Street passes under US 40 (the Orleans Street Viaduct) while St. Paul Street intersects US 40 as it follows the one-way pair of Franklin Street westbound and Mulberry Street eastbound.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen {{was close}} to winning the 2006 Norwegian Chess Championship outright, but a last-round loss to Berge Østenstad dropped him <b>into</b> <b>another</b> tie for first place with Agdestein. It also {{prevented}} Carlsen from beating Agdestein's record as the youngest Norwegian champion ever. Nonetheless, in the playoff held from 19–21 September, Carlsen won 3–1. After two draws at standard time controls, Carlsen won both rapid games in round two, securing his first Norwegian championship win.|$|E

5|$|Dean's small force {{eventually}} {{made it out}} of the city past several North Korean roadblocks. Just outside the city Dean stopped his jeep to tend to several wounded US soldiers in a wrecked truck in the ditch. However, as they attempted to escape further they ran <b>into</b> <b>another</b> North Korean roadblock and were forced to continue on foot, crossing the Taejon River and climbing a nearby mountain. In the confusion, Dean was separated from the group.|$|E
5|$|Find {{insertion}} {{sites for}} other proteins. Inserting one protein as a domain <b>into</b> <b>another</b> protein can be useful. For instance, inserting calmodulin into {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) allowed researchers to measure the activity of calmodulin via the fluorescence of the split-GFP. Regions of GFP that tolerate the introduction of circular permutation {{are more likely to}} accept the addition of another protein while retaining the function of both proteins.|$|E
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated <b>into</b> <b>another.</b> In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

Tone and Crawford had first appeared together in Today We Live (1933) but Crawford was hesitant about entering <b>into</b> <b>another</b> romance so soon after her split from Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek (Lake Erie) flooded {{downtown}} Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, {{was blocked}} by debris, and collapsed. A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225houses and killed 36people. After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed <b>into</b> <b>another</b> larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.|$|E

5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little evolutionary change {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming <b>into</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting blocks may be {{used for}} all races up to and {{including}} 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend <b>into</b> <b>another</b> lane.|$|E
5|$|Territory size {{is highly}} variable, ranging {{from less than}} 40km2 in the Ngorongoro Crater to over 1,000km2 in the Kalahari. Home ranges are defended through vocal displays, scent marking and {{boundary}} patrols. Clans mark their territories by either pasting or pawing in special latrines located on clan range boundaries. Clan boundaries are usually respected; hyenas chasing prey have been observed to stop dead in their tracks once their prey crosses <b>into</b> <b>another</b> clan's range. Hyenas will however ignore clan boundaries in times of food shortage. Males {{are more likely to}} enter another clan's territory than females are, as they are less attached to their natal group and will leave it when in search of a mate. Hyenas travelling in another clan's home range typically exhibit bodily postures associated with fear, particularly when meeting other hyenas. An intruder can be accepted <b>into</b> <b>another</b> clan after {{a long period of time}} if it persists in wandering into the clan's territory, dens or kills.|$|E
50|$|Iso{{antibodies}} (formerly called alloantibody) are antibodies {{produced by}} an individual against isoantigens produced {{by members of the}} same species. In the case of the species Homo sapiens, for example, there are a significant number of antigens which are different in every individual. When antigens from another individual are introduced <b>into</b> <b>another's</b> body, these isoantibodies immediately bind to and destroy them.|$|R
