40|$|A subset S of the {{vertices}} of a {{directed acyclic graph}} {{is called}} glb-closed, if it contains the <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bounds</b> of all pairs of vertices of S. The glb-closure of S is the smallest glb-closed subset containing S. An efficient output sensitive algorithm for computing glb-closures is presented and two applications {{in the field of}} object-oriented programming languages are discussed. 1 The problem in general Directed acyclic graphs are widely used in different areas of computer science. In compiler construction they can be used to identify common subexpressions or to represent type lattices in programming languages supporting subtypes. In the latter case lattice operations for determining least upper <b>bounds</b> or <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bounds</b> are frequently needed. In this paper the notion of closure of a subset of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph is introduced.

25|$|A lattice is an {{abstract}} structure {{studied in the}} mathematical subdisciplines of order theory and abstract algebra. It consists of a partially ordered set in which every two elements have a unique supremum (also called a least upper bound or join) and a unique infimum (also called a <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bound</b> or meet). An example is given by the natural numbers, partially ordered by divisibility, for which the unique supremum is the least common multiple and the unique infimum is the greatest common divisor.|$|E
25|$|It follows by an {{induction}} {{argument that}} every non-empty finite subset of a lattice has a {{least upper bound}} and a <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bound.</b> With additional assumptions, further conclusions may be possible; see Completeness (order theory) for more discussion of this subject. That article also discusses how one may rephrase the above definition {{in terms of the}} existence of suitable Galois connections between related partially ordered sets — an approach of special interest for the category theoretic approach to lattices, and for formal concept analysis.|$|E
25|$|A sup (supremum) of X is a least {{upper bound}} on X, namely an upper bound on X that is less or equal to every upper bound on X. Dually an inf (infimum) of X is a <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bound</b> on X. The sup of x and y always exists in the {{underlying}} poset of a Boolean algebra, being x∨y, and likewise their inf exists, namely x∧y. The empty sup is 0 (the bottom element) and the empty inf is 1 (top). It follows that every finite set has both a sup and an inf. Infinite subsets of a Boolean algebra {{may or may not}} have a sup and/or an inf; in a power set algebra they always do.|$|E

25|$|Any {{two sets}} in an antimatroid {{have a unique}} least upper bound (their union) and a unique <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bound</b> (the union of the sets in the antimatroid that are {{contained}} in both of them). Therefore, the sets of an antimatroid, partially ordered by set inclusion, form a lattice. Various important features of an antimatroid can be interpreted in lattice-theoretic terms; for instance the paths of an antimatroid are the join-irreducible elements of the corresponding lattice, and the basic words of the antimatroid correspond to maximal chains in the lattice. The lattices that arise from antimatroids in this way generalize the finite distributive lattices, and can be characterized in several different ways.|$|E
500|$|Between 1937 and 1939, Von Neumann {{worked on}} lattice theory, {{the theory of}} {{partially}} ordered sets in which every two elements have a <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bound</b> and a least upper bound. Von Neumann provided an abstract exploration of dimension in completed complemented modular topological lattices (properties that arise in the lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces): [...] "Dimension is determined, up to a positive linear transformation, by the following two properties. It is conserved by perspective mappings ("perspectivities") and ordered by inclusion. The deepest part of the proof concerns the equivalence of perspectivity with [...] "projectivity by decomposition"—of which a corollary is the transitivity of perspectivity."

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the topic of}} Boolean algebras.

The content of this initial research used a particular notation. The ideas of partially ordered sets, lattices, least upper <b>bounds,</b> and <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bounds</b> were used to define the structure of a Boolean algebra. From this fundamental understanding, we were able to study atoms, Boolean algebra isomorphisms, and Stone’s Representation Theorem for finite Boolean algebras. We also verified and proved many properties involving Boolean algebras and related structures. We then expanded our study to more thoroughly developed theory. This comprehensive theory was more abstract and required the use of a different, more universal, notation. We continued examining least upper and <b>greatest</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bounds</b> but extended our knowledge to subalgebras and families of subsets. The notions of cardinality, cellularity, and pairwise disjoint families were investigated, defined, and then used to understand the Erdös-Tarski Theorem. Lastly, this study concluded with the investigation of denseness and incomparability as well as normal forms and the completion of Boolean algebras...|$|R
