Mut-Ashkur the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi, however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly.|$|E

He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends precisely as dictated by the narrators.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} male lead was the longest, {{and a series of}} auditions attracted several celebrities. Giddens chose first-time actor Ko Chen-tung because he felt he showed great improvement in his acting skills in each successive audition.

5|$|After {{moving to}} London, his editorship of the Freemason ignited an {{interest}} in the study of Masonic history, and led to the establishment of Quatuor Coronati Lodge, dedicated to masonic research. Woodford was the first Immediate Past Master of the lodge, and as such convened the lodge for much of its first two years, during the frequent absences of Charles Warren, the master. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death, towards the end of 1887, he passed on a set of coded papers which resulted in the establishment of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Cady Stanton, {{the eighth}} of eleven children, {{was born in}} Johnstown, New York, to Daniel Cady and Margaret Livingston Cady. Five of her {{siblings}} died in early childhood or infancy. A sixth sibling, her older brother Eleazar, died at age 20 <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> graduation from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Only Elizabeth Cady and four sisters lived well into adulthood and old age. Later in life, Elizabeth named her two daughters after two of her sisters, Margaret and Harriot.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They both worked as dry goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred his upper lip.

5|$|Speaker's Corner became {{increasingly}} {{popular in the}} late 19th century. Visitors brought along placards, stepladders and soap boxes in order to stand out from others, while heckling of speakers was popular. Donald Soper, Baron Soper was a regular visitor throughout the 20th century, until <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death in 1998. The rise of the Internet, particularly blogs, has diminished the importance of Speaker's Corner as a political platform, and it is increasingly seen as simply a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The second {{individual}} to be conferred the rank was Kodandera M. Cariappa, the first Indian {{to serve as}} the commander–in–chief of the Indian Army. Unlike Manekshaw, who was conferred the rank <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> retirement, Cariappa was already retired in 1953, and since a field marshal never retires, therefore retired officers cannot be given the rank. But as a token of gratitude for the exemplary service rendered by him to the nation, the Government of India overruled the pre-established criteria, and conferred the rank of field marshal on him on 28 April 1986 at a special investiture ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright to experiment with subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E

5|$|During the post-WrestleMania Raw on April 7, Triple H {{immediately}} {{used his}} authority as WWE COO to grant himself a title match against WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan later that night. As Stephanie McMahon {{tried to persuade}} Randy Orton, Batista, Kane, and the Shield to help Triple H in his title match, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H was the mastermind behind {{the attack on the}} Shield on the previous month's SmackDown. As a result, Bryan was attacked by Orton, Batista, and Kane <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> title match, which began anyway at the order of Triple H. However, the title match ended in a no contest and Bryan's retention when the Shield interfered, attacking and chasing away Triple H, Orton, Batista, and Kane.|$|E
5|$|For Operation Husky, the {{invasion}} of Sicily, Patton was to command the Seventh United States Army, dubbed the Western Task Force, in landings at Gela, Scoglitti and Licata to support landings by Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army. Patton's I Armored Corps was officially redesignated the Seventh Army <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> force of 90,000 landed before dawn on D-Day, July 10, 1943, on beaches {{near the town of}} Licata. The armada was hampered by wind and weather, but despite this the three U.S. infantry divisions involved, the 3rd, 1st, and 45th, secured their respective beaches. They then repulsed counterattacks at Gela, where Patton personally led his troops against German reinforcements from the Hermann Göring Division.|$|E
5|$|His {{best known}} popular work is his Dictionary of Plant Names, which {{found its way}} into the {{libraries}} of most horticulturalists. One of the focuses of his work at the Natural History Museum was the flora of the Caribbean, where he carried out field work. Stearn continued to return to the Cambridge Botanic Garden, cared for his own garden and worked with the RHS to become an authority on horticulture as well as botany. William Stearn collaborated with his wife, Eldwyth Ruth Stearn, on a number of his most important works, including Botanical Latin and Dictionary of Plant Names and translating German botanical history into English. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death he completed a revision of his original Epimedium monograph.|$|E

5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console him. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson {{was anxious}} to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E
5|$|Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} Surekill and inquire {{as to the}} company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he {{responds}} that he did. Doggett asks why Chase would have called Surekill <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>his</b> death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill {{early the next morning}} and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of her desk, but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to her surprise. Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase.|$|E
