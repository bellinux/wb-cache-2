25|$|Some {{incorrectly}} ported {{games or}} game engines have acceleration and interpolation curves which unintentionally produce excessive, irregular, or even negative acceleration when {{used with a}} mouse instead of their native platform's non-mouse default input device. Depending on how deeply <b>hardcoded</b> this misbehavior is, internal user patches or external 3rd-party software {{may be able to}} fix it.|$|E
25|$|The core {{principle}} of M-Theory is extracting representations invariant to various transformations of images (translation, scale, 2D and 3D rotation and others). In contrast with other approaches using invariant representations, in M-Theory {{they are not}} <b>hardcoded</b> into the algorithms, but learned. M-Theory also shares some principles with Compressed Sensing. The theory proposes multilayered hierarchical learning architecture, {{similar to that of}} visual cortex.|$|E
25|$|By default MSX {{machine has}} <b>hardcoded</b> {{character}} set and keyboard return scan code handling algorithm. While MSX in overall has full application software compatibility, at the firmware (BIOS) level coupled with its hardware level, due to minor hardware differences, {{replacement of the}} BIOS with another from different PC may render incorrect scan code translations and thus incorrect behavior of the keyboard subsystem for the application software.|$|E

50|$|HPKP is {{standardized}} in RFC 7469. It expands on static certificate pinning, which <b>hardcodes</b> {{public key}} hashes of well-known websites or services within web browsers and applications.|$|R
25|$|A client {{that does}} key pinning adds an extra step beyond the normal X.509 {{certificate}} validation: After obtaining the server's certificate {{in the standard}} way, the client checks the public key(s) in the server's certificate chain against a set of (hashes of) public keys for the server name. Typically the public key hashes are bundled with the application. For example, Google Chrome includes public key hashes for the *.google.com certificate that detected fraudulent certificates in 2011. (Chromium does not enforce the <b>hardcoded</b> key pins.) Since then, Mozilla has introduced public key pinning to its Firefox browser.|$|E

50|$|Softcoding is a {{computer}} coding term that refers to obtaining a value or function from some external resource, such as a preprocessor macro, external constant, configuration file, command line argument or database table.

25|$|Malware {{can carry}} DDoS attack mechanisms; {{one of the}} better-known {{examples}} of this was MyDoom. Its DoS mechanism was triggered on a specific date and time.

50|$|Hard coding (also hard-coding or <b>hardcoding)</b> {{refers to}} the {{software}} development practice of embedding an input or configuration data directly into the source code of a program or other executable object, or fixed formatting of the data, instead of obtaining that data from external sources or generating data or formatting in the program itself with the given input.|$|R
