5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates and neglected the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E
25|$|Improving {{the quality}} of gemstones by {{treating}} them is common practice. Some treatments are used in almost all cases and are therefore considered acceptable. During the late 1990s, a large supply of low-cost materials caused a sudden surge in supply of heat-treated rubies, leading to a <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on ruby prices.|$|E

25|$|In the 1890s, gypsum {{manufacturers}} perfected {{a method}} of strengthening plaster by adding a retarder, which controlled the setting time, thus creating a viable competitor to traditional lime plaster. Because gypsum was plentiful, and available at a relatively low price, and because the manufacturing process was so simple, new firms flooded and fragmented the market, placing constant <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on prices.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{development}} of increased oil production in California had consequences. The additional California oil fields, along with booming oil supplies in Texas and Oklahoma, put <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the price.

25|$|Australia's {{dependence}} on agricultural and industrial exports meant {{it was one}} of the hardest-hit developed countries. Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> on wages. Unemployment reached a record high of 29% in 1932, with incidents of civil unrest becoming common. After 1932, an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery.|$|R

25|$|Spain's economy {{suffered}} {{upon the}} decline of the wartime economic activity. Following the end of the war, the fall in foreign demand depressed the agricultural, industrial and trade markets. With the loss of these, protective measures were demanded by workers as the <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> of prices on salaries intensified. Employers argued that the solution was to reduce product costs, lower labour costs and increase productivity, but the workers refused to accept their propositions.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income. This subsidy encourages people to buy more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on premium prices). CBO estimates the net effect is to increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. {{economy was}} {{primarily}} agricultural {{in the early}} 19th century. Westward expansion plus the building of canals {{and the introduction of}} steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama, and new grain growing areas were brought into production in the Mid West. Eventually this put severe <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on prices, particularly of cotton, first from 1820 to 1823 and again from 1840 to 1843.|$|E
50|$|Before the 14th century, popular uprisings (such as uprisings at a {{manor house}} against an {{unpleasant}} overlord), though not unknown, tended {{to operate on}} a local scale.

40|$|The current {{financial}} crisis may primarily be a banking crisis, and the solvency {{of the insurance}} sector as a whole {{does not appear to}} be threatened. Nonetheless, insurance companies have been affected, and in mostly adverse ways. For many insurers, direct exposure to the epicentre of the crisis, the US mortgage market, and to related securities appears to have been limited. But the {{financial crisis}} has nonetheless had an increasingly visible impact on the insurance industry, primarily through their investment portfolios, as the crisis spread and financial market valuations and the outlook for real activity deteriorated significantly. Also, a number of concentrated exposures to credit and market risks have been revealed, including in US mortgage and financial guarantee insurance companies, as well as in parts of certain other insurance-dominated financial groups. Thus, while insurers as a group may have cushioned rather than amplified the <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> during the financial crisis, some clearly have added to <b>downward</b> <b>pressures.</b> Financial instruments that were at the core of difficulties served an insurance function and, thus, it is not so surprising that some institutions from that sector have been affected by the crisis on one or the other side of their balance sheets. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{inability}} of the Russian government to implement a coherent set of economic reforms led to a severe erosion in investor confidence and a chain reaction that can be likened to a run on the Central Bank. Investors fled the market by selling rubles and Russian assets (such as securities), which also put <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the ruble. This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble. It is estimated that between 1 October 1997 and 17 August 1998, the Central Bank expended approximately $27billion of its U.S. dollar reserves to maintain the floating peg.|$|E
25|$|Farming is subsidised, with {{subsidies}} to farmers totalling £3.19 billion (after deduction of levies) paid in 2010. These subsidies are mostly channelled through the EU Common Agricultural Policy from member states' contributions.

25|$|The {{decision}} of the German Empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> {{on the value of}} silver; this had a knock-on effect in the USA, where much of the supply was then mined. As a result, the United States Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873, which changed the country's silver policy. Before the Act, the United States had backed its currency with both gold and silver, and it minted both types of coins. The Act moved the United States to a 'de facto' gold standard, which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or convert silver from the public into silver coins (though it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars).|$|E
50|$|Falling export {{demand and}} {{commodity}} prices placed massive <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> on wages, particularly in {{industries such as}} coal mining. Due to falling prices, bosses were unable to pay the wages that workers wanted. The result {{was a series of}} crippling strikes in many sectors of the economy in the late 1920s. Coal miners' strikes in the winter of 1929 brought much of the economy to its knees. A riot at a picket line in the Hunter Region mining town of Rothbury saw police shoot one teenage coal miner dead.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the cyclical fluctuations of price-cost margins, following an extended version of the Rotemberg and Woodford (1991) approach. The results support the hypothesis of counter-cyclical price margins in most manufacturing industries, especially {{in the presence of}} downward rigidities of labour inputs. This is consistent with a growing body of empirical literature showing that economic booms tend to increase competition or decrease the incentives for collusion, thereby creating <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> on price margins. It also offers an appealing interpretation of the otherwise puzzling pro-cyclicality of real wages. ...|$|R
40|$|Cotton {{production}} in West and Central Africa (WCA) {{has contributed to}} growth and poverty reduction. Recently, the objective of poverty alleviation has been adversely impacted by the <b>downward</b> <b>pressures</b> on world prices (exacerbated by subsidies by major cotton producers outside Africa). Several countries in WCA are undergoing reforms in the cotton sector to stimulate greater market competition and raise {{the share of the}} international price going to farmers. While these efforts would help to improve rural income irrespective of the world market situation, they would be more powerful in combination with a reduction in other countries’ subsidies in this sector. ...|$|R
25|$|However, in {{the wider}} economy, Canada was {{surprisingly}} unhurt by these events. While growth slowed, the economy never actually entered a recession. This {{was the first time}} that Canada had avoided following the United States into an economic downturn. The rate of job creation in Canada continued at the rapid pace of the 1990s. A number of explanations have been advanced to explain this. Canada was not as directly affected by 9/11 and the subsequent wars, and the <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> of these events was more muted. Canada's fiscal management during the period has been praised as the federal government continued to bring in large surpluses throughout this period, in sharp contrast to the United States. Unlike the United States no major tax cuts or major new expenditures were introduced. However, during this time, Canada did pursue an expansionary monetary policy in an effort to reduce the effects of a possible recession. Many provincial governments suffered greater problems with a number of them returning to deficits, which was blamed on the fiscal imbalance. 2003 saw elections in six Canadian provinces and in only one did the governing party not lose seats.|$|E
25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E
25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some <b>downward</b> <b>pressure</b> on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.|$|E
