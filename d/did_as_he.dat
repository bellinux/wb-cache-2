5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
5|$|Although Pytka {{fixed the}} ideas on a storyboard, he {{abandoned}} {{it as soon}} as filming began, and followed ideas based on what angles and perspectives the steadycam camera produced. One instance was the filming of the car crash, which Pytka filmed for hours from above, but realised that a steadycam shot on the ground was a much better idea. Archive footage was used by imposing it on scenes shot by Pytka, who utilised a greenscreen stage to digitally blend it into the finished film, such as Paul's Old English Sheepdog in the graveyard, and the elephant in the ballroom procession scene. The elephant was put in last, as Aspinall phoned Pytka and said that Starr liked the scene, but insisted an elephant be put in it, which Pytka later <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had already put a sitar in at the request of Harrison. Apart from the steadycam shots, Pytka used a Russian-made Akil-crane for sweeping overhead shots, such as the Abbey Road zebra crossing shot at the end, as well as a remote-controlled toy helicopter with a camera added to it for intricate aerial shots. To make it more interesting, two Blue Meanies make cameos.|$|E

He was an unused {{substitute}} in a 1–0 victory against Spain, but Fabio Capello insisted that Sturridge would play against Sweden the following Tuesday and <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> made his debut coming on as a second-half substitute for Theo Walcott. He made his second appearance against the Netherlands coming on {{in the first half}} for the injured Steven Gerrard and caused the Dutch defence problems throughout the match and earned the man of the match award for his efforts during the match.|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman did not renew his New Yorker {{contract}} after 2003. [...] He later quipped that {{he regretted}} leaving when he <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{could have left}} in protest when the magazine ran a pro-invasion of Iraq piece later in the year. [...] Spiegelman said his parting from The New Yorker {{was part of his}} general disappointment with [...] "the widespread conformism of the mass media in the Bush era". [...] He said he felt like he was in [...] "internal exile" [...] following September 11 attacks as the US media had become [...] "conservative and timid" [...] and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create. [...] Nevertheless, Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences, as had been widely reported, but because The New Yorker was not interested in doing serialized work, which he wanted to do with his next project.|$|E
500|$|The couple put {{together}} an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. [...] To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, {{but by the time}} they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. [...] Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> asked. [...] He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. [...] By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.|$|E

For the same episode, Sarah Strange and Thai-Hoa Lee {{had to learn how}} to speak Standard Tibetan phonetically a week in advance of filming. Katharine Isabelle guest starred in [...] "Nubbins" [...] as Sophie. While filming her scenes, Isabelle complained of a dry eye problem, which kept making her almost tear up. However, it ended up being beneficial for her portrayal of her character. Canadian actor Daryl Shuttleworth guest stars as a fight promoter in [...] "Warriors". During a readthrough of the script, Shuttleworth decided his character should speak with a British accent like in the film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

Much to Jephthah's dismay, his only daughter greeted him upon his triumphant return. Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had vowed, but [...] "shies away from explicitly depicting her sacrifice, which leads some ancient and modern interpreters (e.g., Radak) to suggest {{that she was not}} actually killed." ...|$|E

When he asked the Canadian Corps commander, Arthur Currie, to capture Passchendaele Ridge during the final month of the battle, Currie flatly replied [...] "It's suicidal.

2500|$|As the 1988 St. Louis Cardinals season began, Pendleton {{seemed to}} {{struggle}} {{where he had}} flourished. Despite earning 80 stolen bases in his first four seasons, he only stole three bases the whole season, and in fact went {{the rest of his}} career without stealing more than ten. Injuries also plagued him in 1988, as he missed a few weeks with a right hamstring injury, and had arthroscopic surgery in mid-September which cut his season short. Despite this, Pendleton hoped to rebound for the 1989 St. Louis Cardinals season. Rebounding was exactly what he <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> played in all 162 games for the only times in his career, finished ninth in hits with 162, and earned his second Gold Glove with an impressive [...]971 fielding percentage. Despite an impressive 1989 season, Pendleton struggled during the 1990 St. Louis Cardinals season. His overall production decline that season, as evident by his [...]230 batting average and [...]277 on-base percentage, as well as splitting time with rookie Todd Zeile {{by the end of the}} season. After the season ended, Zeile appeared to be the third baseman of the future for the Cardinals, and Pendleton became a free agent.|$|E

Fireman Charles Hendrickson claimed he told his boat mates: [...] "It's up to us to go back and pick up anyone in the water" [...] but found no support. At least three other crewmembers, as well as the Duff Gordons, Salomon and Stengel, denied hearing any suggestion to go back or opposing any proposition to do so. In the media later, the Duff Gordons in particular were widely criticised for what was interpreted as their callousness {{in the face of the}} disaster. For instance, as Titanic sank, Lucile reportedly commented to her secretary: [...] "There is your beautiful nightdress gone." [...] Fireman Pusey replied that she shouldn't worry about losing her belongings because she could buy more. Pusey mentioned that the crew had lost all their kit and that their pay stopped from the moment of the sinking. Sir Cosmo responded: [...] "Very well, I will give you a fiver each to start a new kit!"

2500|$|Santa Anna's army marched toward Mexico City, winning small {{victories}} {{along the}} way. [...] Iturbide gathered and sent troops to combat Santa Anna, {{but the effort}} was not very strong. [...] Many of the military leaders that Iturbide appointed later turned on him upon contacting Santa Anna's forces. Iturbide later admitted {{he had made a}} mistake by not leading his armies himself. Iturbide recognized that, although his provisional Junta was working to call a new Congress, such a process would take too long, and all of the nation had accepted the Plan de la Casa Mata. Recognizing the wishes of the country, Iturbide <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> promised and personally reopened the same congress he closed in March 1823 to present his abdication to this body. This measure surprised the congress, as none of the rebellions had made a point out of demanding Iturbide's abdication. He later wrote that he was choosing abdication over bloody civil war. However, congress refused to accept it, arguing that such would imply that the existence of the throne was legitimate. [...] Instead they nullified their own election of Iturbide as emperor and refused to acknowledge the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba. This was recognized by some members of the Congress as very irregular. The Congress' powers flowed from Iturbide's naming of the Congress. By nullifying Iguala and Córdoba, the Congress nullified its own legitimacy. However, these inconsistencies within the mandate were brushed aside. [...] Leadership of the country was passed on to what was called the [...] "triumvirate," [...] made up of generals Guadalupe Victoria, Nicolás Bravo and Pedro Celestino Negrete.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the growing}} {{collective}} of organizers, {{differences of opinion}} and direction arose concerning the planned public event. VVAW leaders felt {{it should be an}} all-veteran event, to maintain its credibility. Less than three months into planning for the Winter Soldier Investigation, most of the Vietnam veteran organizers and Jeremy Rifkin had become adamant that WSI disassociate itself from Mark Lane. CCI staffers criticized Lane as being arrogant and sensationalistic, and said the book he was writing had [...] "shoddy reporting in it." [...] The CCI leaders refused to work with Lane further and gave the VVAW leaders a [...] "Lane or us" [...] ultimatum. VVAW did not want to lose the monetary support of Lane and Fonda, so the CCI split from the project. The following month, after caustic reviews of Lane's book by authors and a Vietnam expert, VVAW would also distance itself from Lane just one month before the event. [...] Lane had recently published a book, Conversations with Americans, in which Lane relied on unverified interviews with thirty three servicemen, four of whom were later exposed as unreliable by Neil Sheehan in a New York Times book review. Leaders of VVAW feared involvement with Lane would tarnish the credibility of the WSI. [...] A new steering committee was created without Lane, but he was allowed to continue with fundraising events and was available for legal counsel. [...] The new six-member steering committee for WSI was composed of three national office leaders (Al Hubbard, Craig Scott Moore, and Mike Oliver) and three members of the growing list of chapters (Art Flesch, Tim Butz, and William F. Crandell). Organizers hoped Lane would keep a low profile during the event, and he <b>did,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spent his time flying around the country defending his book. [...] Ultimately, the WSI was an event produced by veterans only, without the need of [...] "so-called experts" [...] such as Lane and Fonda.|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, art {{historian}} Manuel Bartolomé Cossío, who regarded El Greco's style {{as a response}} to Spanish mystics, published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works. In this book, El Greco is described as the founder of the Spanish School and as the conveyor of the Spanish soul. Julius Meier-Graefe, a scholar of French Impressionism, travelled in Spain in 1908 and wrote down his experiences in The Spanische Reise, the first book which established El Greco as a great painter of the past. In El Greco's work, Meier-Graefe found foreshadowings of modernity. To the Der Blaue Reiter group in Munich in 1912, El Greco typified that mystical inner construction that it was the task of their generation to rediscover. To the English artist and critic Roger Fry in 1920, El Greco was the archetypal genius who <b>did</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thought best [...] "with complete indifference to what effect the right expression might have on the public". Fry described El Greco as [...] "an old master who is not merely modern, but actually appears a good many steps ahead of us, turning back to show us the way". At the same period, some other researchers developed certain disputed theories. Doctors August Goldschmidt and Germán Beritens argued that El Greco painted such elongated human figures because he had vision problems (possibly progressive astigmatism or strabismus) that made him see bodies longer than they were, and at an angle to the perpendicular. This theory enjoyed surprising popularity {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century and was opposed by the German psychologist David Kuntz. Whether or not El Greco had progressive astigmatism is still open to debate. Stuart Anstis, Professor at the University of California (Department of Psychology) concludes that [...] "even if El Greco were astigmatic, he would have adapted to it, and his figures, whether drawn from memory or life, would have had normal proportions. His elongations were an artistic expression, not a visual symptom." [...] According to Professor of Spanish John Armstrong Crow, [...] "astigmatism could never give quality to a canvas, nor talent to a dunce". The English writer W. Somerset Maugham attributed El Greco's personal style a [...] "latent homosexuality" [...] which he claimed the artist might have had; the doctor Arturo Perera attributed El Greco's style to the use of cannabis.|$|E
