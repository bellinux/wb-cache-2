The communications device comprises a transmitter configured to transmit signals representing data to an <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> of a mobile communications network via a first wireless access interface, a receiver configured to receive signals from the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> of the mobile communications network via the first wireless access interface, and a controller. The controller controls the transmitter and the receiver to transmit data to the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> in accordance with a synchronous process in which a synchronized response is received from the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment,</b> or to receive data from the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> in accordance with a synchronous process in which a synchronized response is transmitted to the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment.</b> The controller is configured {{in combination with the}} transmitter and the receiver to transmit signals via a second wireless access interface to a communications apparatus operating as a relay node, the signals being for transmission to the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> by the communications apparatus as if the signals were transmitted by the communications device via the first wireless communications interface, to receive signals from the infrastructure via the first wireless access interface, to determine an additional delay caused by the transmission of the signals to the communications apparatus acting as the relay node via the second wireless access interface compared with a time taken which would have been taken to transmit the signals to the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> as if transmitted via the first wireless access interface, and to transmit to the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> an indication from which the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>equipment</b> can derive the determined additional delay for adjusting the transmission or reception of the synchronized response.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] A Wireless ad hoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of autonomous mobile nodes that communicate with each other over wireless links without any <b>fixed</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The nodes use the service of other nodes in the network to transmit packets to destinations that are out of their range. Such networks are expected to play increasingly important role in future organizations, University, Civilian and Military settings, being useful for providing communication support where no <b>fixed</b> <b>infrastructure</b> exists. Also, in case of disaster or natural calamities, the deployment of a <b>fixed</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is neither feasible nor economically profitable for establishing communication among the rescue members. In order to accomplish this, a number of ad-hoc routing protocols have been proposed and implemented, which include dynamic source routing (DSR) and Destination sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) routing protocols. In this paper for experimental evaluation purposes, we have considered 500 m x 500 m, terrain area which illustrates the performance in terms of the packet delivery fraction and throughput for DSR and DSDV routing protocols. Our simulation results using NS- 2 shows that DS...|$|R
