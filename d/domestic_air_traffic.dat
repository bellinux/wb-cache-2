Total <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> {{was expected to be}} halved from 2006 to 2008, and actually fell from 8.6 to 4.9million. In June 2012, officials announced the discontinuation of the last remaining commercial flight between Taipei and Kaohsiung. The share for conventional rail between Taipei and Kaohsiung fell from 9.71% in 2006 to 2.5% in 2008, while high-speed rail became the most common mode of transport at 50% of all trips by 2008. The opening of THSR led to a 10% reduction of traffic on the parallel expressway in 2007. Despite cheaper ticket prices, long-distance bus companies reported that passenger volumes had fallen by 20 to 30 percent by 2008.|$|E

25|$|Community and {{business}} leaders in Edinburgh have voiced support {{for the construction of}} a high-speed rail link between Glasgow and Edinburgh to reduce current journey times between Scotland's two main cities. Currently First ScotRail operate a shuttle service, every 15 minutes between 7am and 7pm, between the two cities on the Glasgow to Edinburgh (via Falkirk High) line, with journeys taking around 50 minutes. It is estimated that a high-speed maglev system would halve the journey time between the two cities. The UK Government has also conducted a feasibility study into ascertaining whether a high-speed Maglev network between Edinburgh and London would be economically beneficial and thus cutting down on the growth of <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> between the two cities. Such a system would, however require a complete new infrastructure as it is not compatible with the existing rail infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of four essays that address important gaps in passenger- and cargo-airline research. Seminal studies in airline economics that rely on cross-section methods make critical homogeneity assumptions and preclude time-specific effects. The essays in this thesis use panel data, which allow for certain assumptions made by cross-sectional studies to be relaxed, while shedding light on the intertemporal features of air transport. The first chapter investigates the cost structure of air cargo carriers by applying a total cost model used in passenger-airline studies. Using quarterly panel data (2003 - 2011) on the domestic operations and costs of FedEx Express and UPS Airlines, empirical {{results indicate that the}} air cargo industry exhibits increasing returns to traffic density and constant returns to scale. Accounting for carrier-specific differences in cost structure and network size, FedEx is found to be more cost efficient than UPS (a finding that is reversed when network size is not controlled). Individually, UPS exhibits substantial economies of density and constant returns to scale while FedEx's cost structure is characterized by weak economies of density and constant returns to scale. Both carriers exhibit economies of size. The next three chapters embody papers that use quarterly panel data of city-level <b>air</b> <b>traffic,</b> airline delay, and socioeconomic variables. Spanning 10 years (2003 - 2012), the panel structure of the data permits the use of fixed effects to control for city-specific heterogeneity. The second chapter presents a paper prepared for the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP). The study demonstrates the within-city traffic impacts of urban size, employment composition, and wages, providing new insights into the determinants of passenger and <b>air</b> cargo <b>traffic.</b> The essay also confirms that airport traffic is proportional to population, and that service-sector employment and higher wages induce passenger travel and goods movement. A city's share of manufacturing employment, however, only impacts <b>air</b> cargo <b>traffic.</b> Passenger enplanements exhibit more sensitivity to the proportion of urban workers providing non-tradable services, compared to the share of workers in tradable service jobs. The third chapter, co-authored with Andre Tok, examines the determinants of <b>air</b> cargo <b>traffic</b> in California. The study uses a shorter 7 -year panel (2003 - 2009), and shows that service and manufacturing employment impact the volume of outbound <b>air</b> cargo. Total (<b>domestic)</b> <b>air</b> cargo <b>traffic</b> is found to grow faster than (proportionally to) population, while wages {{play a significant role in}} determining both total and <b>domestic</b> <b>air</b> cargo movement. Metro-level air cargo tonnage are also forecasted for the years 2010 - 2040, indicating that California's total (<b>domestic)</b> <b>air</b> cargo <b>traffic</b> will increase at an average rate of 5. 9 percent (4. 4 percent) per year in that period. The final chapter is co-authored with Volodymyr Bilotkach, and it provides the first evidence on the impact of airline delays on urban-sectoral employment. Controlling for unobserved city-specific differences, the empirical estimates of the effects of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> on total employment are comparable to previously reported measures. However, service-sector employment is found to be less sensitive to <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> than other studies suggested. New evidence confirming that delays have a negative impact on employment is also provided, a finding that is robust to various model specifications...|$|R

The study showed that the market is still characterised by regular market entries and exits. Also that the entry of the low-cost carriers has stimulated the market, resulting in increased <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> movements, higher passenger numbers, higher load factors in general and the opening of a secondary airport in Gauteng, Lanseria International.
