40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} explore micro-beam {{relaxation}} dynamics of MEMS, the beam deflection relaxation expression considering air slide-film damping effect was educed based on Euler–Bernoulli equation with boundary conditions of two <b>hinged</b> <b>ends.</b> The beam deflection relaxation process under over damping, critical damping and under damping was calculated used Maple. The relaxation simulation data of micro-beam with two <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> used ANSYS demonstrate that relaxation process conform to theoretical calculation and relaxation period of under-damping relaxation approximate constant when damping coefficient is small, but increase significantly when damping coefficient is large...|$|R
50|$|Consider as {{a simple}} example a rigid beam of length L, <b>hinged</b> in one <b>end</b> and free in the other, and having an angular spring {{attached}} to the <b>hinged</b> <b>end.</b> The beam is loaded in the free end by a force F acting in the compressive axial direction of the beam, see the figure to the right.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic paper mussel has {{a pair of}} fragile, elongated, oval valves. The {{shell is}} {{narrower}} at the anterior, <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> and the umbones are prominent. The outer surface of the valves is a greenish-yellow colour, often with irregular rust-coloured zigzag markings. The interior is glistening white.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a {{swinging}} door that is {{stopped by a}} doorstop placed 2/3 of {{the width of the}} door will do the job with minimal shaking of the door because the <b>hinged</b> <b>end</b> is subjected to no net reactive force. (This point is also the node in the second vibrational harmonic, which also minimizes vibration.) ...|$|R
40|$|Timoshenko beam {{equations}} {{with external}} damping and internal damping terms and forcing terms are investigated, and boundary conditions (end conditions) {{to be considered}} are <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> (pinned ends), hinged-sliding ends, and sliding ends. Unboundedness of solutions of boundary value problems for Timoshenko beam equations is studied, and it is shown that {{the magnitude of the}} displacement of the beam grows up to ∞ as under some assumptions on the forcing term. Our approach is to reduce the multidimensional problems to one-dimensional problems for fourth-order ordinary differential inequalities...|$|R
50|$|Firstly, we {{will put}} {{attention}} to the fact there are no reactions in the <b>hinged</b> <b>ends,</b> so we also have no shear force in any cross-section of the column. The reason for no reactions can be obtained from symmetry (so the reactions should be in the same direction) and from moment equilibrium (so the reactions should be in opposite directions).|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{published}} in Duke Math. J. 1993, Y. Wen studied a second-order parabolic equation for inextensible elastic closed curves in R^ 2 toward inextensible elasticae. In this article, we extend Wen's result {{to the case}} of open inextensible planar curves with <b>hinged</b> <b>ends.</b> We obtain the long time existence of smooth solutions when the initial curves fulfill certain regular conditions...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we study}} the {{evolution}} of open inextensible planar curves with <b>hinged</b> <b>ends.</b> We obtain long time existence of C∞-smooth solutions during the evolution, given the initial curves that are only C 2 -smooth with vanishing curvature at the boundary. Moreover, the asymptotic limits of this flow are inextensible elasticae. Our method and result extend the work by Wen (Duke Math. J. 70 (3) : 683 – 698, 1993) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} new existence {{results for}} multiple positive solutions of fourth-order nonlinear equations which model deflections of an elastic beam. We consider the widely studied boundary conditions corresponding to clamped and <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> and many non-local boundary conditions, with a unified approach. Our {{method is to}} show that each boundary-value problem can be written as the same type of perturbed integral equation, in the space C[0, 1], involving a linear functional α[u] but, although we seek positive solutions, the functional is not assumed to be positive for all positive u. The results are new even for the classic boundary conditions of clamped or <b>hinged</b> <b>ends</b> when α[u]= 0, because we obtain sharp results for the existence of one positive solution; for multiple solutions we seek optimal values of some of the constants that occur in the theory, which allows us to impose weaker assumptions on the nonlinear term than in previous works. Our non-local boundary conditions contain multi-point problems as special cases and, {{for the first time in}} fourth-order problems, we allow coefficients of both signs...|$|R
