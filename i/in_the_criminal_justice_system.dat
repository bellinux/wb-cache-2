25|$|Human rights {{organizers}} in United States face particular challenges due to {{the role}} of the U.S. in the world and to the U.S. failure to ratify most major international human rights treaties. However, in the 2000s, more U.S.-based activists have been working to raise international awareness of U.S. human rights violations, including racial discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> economic human rights violations, and the rights of children.|$|E
25|$|Children’s {{rights law}} {{is defined as}} the point where the law intersects with a child's life.

25|$|Black feminist {{criminology}} is {{the solution}} to this problem. It takes four factors into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture. Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most Muslim-majority {{countries}} incorporate sharia at {{some level}} in their legal framework, with many calling it the highest law or the source of {{law of the land}} in their constitution. Most use sharia for personal law (marriage, divorce, domestic violence, child support, family law, inheritance and such matters). Elements of sharia are present, to varying extents, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> of many Muslim-majority countries. Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Brunei, Qatar, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan and Mauritania apply the code predominantly or entirely while it applies in some parts of Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|The perp walk arose {{incidentally}} {{from the}} need to transport a defendant from a police station to court after arrest, and the general prohibition of prior restraint under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. Law enforcement agencies often coordinate with the media in scheduling and arranging them. It has been criticized {{as a form of}} public humiliation that violates a defendant's right to privacy and is prejudicial to the presumption of innocence, but is defended as promoting transparency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system.</b> American courts have permitted it {{on the grounds that it}} arises from the limitations and necessity of police procedure, but have also limited it only to those times when it is actually necessary.|$|E
25|$|Sanders rose to {{national}} prominence after his 2010 filibuster against the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2010, which extended the Bush {{tax cuts that}} favored the wealthiest Americans. He has built {{a reputation as a}} leading progressive voice on issues such as campaign finance reform, corporate welfare, global warming, income inequality, LGBT rights, parental leave, and universal healthcare. Sanders has long been critical of U.S. foreign policy and was an early and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War, the First Gulf War, and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua. He is also outspoken on civil liberties and civil rights, criticizing racial discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> as well as advocating for privacy rights against mass surveillance policies such as the USA Patriot Act and the NSA surveillance programs.|$|E

25|$|When Cardenas {{learned of}} his wife's predicament, he {{recommended}} that she retain Charles Garry, a criminal attorney who had {{gained a reputation}} in Soledad State Penitentiary as the ardent defender of George Jackson, Huey P. Newton, and Bobby Seale. At the same time, news of the case reached the San Francisco Bay Area, where the women's rights and Chicano movements were at their apex. García began speaking to women's groups in the area, and the Inez Garcia Defense Committee raised money for the defense and publicized the case, hoping to put gender inequalities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system,</b> rather than Garcia herself, on trial. Through her contact with feminist groups, Garcia transformed from the timid, submissive victim who was too ashamed to even admit {{what had happened to}} her into an outspoken critic of patriarchy, even when she saw it in her own judge, who she accused of prejudice and sexism. During the trial, Garry had argued that García had acted with diminished capacity. He based this argument on expert psychological testimony that rape causes mental trauma and García's own history of mental instability. The defense disappointed feminists who preferred to see García as a symbol of strength and resistance to male domination. It also failed to win the sympathy of the jury. García was convicted of second-degree murder, sentenced, and spent two years in the California Institution for Women before her appeal was heard.|$|E

Western-based human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have criticized the activities of both the Mabahith and the Mutawa, {{as well as a}} number of other aspects of human rights in Saudi Arabia.

500|$|Dalrymple {{analyses}} {{the poet}} Sylvia Plath, whom {{he describes as}} the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization", and interprets Margaret Drabble's descriptions of Plath as a [...] "willing casualty" [...] and [...] "supremely vulnerable" [...] to mean [...] "virtues of a high order". He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem [...] "Daddy" [...] with Nazism and makes allusions to the holocaust. Dalrymple writes that [...] "Plath felt it right to allude {{to one of the}} worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German…the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity [...] "was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy", and that [...] "the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace." [...] He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges [...] "make bogus claims to victim status" [...] and whose stories reveal perfectly [...] "the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing victimhood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> <b>system</b> and concludes, [...] "For the sentimentalist, of course, {{there is no such thing}} as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down".|$|E
