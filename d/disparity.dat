In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles, and limited air capability. Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions. In January 1978, Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province.

40|$|Abstract Introduction The 2010 Census {{revealed}} {{the population of}} Latino and Asian children grew by 5. 5 million, while the population of white children declined by 4. 3 million from 2000 - 2010, and minority children will outnumber white children by 2020. No prior analyses, however, have examined time trends in racial/ethnic <b>disparities</b> in children’s health and healthcare. The study objectives were to identify racial/ethnic <b>disparities</b> in medical and oral health, access to care, and use of services in US children, and determine whether these <b>disparities</b> have changed over time. Methods The 2003 and 2007 National Surveys of Children’s Health were nationally representative telephone surveys of parents of 193, 995 children 0 - 17 years old (N[*]=[*] 102, 353 in 2003 and N[*]=[*] 91, 642 in 2007). Thirty-four <b>disparities</b> indicators were examined for white, African-American, Latino, Asian/Pacific-Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and multiracial children. Multivariable analyses were performed to adjust for nine relevant covariates, and Z-scores to examine time trends. Results Eighteen <b>disparities</b> occurred in 2007 for ≥ 1 minority group. The number of indicators for which at least one racial/ethnic group experienced <b>disparities</b> did not significantly change between 2003 - 2007, nor did {{the total number of}} specific <b>disparities</b> (46 in 2007). The <b>disparities</b> for one subcategory (use of services), however, did decrease (by 82 %). Although 15 <b>disparities</b> decreased over time, two worsened, and 10 new <b>disparities</b> arose. Conclusions Minority children continue to experience multiple <b>disparities</b> in medical and oral health and healthcare. Most <b>disparities</b> persisted over time. Although <b>disparities</b> in use of services decreased, 10 new <b>disparities</b> arose in 2007. Study findings suggest that urgent policy solutions are needed to eliminate these <b>disparities,</b> including collecting racial/ethnic and language data on all patients, monitoring and publicly disclosing <b>disparities</b> data annually, providing health-insurance coverage and medical and dental homes for all children, making <b>disparities</b> part of the national healthcare quality discussion, ensuring all children receive needed pediatric specialty care, and more research and innovative solutions. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{deepening}} {{of regional}} <b>disparities</b> {{is an issue}} of increasing importance that has been systematically emphasized in the EU policy, especially since the process of “Eastern Integration” has started. The paper focuses on the Visegrad Group countries whose regions are less developed in the EU context. The aim of the research is to assess the development of <b>disparities</b> in regional economic performance of the Visegrad Group countries, to identify how the factors of economic growth determine these <b>disparities,</b> and partly to assess whether the integration of the Visegrad Group countries into the EU influenced the development of regional <b>disparities</b> in these countries. For the analysis of <b>disparities</b> during 2000 – 2013 we selected an approach of measuring real convergence (sigma-convergence). <b>Disparities</b> were measured {{in the context of a}} breakdown of the GDP per capita into sub-components, reflecting on the development of <b>disparities</b> in productivity and employment. The results show that, although regions of the Visegrad Group countries converged towards the EU average and also in terms of the Visegrad Group as a whole, regional <b>disparities</b> within countries rather increased. This led to a paradox where, although the objective of reducing regional <b>disparities</b> across the EU was satisfied, from a national perspective <b>disparities</b> increased. The Labour productivity factor, with its dominant yet steadily growing contribution, is the main determinant of <b>disparities</b> in the performance of the Visegrad Group regions. Other sources of <b>disparities</b> are characterized by a stable development or convergence. Only Polish regions deviated from the general conclusions, since the extent of <b>disparities</b> among them grew constantly, and the nature of <b>disparities</b> was the Labour participation rate. In terms of the impact caused by accession into the EU, the measured changes were rather minor and the identified trends had mostly been in place before the Visegrad Group countries entered the EU...|$|R
