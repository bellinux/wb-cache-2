5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, <b>infectious</b> <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to <b>infectious</b> <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{infection}} with <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> virus {{has been studied}} {{in a series of}} 49 dogs. The pattern of response to infection was distinctly modified by the immune status of the animal. All of 19 fully susceptible dogs had an acute, fulminating fatal hepatitis when infected with a standard dose of virus, and all of 19 dogs with high levels of immunity to the virus survived without apparent illness. However, 11 dogs were spontaneously encountered with partial immunity to the infectious agent, and these animals developed different, prolonged forms of hepatitis following infection. In four animals death occurred in 8 - 21 days following what may be called a subacute course. The remaining seven dogs survived up to 8 months with evidence of chronic hepatic damage. The subacute and chronic forms of hepatitis were reproduced experimentally in seven of eight fully susceptible dogs which were passively immunized against the <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> virus by administration of hyperimmune serum. Although the virus could be found in sites of hepatic damage {{in the early stages of}} the subacute and chronic diseases, it could not be demonstrated in the later stages which were characterized by persistent hepatic damage and a marked chronic inflammatory reaction. Dogs with chronic hepatitis eventually developed extensive hepatic fibrosis. The pathologic, physiologic, virologic, and immunologic features of these experimental forms of viral hepatitis are described...|$|R

The discovery of a viral etiology in <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> will promote the development of specific drugs and vaccines {{for the treatment of}} idiopathic hepatitis in dogs. The objective of this study was the application of the sequence-independent Virus Discovery cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (VIDISCA) technique combined with high through-put sequencing on a Roche- 454 sequencer to identify unknown viruses. Liver tissue of a dog with idiopathic acute hepatitis was cultured on a canine liver cell line and the cell culture medium was submitted to the VIDISCA- 454 technique. Without prior knowledge of the viral species involved, this technique identified Canine adenoyirus type 1 (CAV- 1) as the infecting agent. This demonstrates the power of VIDISCA- 454 to identify viruses, independent of preliminary information about the genomic sequence. Consequently, the strategy of propagation in this cell line followed by the VIDISCA- 454 technique is valuable to identify the viral etiology of idiopathic hepatitis in dogs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

500|$|Viral {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include rabies, canine distemper, canine parvovirus, <b>infectious</b> <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> papillomatosis, and canine coronavirus.

Infected wolves do not show any fear of humans, with most documented wolf attacks on people being attributed to rabid animals. Although canine distemper is lethal in dogs, {{it has not been}} recorded to kill wolves, except in Canada and Alaska. The canine parvovirus, which causes death by dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and endotoxic shock or sepsis, is largely survivable in wolves, but can be lethal to pups.

40|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} (AIH) is not {{a disease}} entity restricted to man, {{but it can be}} found in other animals including canines. An increasing number of studies have focused on the immunopathogenesis of human autoimmune hepatitis (hAIH), but little is known of what triggers <b>canine</b> autoimmune <b>hepatitis</b> (cAIH). Several drugs, toxins, microbial and viral agents are able to induce autoantibodies and indeed immune-mediated chronic <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with immunological and serological features similar of those seen in the human disease. We discuss the features of cAIH paying attention to the autoantibody profile of the disease in comparison to that seen in hAIH. We also discuss the immunomodulatory role of specific molecular signaling pathways such as those mediated by tumor growth factor and p 38 mitogen-activated kinase in the induction of AIH, and the potential of these molecules to act as targets of specialized immunotherapeutic interventions. Review of the literature indicates that we have more to learn for the delineation of autoantibody profile and the antigen-specific immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of cAIH from the human disease, {{rather than the other way}} around. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Italia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{reports for}} the first time {{molecular}} detection of Anaplasma platys infection in 4 (13. 3 %) of 30 Malaysian dogs investigated. A low occurrence (3. 3 %) of Babesia gibsoni was also noted, being detected in one of the 30 dogs. Rickettsia, Bartonella, Orientia tsutsugamushi, and Ehrlichia DNA were not detected in the dog blood samples. The role of A. platys as an agent of canine anaplasmosis and its transmission through Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks merits further investigation. Anaplasma platys (formerly Ehrlichia platys) is an obligate intracellular bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae which causes <b>infectious</b> <b>canine</b> cyclic thrombocytopenia (ICCT) in dogs. The organism was first reported in 1978 in Florida (Harvey et al., 1978).

40|$|Anaplasma platys is a tick-borne {{pathogen}} {{causing the}} <b>Infectious</b> <b>Canine</b> Cyclic Thrombocytopenia.

The present paper reports 3 cases of infection by A. platys occurring in dogs native to Central Italy, considered a non-endemic area to date. Infections were initially diagnosed based on clinical data and observation of morulae within platelets and then confirmed by biomolecular techniques. Moreover, two dogs showed an immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, as yet not described in literature in association with A. platys infection.

40|$|All human, simian, bovine and avian {{adenovirus}} types tested {{so far and}} the <b>canine</b> <b>hepatitis</b> virus induce interferon {{production in}} chick cells. This finding indicated this property to be characteristic for viruses belonging to the adenovirus group.

T antigen and interferon were formed simultaneously in chick embryo fibroblast cells infected with human adenovirus type 12, and therefore the adenovirus-specific T antigen was resistant to the action of endogenous interferon synthetized by the same cells. In chicks inoculated with human types, the appearance of interferon was biphasic: an 'early' and a 'late' interferon could be demonstrated with maximum titre 4 and 10 hr, respectively, after virus infection. In chicks infected with adenoviruses, first interferon production and then a decreased primary immune response to sheep red blood cells was observed. It was assumed that in adenovirus-infected chicks the interferon produced by viral stimulus resulted in a transient immunosuppression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background It {{is known}} that Anaplasma (A.) platys, the causative agent of <b>infectious</b> <b>canine</b> cyclic thrombocytopenia, is endemic in {{countries}} of the Mediterranean basin. However, few reports {{are available from the}} Balkans. This case report describes a dog, which was imported from Croatia to Germany in May 2010. One month later the dog was presented to a local veterinarian in Germany due to intermittent/recurrent diarrhoea. Diagnostic tests were performed to identify infections caused by Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon canis, Babesia spp., Leishmania spp., Borrelia burgdorferi and/or Dirofilaria immitis. Findings Haematological examination of a blood smear revealed basophilic inclusions in thrombocytes, which were confirmed as A. platys with a species-specific real-time PCR. Additionally, an infection with Babesia (B.) vogeli was also detected (PCR and serology). No specific antibodies against Anaplasma antigen were detectable. Although the dog showed no specific clinical signs, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were observed. Sequencing of a 1, 348 -bp partial ribosomal RNA gene revealed highest homology to A. platys sequences from Thailand, Japan and France. Conclusions A. platys was detected for first time in a dog imported from Croatia. As the dog was also co-infected by B. vogeli, unique serological and haematological findings were recorded. Thrombocytopenia, anaemia and elevated values of C-reactive protein were the laboratory test abnormalities observed in this case. A. platys infections should be considered in dogs coming from Croatia and adjacent regions. </p...|$|R
