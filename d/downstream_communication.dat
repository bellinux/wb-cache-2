The methodology spans digital modem design from the link level to the gate level.

5000|$|With {{commonly}} deployed ADSL over POTS (Annex A), {{the band}} from 26.075 kHz to 137.825 kHz {{is used for}} upstream communication, while 138-1104 kHz is used for <b>downstream</b> <b>communication.</b> Under the usual DMT scheme, each of these is further divided into smaller frequency channels of 4.3125 kHz. These frequency channels are sometimes termed bins. During initial training to optimize transmission quality and speed, the ADSL modem tests each of the bins to determine the signal-to-noise ratio at each bin's frequency. Distance from the telephone exchange, cable characteristics, interference from AM radio stations, and local interference and electrical noise at the modem's location can adversely affect the signal-to-noise ratio at particular frequencies. Bins for frequencies exhibiting a reduced signal-to-noise ratio will be used at a lower throughput rate or not at all; this reduces the maximum link capacity but allows the modem to maintain an adequate connection. The DSL modem will make a plan on how to exploit each of the bins, sometimes termed [...] "bits per bin" [...] allocation. Those bins that have a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will be chosen to transmit signals chosen from {{a greater number of}} possible encoded values (this range of possibilities equating to more bits of data sent) in each main clock cycle. The number of possibilities must not be so large that the receiver might incorrectly decode which one was intended in the presence of noise. Noisy bins may only be required to carry as few as two bits, a choice from only one of four possible patterns, or only one bit per bin in the case of ADSL2+, and very noisy bins are not used at all. If the pattern of noise versus frequencies heard in the bins changes, the DSL modem can alter the bits-per-bin allocations, in a process called [...] "bitswap", where bins that have become more noisy are only required to carry fewer bits and other channels will be chosen to be given a higher burden.|$|E

40|$|Parallel and {{distributed}} computing systems {{become more and}} more powerful and hence place increasingly higher demands on the networks that interconnect their processors or processing nodes. Many of the applications running on such systems, especially embedded systems applications, have real-time requirements and, with increasing application demands, high-performance networks are the hearts of these systems. Fiber-optic networks are good candidates for use in such systems in the future. This thesis contributes to the relatively unexplored area of fiber-optic networks for parallel {{and distributed}} real-time computer systems and suggests and evaluates several fiber-optic networks and protocols. Two different technologies are used in the networks, WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) and fiber-ribbon point-to-point links. WDM offers multiple channels, each with a capacity of several Gbit/s. A WDM star network in which protocols and services are efficiently integrated to support different kinds of real-time demands, especially hard ones, has been developed. The star-of-stars topology can be chosen to offer better network scalability. The WDM star architecture is attractive but its future success depends on components becoming more commercially mature. Fiber-ribbon links, offering instead an aggregated bandwidth of several Gbit/s, have already reached the market with a promising price/performance ratio. This has motivated the development and investigation of two new ring networks based on fiber-ribbon links. The networks take advantage of spatial bandwidth reuse, which can greatly enhance performance in applications with a significant amount of nearest <b>downstream</b> neighbor <b>communication.</b> One of the ring networks is control channel based and not only has support for real-time services like the WDM star network but also low level support for, e. g., group communication. The approach has been to develop network protocols with support for dynamic real-time services, out of time-deterministic static TDMA systems. The focus has been on functionality more than pure performance figures, mostly on real-time features but also on other types of functionality for parallel and distributed systems. Worst-case analyses, some simulations, and case studies are reported for the networks. The focus has been on embedded supercomputer applications, where each node itself can be a parallel computer, and it is shown that the networks are well suited for use in the radar signal processing systems studied.

The Kano methodology was used to evaluate opportunities based on implementation requirements in each enterprise. Findings – FSC enterprises implement a GTS to meet legal food traceability requirements. This incentive is stronger among enterprises upstream in the FSC than among downstream enterprises. <b>Downstream</b> enterprises emphasize <b>communication</b> with the end consumer as an incentive to implement a GTS. Implementing a GTS increases the opportunity to preserve end consumer confidence, efficiency in information sharing, reduces time in inventory management and the risk of theft.

For these reasons, irrigation is being pressed in an increasing way to improve water use efficiency, release more water to industrial and urban users and to pay the same price for this scarce natural resource. Agriculture must be prepared for this increasing competition, developing intelligent management and operation of the irrigation systems. For technical and financial reasons, large brut water conveyance and delivery systems are usually in canal. Above 90 % of the irrigation canals {{in the world are}} local upstream controlled. With this control strategy, canals can be sized to convey the maximum uniform steady. This simplifies both the design (constant cross section along the canal) as control system requirements. Local upstream canal control is particularly effective when associated with programmed water delivery methods. However, this method has disadvantages when combined with water flexible delivery methods, because pool water storage must change opposite to its natural tendency. Upstream controlled canals performance can be improved, saving water and labor in the canal operation and improving the water delivery service quality, using three ways, that can be used or not simultaneously – automatic canal control, SCADA systems and buffer reservoirs. With the digital canal control, the controllers can be programmed, for example, with the local upstream control, activated in situations of scarcity of water, when it is important to implement rigid water delivery rules, and, at the same time, programmed with the distant downstream control, that maintains the same canal hydrodynamics, but guarantees the total automation of the canals, producing important water savings in connection with flexible water delivery rules. The communication will present these automatic canal control approaches and their advantages. Upstream control always needs manual flow control at all canal intakes and offtakes, what requires a lot of manpower. A Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system can be installed to enable remote manual control of flows. SCADA systems can complement the automatic control of the canals. Anyway, considering the hydraulic system visualization possibility in real time, SCADA are, always, important water management tools, permitting {{to improve the quality of}} the water delivery, saving labor, time and energy in the canal operation.

Buffer reservoirs can reduce water losses, storing the excess water that arrives from upstream canal when the offtakes begin to close, and improve the system’s ability to satisfy the expected and unexpected water demands at <b>downstream.</b> The <b>communication</b> will present the definition, purposes, types and sizing of these reservoirs...|$|R

In this paper {{we argue that}} REACh {{is nothing less than}} a paradigm shift in the regulatory approach of the EU. Generally speaking, REACh places all major responsibilities with firms rather than on administrative bodies. At the same time, this policy is far from undemanding: companies marketing substances falling under REACh must ensure that along the production chain dangers to health and environment will be mastered throughout all intermediate and final users of the substance or the product containing the substance. In other words, producers of REACh chemicals must start <b>downstream</b> information and <b>communication</b> processes along the entire production chain to meet the requirements of the directive, which is stipulating both gathering the risk-related information and implementing appropriate risk-reduction measures. This paper aims to identify the major changes in the policy approach induced by REACh, and the type of behavioural model necessary to give a well-founded prognosis. In this paper we describe briefly responsive regulation as the new underlying paradigm of regulation as opposed to hierarchical regulation. From there we proceed to analyse the concept of self-responsibility in this context, and suggest adopting an agent-specific approach. In order to form expectations about the possible outcome of such regulation, behavioural models need to be well-defined for a systematic analysis of in-centives imposed by REACh.

Although much research has been devoted to improving upstream (CRFID to RFID reader) communication rates, the opposite direction has so far been neglected, presumably due to the difficulty of guaranteeing fast and error-free transfer amidst frequent power interruptions of CRFID. With growing interest in the market where CRFIDs are forever-embedded in many structures, it is necessary for this void to be filled. Therefore, we propose Wisent-a robust <b>downstream</b> <b>communication</b> protocol for CRFIDs that operates on top of the legacy UHF RFID communication protocol: EPC C 1 G 2.

30|$|The {{drilling}} {{efficiency of the}} drilling operation is seriously affected by the man-made control of the opening and braking of the ground mud pump, and there are uncertainties such as man-made error of control time and artificial judgment. This is the main obstacle to improve the speed of information transmission. A computer-controlled bypass valve is installed at a suitable location {{on the ground or}} in the well, bypassing a portion of the slurry that is involved in the normal circulation to cause a change in the down hole pressure. Down hole information can be transmitted by changing the down hole pressure, and the downward change of pressure can be realized. Moreover, computer control has a great advantage in terms of time accuracy and signal frequency. The control mechanism of computer-controlled <b>downstream</b> <b>communication</b> is still negative pulse of mud as the information carrier. The generation of mud negative pulse is no longer controlled by the operator, but the computer-controlled switch device is added to the ground to control the effective flow into the bottom mud. When the mud flow {{into the bottom of the}} well decreases in a certain period of time, this time and the former moment will appear the reduction phenomenon in the mud pressure contrast, namely has produced the negative pulse. The complete set consists of a ground launch device that generates pressure pulse signals, a control system, and a down hole receiver for receiving and decoding the pulse signal. The ground switchgear is replaced by a mud bypass valve that, during operation, opens and closes to produce a series of pressure pulse signals that can be received by the down hole receiver and decoded. It is worth noting that this method shortens the time necessary for downstream information transmission without interrupting the drilling and simultaneous uplink transmission.|$|E
30|$|With TDCS (Koubaa et al. 2007), it is {{possible}} to find the best schedule for the routers active periods in order to avoid interference, and to support most of the network bandwidth requirements. However, the schedule is done at network setup time and assumes a static network that will remain unchanged. The choice of the TDCS schedule has a strong impact on the end-to-end delays. In fact, it is easy to observe that in a single collision domain, where there are no overlapping clusters, a TDCS schedule optimized for <b>downstream</b> <b>communication</b> will result in the worst-case for upstream communication, and consequently in higher end-to-end delays. Moreover, routers are assigned with a fixed bandwidth they might not always need, while other clusters might be lacking. We aim at reacting to different data flow changes on-the-fly, while simultaneously minimizing the network inaccessibility time. Our proposal achieves this via two techniques: (1) re-ordering the clusters’ active periods to favour one set of streams, reducing the end-to-end delays, which we call DCR (Dynamic Cluster Re-ordering); and (2) tuning the size of the clusters’ duration, increasing the bandwidth of the clusters serving a specific stream, an eventually decreasing others’ bandwidth, which we named DBR (Dynamic Bandwidth Re-allocation). The first technique consists of a rescheduling of the clusters order in the TDCS cycle, aiming at minimizing end-to-end delays, while the second technique consists on rearranging the bandwidth allocation for the clusters involved in a stream, to increase its bandwidths and decrease the overall time for a data stream transmission. Both techniques can be used together, or separately. Importantly, the mechanism presents a complexity of O(N), where N represents the number of Cluster-Heads in the network, making it suitable to be run over WSN platforms with scarce processing power. This low complexity also avoids a much larger energy depletion of the central node in charge of running DCS.|$|E

Improvements in receiver design: Correlators have been rewritten {{to take full advantage}} of VOLK and VOLK_GNSSSDR, and they are of general use for any tracking block.

Improvements in receiver design: Block adapters are now all managed by smart pointers, ensuring better memory management. 	Improvements in processing speed: The VOLK_GNSSSDR library has been rewritten, following current VOLK standards and adding a number of new kernels. This approach addresses both efficiency and portability. Now the library provides the key kernels for GNSS signal processing in 16 ic and 32 fc versions, including SSE 2, SSE 3, SSE 4. 1, AVX, AV 2 and NEON implementations. Please execute volk_gnsssdr_profile’'' andvolk_profile’'’ to use the fastest implementation for your host machine. 	New source block: Two_Bit_Packed_File_Signal_Source. This block takes 2 bit samples that have been packed into bytes or shorts as input and generates a byte for each sample. 	Fixes in SUPL assistance (supl. nokia. com removed). 	Improvements in acquisition: Added a non CFAR PCPS acquisition algorithm based on the estimation of the post correlation noise floor. If enabled as an option in the acquisition configuration, it allows setting more stable thresholds in the presence of non-gaussian front-end noise (which is the usual behavior of front-ends.) 	Fixes in acquisition: Fixed mismatch between the config files and the acquisition code in the specification of the IF. Fixed a bug in the length of the FFT of local codes. 	Improvements in tracking sensitivity: Added configuration option to customize the extension of the GPS L 1 CA correlation length after bit synchronization (options are: [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20] ms). Only available in the GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking implementation. 	New tracking block introduced: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_C_Aid_Tracking is a GPS L 1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL with optional carrier-aid feedback. It is available in both 32 bits gr_complex input samples and in 16 bits short int complex samples. The gr_complex version has also the capability to extend the coherent correlation period from 1 ms to 20 ms using telemetry symbol synchronization. 	Increased resolution in CN 0 estimator internal variables. 	Fixed a bug in computation of GPS L 1 C/A carrier phase observable. 	Fixed a bug in the internal state machine that was blocking the receiver after a few hours of usage. Now the receiver can work continually (tested for more than one week, no known limit). 	New tracking block introduced: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_Tracking_GPU is a GPS L 1 C/A carrier PLL and code DLL that uses the CUDA-compatible GPU to compute carrier wipe off and correlation operations, alleviating the CPU load. 	Obsolete/buggy blocks removed: GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_FLL_PLL_Tracking, GPS_L 1 _CA_DLL_PLL_Optim_Tracking. 	Added a RTCM printer and TCP server in PVT blocks (still experimental). The receiver is now able to stream data in real time, serving RTCM 3. 2 messages to multiple clients. For instance, it can act as a Ntrip Source feeding a Ntrip Server, or to be used as data input in RTKLIB, obtaining Precise Point Positioning fixes in real-time. The TCP port, Station ID, and rate of MT 1019 /MT 1045 and MSM can be configured. GPS_L 1 _CA_PVT serves MT 1019 (GPS Ephemeris) and MSM 7 (MT 1077, full GPS pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution) messages, while GALILEO_E 1 _PVT serves MT 1045 (Galileo ephemeris) and MSM 7 (MT 1097, full Galileo pseudoranges, phase ranges, phase range rates and CNR - high resolution). 	Added a GeoJSON printer. Basic (least-squares) position fixes can be now also stored in this format, in addition to KML. 	Obsolete block removed: output filter. 	QA code migrated to the new asynchronous message passing system. 	Improvements in documentation: update of README. md file, addition of documentation for the VOLK_GNSSSDR library, updated links to new ICDs. 	Improvements in documentation: Satellite identification updated to current constellation status. 	Updated and cleaner console output. Now Galileo satellites have the ‘E’ identifier in their PRN number. 	Several improvements in CMake scripts allow to build GNSS-SDR in Linux Debian (Jessie, Stretch and Sid), Ubuntu (from 12. 04 to 16. 04), including amd 64, i 386, armhf and arm 64 architectures, and possibly in other GNU/Linux distributions, as well as in Mac OS X 10. 9 to 10. 11. It also works well with CMake 3. 5 (some problems solved with VOLK_GNSSSDR as a sub-project). 	The software can link either against OpenSSL or against GnuTLS with openssl extensions, whatever it is available. This allows buildings in distributions such as Fedora or ArchLinux, while being compatible with binary distribution through Debian packages. 	Fixed a number of defects detected by Coverity Scan. 	Some fixes required by Debian licensing and packaging system. 	Added a CGRAN ([URL] manifest 	Lots of code cleaning and fixes of typos and small bugs...|$|E
