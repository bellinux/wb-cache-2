40|$|Krabbe’s disease (globoid cell leucodystrophy) is a {{disorder}} involving the white {{matter of the}} peripheral and central nervous systems. Mutations in the gene for the lyso-somal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC) result in low enzymatic activity and decreased ability to degrade galactolipids found in myelin. The disease is classically of infantile onset, but adult onset cases have been reported. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain shows characteristic abnormalities. A unique family with Krabbe’s disease is described, with proven <b>GALC</b> <b>deficiency</b> but normal MRI. A neurological phenotype is present in heterozygotes and the family shows the extent of homozygotic phenotypic diversity {{that can be seen}} in this disorder.

40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} or Krabbe {{disease is}} an inherited autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase (<b>GALC)</b> gene. <b>Deficiency</b> of <b>GALC</b> {{results in the}} accumulation of a highly cytotoxic metabolite galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). In the present study, we describe the development and validation of a sensitive and specific LC–ESI-tandem-MS method for the determination of psychosine in the serum of twitcher mice, the naturally occurring animal model of this disease. The method was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, specificity, linearity and sensitivity. Calibration plots were linear over the concentration range of 2. 5 – 50 ng/mL. Recovery of psychosine from serum was in the range 94. 20 – 98. 02 %. The {{results of this study}} show that in the affected mice the concentration of psychosine (ranging from 2. 53 to 33. 27 ng/mL) increased significantly with the progression of the disease. The maximum level (33. 27 ng/mL) was detected in the serum of one of the twitcher mice sacrificed at 40 PND. Psychosine was not detected at significant levels in wild type mice. These results clearly demonstrate that this noninvasive, rapid, and highly sensitive LC–ESI-tandem-MS method is a very useful approach for the detection of psychosine in serum...|$|R
40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} (GLD) {{is a rare}} lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) due to the {{deficiency of}} the lysosomal enzyme Galactocerebrosidase (<b>GALC).</b> The enzymatic <b>deficiency</b> results in intracellular storage of undegraded metabolites in the nervous system, leading to progressive dysmyelination. We are testing the feasibility and efficacy of a gene therapy strategy based on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) and lentiviral vectors (LV) in the murine model of GLD. Differently from what observed with other lysosomal enzymes, GALC gene transfer and expression in HSPC causes apoptosis and functional impairment of the transduced cells due to an inbalance of the intracellular content in bioactive sphingolipids consequent to de novo enzyme expression. Differentiated cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages are not affected by GALC expression, suggesting a unique sensitivity of HSPC to enzyme toxicity.

Using this method, we observed robust X-Gal staining in diverse neuronal populations and interfascicular oligodendrocytes in sections from normal mouse brain. In contrast, sections of Twitcher brain did not show a specific staining pattern in neurons or glial cells.

40|$|We {{report a}} novel {{role for the}} {{lysosomal}} galactosylceramidase (GALC), which is defective in globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), in maintaining a functional post-natal subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenic niche. We show that proliferation/self-renewal of neural stem cells (NSCs) and survival of their neuronal and oligodendroglial progeny are impaired in GALC-deficient mice. Using drugs to modulate inflammation and gene transfer to rescue GALC expression and activity, we show that lipid accumulation resulting from <b>GALC</b> <b>deficiency</b> acts as a cell-autonomous pathogenic stimulus in enzyme-deficient NSCs and progeny before upregulation of inflammatory markers, which later sustain a non-cell-autonomous dysfunction. Importantly, we provide evidence that supply of functional GALC provided by neonatal intracerebral transplantation of NSCs ameliorates the functional impairment in endogenous SVZ cells. Insights into the mechanism/s underlying GALC-mediated regulation of early post-natal neurogenic niches improve {{our understanding of the}} multi-component pathology of GLD. The occurrence of a restricted period of SVZ neurogenesis in infancy supports the implications of our study for the development of therapeutic strategies to treat this severe pediatric neurodegenerative disorde...|$|E

The poor outcome of current clinical treatments calls for novel model systems to investigate the biological impact of GALC down-regulation and for the search of novel therapeutic strategies in GLD. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) represents an attractive vertebrate model for human diseases. Here, lysosomal GALC activity was demonstrated in the brain of zebrafish adults and embryos. Accordingly, we identified two GALC co-orthologs (named galca and galcb) dynamically co-expressed in CNS during zebrafish development. Both genes encode for lysosomal enzymes endowed with GALC activity. Single down-regulation of galca or galcb by specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides results in a partial decrease of GALC activity in zebrafish embryos that was abrogated in double galca/galcb morphants. However, no psychosine accumulation was observed in galca/galcb double morphants. Nevertheless, double galca/galcb knockdown caused reduction and partial disorganization of the expression of the early neuronal marker neuroD and an increase of apoptotic events during CNS development. These observations provide new insights into the pathogenesis of GLD, indicating that GALC loss-of-function may have pathological consequences in developing CNS independent of psychosine accumulation.

40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} is an {{autosomal recessive}} inherited disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC). Although the severe, rapidly progressing infantile form {{is the most}} common, late-onset forms have been described. We investigated the molecular basis of <b>GALC</b> <b>deficiency</b> in a patient with a late-life mild form of globoid cell leukodystrophy who survived into the eighth decade. Since material suitable for mutation analysis was no longer available from the proband, her GALC genotype was reconstructed by analyzing this gene in her six obligate carrier offspring. One allele contained the mutation 809 G>A (G 270 D) in the 1637 C background, while the other allele contained three sequence variants: 1609 G>A (G 537 R), 1873 G>A (A 625 T), and 1650 T>A (V 550 V) in the 1637 T background. These mutations were confirmed in the proband's genomic DNA isolated from a sural nerve biopsy. Expression studies indicated that the G 537 R is a disease-causing mutation, as it resulted in no GALC activity, either alone or together with the A 625 T. This A 625 T sequence variant {{did not affect the}} enzyme activity, at least when expressed in the 1637 T background. The mild clinical phenotype was likely {{to be associated with the}} 809 G>A, since residual GALC activity, about 17 % of the control activity, was detected in the expression studies of this mutation.

40|$|Globoid-cell Leukodystrophy (GLD; Krabbe’s disease) is {{a rapidly}} {{progressing}} inherited demyelinating disease {{caused by a}} deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme Galactosylceramidase (<b>GALC).</b> <b>Deficiency</b> of GALC leads to altered catabolism of galactosylceramide and the cytotoxic lipid, galactosylsphingosine (psychosine). This leads to a rapidly progressive fatal disease with spasticity, cognitive disability and seizures. The murine model of GLD (Twitcher; GALC 2 / 2) lacks the same enzyme and has similar clinical features. The deficiency of GALC leads to oligodendrocyte death, profound neuroinflammation, and the influx of activated macrophages into the CNS. We showed previously that keratinocyte chemoattractant factor (KC) is highly elevated in the CNS of untreated Twitcher mice and significantly decreases after receiving a relatively effective therapy (bone marrow transplantation combined with gene therapy). The action of KC is mediated through the CXCR 2 receptor and is a potent chemoattractant for macrophages and microglia. KC is also involved in oligodendrocyte migration and proliferation. Based on the commonalities between the disease presentation and the functions of KC, we hypothesized that KC and/or CXCR 2 contribute to the pathogenesis of GLD. Interestingly, {{the course of the}} disease is not significantly altered in KC- or CXCR 2 -deficient Twitcher mice. There is also no alteration in inflammation or demyelination patterns in these mice. Furthermore, transplantation of CXCR 2 -deficient bone marrow does not alter the progression of the disease as it does in other models of demyelination. This study highlights the role of multiple redundan...|$|E

40|$|Globoid cell {{leukodystrophy}} (GLD) is {{an inherited}} lysosomal storage disease caused by β-galactocerebrosidase (<b>GALC)</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Gene therapy (GT) should provide rapid, extensive and lifetime GALC supply in {{central nervous system}} (CNS) tissues to prevent or halt irreversible neurologic progression. Here we used a lentiviral vector (LV) to transfer a functional GALC gene in the brain of Twitcher mice, a severe GLD model. A single injection of LV. GALC in the external capsule of Twitcher neonates resulted in robust transduction of neural cells with minimal and transient activation of inflammatory and immune response. Importantly, we documented a proficient transduction of proliferating and post-mitotic oligodendroglia, a relevant target cell type in GLD. GALC activity (30 - 50 % of physiological levels) was restored in the whole CNS of treated mice as early as 8 days post-injection. The early and stable enzymatic supply ensured partial clearance of storage and reduction of psychosine levels, translating in amelioration of histopathology and enhanced lifespan. At 6 months post-injection in non-affected mice, LV genome persisted exclusively in the injected region, where transduced cells overexpressed GALC. Integration site analysis in transduced brain tissues showed no aberrant clonal expansion and preferential targeting of neural-specific genes. This study establishes neonatal LV-mediated intracerebral GT as a rapid, effective and safe therapeutic intervention to correct CNS pathology in GLD and provides a strong rationale for its application in this and similar leukodystrophies, alone or in combination with therapies targeting the somatic pathology, with the final aim of providing an effective and timely treatment of these global disorder...|$|E
