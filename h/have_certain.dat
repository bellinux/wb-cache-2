5|$|Drug {{collectors}} <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> traditions {{which may}} be accurate or may be exaggerated.

Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, {{theorists have}} {{discovered}} many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence.

5|$|Anura {{is divided}} into three suborders that are broadly {{accepted}} by the scientific community, but the relationships between some families remain unclear. Future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships. The suborder Archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs. These are Ascaphidae, Bombinatoridae, Discoglossidae and Leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages. The six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder Mesobatrachia are the fossorial Megophryidae, Pelobatidae, Pelodytidae, Scaphiopodidae and Rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic Pipidae. These <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders. Neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs, including most common species. Ninety-six percent of the over 5,000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians.|$|E
5|$|From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local {{government}} system {{known as the}} Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government. Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> rights to all land on the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.|$|E
5|$|Selfe's {{contempt}} for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos– indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised {{is that in the}} vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded animals will <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E

Each house of the Diet determines its own standing orders and has responsibility for disciplining its own members. A member may be expelled, but only by a two-thirds majority vote. Every member of the Cabinet has the right to appear in either house of the Diet for the purpose of speaking on bills, and each house has the right to compel the appearance of Cabinet members.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of sailing ships, but they all <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> basic things in common. Except for rotor ships using the Magnus effect, every sailing ship has a hull, rigging {{and at least one}} mast to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship. Ocean journeys by sailing ship can take many months, and a common hazard is becoming becalmed because of lack of wind, or being blown off course by severe storms or winds that do not allow progress in the desired direction. A severe storm could lead to shipwreck, and the loss of all hands. Sailing ships can only carry a certain quantity of supplies in their hold, so they have to plan long voyages carefully to include appropriate provisions, including fresh water.|$|E
5|$|They did, however, <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> traits {{separating}} {{them from}} cartilaginous fishes, traits {{that would become}} pivotal {{in the evolution of}} terrestrial forms. With the exception of a pair of spiracles, the gills did not open singly to the exterior as they do in sharks; rather, they were encased in a gill chamber stiffened by membrane bones and covered by a bony operculum, with a single opening to the exterior. The cleithrum bone, forming the posterior margin of the gill chamber, also functioned as anchoring for the pectoral fins. The cartilaginous fishes do not have such an anchoring for the pectoral fins. This allowed for a movable joint {{at the base of the}} fins in the early bony fishes, and would later function in a weight bearing structure in tetrapods. As part of the overall armour of rhomboid cosmin scales, the skull had a full cover of dermal bone, constituting a skull roof over the otherwise shark-like cartilaginous inner cranium. Importantly, they also had a swim bladder/lung, a feature lacking in sharks and rays.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Constitution and by law, all adults aged over 18 are eligible to vote, with a secret ballot and a universal suffrage, and those elected <b>have</b> <b>certain</b> protections from apprehension while the Diet is in session.

Each house is responsible for disciplining its own members, and all deliberations are public unless two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution agreeing it otherwise. The Diet also requires the presence of at least one-third of the membership of either house in order to constitute a quorum. All decisions are decided by a majority of those present, unless otherwise stated by the Constitution, {{and in the case of}} a tie, the presiding officer has the right to decide the issue. A member cannot be expelled, however, unless a majority of two-thirds or more of those members present passes a resolution therefor.|$|E
