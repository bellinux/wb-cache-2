50|$|Canagliflozin is an anti-diabetic drug used {{to improve}} glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. In {{extensive}} clinical trials, canagliflozin produced a consistent dose-dependent decrease in HbA1c levels of 0.77% to 1.16% when administered either as monotherapy, in combination with metformin, in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, in combination with metformin and pioglitazone, or in combination with insulin, from initial HbA1c levels of 7.8% to 8.1%. When added to metformin, canagliflozin daily was shown to be non-inferior to both sitagliptin 100 mg daily and glimepiride in reducing HbA1c levels at one year, whilst canagliflozin 300 mg successfully demonstrated statistical superiority over both sitagliptin and glimiperide in decreasing HbA1c levels. Secondary <b>efficacy</b> <b>endpoints</b> of higher reductions in weight and blood pressure (versus sitagliptin and glimiperide) were also observed in studies.

50|$|On 21 January 2016, {{data from}} two of three core Phase III trials was released. The two trials, which each studied the drug at dosages {{including}} 0.5 mg/day and 2 mg/day, failed to meet their primary <b>efficacy</b> <b>endpoints.</b> However, {{there was a clear}} trend towards efficacy for 2 mg/day (but not 0.5 mg/day) on the primary endpoint of one of the trials (FORWARD-4), as well as statistically significant efficacy on the MADRS endpoint in post hoc analyses of that trial. In addition, the placebo response was unusually high in the other trial (FORWARD-3), potentially confounding results. Moreover, Phase II studies investigated ALKS-5461 at dosages of 2 mg/day and 8 mg/day (and notably not 0.5 mg/day) and found effectiveness with both dosages but significantly greater improvement with the 8 mg/day dose (5.3- and 8.7-point MADRS score decreases for 2 mg/day and 8 mg/day, respectively), suggesting that higher dosages of ALKS-5461 might demonstrate more marked effectiveness. Alkermes has expressed that it fully intends to continue development and seek FDA approval for ALKS-5461, with the third of the core Phase III studies, FORWARD-5 (which is assessing dosages of 1 mg/day and 2 mg/day), yet-to-be-completed.
