40|$|As {{the stress}} {{is one of}} the main factors {{affecting}} the safe operation of the pipeline in the gas pipeline tunnel crossing project, in order to ensure the safe operation of the pipeline, it is necessary to research the stress conditions of the gas pipelines in the deviated well. In this study, we discuss on these two aspects of the gas pipelines in the deviated well: the necessity of adding <b>buttresses</b> and the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buttresses.</b> We do the numerical simulation of China Shaanxi-Beijing III gas pipeline in the Eighth Fort Yellow River tunnel areas using stress analysis software CAESAR II; exploring its secure and economical buttresses distance. Our research shows that the pipeline can be safely run after adding buttresses and it is more reasonable to set buttresses distance of 20 m for the numerical example. Our research provides a reference for the design of the buttresses distance of gas pipelines in the deviated well and has some engineering value...|$|R

50|$|The Sessions House in Spalding, Lincolnshire, {{was built}} in 1842 to 1843 and was {{designed}} by Charles Kirk and erected {{at a cost of}} £6,000. It was opened on 30 June 1843. There are two crenellated side towers and a recessed centre, which is two storeys high, with three bays divided by <b>buttresses.</b> In the <b>centre</b> are heraldic beast finials. There are three windows <b>between</b> the <b>buttresses</b> with 'Perpendicular' tracery and a central four-centred doorway.|$|R
50|$|Natural {{regeneration}} is very scarce. Seedlings can {{be found}} as far as 200 m from mother trees, especially <b>between</b> <b>buttresses.</b> Height increment in a 2-year-old plantation was 0.7 - 2.9 m and diameter increment is 0.6 - 3.8 cm. Petersianthus quadrialatus trees coppice easily.|$|R
50|$|Interestingly, {{while most}} petrels nest in burrows, {{as do the}} Gould's petrels on New Caledonia, the Australian {{subspecies}} of Gould's petrel does not. On Cabbage Tree Island, they nest in amongst rocks and boulders, under fallen palm fronds, in hollow trunks of fallen palms and <b>between</b> <b>buttresses</b> of fig trees.|$|R

50|$|The current temple has {{a single}} nave of six sections, chapels <b>between</b> <b>buttresses,</b> semicircular arches, {{polygonal}} presbytery, and covered with vault with canvases in brick.

50|$|Construction {{materials}} are typically poor, {{with a few}} severe facade sculptures, a polygonal apse with large window openings. The monasteries adapted and assimilated local building traditions to the community's needs, so churches vary depending on geographic location. In Spain there were two models: buildings with a Latin cross and buildings with a single nave with chapels <b>between</b> <b>buttresses.</b>|$|R

50|$|Hypertelorism is an {{abnormally}} increased <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> two organs or bodily parts, usually {{referring to}} an increased <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the orbits (eyes), or orbital hypertelorism. In this condition the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the inner eye corners {{as well as the}} <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the pupils is greater than normal. Hypertelorism {{should not be confused with}} telecanthus, in which the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the inner eye corners is increased but that of the outer eye corners remains unchanged. Therefore the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the pupils is normal.|$|R

50|$|The façade was {{modified}} in 1787 by the architect Eugene Durango under {{the orders of}} Cardinal Lorenzana. The sculptor was Mariano Salvatierra.

50|$|The {{church is}} built in coursed {{sandstone}} ashlar with slate roofs in the Early English Gothic Revival style. The aisles have two-light lancet windows <b>between</b> <b>buttresses</b> and the chancel single light lancets. There is a three-stage south west tower with an embattled parapet, angle buttresses and a porch with a Gothic arch and planked door with ornate hinges. There are three-light belfry windows; the outer windows are blocked.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} consecrated in 1198. However, it reached {{its present form}} in 1401-30. This 71-meter-high {{building}} is surrounded by 19 chapels located <b>between</b> <b>buttresses.</b> In its gothic interior 22 pillars support the ceiling. Numerous bishops’ tombstones deserve mentioning, with the tombstone of Balthazar von Pronto being the greatest. The church burnt down in 1945 and was rebuilt between the years 1947-58. Colloquially it {{is referred to as}} a cathedral.|$|R

Again, a measure of <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> random variables may relate to the extent of dependence between them, rather than to their individual values.|$|R
