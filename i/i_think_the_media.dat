40|$|When {{it comes}} to the free expression, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> can be both problem and solution, writes MARGARET SIMONS ?THE public interest. ? What do those words mean, {{particularly}} when used by media organisations in their own defence, or when lobbying governments for greater freedoms? The question occurs to me {{as a result of this}} entirely reasonable Australian Press Council adjudication, which forms part of the continuing controversies concerning the West Australian ? the wild, wild journal of the wild, wild west. The latest adjudication is a fairly simple case ? or so you would <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> West Australian got fundamental facts wrong in a story about the hospital system and refused to correct. As the Press Council says, ?The newspaper?s actions compromised its legitimate attempt to air a matter of obvious public concern. ? Inarguable, you would think, but that hasn?t stopped the West Australian lodging an appeal against the decision. Their defence? You guessed it ? writing stories about inadequate health services is in the ?public interest? and this means that the errors ?were immaterial to the issue. ? Oh, really? The West Australian must take the public for fools. The words ?the public interest,? used in this way, become weasel words, full of wind and self interest. Successive generations of media moguls have argued for freedom of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> because of <b>the</b> public interests involved. Our own time is no exception. Our leading media organisations earlier this year clubbed together to form Australia?s Right to Know, which has commissioned an independent audit of <b>the</b> state of <b>media</b> freedom in Australia. Admirable, but as the Australia Privacy Foundation has pointed out in its submission to <b>the</b> audit. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> are also heavily involved in commercial activity unrelated to any ?public interest? role, and much of their editorial output is in the area of ?infotainment? or pure entertainment, which can make few if any claims to special protection or privileges founded on a ?fourth estate? role. We also hope that the audit, and the Right to Know campaign, can avoid overly simplistic characterisation of the relationship between governments and <b>the</b> <b>media?</b> <b>the</b> relationship cannot be reduced to a simple story of good and brave journalists fighting repressive government censorship. Press and media interests have often enthusiastically cooperated with government efforts to mould public opinion and have often received benefits from doing so? an appropriate degree of humility, would be welcome. ? I hope the Privacy Foundation isn?t holding its breath waiting for the humility. Freedom of <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> so far as media corporations are concerned, means freedom for them to do as they wish. They are slower to defend the ability of individual journalists to write as they wish, let alone for the public to have direct access to the ability to publish. New media changes this. A thousand blogs bloom, and now just about anyone can say anything ? but this kind of freedom of speech has not been embraced by mainstream media. Rather, they rubbish it. Witness News Limited?s sensitivity to criticism in the blogosphere. Every editor would claim to want their publication talked about around the water cooler. But when those conversations happen in public, on the web, they hate it. The notional but safely invisible readers chatting around the water cooler are characterised as ?mainstream Australians? ? the nice friendly public whose right to know <b>the</b> <b>media</b> casts itself as defending. But bloggers! They are ?cannibals? on <b>the</b> mainstream <b>media,</b> academics, wankers and wannabes, and so forth and so on. The abuse is heaped on. Journalism academic Jay Rosen has pointed out that the famous part of the United States constitution guaranteeing freedom of the press was originally proposed, composed and codified to protect not the freedom of journalists to report, but the freedom of citizens to meet, speak, be informed and publish reports. When {{it comes to}} the citizen?s right to be heard, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> can be both problem and solution. Too often, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> very <b>media</b> organisations who complain about lack of freedom of speech are the first to bully non-media participants in public life. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> are just one way of giving expression to freedom of speech ? vitally important, yes, but not the whole box and dice, and not an unqualified blessing. It?s hard to imagine that the West?s appeal against the Press Council decision can succeed. If it did, it would mean that any media organisation could raise any issue in the public realm, whether or not it gets its facts right, and get off scot free because of ?the public interest. ? But more important than this single case is that those who bang on about freedoms and public interests need to become a bit more careful about how they use the words. The concepts are too important to be used so shallowly. ? Margaret Simons?s new book, The Content Makers: Understanding <b>the</b> <b>Media</b> in Australia, is published by Penguin.

ATHENS, Ga. - When historians {{analyze the}} {{presidency}} of Bill Clinton, will impeachment mar his legacy? While admitting he 2 ̆ 7 s no prophet, University of Georgia law and history professor Ed Larson, winner of the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for history, shares ideas. 2 ̆ 2 Andrew Johnson tried hard to redeem himself, 2 ̆ 2 Larson says. 2 ̆ 2 He eventually {{went back to the}} Senate from Tennessee and viewed that as a tremendous vindication. The question is how much does Clinton think he needs to be redeemed? He can look to the public opinion polls, which still show him as popular. He may not feel the need to be redeemed in history because he may not think it 2 ̆ 7 s that bad a blot. 2 ̆ 2 And historians may not either. While Larson acknowledges that impeachment will be of historical importance, he believes historians will paint Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s presidency with broad strokes and consider other factors: the breakdown of discourse among party lines, the influence of politicians such as Newt Gingrich, the scandal-driven media, and a loss of historical perspective. Historians do not look favorably upon Johnson, the only other U. S. president ever impeached, but Larson says that 2 ̆ 7 s as much a denouncement of his politics as it is the legacy of impeachment. A more apt parallel for Clinton, Larson believes, is Grover Cleveland, a very popular Democrat who survived sex scandals and served two presidential terms. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s been joked that Grover was the best Republican in the period of the 1890 s, because even though he was a Democrat, he had Republican policies, 2 ̆ 2 Larson says. 2 ̆ 2 We could say the same of Bill Clinton - he 2 ̆ 7 s the best Republican president of the late 1900 s. And Cleveland is not one of our more remembered presidents. He tends to be a forgotten president, despite serving in office for a long time. 2 ̆ 2 And because many Americans wish the impeachment affair could be forgotten, Larson says the Senate trial will not measure up to previous courtroom dramas as another 2 ̆ 2 trial of the century. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t think people will be glued to their sets as they were for the O. J. Simpson trial or glued to their radios and newspapers as in the Scopes trial, 2 ̆ 2 says Larson. 2 ̆ 2 <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> think they should cover it and they think it 2 ̆ 7 s the best story they 2 ̆ 7 ve got, but it 2 ̆ 7 s not a story that will capture the interest of the people.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{performed}} a comparative case study between the United States and a foreign country, particularly Australia, Venezuela, and the United Kingdom, {{in each of}} the media ages that I defined. I defined these media ages as the Pre- 24 Hour News Cycle Age, the Internet Age, and the Social Media Age. For the Pre- 24 Hour News Cycle Age, I examined Muhammad Ali and his refusal to be inducted into the Armed Services in 1967 after being drafted for the Vietnam War and Peter Norman, an Australian Olympic medalist, and his decision to take a silent stand for equality at the 1968 Olympics, while Australia’s Indigenous population underwent a civil rights movement. For the Internet Age, I examined the Dixie Chicks and their anti-Bush comment in 2003, and Alejandro Sanz, a Spanish singer, who made anti-Chavez commentary in Venezuela in 2004. For the current Social Media Age, I examined Colin Kaepernick and his decision to kneel during the National Anthem in 2016 and 2017, and Andy Murray, a Scottish-born tennis player who plays for Great Britain, and his tweet in support of Scotland voting yes to the Scottish Independence Referendum in 2014. I explored how American culture reacts and how a foreign culture reacts to a celebrity protest that has been widely perceived as anti-patriotic in their home country. I also exmained the implications of the evolving media environment to understand the reactions to celebrity protest. Are the protests perceived differently across the ages as the media and our news consumption evolves? Do the countries react the same to celebrity protest, despite cultural differences, or do they act differently? My conclusions regarding the impact of changing news consumption are as follows. First, {{as a result of these}} changes in the news platforms, the news cycle, and the consumption of news, I saw different reactions amongst the public across the media ages. Before the internet, the limited amount of news platforms resulted in just the dominating opinion having a platform to be heard, thus creating a kind of one-sided argument driven by the media that the public just agreed with. As more platforms to consume news have become available, we are being exposed to more opinions and able to consume the story from many perspectives. In addition, the creation of social media platforms allows for people to read opinions and express their own, specifically choosing how they consume their news and the type of news they are consuming. This increased diversity of information outlets, and the ability for consumers to choose the outlets from which they received their news has changed the face of the media environment. With regard to celebrity protest, reactions are equally as strong as they were in the first media age, but the current environment also allows for more diversity of opinion. As a result, I found more support of celebrity protest as time progresses to the Social Media Age we live in today. This support was not common before the creation of the internet. Finally, I concluded that despite the cultural and social differences, countries reacted the same to perceived anti-patriotic protests by celebrities in each media age. I discovered that the change in our consumption of news and the availability of news platforms transcends the cultural and societal differences between the United States and these foreign countries. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> environment transcends these differences due to its structure and the conversation it incites. In the beginning, public opinions were very media driven, but as more platforms became available, opinions became more driven by the public with the media mirroring these thoughts...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{farming and}} food Cue: Urban {{agriculture}} - the {{growing of crops}} and keeping of livestock in cities ? is increasingly popular {{in many parts of}} Africa, both as a means for generating income, and as a way for urban households to supplement their diets. However, one challenge facing urban farming is how to access water for irrigation. While some families may harvest rainwater from their rooftops, many urban farmers depend on less clean sources of water, including polluted rivers and drainage channels. This creates a danger to health, both for the farmers themselves, who risk catching infections from the water, and for consumers who buy their produce. So how can consumers protect themselves, {{and what can be done}} to ensure that produce grown in urban areas is as safe as possible? To find out, Eric Kadenge went to a restaurant owned by food safety expert Mr Ham Onsando. Apart from his restaurant business, Mr Onsando also works for Global Food Safety, an organisation which helps restaurants and food processors to improve their safety standards. He began by explaining the risk to food safety from the use of contaminated irrigation water. IN:		?There is a very interesting situation ? OUT:		? Thank you very much. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Ham Onsando, of the organisation Global Food Safety, talking to Eric Kadenge. Transcript Onsando	There is a very interesting situation that we find ourselves, especially in Nairobi and the urban setting. You have got your domestic shambas (gardens), you have got people who grow food by riversides, by drainage systems. A lot of these obviously have an element of risk. More so when we know that a lot of the effluent that leaves our houses finds its way into these rivers, into the drainage system on the way out. If you go into the industrial area, a lot of organizations there are pumping chemicals into these same scenarios that then end up possibly contaminating the produce that we get from these farmers. Kadenge	It is actually quite scary especially during the days when it?s very rainy because you will find that the sewage water and all the other rain water gets mixed up. Onsando	I have got a classic example of one. On my way home I always drive by him, he?s got a little sukuma wiki (kales) patch, and I know he gets his water from the drainage that runs by the little patch. There are issues in terms of what contaminants he is actually transferring on to the produce. The produce looks good, but you have then got to be aware of ? because of where it is grown - there is a risk and because of that risk there are ways you have got to address it. So you have got to cook it thoroughly, make sure you wash it thoroughly etc. So the steps to actually secure your own safety in terms of the consumer are easy to achieve. It is just washing thoroughly and then cooking thoroughly. That would normally get rid of the kind of contaminants we are dealing with in the urban area. But in that backdrop as well, we have got a mushrooming up of more informal eating areas as well. Nowadays you walk down the street and you can buy fruit salad ready to eat. You don?t know where the fruits have been washed, you don?t know whether the guy washed his hands before peeling the fruit, before chopping; we know so little about the food we are eating. Kadenge	And how do you think then that some of these risks could be minimized or prevented especially from the farmer?s perspective? Onsando	One of the biggest things we need is legislation. Legislation in the sense that farmers who draw water from rivers or from bore-holes have a right to know what kind of pollutants could have gotten into that water. Now legislation on industries, big industry players, we need legislation that will control what they can spew out into rivers. We need legislation that controls what pesticides farmers can use and in what quantities. Kadenge	Let?s talk about the consumer. How should I as a consumer get to know about these risks? Onsando	Education on food risks when you are eating is very key. But from my perspective any time you eat in a restaurant ? even if you have the slightest discomfort, four hours, three hours after eating, complain. Go back to that restaurant and complain. Say they caused you to have a sleepless night, they caused you to have diarrhea ? complain. Consumers have to be aware of their rights and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> has a role to play in that and maybe we should be running more consumer awareness programs and inviting people to tell the consumer what is his right as a consumer. Kadenge	And lastly then, what word would you have in regards to the contamination of water that is used for irrigation in urban settings like Nairobi? Onsando	Other than touting a lot for legislation, I would also like to ask the industry players, the guys who are actually spewing out a lot of waste water into our ecosystem. They should actually take it upon themselves and they should ask themselves ?Is what I am doing good for the environment?? Because ultimately, they might think that they will drive home in their big cars and go into their posh neighbourhoods and it will not affect them. But ultimately whatever we do to the environment affects us. Nature has got a nasty way of coming right round back and hitting at us. Kadenge	Okay thank you very much for taking your time to talk to us. Is this my cup of tea? Onsando	Yes, enjoy your cup of tea, it is very safe - purified water! Kadenge	Thank you very much. End of track. Ham Onsando, a restaurant owner and member of the Global Food Safety organisation, describes risks from dirty irrigation water used in urban farming, and other food risks facing urban consumers...|$|E
