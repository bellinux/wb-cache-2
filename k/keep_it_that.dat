5|$|Marcus went {{to great}} lengths to {{sanitize}} her own and Wyatt's history. For example, she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong evidence to the contrary exists.|$|E

With the clans destroyed and the village safe, the blacksmith vows to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way and destroys the sign pointing to his weapon shop. During the credits, Zen-Yi's pregnant fiancee is kidnapped by a bird clan, prompting Zen-Yi to seek the blacksmith's aid.|$|E
5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in a stark {{gatefold}} sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E

25|$|Historically, local {{residents}} and preservation {{groups have been}} concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, Margot Gayle led a group of citizens to preserve the Jefferson Market Courthouse (later reused as Jefferson Market Library) while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park, and Jane Jacobs, using the Village {{as an example of}} a vibrant urban community, advocated to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, thank you very much.|$|E
500|$|March for Bayh {{began with}} {{reports that the}} {{potential}} candidate {{was one of the}} most conservative Democrats of the Senate. However, it was later revealed that he was the 19th most conservative Democrat during the 109th Congress, demonstrating a sharp trend to the left during his run. This came as the Senator made the keynote speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, where according to a campaign aide, he [...] "la out a tough and smart approach to deal with Iran and Hamas". While on a campaign stop in Manchester late in March, Bayh revealed to a New Hampshire crowd that he supported the continuation of the New Hampshire Primary as the first in the nation and that he would [...] "do everything" [...] he could [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way".|$|E

500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) â€” Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals. Commenting {{on the name}} of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, [...] "you are absolutely {{not going to get the}} right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" [...] and that [...] "no one is going to know the reason and we are going to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] The term [...] "Autumn" [...] refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created. Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book. For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.|$|E
500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the tour}} of the show reached a racially {{segregated}} theatre in Wilmington, Delaware, Rodgers and Hammerstein threatened to cancel the performances there unless seating was integrated, which it was. In 1953, with the tour in Atlanta, there was controversy over [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Two Georgia state legislators, Senator John D. Shepard and Representative David C. Jones, objected to the song, stating that though South Pacific was a fine piece of entertainment, that song [...] "contained an underlying philosophy inspired by Moscow", and explained, [...] "Intermarriage produces half-breeds. [...] And half-breeds are not conducive to the higher type of society.... In the South, we have pure blood lines and we intend to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] They stated that they planned to introduce legislation to outlaw such communist-inspired works. The Northern press had a field day; Hammerstein, when asked for comment, responded {{that he did not}} think the legislators were representing their constituents very well, and that he was surprised at the suggestion that anything kind and decent must necessarily originate in Moscow. In part because of the song, touring companies of South Pacific had difficulty getting bookings in the Deep South.|$|E

500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind when things go badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If we <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E

U.S. Steel was non-union, and experienced steel producers, led by Schwab, wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{way with the}} use of aggressive tactics to identify and root out pro-union [...] "troublemakers." [...] The lawyers and bankers who had organized the mergerâ€”notably Morgan and CEO Elbert Garyâ€”were more concerned with long-range profits, stability, good public relations, and avoiding trouble.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1969, it emerged that Maxwell's attempt to buy the News of the World had failed. The Carr family, which owned the title, had been incensed {{at the thought of}} a Czech immigrant with socialist politics gaining ownership. The board voted against his bid without any dissent. The News of the Worlds editor Stafford Somerfield opposed Maxwell's bid in an October 1968 front page leader article, in which he referred to Maxwell's Czech origins and used his birth name. [...] "This is a British paper, run by British people," [...] he wrote, [...] "as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding ... Let us <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] The tycoon who gained control was the Australian Rupert Murdoch, who later the same year acquired The Sun, which had also previously interested Maxwell.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the course}} of writing [...] (1931), Stuart Lake learned that Josephine had lived with Johnny Behan in Tombstone {{and other aspects of}} Josephine's life that she wanted to keep private. At one point in their {{contentious}} relationship, Josephine described Lake's book as made up of [...] "outright lies". Josephine and Wyatt {{went to great lengths to}} keep her name out of Lake's book, and she threatened litigation to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. After Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine traveled to Boston, Massachusetts to try to persuade the publisher to stop the release of the book. Although the biography became a bestseller, it was later strongly criticized for fictionalizing Earp's life and was found to be markedly inaccurate. As late as 1936, Josephine took legal action to suppress certain details of her and Wyatt's life in Tombstone. During those later years of her life, in addition to burnishing the life and legend of husband Wyatt Earp, [...] "she scripted a history of make believe to hide a number of things of which she was not terribly proud." ...|$|E

It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: [...] "I found strong indications that [...] [...] [...] auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations [...] [...] [...] The commission is a closed culture {{and they want to}} <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs â€“ and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."
