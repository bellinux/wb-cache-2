DASH was withdrawn from ASW service in 1969 due to poor reliability. Lacking ASROC, the Allen M. Sumners were left without a standoff ASW capability, and were decommissioned 1970-73, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The Gearings lasted somewhat longer in US service, with most decommissioned and transferred to foreign navies 1973-80. The FRAM destroyers were replaced as ASW ships by the s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969-74, and the s, which were commissioned 1975-83. Both of the replacement classes had the same ASW armament as a Gearing FRAM I destroyer, {{with the addition of}} improved sonar and a piloted helicopter, typically the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. Some ships of both the Allen M. Sumner (from 1965) and <b>Gearing</b> <b>classes</b> (from 1973) served in the Naval Reserve Force (NRF), remaining in commission with a partial active crew to provide training for Naval reservists. The last FRAM destroyer in US naval service was , a Gearing FRAM I, decommissioned and stricken 1 October 1983 and expended as a target 14 July 1999.|$|R
