Baldwin proposed an expansion program for the ACLU, focusing on police brutality, Native American rights, African American rights, censorship in the arts, and international civil liberties. The board of directors approved Baldwin's expansion plan, except for the <b>international</b> <b>efforts.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{widespread}} misconception {{has arisen}} in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained Haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some less-educated parents {{not to have}} their children vaccinated. This belief is most prevalent in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region, where {{people are likely to}} be influenced by conservative teachings. There also have been attacks on polio vaccination teams. This is hampering <b>international</b> <b>efforts</b> to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally since the virus can be carried by travelers.|$|E

She became flagship of the Pacific Squadron commander, Vice Admiral Nikolai I. Skrydlov, upon her arrival. The ship supported <b>international</b> <b>efforts</b> to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in mid-1900. Poltava and Sevastopol departed for Port Arthur on 15 October 1900 and arrived on 12 and 13 April 1901 respectively.

5|$|During the {{following}} months, <b>international</b> <b>efforts</b> mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, Bosnia and Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and <b>international</b> <b>efforts</b> to preserve agricultural genetic resources through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{relocated}} to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney on 15 August 1946. It {{became part of}} No. 86 Wing, along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, which also operated Dakotas, and No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron, which serviced the wing's flying units. Commencing on 22 January 1947, one of No. 38 Squadron's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice-weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin-engined aircraft at the time, and took several days to complete. The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948, after which chartered Qantas aircraft were used to support the force in Japan. In August 1948, five of No. 38 Squadron's air crews were dispatched to Europe where, {{as members of the}} RAAF Squadron Berlin Air Lift, they participated in the <b>international</b> <b>efforts</b> to fly supplies into Berlin during the Soviet blockade of the city. These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months, and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron's operations. Overall, twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit, all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records. No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949.|$|E
