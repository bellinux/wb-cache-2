2500|$|Wallace {{retracted}} the invitation, and (after considering Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders) chose former Air Force General Curtis LeMay of California. LeMay {{was considered}} {{instrumental in the}} establishment in 1947 of the United States Air Force and an expert in military affairs. His four-star military rank, experience at Strategic Air Command and presence advising President Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis were considered foreign-policy assets to the Wallace campaign. By 1968, LeMay had retired and was serving {{as chairman of the}} board of an electronics company, but the company threatened to dismiss him if he took a leave of absence to run for vice president. To keep LeMay on the ticket, Wallace backer and Texas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt set up a million-dollar fund to reimburse LeMay for any income lost in the campaign. Campaign aides tried to persuade LeMay to avoid questions relating to nuclear weapons, but when asked if he thought their use was necessary to win the Vietnam War, he first said that America can win in Vietnam without them. [...] However, he alarmed the audience by further commenting, [...] "we [...] have a phobia about nuclear weapons. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be times when it would be most efficient to use nuclear weapons." [...] The [...] "politically tone-deaf" [...] LeMay became a drag on Wallace's candidacy for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

60|$|Bun. Sir, said I, let {{me answer}} you in a similitude: Set the case that, at such a wood corner, there did usually come forth thieves, to do mischief; must there {{therefore}} a law be made that every one that cometh out there shall be killed? <b>May</b> <b>there</b> not come out true men as well as thieves out from thence? Just thus {{it is in this}} case; <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be many that may design the destruction of the commonwealth; but it does not follow therefore that all private meetings are unlawful; those that transgress, let them be punished. And if at any time I myself should do any act in my conversation as doth not become a man and Christian, let me bear the punishment. And as for your saying I may meet in public, if I may be suffered, I would gladly do it. Let me have but meeting enough in public, and I shall care the less to have them in private. I do not meet in private because I am afraid to have meetings in public. I bless the Lord that my heart is at that point, that if any man can lay anything to my charge, either in doctrine or practice, in this particular, that can be proved error or heresy, I am willing to disown it, even in the very market place; but if it be truth, then to stand to it to the last drop of my blood. And, Sir, said I, you ought to commend me for so doing. To err and to be a heretic are two things; I am no heretic, because I will not stand refractorily to defend any one thing that is contrary to the Word. Prove anything which I hold to be an error, and I will recant it.|$|R
60|$|When Southern {{people tell}} us that they are no more {{responsible}} for the origin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When {{it is said that}} the institution exists, and that {{it is very difficult to}} get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do as to the existing institution. My first impulse would be to free all the slaves, and send them to Liberia, to their own native land. But a moment's reflection would convince me that whatever of high hope (as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is) <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be in this in the long run, its sudden execution is impossible. If they were all landed there in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days; and there are not surplus shipping and surplus money enough to carry them there in many times ten days. What then? Free them all, and keep them among us as underlings? Is it quite certain that this betters their condition? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would not hold one in slavery at any rate, yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon. What next? Free them, and make them politically and socially our equals? My own feelings will not admit of this, and if mine would, we well know that those of the great mass of whites will not. Whether this feeling accords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question, if indeed it is any part of it. A universal feeling, whether well or ill founded, cannot be safely disregarded. We cannot then make them equals. It does seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted, but for their tardiness in this I will not undertake to judge our brethren of the South.|$|R

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be {{a purpose}} or object trust, the {{carrying}} {{out of which}} would benefit an individual or individuals, where that benefit is so indirect or intangible or which is otherwise so framed as not to give those persons any locus standi {{to apply to the}} court to enforce the trust, in which case the beneficiary principle would, as it seems to me, apply to invalidate the trust, quite apart from any question of uncertainty or perpetuity. Such cases can be considered if and when they arise. The present is not, in my judgment, of that character, and it will be seen that clause 2 (d) of the trust deed expressly states that, subject to any rules and regulations made by the trustees, the employees of the company shall be entitled to the use and enjoyment of the land. Apart from this possible exception, in my judgment the beneficiary principle of In re Astor's Settlement Trusts. which was approved in In re Endacott, decd. - see particularly by Harman L.J. - is confined to purpose or object trusts which are abstract or impersonal. The objection is not that the trust is for a purpose or object per se, but that there is no beneficiary or cestui que trust. The rule is so expressed in Lewin on Trusts, 16th ed. (1964), p. 17, and, in my judgment, with the possible exception I have mentioned, rightly so. In In re Wood, decd., Harman J. said 36:"There has been an interesting argument on the question of perpetuity, but it seems to me, with all respect to that argument, that there is an earlier obstacle which is fatal to the validity of this bequest, namely, that a gift on trust must have a cestui que trust, and there being here no cestui que trust the gift must fail."Again, in Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales Viscount Simonds, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said:“A gift can be made to persons (including a corporation) but it cannot be made to a purpose or to an object: so also," [...] - and these are the important words - [...] "a trust may be created for the benefit of persons as cestuis que trust but not for a purpose or object unless the purpose or object be charitable. For a purpose or object cannot sue, but, if it be charitable, the Attorney-General can sue to enforce it.”Where, then, the trust, though expressed as a purpose, is directly or indirectly for the benefit of an individual or individuals, {{it seems to me that}} it is in general outside the mischief of the beneficiary principle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} meanings and significance of the ontological transformations that proposed by John Hick (1922 ~) and Abe Masao (1915 ~) {{in the context of}} Christian-Buddhist dialogue. Not only will I take a close study of the two very controversial and insightful proposals for ontological transformation that suggested by Hick and Abe respectively, namely, the Real and the kenotic God, but also examine its significance on Christian and Buddhist axiology and the hermeneutic issue for Christian-Buddhist dialogue. What I want to argue in this paper is, in the course of transforming the idea of Christian God, we should not only focus on the ontological disputes between Christianity and Buddhism, but also the methodological question, that is, how Hick and Abe make their interpretations on Christian God. By borrowing the metaphorical approach of Hick, I will show how his methodology for interpretation is comparatively effective and less costly while conducting the transformation of Christian God in the context of Christian-Buddhist dialogue. Not only can it apply to the Real and the metaphorical God incarnate that Hick himself proposes, but also to the kenotic God that Abe suggests. For my part, in face of the very fundamental and seemingly irresolvable ontological confrontations between Christianity and Buddhism, should we not only confine to compare and contrast their similarities and differences, of which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> not come up with any constructive result, but also examine the question of interpretation that underlies. For whenever a dialogue takes place, the activity of interpretation undergoes through the medium of language. Particular on the ontological debate between Christianity and Buddhism, I believe that the question of interpretation is more important and should be dealt with now and in the future, instead of entangling with the debate of whether Christian God is substantial or not...|$|E
40|$|J. L. Schellenberg {{argues in}} the book Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason that the {{apparent}} hiddenness of God is—in itself—an atheistic argument. His argument takes as the starting premise: If a perfectly loving God exists, reasonable nonbelief does not occur. Then he tries to show that reasonable nonbelief does occur. Thus, the conclusion {{is that he has}} an argument of considerable force from the reasonableness of nonbelief to the nonexistence of God. I find that the argument of Schellenberg is persuasive, clearly presented, and easy to follow. In this thesis, I first outline the argument by Schellenberg and then present and evaluate different objections. Some of my objections are related to both the implicit and the explicit premises of Schellenberg s argument. Even though I think some of the presented rejections of Schellenberg's argument do not succeed, it seems possible to refute the argument by what can be called a cumulative argument. While it does not lead to an outright rejection of his argument, it weakens his argument considerably. I think that a cumulative approach is relevant for this kind of philosophical discussion. Even if we grant that God is hidden, there may nevertheless be various reasons for this situation. This can be explained by discussing why a father leaves his ten-year-old son for one hour—to go shopping. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> be a combination of reasons. The father obviously needs to shop for something, but this situation alone does not explain why he leaves his child as the child could accompany the father. An additional reason may be that the father will buy a secret present for the child. It is also possible that the child is playing with the girl next door, and this friendship is highly valued by the father. Or maybe the father thinks the child needs to be alone occasionally in order to develop more independent behavior? This line of argument may also be adapted for explaining the hiddenness of God. Perhaps some human beings need to experience being alone in the universe to appreciate (later) the importance of entering a relationship with God. Alternatively, it could be of vital importance for some people not to feel monitored by God all the time in order to develop a mature moral attitude. It may also be that some individuals need to long for the presence of God if they are to find motivation for entering into a reciprocal relationship with God...|$|E
