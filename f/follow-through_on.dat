40|$|Objective follow-through {{experiences}} (which enable midwifery {{students to}} experience {{continuity of care}} with individual women through pregnancy, labour and birth and the postnatal period) are a component of midwifery education programmes in Australia and the United Kingdom. Current accreditation standards in Australia require midwifery students to have a total of 20 continuity of care experiences {{with an average of}} 20 hours per woman over the duration of their course. There has been limited research regarding students’ and academics’ experiences of follow-through experiences; and there has been debate regarding the appropriate number of follow-through experiences in midwifery curricula. This study aimed to explore the follow-through experience from the perspective of midwifery students and academics in Victoria, Australia. Design cross-sectional design using a web-based survey. Setting Victoria, Australia. Participants students (n= 401) and academics (n= 35) from all seven universities in Victoria that offer accredited midwifery programmes including the Bachelor of Midwifery, Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Midwifery double degree, Postgraduate Diploma of Midwifery and Masters of Midwifery (entry to practice). Findings students and academics were in agreement that continuity of care is important to women. They considered the follow-through experience to be a unique and valuable learning opportunity and agreed that follow-through experiences should be included in midwifery education programmes. However, students and academics raised major concerns about the impact of <b>follow-through</b> experiences <b>on</b> students’ capacity to meet university course requirements (such as missing lectures/tutorials and clinical placements), and spending extensive periods of time on-call both within and outside the university semester. Students and academics also reported concerns about the impact of <b>follow-through</b> experiences <b>on</b> students’ personal lives, including paid employment and family responsibilities (such as childcare or caring for family members). Key conclusions and implications for practice in settings where continuity of care options for women are relatively limited, prescriptive requirements regarding the number and hours of follow-through experiences can present significant challenges for midwifery students.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the intensity of force on the big toes of both feet during the golf swing. The subjects were four right-handed golfers; male tournament professional-golfer, male amateur golfer (HDCP 16), female tournament professional-golfer, and female amateur golfer (HDCP 20). There were obvious differences among four golfers in the swing movement, comparing the intensity of force of the right and left big toes. The findings were as follows: Male pro-golfer demonstrated a gradual increase in force on his both big toes. Female pro-golfer confirmed the presence of force on right and left toe with the value 14 Ns and 11 Ns, respectively. On the other hand, the male amateur golfer exhibited high force (11 Ns) on the left big toe. Both the male and the female pro-golfer and the male amateur showed higher force during the back swing (A-T) phase, compared with other phases, e. g. downswing (T-I) and <b>follow-through</b> (I-F). <b>On</b> the other hand, the female amateur golfer showed higher force at I-F phase. It may be considered that during back swing, the more skillful golfer puts force on the big toes of both feet.

In addition, results from this study can be utilized for the development of a technique for improving the swing action of golfers...|$|R
50|$|Dimitrov employs {{an eastern}} to semi-western {{grip on his}} forehand, {{somewhat}} {{similar to that of}} Roger Federer. When hitting, unlike most players, he uses his elbow and arm to generate power instead of his body. His forehand is known to be very heavy, powerful and accurate and is his primary weapon. He uses it to generate sudden pace in baseline rallies, often catching his opponents off guard. Dimitrov employs a conventional single-handed backhand. His backhand is said {{to be one of the}} most flexible in the game, due to his ability to hit it with top-spin, flat, and his backhand slice, which John McEnroe has said is the best slice in the game. He also has a slightly unusual <b>follow-through</b> and finish <b>on</b> his backhand, often straightening out his hand and extending it all the way across his waist, which some have said is a weakness due to the time taken to recover by recoiling his arm. Dimitrov usually uses his backhand as a rally stroke to build up points rather than hit immediate winners, although he is known to be able to generate significant pace on his backhand when returning a weak shot from his opponent or when neutralising a fast-paced shot. However, like most single-handed backhand players, Dimitrov's backhand suffers when his opponent employs heavy top-spin, which forces a weak top-spin reply or slice from him.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prior {{literature}} {{has shown that}} physicians with healthy personal habits {{are more likely to}} encourage patients to adopt similar habits. However, despite the possibility that promoting medical student health might therefore efficiently improve patient outcomes, no one has studied whether such promotion happens in medical school. We therefore wished to describe both typical and outstanding personal health promotion environments experienced by students in U. S. medical schools. Methods We collected information through four different modalities: a literature review, written surveys of medical school deans and students, student and dean focus groups, and site visits at and interviews with medical schools with reportedly outstanding student health promotion programs. Results We found strong correlations between deans' and students' perceptions of their schools' health promotion environments, including consistent support of the idea of schools' encouraging healthy student behaviors, with less consistent <b>follow-through</b> by schools <b>on</b> this concept. Though students seemed to have thought little about the relationships between their own personal and clinical health promotion practices, deans felt strongly that faculty members should model healthy behaviors. Conclusions Deans' support of the relationship between physicians' personal and clinical health practices, and concern about their institutions' acting on this relationship augurs well for the role of student health promotion in the future of medical education. Deans seem to understand their students' health environment, and believe it could and should be improved; if this is acted on, it could create important positive changes in medical education and in disease prevention. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{live in an}} “Age of Reconciliation. ” In {{recent years}} governments and populaces in the United States and {{countries}} worldwide embarked on major reconciliation initiatives to heal the persisting wounds of historic injustices. With an emphasis on personal and societal benefits of victim storytelling, perpetrator apologies, compensatory or symbolic payments, institutional reordering and public education, reconciliation initiatives emerged on the political agendas of both established and transitioning democracies. Acknowledging and repairing the damage of grievous transgressions signaled commitments to human rights and reparative justice. And it illuminated the high aspirations and moral tenor of civil societies. Yet, despite those aspirations and commitments, reconciliation initiatives stall. Genuine social healing awaits. As eloquently recited by the National Survivors Network in its 2015 petition to the Kenyan National Assembly, the “lack of a framework for implementing {{the recommendations of the}} Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission” has “huge repercussions on the lives of [thousands of] victims who bear the scars of past serious human rights abuses. ” The failure of <b>follow-through</b> action <b>on</b> the commission’s reparative directives “under[cuts] victims’ ability to obtain closure and restart their lives. ” Why, then, despite investments of time, energy and money, is there a far-too-often failure to follow through and implement truth commission reparative recommendations? More fundamentally, why is there still a lack of a workable implementation framework? At bottom, how do we, as members of civil societies, bridge the chasm between aspiration and realization? As developed in this article, a truth commission is a key piece, but only a piece, of a reconciliation initiative. Because implementation of final report recommendations “results from a convergence of factors, some informed by political will, it is illusory to assume” that governments and communities automatically will follow through. Reconciliation policymakers, scholars and advocates thus need, and are searching for, a cogent “next step” framework for assessing and refashioning troubled reconciliation initiatives. With realpolitik influences in mind, to facilitate recalibration and rejuvenation, this article suggests remaking {{a key part of the}} prevailing reconciliation template – a new formalized fourth step in the truth and reconciliation process to bridge the chasm between social healing aspiration and realization. This proposed fourth step is an independent yet politically attuned follow-up body created to assess and update existing recommendations, to implement outstanding recommendations and to refashion and oversee future reconstructive and reparative actions to further comprehensive and enduring social healing – an “assessment, implementation and oversight Task Force” comprised of all key stakeholders. This article fully describes and critiques this proposed implementation and recalibration fourth step and illuminates its potential operations with partial case studies of initiatives in South Korea, South Africa and Peru...|$|R

One potential way to combat this self-stigma is {{through the use of}} computer-assisted screening, allowing veterans to reveal symptoms to a computer. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effectiveness of a computer-assisted motivational interviewing (MI) intervention supported by the tenets of Self-Determination Theory in encouraging veterans to request a referral for treatment and to <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> attending at least one appointment for services within a 30 -day follow-up period. The computer screening created for this purpose contained demographic questions, the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs: Short Screener (GAIN: SS) and the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI). These instruments were followed by a brief MI intervention provided by an on-screen avatar. The final question of the instrument asked participants if they would like a referral to a provider for any symptoms they might have.

While both donors and INGOs agreed that monitoring had a positive outcome on information gathering and sharing, {{as well as on}} limiting human rights violations by the courts themselves, they disagreed {{on the extent to which}} donors should have supported INGOs’ recommendations for improvements to the process. As a result of their service delivery role, INGOs expected to be granted more space by the Rwandan authorities to help improve the gacaca process.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore human {{resources}} (HR) practitioners’ experiences of engagement interventions within a financial institution. A qualitative research approach was followed which was informed by the hermeneutic phenomenological paradigm. Semi-structured interviews were used. The findings indicated that HR practitioners play a critical role in enhancing engagement in organisations through the implementation of effective engagement interventions. The HR practitioners often thought of themselves as the ‘heart’, ‘the core’, ‘facilitator’, ‘business partner’ or ‘middle man’ when implementing engagement interventions. The majority of the HR practitioners did understand engagement, their role in the implementation of engagement interventions and the tools used to assess engagement. However, the findings did indicate that some of the HR practitioners within this study had limited knowledge of engagement, engagement interventions and the tools used to implement engagement. The findings also indicated that the implementation of an engagement intervention should be a collaborative process between employer and employee, with the support of top management to ensure the success of the engagement intervention. Engagement interventions were considered to be predominantly positive and successful by most of the participants. However, it was noted by participants that if there is no <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> the implementation of the engagement interventions it can become negative.

40|$|Modern {{portfolio}} {{theory is}} no longer quite the safe harbor for fiduciaries making investment decisions that it once was (Hawley et al. 2011). One {{reason for this is}} the prolonged uncertainty in the financial markets that was mentioned by chairman Bernanke in 2010 and which still seems to be with us two years (at the time of writing) down the line. In such an environment, the pension fiduciary faces both the external pressures stemming from a prolonged uncertain investment outlook, and the internal pressures stemming from employers and participants reacting to economic uncertainty and voicing their concerns related to the investment of pension assets. Fiduciaries have a duty to balance the interests of their different participant groups, and understanding the perspectives of those beneficiaries is critical to successful implementation of fiduciary obligations (Hawley et al. 2011; Berry and Scanlan 2014).

We also build on the work of Aras and Crowther [2008. “Governance and Sustainability: An Investigation into the Relationship Between Corporate Governance and Corporate Sustainability. ” Management Decision 46 (3) : 433 – 448] by investigating the relationship between specific corporate governance and sustainability characteristics of S&P 100 companies in the USA. Our initial exploratory findings suggest that environmental disclosure scores and ESG disclosure scores are strongly influenced by governance disclosure scores. Board meeting attendance is an important predictor of both scores, suggesting that more disciplined boards result in better sustainability performance. Boards with a higher percentage of independent directors also have higher disclosure scores and are more likely to have climate change and an environmental supply chain management policy in place. They are also more likely to be Global Reporting Initiative compliant, to have a green building policy and social supply chain management. A disturbing pattern emerges, however, when assessing firms’ <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> declared commitments. It turns out that few firms that purport to have climate change policies in place have actually discussed climate change risks or opportunities. We discuss some implications of these preliminary finding...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{continued}} diplomatic truce with Taiwan, this paper reassesses the drivers of China’s engagement in the Pacific, examines trends in China’s aid giving and associated concerns, as well as survey results of China’s <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> aid delivery since 2005. This is the fourth {{in a series of}} Lowy Institute reports on China’s aid program in the Pacific. They now cover the five-year period 2005 - 2009, offering the most detailed picture available of China’s activities in the region. China has been increasing the loan to grant ratio of its aid and has now pledged over $US 600 million to Pacific states. In Tonga, pledged loans from China equate to one third of its GDP. This paper examines Chinese aid activities in the Pacific region for calendar year 2009 and draws on data gathered since 2005. It concludes with some suggestions, including: At this stage, China appears confident in its aid program and sensitive to analysis of it. In this atmosphere, the success of other countries’ efforts to encourage improvements in China’s approach is likely to be limited. Nonetheless, some modest efforts are worth pursuing over the long term. AusAID and other major donors should continue to try to engage China in joint projects. They should begin a discussion with China and Pacific governments on debt burdening. Pacific governments should report aid flows from all sources, including China. They should continue to urge China to improve the use of local labourers, contractors and, where possible, materials in its aid projects, and push it to coordinate its aid activities consistent with the Cairns Compact...|$|E
40|$|International actors face a dilemma. While {{agreements}} with other states can yield substantial benefits, actors are often left uncertain {{as to whether}} their potential partners will <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> their commitments. Actors attempt to reduce this uncertainty by assessing their partners reputation. Scholars characterize a states reputation with an international actor as {{the outcome of a}} specific sequence of events wherein the state (1) joins an agreement (2) demonstrates compliance or non-compliance with its obligations under the agreement (3) is observed demonstrating compliance/non-compliance by the international actor and (4) comes to have a reputation for reliability with that actor. But what happens when step 2 never occurs? For example, if a state is in a collective security agreement that effectively deters aggression: without the occurrence of conflict, a state has few opportunities to demonstrate its commitment to the agreement. In this case, outcomes are ambiguous. I call this membership in untested agreements. Contrary to extant models, membership in untested agreements is actually beneficial to a states reputation. The benefit of membership in an untested agreement comes from the signal provided by the states entry into the agreement. When a state enters an agreement, the other members of that agreement implicitly endorse the reliability of the state. I call this entry-endorsement. The benefit of entry endorsement depends on a variety of factors. Characteristics of the endorser influence the reputational benefit felt by the state, specifically, relationship between the endorser and subsequent actors. The role of the reputation observer 2 ̆ 7 s recent history also plays a role. I test the implications of this argument as they apply to two distinct issue areas: international investment and security agreements. Through this, I am able to compare how entry endorsements effects differ depending on the relationship between the endorser and subsequent state actors. When the subsequent actor is another state, then the influence of entry endorsement is substantial, but moderated by the similarity between the actor and the endorser. When the subsequent actor is a sub-state actor, then the influence of entry endorsement is conditioned by the endorsing states vulnerability to making a bad endorsement (i. e. entering into agreements that later fail) ...|$|E
40|$|Meta{{evaluation}} is {{the evaluation}} of an evaluation or evaluation system (Scriven, 1969). It serves as a mechanism to ensure quality in evaluation approaches and implementation. Operationally metaevaluation is defined as “the process of delineating, obtaining, and applying descriptive information and judgmental information – about the utility, feasibility, propriety, and accuracy of an evaluation and its systematic nature, competent conduct, integrity/honesty, respectfulness, and social responsibility to guide the evaluation and/or report its strengths and weaknesses” (Stufflebeam, 2001, p. 185). This study was a metaevaluation of an assessment system designed for accreditation requirements to support continuous improvement in teacher education programs at the University of Louisville. The study was intended {{to serve as a}} formative metaevaluation to identify strengths and weaknesses in the University of Louisville, College of Education and Human Development’s (CEHD) teacher education assessment system to support improvement of the system and better support continuous improvement of teacher education programs. The study took careful consideration of accountability and accreditation requirements, as well as evaluation and metaevalaution standards and practices. The study utilized Stufflebeam’s structure for metaevaluation (2001), which supports strategic and contextual analysis of the evaluation or evaluation system to address alignment with stakeholders needs. The study employed mixed methods to address four research questions. The research questions were focused on the application of data from the CEHD’s assessment system in driving program improvement and also {{the reliability and validity of}} instruments used in the assessment system. The first research question was focused on identifying the types of assessments that best support program improvement in teacher education. A qualitative case study analysis revealed a lack of explicit connections to data within the CEHD’s SLO action plans in which faculty identify plans for improving programs. Implied connections to data, included references to the 10 Unit Key Assessments, Hallmark Assessment Tasks (HATs), and indirect assessment data (QMS student satisfaction survey data. These results indicate that a variety of assessments support program improvement and are in alignment with CAEP standards (2013), the American Evaluation Association (2013), and the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation (2011), multiple measures are necessary in sound evaluation and evaluation systems. This study resulted in recommendations to modify SLO templates and action plan prompts to ensure more explicit connections of data to the action plans and even <b>follow-through</b> <b>on</b> action plans. The second research question was intended to identify how assessment data are used to drive continuous improvement in teacher education programs. The qualitative case study review of SLO action plans and reflections on previous year’s plans for improvement identified actions in the area of curriculum, faculty development, assessments, field and clinical experiences, and candidate performance. These findings demonstrated a real strength of the CEHD’s assessment system, as it demonstrates that the assessment system is driving continuous program improvement. One suggestion for improvement was increased documentation related to follow-through of actions within the current assessment system structures. The third research question pertained to reliability of instruments used across programs. The analysis revealed no concerns in regards to reliability of instruments across programs. The CEHD is encouraged to incorporate continued training and collaborative sessions to dissect and practice application of instruments to ensure reliability over time. This is especially important as programs revise instruments, assessors matriculate, and assessment context changes. The fourth and final research questions reviewed the construct validity of instruments in the CEHD assessment system aligned with the CEHD’s conceptual framework. The study revealed adequate construct validity related to measuring critical thinking, problem solving, and professional leadership, however also revealed potential concerns regarding discriminant validity. To address these findings, it has been recommended that the CEHD transition to 4 -point rubrics instead of the current 3 -point rubrics used in the assessment system. The study has outlined next steps in making that transition. In conclusion, this study identified strengths in the reliability of instrumentation and strategic application of data. Areas for improvement include revision of instruments to provide differentiation between performance levels and outcomes in the assessment system and revisions to SLO processes and templates to ensure more explicit connections between data and decision making. Ultimately, this metaevaluation has identified the most pertinent next steps for CEHD administrators, faculty, and staff in improving the assessment system to drive continuous program improvement in alignment with the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) and the Kentucky Education Professional Standards Board (EPSB) accreditation processes...|$|E
