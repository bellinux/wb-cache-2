This work characterizes the impact resistance and fracture toughness of several fiber-reinforced polyurethane composites. A series of Charpy impact tests were conducted to measure the impact strength and specific impact strength for five combinations of fiber reinforced elastomer composites, and epoxy matrix composites. The elastomers covered a range of <b>durometers</b> (<b>hardness).</b> Impact strength and specific impact strength of the composites were also compared to results from aluminum and steel specimens. For the same fiber type, all elastomer composites had greater impact strength than the epoxy composite. When specific impact energies are considered, the intermediate and rigid elastomer composite specimens have greater impact resistance than the baseline metal specimens and compared favorably with hot rolled 4140 steel. The fiberglass and intermediate hardness elastomer specimens resisted multiple Charpy impact tests with gradual loss of strength. Compact tension specimens of fiberglass using the same intermediate and rigid elastomer matrices and epoxy resin were fabricated and tested to acquire preliminary trends in fracture toughness.

50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and <b>durometers</b> (<b>hardness).</b> Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The type of washers used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R
40|$|Seals {{that provide}} the {{containment}} system interface between the packaging body and closure must function in high and low temperature environments, under dynamic and static loading conditions, and with different types of contained media. It {{is one of the}} most critical elements in the container since the container fails to meet regulations if the seal does not function properly. A research and testing program for seal materials was initiated at Sandia in 1988 with the goal of characterizing the behavior of seal materials commonly used in packages conditions as specified in the regulations (NRC IOCFR Part 71) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) 14. 5. The performance of elastomeric seals in undeformed closures at both high and low temperatures has been investigated (Bronowski 1995). Work has begun with this program to determine the response of elastomeric seals to fast acting dynamic deformations`` in the closure. The response of elastomeric o-ring seals during closure movements due to long-term deformations has already been characterized. What has not been well characterized are short-term closure movements with durations of only a few milliseconds that result in the so called ``burp`` release. Methods for generating this type of response in a repeatable manner had not been developed and standard leak detection equipment does not have a fast enough response time to measure these transient events. One factor which affects the length of the burp is the ability of the o-ring to quickly close the gap to prevent a significant leak. The dynamic characteristics of the elastomeric o-ring material including the dynamic spring modulus and internal damping are directly related to its ability to quickly close the gap. A set of tests designed to determine the dynamic properties for various material types and <b>durometers</b> (<b>hardness)</b> of elastomers that were both lubricated and dry at ambient temperature were conducted...|$|R

Materials to be tested are Buna-N vinyl, neoprene, nitrile, plain cork, neoprene and cork (backed cork), Viton, high-purity silicone, polyester, polysulfide and rubber hose.

Statistical methods were applied to the volume change, tensile strength and elongation tests to determine significant differences. The largest difference in volume swell was for backed cork, the largest difference in tensile and elongation was in neoprene, the largest difference in density was in nitrile, and plain cork exhibited the largest difference in <b>durometer</b> <b>hardness.</b> Viton and polyester exhibited no significant differences.

This project was created by Raytheon so they could develop anti-vibration housings for their electronic components that experience vibrations during flight. Team 16077 was successful in developing a printer. To achieve the result, the hardware and software of a commercial 3 D printer were modified. The entire existing extrusion system was replaced with a dual extruder system with a tubing design to be able to extrude multiple filaments (a soft and a hard filament) at once. The nozzle was replaced with a mixing nozzle so that the two filaments can create a range of durometers. The firmware of the printer had to be rewritten to accept G-Code commands to run both the extruders at once at varying ratios. A standalone graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to give the user an easy way of modifying their existing G-Code file to include the mixing ratios and commands.

It {{is a technique}} used to maintain speed without the rider taking his or her feet off of the skateboard. The motion itself is somewhat unorthodox and it requires the rider to be very in sync {{with his or her}} center of gravity and skateboard.

Boards made specifically for pumping usually consist of large longboard wheels which range anywhere from 60mm to 80mm.

Three elastomers were tested: CR rubber (C 873 - 70), FKM fluorocarbon rubber (Viton A), and MPQ silicone rubber (MIL-ZZ- 765, Class 2); and three thermoplastics were tested: polyhexamethylene adipamide (Zytel 42), polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon TFE), and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (Neoflon CTFE M 400 H). Post-aging changes in mass, dimensions, tensile strength, elongation at break, and <b>durometer</b> <b>hardness</b> were determined.

Attempts are underway to verify conclusively the occurrence of heterogeneous oxidation using a simple modulus profiling technique. Finally, the effect of aging at 620 kpa (90 psia) and 121 C (250 F) on ignition and combustion resistance was determined.

Then tested friction with a load of 15 kg for 60 minutes with dry test, spraying of water, with a standard testing SNI 09 - 2663 - 1992 then calculated wear and coefficient geseknya, and tested by using a <b>Durometer</b> <b>hardness.</b> From the research that the average wear of the brake lining Indopart lower and better than the brake with the sintering time variation in the friction test for 60 minutes. The coefficient of friction brake Indopart higher than the brake with the variation of sintering time on tests of friction for 60 minutes, the coefficient of friction Indopart high of 0. 6708 while approaching at 0. 6357 on the brake with a variation of 60 minutes at a temperature of 250 ° C on a test dry, Hardness values Indopart brake better than the brake with the variation of sintering time was 94 shored up, while the value of hardness approaching the brake with the variation of sintering time of 60 minutes dengn sintering temperature of 250 ° C for 88 shored Keywords: brake, sintering time, swipe test, hardnes...|$|E
