5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, <b>itraconazole,</b> ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine {{reduces the}} {{absorption}} of ketoconazole and <b>itraconazole</b> (which require a low pH).|$|E
25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. <b>Itraconazole</b> has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and <b>itraconazole</b> drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, <b>itraconazole,</b> disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, erythromycin, probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} described technique, known as sparing, involves using an antifungal agent to clear spores from airways adjacent to corticosteroid therapy. The antifungal aspect aims to reduce fungal causes of bronchial inflammation, whilst also minimising the dose of corticosteroid required {{to reduce the}} immune system’s input to disease progression. The strongest evidence (double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials) is for <b>itraconazole</b> twice daily for four months, which resulted in significant clinical improvement compared to placebo, and was mirrored in CF patients. Using <b>itraconazole</b> appears to outweigh the risk from long-term and high-dose prednisone. Newer triazole drugs—such as posaconazole or voriconazole—have not yet been studied in-depth through clinical trials in this context.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many benzodiazepines, {{pharmacokinetic}} interactions {{involving the}} P450 system {{have not been}} observed with temazepam. Temazepam shows no significant interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. <b>itraconazole,</b> erythromycin). Oral contraceptives may decrease the effectiveness of temazepam and speed up its elimination half-life.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole was {{discovered}} in 1976 at Janssen Pharmaceutica. It was initially introduced in 1977, followed by introduction in the United States in 1981. It was introduced as the prototypical drug of the imidazole antifungals. Oral ketoconazole has been replaced with oral <b>itraconazole</b> for many mycoses.|$|E
25|$|Lipid {{formulations}} of amphotericin B are usually recommended instead of amphotericin B deoxycholate {{because of a}} better adverse-effect profile. Amphotericin B {{can be used for}} severe infection during pregnancy. For children with disseminated or severe disease, amphotericin B deoxycholate can be used initially, followed by <b>itraconazole.</b>|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{antifungal}} susceptibility {{tests of}} the entire genus Apophysomyces have revealed that amphotericin B and posaconazole are the most effective against A. variabilis infections when compared to <b>itraconazole,</b> ravuconazole, and voriconazole. Testing data has also showed that caspofungin and anidulafungin are inactive antifungal agents against all strains of the genus Apophysomyces.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{around the}} treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis is poor. A number of topical treatments {{may be used for}} cutaneous leishmaniasis. Which treatments are effective depends on the strain, with topical paromomycin effective for L. major, L. tropica, L. mexicana, L. panamensis, and L. braziliensis. Pentamidine is effective for L. guyanensis. Oral fluconazole or <b>itraconazole</b> appears effective in L. major and L. tropica.|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{benefits}} of using corticosteroids {{in the short term}} are notable, and improve quality of life scores, there are cases of ABPA converting to invasive aspergillosis whilst undergoing corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, in concurrent use with <b>itraconazole,</b> there is potential for drug interaction and the induction of Cushing syndrome in rare instances. Metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis, can also be induced.|$|E
25|$|This species shows {{elevated}} {{resistance to}} antifungal drugs; however, four classes of drugs (<b>itraconazole</b> (a triazole), voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B) demonstrate fungicidal effectiveness {{that is most}} pronounced in combination. One promising regimen combines voriconazole and caspofungin. Although disseminated infection carries a high mortality rate, the response of skin to treatment varies depending {{on the degree of}} drug susceptibility exhibited by the particular strain.|$|E
25|$|Ketoconazole has {{activity}} against {{many kinds}} of fungi that may cause human disease, such as Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces (although it is not active against Aspergillus). First synthesized in 1977, ketoconazole was the first orally-active azole antifungal medication. However, ketoconazole has largely been replaced as a first-line systemic antifungal medication by other azole antifungal agents, such as <b>itraconazole,</b> because of ketoconazole's greater toxicity, poorer absorption, and more limited spectrum of activity.|$|E
25|$|As an antifungal, {{ketoconazole}} is structurally {{similar to}} imidazole, and {{interferes with the}} fungal synthesis of ergosterol, a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol. Lower doses of fluconazole and <b>itraconazole</b> are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, {{as they have been}} found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of azoles is the triazoles, which {{includes}} fluconazole, <b>itraconazole,</b> and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the triazoles involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the triazoles bind to the heme group. The triazoles {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|E
25|$|Where {{available}} and tolerated by the patient, antifungal drugs are indicated {{as the primary}} treatment of sporotrichosis. For cutaneous infection <b>itraconazole</b> or terbinafine are the primary treatment with fluconazole being recommended if primary antifungals are not well-tolerated. When infection is disseminated throughout the body, Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. To completely clear the fungus, the course of treatment generally lasts from 3 to 6 months. In vitro susceptibility to antifungal drugs {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the growth phase (hyphal or yeast) of the fungus.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, several {{compounds}} (antifungals, fungicides, and biocides) where {{shown to}} effectively inhibit {{the growth of}} P.destructans including benzalkonium chloride, chloroacetoxyquinoline, chloroxine, ciclopirox olamine, econazole, phenylmercuric acetate, pyrithione zinc and sulconazole. The same study showed that P.destructans was sensitive to Amphotericin B, <b>itraconazole,</b> ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole, while the fungus had some resistance to anidulafungin, caspofungin, flucytosine and micafungin. A recent study (2014) identified several volatile organic compounds (benzaldehyde, benzothiazole, decanal, nonanal, N,N-dimethyloctylamine, and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol) that were previously identified from fungistatic soils, which demonstrated inhibition of both mycelial extension and growth from conidia.|$|E
25|$|Bromazepam is {{reported}} to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Dr. Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since <b>itraconazole,</b> a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at Solvay Duphar B.V.'s Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, <b>itraconazole,</b> ketoconazole, nefazodone, cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 a small {{outbreak}} of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in North Carolina hospitals, involving five women who received steroid injections for pain management. In one of women the infection wasn't evident until 152 days after injection of the contaminated solution. Isolates from these patients were {{found by the}} FDA to be susceptible to all of voriconazole, <b>itraconazole,</b> and amphotericin B. In one patient the infection caused sacroiliitis, while the remaining four developed meningitis. Meningitis eventually caused death in one patient, while voriconazole was successful in treating infection in the four other patients. The outbreak was traced back to a single compounding pharmacy, which was found by the FDA to have inadequately controlled for sterility of its products.|$|E
25|$|Flucytosine by {{mouth is}} used for the {{treatment}} of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of Candida or Cryptococcus neoformans. It can also be used for the treatment of chromomycosis (chromoblastomycosis), if susceptible strains cause the infection. Flucytosine must not be used as a sole agent in life-threatening fungal infections due to relatively weak antifungal effects and fast development of resistance, but rather in combination with amphotericin B and/or azole antifungals such as fluconazole or <b>itraconazole.</b> Minor infections such as candidal cystitis may be treated with flucytosine alone. In some countries, treatment with slow intravenous infusions for no more than a week is also a therapeutic option, particular if the disease is life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as <b>itraconazole,</b> telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, bosentan, fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} infections {{of the mouth}} {{include the use of}} {{chlorhexidine}} mouth wash in those with poor immune function and washing out the mouth following the use of inhaled steroids. Little evidence supports probiotics for either prevention or treatment even among those with frequent vaginal infections. For infections of the mouth, treatment with topical clotrimazole or nystatin is usually effective. By mouth or intravenous fluconazole, <b>itraconazole,</b> or amphotericin B may be used if these do not work. A number of topical antifungal medications may be used for vaginal infections including clotrimazole. In those with widespread disease, an echinocandin such as caspofungin or micafungin is used. A number of weeks of intravenous amphotericin B may be used as an alternative. In certain groups at very high risk, antifungal medications may be used preventatively.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} aspect of treatment is improving denture hygiene, i.e. removing the denture at night, cleaning and disinfecting it, and storing it overnight in an antiseptic solution. This is important as the denture is usually infected with C. albicans which will cause re-infection if it is not removed. Substances which are used include solutions of alkaline peroxides, alkaline hypochlorites (e.g. hypochlorite, which may over time corrode metal components of dental appliances), acids (e.g. benzoic acid), yeast lytic enzymes and proteolytic enzymes (e.g. alcalase protease). The other aspect of treatment involves resolution of the mucosal infection, for which topical antifungal medications are used (e.g. nystatin, amphotericin, miconazole, fluconazole or <b>itraconazole).</b> Often an antimicrobial mouthwash such as chlorhexidine is concurrently prescribed. Possible underlying disease (diabetes, HIV) should be treated where possible.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and nefazodone {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of <b>itraconazole,</b> clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|These are {{antifungal}} drugs. [...] <b>Itraconazole</b> {{is currently}} the drug of choice and is significantly more effective than fluconazole. Fluconazole should be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate <b>itraconazole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|PPIs reduce {{absorption}} of antifungals (<b>itraconazole</b> and ketoconazole) [...] and possibly increase digoxin in plasma ...|$|E
2500|$|Ketoconazole and <b>Itraconazole</b> have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, [...] fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, <b>itraconazole,</b> ketoconazole, nefazodone, [...] rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
2500|$|A {{diagnosis}} of E. dermatitidis {{infection of the}} CNS can only be reliably achieved following biopsy. For systemic infections there are few treatment options, and E. dermatitidis is described as [...] "notoriously resistant" [...] to antifungal drugs. During the North Carolina outbreak, treatment with voriconazole was effective in four out of the five patients, and all of voriconazole, <b>itraconazole,</b> and amphotericin B {{were found to be}} effective in vitro. Terbinafine has also been found to be effective in vitro, and combinations of antifungal drugs can have a synergistic effect against E. dermatitidis. A 2012 article found that of reported cases, 44% of patients responded to amphotericin B treatment, 50% responded to voriconazole treatment, and 71.4% responded to <b>itraconazole</b> therapy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} way to target this pathway is {{modulate}} SMO. [...] Antagonist and agonist of SMO have already shown {{to affect the}} pathway regulation downstream. The most clinically advanced SMO targeting agents are cyclopamine-competitive. <b>Itraconazole</b> (Sporanox) {{has also been shown}} to target SMO through a mechanism distinct from cyclopamine and vismodegib. <b>Itraconazole</b> inhibits SMO in the presence of mutations conferring resistance to vismodegib and other cyclopamine-competitive antagonists, like IPI-926 and Novartis' LDE-225. PTCH and Gli3 (5E1) antibodies are also a way to regulate the pathway. [...] A downstream effector and strong transcriptional activator siRNA Gli1 has been used to inhibit cell growth and promote apoptosis. Arsenic trioxide (Trisenox) has also been shown to inhibit hedgehog signaling by interfering with Gli function and transcription.|$|E
2500|$|On the whole, oral {{fluconazole}} and intravenous amphotericin B {{are used}} in progressive or disseminated disease, or in immunocompromised individuals. Amphotericin B {{used to be the}} only available treatment, although now there are alternatives, including <b>itraconazole</b> or ketoconazole may be used for milder disease. Fluconazole is the preferred medication for coccidioidal meningitis, due to its penetration into CSF. Intrathecal or intraventricular amphotericin B therapy is used if infection persists after fluconazole treatment. <b>Itraconazole</b> is used for cases that involve treatment of infected person's bones and joints. The antifungal medications posaconazole and voriconazole have also been used to treat coccidioidomycosis. [...] Because the symptoms of valley fever are similar to the common flu and other respiratory diseases, it is important for public health professionals {{to be aware of the}} rise of valley fever and the specifics of diagnosis. [...] Greyhound dogs often get valley fever as well, and their treatment regimen involves 6–12 months of Ketoconazole, to be taken with food.|$|E
2500|$|The less toxic and {{generally}} more effective triazole antifungal agents fluconazole and <b>itraconazole</b> are usually preferred for systemic use. In 2013 the European Medicines Agency's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended that a ban {{be imposed on}} the use of oral ketoconazole for systemic use in humans throughout the European Union, after concluding that the risk of serious liver injury from systemic ketoconazole outweighs its benefits. [...] The oral formulation of ketoconazole was discontinued in Australia in 2013 and in China in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common fungal {{diseases}} in dogs is ringworm, or dermatophytosis, an infection of the skin, hair, or nails. [...] There are three fungal species that cause ringworm in dogs. [...] About 70 percent of infections are caused by Microsporum canis, 20 percent by M. gypseum, and 10 percent by Trichophyton mentagrophytes. [...] Signs include hair loss and scaling of the skin. [...] Treatment for localized ringworm is not always necessary as the disease is self-limiting, but the cliinical course can be shortened by using topical miconazole or clotrimazole. [...] Generalized infections, most commonly seen in immunocompromised dogs, can be treated with oral antifungal drugs such as griseofulvin or <b>itraconazole.</b> [...] Infection can spread to humans.|$|E
2500|$|Effective {{clinical}} {{treatments of}} infections caused by Exserohilum {{are still very}} scarce. Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, <b>itraconazole</b> and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent drug repurposing screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints. It {{has also been shown}} to cross the blood-brain barrier and thus has potential as a treatment for CNS infections as well, though not reaching levels as high as the azoles.|$|E
50|$|Treatment with <b>itraconazole</b> {{will need}} to {{continue}} {{for at least a}} year in severe cases, while in acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, 6 to 12 weeks treatment is sufficient. Alternatives to <b>itraconazole</b> are posaconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole. Individuals taking <b>itraconazole</b> are monitored for hepatic function.|$|E
50|$|<b>Itraconazole</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} as an anti-cancer agent. A small randomized clinical trial found that patient survival was increased when <b>itraconazole</b> was added to pemetrexed. Median survival for the patients in the study who received both <b>itraconazole</b> and pemetrexed was 32 months, while median survival for patients who only received pemetrexed was 8 months.|$|E
