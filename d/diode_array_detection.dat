40|$|Four {{mammalian}} metallothioneins (MTs), rabbit liver MT (RL MT), rabbit liver MT- 1 (RL MT- 1) and rabbit liver MT- 2 (RL MT- 2) {{and horse}} kidney MT (HK MT), weresubjected to capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with on-line <b>diode</b> <b>array</b> <b>detection</b> (DAD) by using tris-borate buffer at neutral or nearly neutral conditions thus giving {{information about the}} putative isoforms in conditions also found in tissues. The MTs were found to exhibit a different polymorphism. Rabbit liver MT exhibited 3 main peaks and horse kidney 5 main peaks. Isoform abundance between batches was found to vary noticeably. Differences in electrophoretic behaviour were observed. As expected, the 2 -charged main peak of RL MT- 2 showed highest electrophoretic mobility. Main peak of RL MT- 1 and two of rabbitliver MT had lower electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to single charge. Two later migrating horse kidney MT peaks had nearly similar electrophoretic behaviour as the single charged rabbit liver MT peaks. interestingly, horse kidney MT exhibited also peaks with lower electrophoretic mobilities and different behaviour than the other peaks observed. The ultra violet (UV) spectra obtained by using <b>diode</b> <b>array</b> <b>detection</b> (DAD) showed clear difference {{in the structure of}} these peaks compared to other peaks observed. These peaks showed no or nearly no absorbance ate wavelenghts 225 and 250 nm that corresponds to cation-thiol bondage, Zn-thiol and Cd-thiol, respectively. We can therefore assume, that horse kidney MT sample contains components that are in apothionein form or only partially saturated with metals. The use of <b>diode</b> <b>array</b> <b>detection</b> appears to be a good tool for a quick identification of apothioneins and partially metal-saturated metallothioneins. JRC.
