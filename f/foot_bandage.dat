50|$|Veterinary {{treatment}} includes {{taking the}} shoe off, cutting the hoof clean and opening the nail hole to allow drainage. If {{the horse is}} in pain anesthesia of the nerve is given. The hole is irrigated and the hole can be packed with iodine-soaked cotton. Superficial infections may only need one treatment. The horse can be given an antiseptic <b>foot</b> <b>bandage</b> for 3-4 days and then be shod if the lameness is gone. The prognosis is usually good provided that minimal damage occurs to vatial structures of the foot. Tetanus prophylaxis is used for unvaccinated horses.|$|E
5000|$|A 337 epitaph {{inscription}} in the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le Mura {{celebrates the}} late Cinnamius Opas, lector {{of a church}} known as Titulus Fasciolae; the name has traditionally been explained as the place where St. Peter lost the <b>foot</b> <b>bandage</b> (fasciola) that wrapped the wounds caused by his chains, {{on his way to}} escape the Mamertine Prison. [...] In the acts of the synod of Pope Symmachus, in 499, the Titulus Fasciolae is recorded as served by five priests. This same building is recorded as titulus Sanctorum Nerei et Achillei in 595; therefore the dedications to Saints Nereus and Achilleus, two soldiers and martyrs of the 4th century, must date to the sixth century.|$|E

Now, the young lady {{happened}} to be lame, and had to have her <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged</b> up every day; so she kept a basketful of bandages, all nicely rolled and ready. The little girl liked to play with this basket, and one day, when she thought no one saw her, she took one of the rolls without asking leave, and put it in her pocket." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{intended}} to go to Checkshill that day, but my bruised ankle was too swollen for that to be possible. I sat indoors in the ill-lit downstairs kitchen, with my <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged,</b> and mused darkly and read. My dear old mother waited on me, and her brown eyes watched me and wondered at my black silences, my frowning preoccupations. I had not told her how it was my ankle came to be bruised and my clothes muddy. She had brushed my clothes {{in the morning before}} I got up.|$|R
50|$|It is {{summer in}} Sweden, and the Andersson family {{has decided to}} go on {{vacation}} to Greece. The trip {{turns out to be}} too expensive, especially when Håkan destroys a shelf in the travel agency. Rudolf decides that they should go on a caravan holiday instead. When they start the journey, Karin runs over Rudolf's foot with the caravan and they have to go into a hospital. There, Rudolf gets his <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged</b> by Lenny, a medic who is pretending to be a doctor. At the hospital Sune meets a girl named Cornelia and falls in love with her, but he makes a fool of himself at a candy vending machine.|$|R

50|$|With {{the change}} in dress and bicycle, Londonderry was {{determined}} to complete her world trip, even though she only had eleven months {{to make it back}} to Chicago. She followed her route back to New York City, and on November 24, 1894, she boarded the French liner La Touraine, destined for Le Havre on France's north coast. She arrived on December 3 and became wrapped up in bureaucracy. Her bike was confiscated by custom officials, her money was taken, and the French press wrote insulting articles about her appearance. She managed to free herself and rode from Paris to Marseille. Despite being held up and bad weather, she arrived in two weeks by cycling and train with one <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged</b> and propped up on her handlebars due to an injury on the road.|$|R

25|$|Poirot visits Mertonshire, {{where an}} old friend, Lady Carmichael, gives him {{details of the}} Grant family. All the girls {{are going to the}} bad as their father cannot control them. They keep company with Hawker, who has an {{unpleasant}} reputation, as does another of his 'lady friends', Mrs Larkin. Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair with his <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged</b> up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against whoever is getting his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host.|$|R
5000|$|After {{discussions with}} Edward Hayes and William Cox, captain and master of Golden Hind, Gilbert decided on 31 August to return. The fleet made good speed, {{clearing}} Cape Race after two days, {{and was soon}} clear of land. Gilbert had stepped on a nail on the Squirrel and, on 2 September, went aboard Golden Hind to have his <b>foot</b> <b>bandaged</b> and to discuss means of keeping the two little ships together on their Atlantic crossing. Gilbert refused to leave Squirrel and after a strong storm they had a spell of clear weather and made fair progress. Gilbert went aboard Golden Hind again, visited with Hayes, and insisted once more on returning to Squirrel, even though Hayes insisted she was over-gunned and unsafe for sailing. Nearly 900 miles away from Cape Race, near the Azores, they encountered high waves of heavy seas, [...] "breaking short and high Pyramid wise", said Hayes.|$|R

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{conducted}} to compare oxytetracycline to three nonantibiotic therapies using bandage protocols {{for the treatment of}} hairy heel warts. Affected <b>feet</b> were <b>bandaged</b> for 4 days with either of the four products. Over a 28 -day period following bandage removal, heel warts on 44 cows (11 per treatment group) were evaluated based on size, degree of pain, color, and lesion appearance. No differences were detected among treatments, suggesting that nonantibiotic therapies used in bandage protocols may be as effective as oxytetracycline...|$|R

50|$|With an {{arm in a}} sling, a <b>foot</b> in <b>bandages,</b> and his leg dragging, Damien knew {{death was}} near. He was {{bedridden}} on 23 March 1889, and on 30 March he made a general confession. Damien died of leprosy at 8:00 a.m. on 15 April 1889, aged 49. The next day, after Mass said by Father Moellers at St. Philomena's, the whole settlement followed the funeral cortège to the cemetery. Damien was laid to rest under the same pandanus tree where he first slept upon his arrival on Molokai.|$|R
40|$|In Step was a {{wearable}} artwork {{consisting of}} a pair of embroidered <b>foot</b> <b>bandages</b> and an actuator ‘cushion’ embedded with 15 electromechanical actuator pistons. The bandage was embedded with woven, soft and flexible fabric sensors - interconnected with metallic connecting threads, fasteners and a wireless interface (in a final form). When wrapped around a foot and lower leg the sensors sat on the ball of the toes and heel. This ‘wearable interface’ was then connected wirelessly to a soft sculptural form, which employed actuators to tap gently in response to the qualities of the walk detected by the soft sensors. In this way the ‘tread qualities’ of the walker could then be felt by someone else holding this device against their stomach – thereby allowing pairs of participants to ‘feel’ the tactile qualities of the other's walk. The work was presented both as a working object and via a short videorecorded performance. [...] - In Step generated innovative new approaches to interface and sensor embedded clothing/footware whilst also creating an evocative vehicle to comment upon contemporary Post Colonial theories of weight and groundedness – particularly the psycho-geographical ‘separation’ from the landscape that inspired Paul Carter’s “environmentally grounded poetics”. The work’s final form also suggested critical new directions for responsive clothing and footwear for the emerging genre of smart textiles...|$|R
60|$|And one {{of those}} white parcels was the paper I held in my hands, as I sat with a <b>bandaged</b> <b>foot</b> on the steel fender in that dark {{underground}} kitchen of my mother's, clean roused from my personal troubles by the yelp of the headlines.

50|$|Umiliana {{fell ill}} {{and she knew}} her end was close. Her confessor was at her bedside as she died in the dawn of 19 May 1246 on a Saturday. Her <b>feet</b> were <b>bandaged</b> before people filed in to view her mortal remains. Her remains were interred in one {{location}} though later moved behind a wall near the stairs of the pulpit. Her brother Arrigo arranged for a chapel to in the basilica to receive her remains. A total of 47 miracles were recorded {{in the period of}} 1246 to 1249 and she is perceived to be the first cloistered third order Franciscan in Florence.|$|R

50|$|Footwraps (also {{referred}} to as <b>foot</b> cloths, rags, <b>bandages</b> or bindings, or by their Russian name portyanki) are rectangular pieces of cloth that are worn wrapped around the feet to avoid chafing, absorb sweat and improve the foothold. Footwraps were worn with boots before socks became widely available, and remained in use by armies in Eastern Europe {{until the beginning of}} the 21st century.|$|R
25|$|First, {{each foot}} would be soaked {{in a warm}} mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was {{intended}} to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut {{back as far as}} possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the <b>foot.</b> Cotton <b>bandages,</b> 3m long and 5cm wide (10ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.|$|R

60|$|The {{village was}} an inland one, far removed alike from the roar and the {{influences}} of the briny ocean. It must have cost the sailor some pain to reach it; for he walked with a crutch, {{and one of his}} bare <b>feet</b> was <b>bandaged,</b> and scarcely touched the ground at each step. He looked dusty and fatigued, yet he was a stout, well-favoured, robust young fellow, so that his hapless condition was evidently the result of recent misfortune and accident--not of prolonged sickness or want. He wore the picturesque blue jacket, wide trousers, and straw hat of a man-of-war's man; and exposed a large amount of brown chest beneath his blue flannel shirt, the broad collar of which was turned well over.|$|R
60|$|Columbine bade her a hurried good-by and ventured {{forth with}} misgivings. And almost {{around the corner}} of the second cabin, which she had to pass, and before she had time to recover her composure, she saw Wilson Moore, hobbling along on a crutch, holding a <b>bandaged</b> <b>foot</b> off the ground. He had seen her; he was hurrying to avoid a meeting, or to get behind the corrals there before she {{observed}} him.|$|R
50|$|After {{winning the}} Kentucky Derby Trial Stakes on April 28, 1943, Jones told Wright that if Count Fleet makes one mistake, we'll beat him. Ocean Wave's left front <b>foot</b> was heavily <b>bandaged</b> {{on the morning}} of April 29, 1943. Jones remarked that he had no {{intention}} of removing it from its packing until April 30. The colt was limping following his win in the Derby Trial. Jones described the injury as a flesh wound only, with no damage to the bone having been sustained. Reporter Al Wolf noted that Ocean Wave had a cracked heel prior to competing.|$|R
60|$|In happy {{ignorance of}} the changes caused by his sudden and tragic end, Captain Flower sat at the open window of his shabby Walworth lodging, smoking an after-breakfast pipe, and gazing idly into the dismal, {{littered}} yard beneath. Time—owing to his injured <b>foot,</b> which, neatly <b>bandaged</b> at a local dispensary, rested upon a second chair—hung rather heavily upon his hands as he sat thinking of ways and means of spending {{the next six months}} profitably and pleasantly. He had looked at the oleographs on the walls until he was tired, and even the marvels of the wax fruit under a cracked glass shade began to pall upon him.|$|R

500|$|Tales {{of extreme}} {{sensitivity}} are infrequent in world culture {{but a few}} have been recorded. The 11th-century Kathasaritsagara by Somadeva tells {{of a young man}} who claims to be especially fastidious about beds. After sleeping in a bed on top of seven mattresses, and newly made with clean sheets, the young man rises in great pain. A crooked red mark is discovered on his body, and upon investigation a hair is found on the bottom-most mattress of the bed. [...] An Italian tale called [...] "The Most Sensitive Woman" [...] tells of a woman whose <b>foot</b> is <b>bandaged</b> after a jasmine petal falls upon it. The Brothers Grimm included a [...] "Princess on the Pea" [...] tale in an edition of their Kinder- und Hausmärchen, but removed it after they discovered that it belonged to the Danish literary tradition. A few folk tales feature a boy discovering a pea or a bean assumed to be of great value. After the boy enters a castle and is given a bed of straw for the night he tosses and turns in his sleep, attempting to guard his treasure. Some observers are persuaded that the boy is restless because he is unaccustomed to sleeping on straw, and is therefore of aristocratic blood.|$|R
60|$|But Danny didn't cry. My, no! He laughed instead. Peter Rabbit was so {{surprised}} that he stopped {{to see what had}} come over Danny Meadow Mouse. When he saw the <b>bandaged</b> <b>foot</b> and heard how Danny had twisted his ankle Peter Rabbit sat right down on the doorstep beside Danny Meadow Mouse and told him how sorry he was, for happy-go-lucky Peter Rabbit is very tender-hearted. Then he told Danny all about the wonderful things he had seen in his travels, and of all the scrapes he had gotten into. When Peter Rabbit finally started off home Danny Meadow Mouse still sat on his doorstep. But no longer was he lonely. He watched Old Mother West Wind trying to gather her Merry Little Breezes into her big bag to take to their home behind the Purple Hills, and he laughed right out when he saw her catch the last mischievous Little Breeze and tumble him, heels over head, in with the others.|$|R
