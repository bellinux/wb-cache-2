The data as to the weight on water, trim, and relative resistance for each model are plotted nondimensionally and are referenced both to the total weight and to the weight on water.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study for trimming the {{computational fluid dynamics}} model of a complete helicopter to free flight conditions by coupling it to a comprehensive rotor code. Rotor controls and fuselage pitch and yaw attitude are set as <b>free</b> <b>trim</b> variables to realize load equilibrium for a steady cruise flight condition. Through weak fluid-structure coupling aeroelastic effects at the main rotor are accounted for, while fuselage loads are transferred in form of temporal mean values. Aerodynamic simulation of the Eurocopter EC 145 helicopter fuselage is characterized by separated and partially irregular flow, and interference between rotor and fuselage renders flight mechanics rich in non-linearity. Special attention therefore {{is given to the}} convergence rate, precision and stability of the expanded trim scheme. The work is motivated by an expected gain in the prediction capability for helicopter performance and interactional loads from exploiting high-fidelity aerodynamic modeling simultaneously for flight attitude prediction.

40|$|Large {{models of}} the Mark V and Mark VI floats used for single float {{seaplanes}} (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) models 41 -A and 41 -B, respectively) were tested in the NACA tank to provide general test data for typical single floats and a basis for possible improvements of their form. The resistance of model 41 -B was {{greater than that of}} model 41 -A, either when <b>free</b> to <b>trim</b> or at the best trim angle for each. The resistance of model 35 -B (a pointed step hull tested <b>free</b> to <b>trim)</b> was less than either of the models at the hump speed, greater at intermediate planing speeds, and less at the speeds and loads near get-away, although the spray was generally worse owing to the absence of transverse flare. The results of the fixed-trim tests of model 41 -A were cross plotted to obtain data at the angle for zero trimming moment and at the best trim angle. The trims assumed by models 41 -A and 41 -B, when tested <b>free</b> to <b>trim,</b> were found to be excessive at the hump speed. The corresponding trim of model 35 -B was found to be approximately 3 degrees lower because of the lower angle of afterbody keel used in this model, and the maximum hump resistance was 15 percent lower...|$|R
40|$|The {{riding qualities}} of an {{aircraft}} with low wing loading {{can be improved}} by freeing the wing to rotate about its spanwise axis.

The coordinates of the peaks of the bow-spray blisters, with reference to the model, were measured at low speeds, and it was found that the model with the low dead rise at the bow had the lowest blisters.

40|$|An {{experimental}} Towing-tank {{method for}} testing a seaplane {{was developed and}} implemented. The defined test programme represents a complete experimental task for study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flying boat during take-off. A specific test-rig was designed by CNR-INSEAN {{in collaboration with the}} customer EDI, who took care of its development and implementation during the test. In particular various simulators of the aerodynamic components of the aircraft were designed because wings and control planes were not modelled. In the Low Speed Tests the model was "free to trim", whereas in the High Speed Tests it was restrained from pitching, i. e. runs were performed at a fixed <b>trim.</b> <b>Free</b> to <b>trim</b> characteristics of the seaplane were determined below hump, while resistance and pitching moment characteristics in the planing region were plotted in contours maps up to the take-off. The Longitudinal Stability measurements characterize the stability limits of the flying boat during take-off. The tests were performed in the high speed region, from hump to take-off, with the "free to trim" model. When oscillations occured, the measured damping moment M was combined with the calculated angular velocity in pitch "q", providing the pitch damping moment rate dM/dq. The trim values corresponding to the porpoising limits were plotted on the performance contours maps, and this completes the hydrodynamic characteristics of the seaplane during the take-off...|$|R

Additionally, Finite Element Method in Time has been developed in various versions like time-marching framework, Galerkin framework, Rayleigh-Ritz framework, and mixed formulation. Recently, this method was applied to the rotorcraft trim problem to obtain linearized solutions. The rotorcraft trim problem consists of trying to find a period solution for period-coefficient, differential equations subject to side constraints where certain force and momentum balance equations are forced to be equal to zero. There are <b>free</b> (or <b>trim)</b> parameters that are chosen to meet these side constraints.

40|$|The <b>free</b> wing/free <b>trimmer</b> {{concept was}} {{analytically}} studied in order to: (1) compare the {{fore and aft}} trimmer configurations {{on the basis of}} equal lift capability, rather than equal area; (2) assess the influence of tip mounted aft trimmers, both free and fixed, on the lateral directional modes and turbulence responses; (3) examine the feasibility of using differential tip mounted trimmer deflection for lateral control; (4) determine the effects of independent fuselage attitude on the lateral directional behavior; and (5) estimate the influence of wing sweep on dynamic behavior and structural weight. Results indicate that the forward trimmer concept is feasible with the reduced size examined, but it remains inferior to the aft trimmer in every respect except structural weight. Differential motion of the aft trimmer is found to provide powerful lateral control; while the effect of fuselage deck angle is a reduction of the dutch roll damping ratio for nose-down attitudes...|$|R

The test vehicle was a single engine light aircraft modified with an experimental set of upper surface spoilers and lower surface dive brakes similar to the type used on sailplanes. The lift, drag, stick <b>free</b> stability, <b>trim,</b> and dynamic response characteristics of four different spoiler/dive brake configurations were determined. Tests also were conducted, under {{a wide range of}} flight conditions and with pilots of various experience levels, to determine the most favorable methods of spoiler control and to evaluate how spoilers might best be used during the approach and landing task. The effects of approach path angle, approach airspeed, and pilot technique using throttle/spoiler integrated control were investigated for day, night, VFR, and IFR approaches and landings. The test results indicated that spoilers offered significant improvements in the vehicle's performance and flying qualities for all elements of the approach and landing task, provided a suitable method of control was available...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the resistance and running attitude are key steps {{in the process of}} hull design and manufacturing. The predictions have traditionally relied on model testing, but this technique is both expensive and time consuming. In this study, the performance of CFD simulations of planing hulls is evaluated using two commercial software: ANSYS FLUENT, developed by ANSYS, Inc., and STAR-CCM+, developed by CD-adapco. This was done by predicting the steady resistance, sinkage and trim angle of one semi-planing and one planing hull in calm, unrestricted water. The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the SST k-! turbulence model was used along with the volume of fluid method to describe the two-phase flow of water and air around the hull. Furthermore, a two degrees of freedom solver was used together with dynamic mesh techniques to describe the fluid-structure interaction. The simulations were performed with both fixed and <b>free</b> sinkage and <b>trim</b> to make careful comparisons of the software and with experimental data. The results from the fixed sinkage and trim simulations of the planing hull in FLUENT and STAR-CCM+ show a good consistency. However, there is {{a significant difference in the}} pressure resistance obtained from the two codes that could not be explained. The <b>free</b> sinkage and <b>trim</b> simulations were mainly conducted in STAR-CCM+ due to problems with obtaining a stable solution in FLUENT. Froude numbers between 0. 447 and 1. 79 were simulated and the results follow the same trends as what is seen in the experimental data. The calculated resistance, sinkage and trim angle show good correspondence to experimental data in the planing region, where the errors of the predicted values are below 10 %...|$|R
40|$|A 1 / 10 -size {{model of}} the hull of the French flying boat Latecoere 521 was tested in the NACA tank. This model {{is one of a}} series of models of the hulls of actual flying boats of both foreign and {{domestic}} type that are being tested in the NACA tank to provide information regarding the water characteristics of a variety of forms of hull and to illustrate the development of present-day types of flying boat. The lines and the offsets of the hull were obtained from the manufacturer through the Paris office of the NACA. The form of the stub-wing stabilizers was not furnished and, therefore, the model was tested without them. The model was tested <b>free</b> to <b>trim</b> at the design initial load (initial load coefficient of 0. 428) and by the general method at load coefficients from 0. 025 to 0. 6. The spray characteristics of the model are good. The form of the bow would be particularly desirable for rough water use. The interference of the afterbody and the tail extension is excessive, causing very high resistance at high speeds.

The structural dynamics analysis is correlated against both experimental data and detailed finite element results. Correlation of rotating natural frequencies of coupled composite box-beams is generally within 5 - 10 percent.

40|$|A {{new data}} {{analysis}} technique for {{the identification of}} static and dynamic aerodynamic stability coefficients from wind tunnel test video data is presented. This new technique was applied to video data obtained during a parachute wind tunnel test program conducted {{in support of the}} Mars Exploration Rover Mission. Total angle-of-attack data obtained from video images were used to determine the static pitching moment curve of the parachute. During the original wind tunnel test program the static pitching moment curve had been determined by forcing the parachute to a specific total angle-of -attack and measuring the forces generated. It is shown with the new technique that this parachute, when <b>free</b> to rotate, <b>trims</b> at an angle-of-attack two degrees lower than was measured during the forced-angle tests. An attempt was also made to extract pitch damping information from the video data. Results suggest that the parachute is dynamically unstable at the static trim point and tends to become dynamically stable away from the trim point. These trends are in agreement with limit-cycle-like behavior observed in the video. However, the chaotic motion of the parachute produced results with large uncertainty bands...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} model for welfare assessment in laying hens was constructed. This model, named FOWEL (fowl welfare), uses {{a description of}} the production system as input and produces a welfare score as output. To assess the welfare status a formalized procedure based on scientific knowledge is applied. In FOWEL the production system is described using 25 attributes (space per hen, beak <b>trimming,</b> <b>free</b> range, etc.), each with two or more levels, together defining the characteristics of a production system. A weighting factor is used for each attribute, based on the available scientific knowledge {{of the effects of the}} attribute levels on the welfare aspects. The welfare score of a production system results from the attribute levels combined with the weighting factors. The results show that feeding level, space per hen, perches, water availability and nests were the most important attributes. The attribute free range was of minor importance. FOWEL includes a description of 22 production systems. The welfare score of cage systems was low, of barn and aviary systems medium, and of organic systems high. The presence of a free range resulted only in a small improvement in the welfare score...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the SHANEL research project (partly supported by the French DGAC and the German BMWA) which was started at the end of 2006 between the German and French Aerospace Research Centres DLR and ONERA, the University of Stuttgart and the two national helicopter manufacturers, Eurocopter and Eurocopter Germany. This program represents the continuation of the binational CHANCE project, involving the same partners. The objective of the project is to enhance and further validate the CFD tools: the structured multi-block elsA software of Onera and the unstructured TAU code of DLR, for computing the aerodynamics of the complete trimmed helicopter, accounting for the blade elasticity by coupling with blade dynamics and structural mechanics tools. A coupling activity between the FLOWer code of DLR and the HOST tool of Eurocopter is also completed to achieve the <b>free</b> flight <b>trim</b> of a complete helicopter. In this program particular attention is being given to wake conservation, to the modelling of elaborated complex shapes such as rotor hubs and consequently to interactional phenomena, with the global objective of improving the prediction of helicopter performance and noise. Rotorcraft noise prediction chains were rationalized, enhanced and compared. The validation activity of the flow solvers elsA and TAU is progressing from the CHANCE results and is now focussing on more complex problems such as the simulation of a rotating rotor head mounted on its fuselage, of a complete helicopter in steady mode through the use of actuator discs and engine boundary conditions, the time-accurate simulation of a complete trimmed helicopter in forward-flight, and the numerical simulation of Blade Vortex Interactions. All along the research program the updated versions of the CFD and acoustic codes are systematically delivered to industry. This approach, also followed during the former CHANCE project, is chosen to speed up the transfer of capabilities to industry and check early enough that the products meet the expectations for applicability in the industrial environment of Eurocopter...|$|R

Cows were managed using the Ovsynch/TAI program. On the day of expected ovulation, cows were assigned randomly to receive bST (n = 9) or to serve as untreated controls (n = 8). Within each treatment group, cows were sacrificed on day 3 or 7 postovulation. Blood was sampled daily for plasma bST, progesterone (P 4) and IGF-I RIAs. At slaughter, the oviducts and uterine horns ipsilateral to the corpus luteum (CL) were collected, <b>trimmed</b> <b>free</b> of the broad ligament, and flushed with PBS. Plasma P 4 profiles and the weights of CL at day 7 postovulation were similar for control and bST-treated cows. Short-term bST treatment had no detectable effects on IGF-I concentration in plasma. Total IGF-I contents in oviductal flushings (OLF) were low and did not differ between stages of the estrous cycle or treatments. In contrast, uterine IGF-I luminal contents increased (P < 0. 01) between days 3 and 7 postovulation, and tended to be higher (P < 0. 08) in the bST-treated group. All major IGFBPs were present in day- 3 ULF, but could not be detected in day- 7 ULF.

40|$|Cytosolic α-mannosidases are {{glycosyl}} hydrolases {{that participate}} in the catabolism of cytosolic free N-oligosaccharides. Two soluble α-mannosidases (E-I and E-II) belonging to glycosyl hydrolases family 47 have been described in Candida albicans. We demonstrate that addition of pepstatin A during the preparation of cell homogenates enriched α-mannosidase E-I {{at the expense of}} E-II, indicating that the latter is generated by proteolysis during cell disruption. E-I corresponded to a polypeptide of 52  kDa that was associated with mannosidase activity and was recognized by an anti-α 1, 2 -mannosidase antibody. The N-mannan core trimming properties of the purified enzyme E-I were consistent with its classification as a family 47 α 1, 2 -mannosidase. Differential density-gradient centrifugation of homogenates revealed that α 1, 2 -mannosidase E-I was localized to the cytosolic fraction and Golgi-derived vesicles, and that a 65  kDa membrane-bound α 1, 2 -mannosidase was present in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi-derived vesicles. Distribution of α-mannosidase activity in a kex 2 Δ null mutant or in wild-type protoplasts treated with monensin demonstrated that the membrane-bound α 1, 2 -mannosidase is processed by Kex 2 protease into E-I, recognizing an atypical cleavage site of the precursor.

Muscles were grouped according to objective color measures of discoloration. M. longissimus lumborum, M. longissimus thoracis, M. semitendinosus, and M. tensor fasciae latae were grouped as "high" color stability muscles, M. semimembranosus, M. rectus femoris, and M. vastus lateralis were grouped as "moderate" color stability muscles, M. trapezius, M. gluteus medius, and M. latissimus dorsi were grouped as "intermediate" color stability muscles, M. triceps brachi - long head, M. biceps femoris, M. pectoralis profundus, M. adductor, M. triceps brachi - lateral head, and M. serratus ventralis were grouped as "low" color stability muscles, and M. supraspinatus, M. infraspinatus, and M. psoas major were grouped as "very low" color stability muscles.

Twenty-four hours after the last administration, all the ani-mals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Laparatomy was performed and the liver and kidney excised, <b>trimmed</b> <b>free</b> of fat, and rinsed in cold phosphate buffered saline solution. The liver was quickly fixed in 10 % formol-saline, while the kidney was fixed in Bouin’s fluid for histological processing.
