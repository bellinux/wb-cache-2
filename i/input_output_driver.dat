This paper presents zig-zag share, a circuit technique to reduce leakage in SRAM peripherals by putting them into low-leakage power sleep mode. The zig-zag share circuit is further extended to enable multiple sleep modes for cache peripherals. Each mode represents a trade-off between leakage reduction and the wakeup delay. Using architectural control of multiple sleep modes, an inte-grated technique called MSleep-Share is proposed and applied in L 1 and L 2 caches. MSleep-share relies on cache miss information to guide leakage control mechanism and switch peripheral circuit’s power mode. The results show leakage reduction by up to 40 in deeply pipelined SRAM peripheral circuits, with small area over-head and small additional delay. This noticeable leakage reduc-tion translates to up to 85 % overall leakage reduction in on-chip memories.

As HDLs and programming languages borrow concepts and features from each other, the boundary between them is becoming less distinct. However, pure HDLs are unsuitable for general purpose application software development, just as general-purpose programming languages are undesirable for modeling hardware. Yet as electronic systems grow increasingly complex, and reconfigurable systems become increasingly common, there is growing desire in the industry for a single language that can perform some tasks of both hardware design and software programming.

The high level of abstraction of SystemC models is well suited to early architecture exploration, as architectural modifications can be easily evaluated with little concern for signal-level implementation issues. However, the threading model used in SystemC and its reliance on shared memory mean that it does not handle parallel execution or lower level models well.|$|R

In addition, as technology migrates to smaller geometries, leakage contribution to total power consumption increases faster than dynamic power, indicating that leakage will be a major contributor to overall power consumption. This paper proposes a combination of circuit and architectural techniques to maximize leakage power reduction in embedded processors on-chip caches by targeting leakage in cache peripheral circuits. At the circuit level, we propose a novel design with multiple sleep modes for cache peripherals. Each mode represents a trade-off between leakage reduction and wakeup delay. Architectural control is proposed to decide when and how to use these different low-leakage modes by utilizing cache miss information to guide its action. The control is based on simple state machines that do not impact area or power consumption and can thus be used even in resource-constrained processors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques can keep the data cache peripherals in one of the low-power modes for more than 85 % of total execution time. The instruction cache is in one of the low power modes for an average of 50 % of the time. This translates to an average leakage power reduction of 50 % for DL 1 and 30 % for IL 1 in 65 nm technology. The energy-delay product is reduced, on average, by up to 21 %. Th...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Modular Weapon Control Unit (MWCU) {{program was}} to design and develop a {{reconfigurable}} weapon controller (programmer/sequencer) that {{can be adapted to}} different weapon systems based on the particular requirements for that system.

Because of this commonality and the amount of re-engineering necessary with the advent of every new design, the idea of a modular, adaptable system has emerged. Also, the controller can be used in more than one application for a specific weapon system. Functionality has been divided into a Processor Module (PM) and an Input/Output Module (IOM). The PM will handle all operations that require calculations, memory, and timing. The IOM will handle interfaces {{to the rest of the}} system, <b>input</b> level shifting, <b>output</b> drive capability, and detection of interrupt conditions.

40|$|Power {{reduction}} {{has become}} a vital design goal for sophisticated design applications, whether mobile or not. Researchers have shown that multi-bit flip-flop is an effective method for clock power consumption reduction. The underlying idea behind multi-bit flip-flop method is to eliminate total inverter number by sharing the inverters in the flip-flops. Since the ring counter {{is made up of}} an array of D-type flip-flops (DFFs) triggered by a global clock signal it is possible to disable the clock signal to most DFFs. Such a gated-clock ring counter is implemented to compose a low-power first-in first-out (FIFO) memory. In this paper, we will review multi-bit flip-flop concepts, and introduce the benefits of using multi-bit flip-flops in our design. we proposed to use double-edge-triggered (DET) flip-flops instead of traditional DFFs in the ring counter to halve the operating clock frequency. A novel approach using the C-elements instead of the R–S flip-flops in the control logic for generating the clock-gating signals is adopted to avoid increasing the loading of the global clock signal. The technique will greatly decrease the loading on distribution network of the clock signal for the ring counter and thus the overall power consumption. The same technique is applied to the <b>input</b> <b>driver</b> and <b>output</b> <b>driver</b> of the memory part in the delay buffer.
