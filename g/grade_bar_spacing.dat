30|$|When {{concrete}} slabs {{are subjected to}} loads, bearing stresses and deflection are mainly affected by the <b>spacing</b> of dowel <b>bars.</b> Decreased dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> results in the reduction in bearing stresses and deflection. However, if dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> decreases to less than 203  mm (8  in), a horizontal plane of weakness in the concrete slab at the joint face will occur. On the contrary, the increased dowel <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> leads to excessive bearing stresses and deflection at the joint. Currently, most highway agencies have adopted a 305  mm (12  in) spacing requirement, which also depends on the slab thickness and subgrade conditions.|$|R

40|$|In impact {{resistance}} of reinforced concrete (RC) panels against projectiles {{the contribution of}} the orthogonal mesh reinforcement has been ignored. In this study the contribution of mesh reinforcement to {{impact resistance}} and itseffect on the nature of local damage caused by impact of non-deformable projectiles are investigated. The investigation included a combination of 53 experiments and series of finite-element based numerical simulations. Three levels of local damage modes were investegated based on the severity of the degree of damage in the impacted panels. Mesh reinforcement ratio within the range of reinforcement ratio considered, namely 0. 19 % to 0. 48 %, was irrelevant to the impact behavior of RC panels under different impact velocities, while <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was to be a controlling parameter for the degree of damage. RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 times the panel thickness have a tendency to spall concrete from the back face more than RC panels with closely <b>spaced</b> <b>bars.</b> RC panels reinforced with <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> greater than 1. 5 time the panel thickness formed punching shear crater, while panels reinforced with less than that limit distributed the damage over a wider area without forming the punching shear crater on the back face. Orthogonal mesh reinforcement with <b>bars</b> <b>spaced</b> no wider than one-third of the projectile diameter were able to prevent the projectiles from perforating the panels. Offseting the reinforcing meshes did not improve the impact resistance of RC panels. An equation was developed to estimate the perforation resistance of an RC panel under impact of non- deformable projectile with given mass, diameter, and impact velocity. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{capacity}} of bottom trawl fishing gears to reduce catches of young fish and discards in a highly exploited demersal trawl fisheries in the Mediterranean, the size-selection performance of a 36 -mm square-mesh codend and two sorting grids with 20 and 15 mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was assessed. Alternate hauls {{were used to assess}} the selectivity of 36 -mm square-mesh codend. Selectivity of sorting grids was assessed using a double codend in which fish that escaped through the grid were captured in the lower codend while other fish were guided into the upper codend. The mean selection length (L 50) for European hake was 18. 5 cm and that for the Atlantic horse mackerel was 14. 0 cm with the 36 -mm square-mesh codend. These values are close to their current minimum landing sizes (20 cm for hake and 12 cm for horse mackerel). The sorting grid with 20 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> showed L 50 value of 13. 3 cm for hake, suggesting that a larger grid-spacing would be needed to obtain sufficient sorting performance. Similarly, for Atlantic mackerel the estimated L 50 of 14. 3 cm indicates that larger grid spacing is required to attain an L 50 that would be close to the current MLS (18 cm). For Atlantic horse mackerel and red mullet, the L 50 obtained with the sorting grid with 20 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was close to the MLS of these species (the MLS of red mullet is 11 cm). The selectivity of the sorting grid with 15 -mm <b>bar</b> <b>spacing</b> was generally very poor. Size-selection performance of sorting grids was assessed {{for the first time in}} the local fisheries. In order to effectively improve size-selection, seasonal and depth-dependent differences between target and by-catch species must be taken into account, which is a good indicator of the difficulty of implementing a single mesh size or grid spacing in the Mediterranean demersal trawl fishery...|$|R
