Neonates who manage to survive suffer increasing respiratory compromise due to softening of the bones (osteomalacia) and underdeveloped lungs (hypoplastic). Ultimately, this leads to respiratory failure. Epilepsy (seizures) can occur and can prove lethal. Regions of developing, unmineralized bone (osteoid) may expand and encroach on the marrow space, resulting in myelophthisic anemia.|$|E

50|$|Infantile hypophosphatasia {{presents}} in {{the first}} 6 months of life, {{with the onset of}} poor feeding and inadequate weight gain. Clinical manifestations of rickets often appear at this time. Although cranial sutures appear to be wide, this reflects <b>hypomineralization</b> of the skull, and there is often “functional” craniosynostosis. If the patient survives infancy, these sutures can permanently fuse. Defects in the chest, such as flail chest resulting from rib fractures, lead to respiratory compromise and pneumonia. Elevated calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia) and urine (hypercalcenuria) are also common, and may explain the renal problems and recurrent vomiting seen is this disease.|$|E

50|$|Patients may {{experience}} delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive myopathy. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near {{the ends of}} major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density (osteopenia) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open fontanels on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from <b>hypomineralization</b> of {{large areas of the}} calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.|$|E

50|$|Hypophosphatasia (also called {{deficiency}} of alkaline phosphatase or phosphoethanolaminuria) is a rare, and sometimes fatal, metabolic bone disease. Clinical symptoms are heterogeneous, {{ranging from the}} rapidly fatal, perinatal variant, with profound skeletal <b>hypomineralization</b> and respiratory compromise, to a milder, progressive osteomalacia later in life. Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) deficiency in osteoblasts and chondrocytes impairs bone mineralization, leading to rickets or osteomalacia. The pathognomonic finding is subnormal serum activity of the TNSALP enzyme, which is caused by one of 200 genetic mutations identified to date, in the gene encoding TNSALP. Genetic inheritance is autosomal recessive for the perinatal and infantile forms but either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant in the milder forms. The prevalence of hypophosphatasia is not known; one study estimated the live birth incidence of severe forms to be 1:100,000.|$|E
5000|$|Osteomalacia is the {{softening}} of {{the bones}} caused by impaired bone metabolism primarily due to inadequate levels of available phosphate, calcium, and vitamin D, or because of resorption of calcium.

Signs and symptoms can include diffuse body pains, muscle weakness, and fragility {{of the bones}}. In addition to low systemic levels of circulating mineral ions necessary for bone and tooth mineralization, accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting proteins and peptides (such as osteopontin and ASARM peptides) occurs in the extracellular matrix of bones and teeth, likely contributing locally to cause matrix <b>hypomineralization</b> (osteomalacia).|$|E

40|$|Molar Incisor <b>Hypomineralization</b> definieras som ett specifikt tillstånd orsakat av störningar i den tidiga fasen av emaljbildning av en eller flera permanenta första molarer med eller utan involvering av permanenta incisiver. Tidigare studier har visat att standardiserad {{intraoral}} fotograferingsteknik kan vara användbar för epidemiologiska studier av emaljdefekter. Denna studies syfte var att utveckla och utvärdera en fotografisk klassificering av allvarlighetsgraden av Molar Incisor <b>Hypomineralization</b> genom att studera metodens validitet och reliabilitet. 164, 10 - 12 åriga svenska barn granskades fotografiskt avseende prevalensen av Molar Incisor <b>Hypomineralization.</b> Först granskades endast första molarens ocklusalyta, därefter ocklusal- och buckalyta. Granskningarna jämfördes sedan med en tidigare utförd klinisk registrering, baserad på etablerade kriterier. Den fotografiska metodens validitet och reliabilitet beräknades. Vid beräkning av validiteten framgick att överensstämmelsen mellan den fotografiska och kliniska registreringen låg mellan 82 - 84 % på individnivå. Sensitiviteten för den fotografiska diagnostiken av ocklusalytorna var 48 % och specificiteten 95 %. Motsvarande siffror då buckalytorna inkluderades var 73 % och 88 %. Metodens reliabilitet resulterade i Cohens Kappa koefficienter som motsvarade ”moderat” och ”good” inom Kappa statistiken.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to discuss therapy {{possibilities}} in the management of molar incisor <b>hypomineralization.</b> Molar incisor <b>hypomineralization</b> (MIH) is defined as <b>hypomineralization</b> of one or more first permanent molars frequently affecting incisors. Etiology of MIH is not fully clarified and numerous etiological factors have been cited. Hypomineralized molars are more prone to caries, cause severe restorative problems and are frequently extracted due to serious damage and caries complications. Incisors can present demarcated enamel opacities, while enamel breakdown is uncommon. Clinically, affected molars can be sensitive to thermal and chemical irritations even when there is no enamel breakdown. Molars can be sensitive to mechanical irritations making even regular tooth brushing painful. Specific problems related to the treatment of these teeth are sensitivity and occlusion in molars and aesthetics in incisors.

40|$|Molar incisor <b>hypomineralization</b> (MIH) {{describes}} the clinical picture of <b>hypomineralization</b> of systemic origin affecting {{one or more}} first permanent molars (FPMs) that are associated frequently with affected incisors. Etiological associations with systemic conditions or environmental insults during the child's first 3 years have been implicated. The complex care involved in treating affected children must address their behavior and anxiety, aiming to provide a durable restoration under pain-free conditions. The challenges include adequate anaesthesia, suitable cavity design, and choice of restorative materials. Restorations in hypomineralized molars appear to fail frequently; there is little evidence-based literature to facilitate clinical decisions on cavity design and material choice. A 6 -step approach to management is described: (1) risk identification; (2) early diagnosis; (3) remineralization and desensitization; (4) prevention of caries and posteruption breakdown; (5) restorations and extractions; and (6) maintenance. The high prevalence of MIH indicates the need for research to clarify etiological factors and improve the durability of restorations in affected teeth.

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim {{this study}} is to present a {{clinical}} case of conservative aesthetic restorative treatment of teeth 11 and 21 in a patient diagnosed with molar incisor <b>hypomineralization.</b> An 18 -year-old female patient came to the Outpatient Restorative Dentistry Clinic at the Federal University of Espírito Santo, complaining mainly of not feeling comfortable with a color change in her anterior teeth. Molar incisor <b>hypomineralization</b> was diagnosed in molars and incisors and the negative psychosocial implications for the aesthetics involved were noticed. Due to factors such as age, financial viability, technical facility and low degree of severity, we opted for maximum preservation of the healthy tooth structure, through minimal surgical intervention to remove the irregular enamel only and subsequently restore the teeth involved (11 and 21) with resin composite. For the patient, this conservative procedure restored function and aesthetics, and thereby improved her emotional and social behavior. Conservative restorations can provide real solutions, especially in cases of molar incisor <b>hypomineralization</b> in anterior teeth where the patient's psychological state should always be considered. An appropriate assessment of the dental substrate and a careful restorative technique are necessary for success in terms of aesthetics and function and can quickly promote the patient's well-being...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Molar incisor <b>hypomineralization</b> (MIH) {{describes}} the clinical picture of <b>hypomineralization</b> of systemic origin affecting {{one or more}} first permanent molar. There is a rarity of prevalence studies in Indian population. Objectives: The main {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of MIH in a population of South Indian children. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional epidemiological survey, included 2000 children aged 11 - 16 years chosen by stratified random sampling from government and private schools of Davangere, a city in South India. Materials and Methods: Evaluation of MIH and decayed, missing and filled teeth was carried out in these children by a calibrated examiner. The severity of <b>hypomineralization</b> was recorded according to the Wetzel and Reckel scale. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test was used to analyze the categorical data. P ≤ 0. 05 was considered for statistical significance. Results: About 8. 9 % of all examined children showed at least one ill-structured first permanent molar in terms of MIH. The male and female ratio was found to be 1 : 1. 1. The decreasing order of occurrence of MIH affected teeth were permanent maxillary molars, maxillaryincisors, mandibular molars and the mandibular incisors. Conclusion: The prevalence of MIH in the permanent dentition of south Indian children was 8. 9 %.
