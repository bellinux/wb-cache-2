50|$|Chittenden & Kotting was an {{architectural}} partnership based in Detroit, Michigan. Founded in 1903 by Alpheus Williams Chittenden (1869-1958) and Charles Kotting (1865-1934). During their 13-year partnership, Chittenden and <b>Kotting</b> <b>worked</b> mostly on residential projects in Detroit's elite neighborhoods such as Indian Village and Grosse Pointe. Two of their residential projects, the Bingley Fales House and the Mary G. Edgar House, {{both in the}} Indian Village neighborhood, are recognized in The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture. The pair are also credited with design of several landmark Detroit buildings including the Detroit Boat Club's building on Belle Isle and the Detroit Stove Works building. The partnership dissolved in 1916.|$|R

25|$|Another terminological {{difference}} {{is known as}} tension (UK) and gauge (US). Individual crocheters <b>work</b> <b>yarn</b> with a loose or a tight hold and, if unmeasured, these differences can lead to significant size changes in finished garments that have {{the same number of}} stitches. In order to control for this inconsistency, printed crochet instructions include a standard for the number of stitches across a standard swatch of fabric. An individual crocheter begins work by producing a test swatch and compensating for any discrepancy by changing to a smaller or larger hook. North Americans call this gauge, referring to the end result of these adjustments; British crocheters speak of tension, which refers to the crafter's grip on the yarn while producing stitches.|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} coal mining, there were 8,000 sheep and 800 black cattle on the hills, and plans were afoot for the {{spinning}} and weaving of wool. These plans resulted in two woollen mills which flourished {{for a time}} in the following century. The two mills employed about 30 people between them. The yarn from the largest was disposed of wholly to the Kilmarnock carpet manufacturers until the proprietor of the mill added a carpet manufactory with eight looms constantly at <b>work.</b> The <b>yarn</b> spun in the second mill was also manufactured on the spot, into blankets, into plaid, packing cloth, etc.|$|R

Because the spinning wheel was not in common use before the 16th century in Europe, the older stories are certainly referring to hand spinning done on a spindle. Chief among these is the French fairy tale The Sleeping Beauty, where the princess is erroneously shown to prick her hand on some part of a spinning wheel in modern illustrations, rather than a spindle.|$|R

By allowing the rotation speed of the rotating vector to vary exponentially along the fibre path, a more realistic fibre path can be defined and the singular point of torsion can be avoided.

40|$|Katherine Mansfield is {{recognised}} {{today as}} one of the leading exponents of the modernist short story, with interest in her work at an all time high. Her literary debt to the Russian writer Anton Chekhov is well documented, but in fact she maintained a lifelong obsession with all things Russian, culminating in her death at Fontainebleau, surrounded by émigré Russians at George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff’s esoteric community, the ‘Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man’. As a young writer Mansfield toyed with Russian sounding pseudonyms: Katya, Katerina, Kissienka and Katoushka, wore Russian costume, smoked Russian cigarettes and attended Russian concerts and the ballet. As co-editor with John Middleton Murry of one of the earliest modernist journals, Rhythm, she was able to bring her fascination with all things Russian to the attention of others. She used the Russian pseudonym ‘Boris Petrovsky’ to place several of her poems in the journal and by issue 7 in August 1912, Rhythm could even boast its own ‘Russian Correspondent’, Michael Lykiardopoulos, almost certainly as a result of Mansfield’s influence, as I shall reveal. In 1914 Mansfield and Murry met the Russian émigré Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky (1880 - 1955), always known as ‘Kot’, to whom she remained devoted (despite the occasional period of estrangement) until her death. After Mansfield and Murry left their house in St John’s Wood in London in October 1915, following the death of her young brother Leslie (killed in a hand grenade incident on the Belgian-French border), Kot took over the lease of the house and remained there until his death in 1955. Beatrice Campbell reveals how Mansfield’s image was constantly in his mind, almost as if she had still been alive. ‘Her’ pear tree in the garden, the guilder rose she had planted, the lock of hair she had once given him, the chair she used to sit in when she wrote – all were devotedly preserved. On a professional level Mansfield and <b>Kot</b> <b>worked</b> together on translations from the Russian. Unpublished collaborations included ‘Maxim Gorky’s Journal of the Revolution’ in 1918. In April 1919, the first of a thirteen part series of collaborative translations of Chekhov’s letters appeared in the Athenaeum. In 1922, the pair worked on a translation of Gorky’s Reminiscences of Leonid Andreyev which was eventually published in a limited edition in 1928. Although the last years of Mansfield’s life were spent abroad, seeking relief from the symptoms of her tuberculosis, the pair maintained an epistolary friendship. Murry’s own relationship with Kot was never an easy one and in fact the tension between them contributed to the periods of estrangement between Mansfield and Kot. Murry especially never forgave him for recommending the Russian doctor Manoukhin, whose x-ray treatments he felt had precipitated Mansfield towards an early grave. This essay will therefore examine the influence of Russian culture on the life of Katherine Mansfield, focused on her relationship – and those of her contemporaries – with S. S. Koteliansky...|$|R

40|$|The work aims to determine, with {{scientific}} rigor, differences in key {{parameters of the}} yarns produced by conventional ring spinning systems, open-end and air spinning and its interrelation with the main parameters of those products that are intended for medical-sanitary sector. The experiences {{have been made in}} a Spanish company from short fibers sector that has three spinning systems, with tradition and prestige in world market, validating the results in Innotex Center laboratories of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. Considering the results, it shows that the technology of manufacture of yarns by air is suitable for yarn, woven fabrics and knitting, structures to textile medical-sanitary application, by specific properties as well as enhanced competitiveness, due to the high production rate and shortened spinning process. The viscose yarns manufactured by air mass are more mass regular. The new DR parameter clearly indicates a better look of the finished fabric when we <b>work</b> with <b>yarns</b> produced by air technology. The significant reduction of the hairiness means less formation of loose fibres by friction, very important in the application of these yarns in the manufacture of textile structures for medical-sanitary use.

Therefore, contact angle, XPS and tensile strength measurements are performed on treated and untreated fibers, while SEM is utilized to evaluate the surface structure. Different results for the fiber materials are observed. While polyethylene exhibits a relevant impact on both surface and bulk properties, polyphenylene terephthalamide and polyphenylene sulfide are only affected slightly by (oxy-) fluorination. The wetting of carbon fiber needs higher treatment intensities, but in contrast to the organic fibers, even its textile-physical properties are enhanced by the treatment. Based on these findings, the capability of (oxy-) fluorination to improve the adhesion of textiles in fiber-reinforced composite materials can be derived...|$|R

50|$|Yarn for crochet {{is usually}} sold as balls or skeins (hanks), {{although}} {{it may also be}} wound on spools or cones. Skeins and balls are generally sold with a yarn band, a label that describes the yarn's weight, length, dye lot, fiber content, washing instructions, suggested needle size, likely gauge, etc. It is a common practice to save the yarn band for future reference, especially if additional skeins must be purchased. Crocheters generally ensure that the yarn for a project comes from a single dye lot. The dye lot specifies a group of skeins that were dyed together and thus have precisely the same color; skeins from different dye lots, even if very similar in color, are usually slightly different and may produce a visible stripe when added onto existing <b>work.</b> If insufficient <b>yarn</b> of a single dye lot is bought to complete a project, additional skeins of the same dye lot can sometimes be obtained from other yarn stores or online.|$|R
