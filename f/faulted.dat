5|$|The {{action of}} {{metamorphism}} {{on the border}} between granite and gneiss bodies produces a succession of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks called greenstone belts. Most Archean volcanic rocks are concentrated within greenstone belts; the green color comes from minerals, such as chlorite, epidote and actinolite that formed during metamorphism. After metamorphism occurred, these rocks were folded and <b>faulted</b> into a system of mountains by the Algoman orogeny.|$|E

30|$|According to its <b>fault</b> character, DC microgrids <b>fault</b> {{types are}} pole-to-pole <b>fault</b> and pole-to-ground <b>fault.</b> The pole-to-ground <b>faults</b> {{are the most}} common in {{industrial}} systems [23]. Generally, the <b>fault</b> impedance of pole-to-pole <b>faults</b> is low. However, the <b>fault</b> impedance of pole-to-ground <b>faults</b> can be either low or high. On the other hand, the <b>fault</b> types can be bus <b>fault</b> and feeder <b>fault</b> based on the <b>fault</b> location. As mentioned, the electronic equipment is vulnerable and the tolerance of the over current is finite. The <b>fault</b> would be much severer when the <b>fault</b> location is closer to the energy sources; therefore the bus <b>fault</b> is critical for the whole system. <b>Faults</b> inside VSCs and batteries may cause a pole-to-pole short-circuit <b>fault</b> and these are terminal <b>faults</b> that generally cannot be quickly cleared. In these cases, the devices have to be replaced and using fuses could be a proper choice.|$|R

5|$|The {{floodplain}} of Johnson Creek is {{a remnant}} of large glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods that deposited thick sediments between 18,000 and 13,000years ago in the Columbia River Basin, including much of the Willamette Valley. Underlying the sediments are substantial thicknesses of basalt lavas from the Columbia River Basalt Group. The lava, exposed mainly in the uplands, has been folded and <b>faulted</b> to form a series of sub-basins, including the Johnson Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear industry, and the NRC. Critics <b>faulted</b> the industry and the NRC for their poor performance {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E
5|$|A post-war German study <b>faulted</b> U-68s commander, Kptlt.

According to the report, Güntzel had broken almost all the rules when approaching Farnborough. However, Kommodore Hermann Bauer, the commander of the German High Seas Fleet U-boats, in his post-war memoirs, reports Güntzel was an inexperienced captain and had not, contrary to usual practice, been first sent to sea under a more experienced U-boat captain to gain knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Transform <b>faults</b> {{are closely}} related to transcurrent <b>faults,</b> and are {{commonly}} confused. Both types of <b>faults</b> are strike-slip or side-to-side in movement; however, transform <b>faults</b> end at the junction of another plate boundary or <b>fault</b> type, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> die out without a junction. In addition, transform <b>faults</b> have equal deformation across the entire <b>fault</b> line, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> have greater displacement {{in the middle of the}} <b>fault</b> zone and less on the margins. Finally, transform <b>faults</b> can form a tectonic plate boundary, while transcurrent <b>faults</b> cannot.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} that two or more <b>faults</b> produce same faulty behavior for all input patterns. These <b>faults</b> are called equivalent <b>faults.</b> Any single <b>fault</b> from the set of equivalent <b>faults</b> can represent the whole set. In this case, much less than k×n <b>fault</b> tests are required for a circuit with n signal line. removing equivalent <b>faults</b> from entire set of <b>faults</b> is called <b>fault</b> collapsing. <b>fault</b> collapsing significantly decreases the number of <b>faults</b> to check.|$|R
5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have <b>faulted</b> Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both Warren and Alien distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E
5|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Rogue River, along the coast of Curry County, is the Otter Point Formation, a mélange of metamorphosed {{sedimentary}} rocks such as shales, sandstones, and chert. Although the rocks formed in the Jurassic, evidence suggests that they <b>faulted</b> north as part of the Gold Beach Terrane after the Klamaths merged with North America. Oregon's only dinosaur fragments, those of a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur, were found here. In the mid-1960s, a geologist also discovered the beak and teeth of an ichthyosaur in the Otter Point Formation.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and <b>faulted.</b> There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E

40|$|The most {{reliable}} of the globally available relative data {{have been used}} to derive empirical for-mulas which relate the subsurface <b>fault</b> length, L, the <b>fault</b> area, S, and <b>fault</b> width, w, with the mo-ment magnitude, M.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were <b>faulted</b> for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots.

As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and <b>faulted</b> volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years.
