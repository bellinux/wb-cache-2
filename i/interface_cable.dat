The 'assembly line diagnostic link' (ALDL) protocol broadcasts at 160 bit/s Implemented on California vehicles for the 1980 model year, {{and the rest of}} the United States in 1981. Most owners can read DTCs (Diagnostic Trouble Code(s)) by commanding the ECM (Engine Control Module) to flash the CEL (Check Engine Lamp) or MIL (Malfunction Indicator Lamp) on and off. [...] A PC based Software package called WinALDL will listen to the CLCC (Closed Loop Carburetor Control) and early CLC EFI datastreams over a fairly easy to construct <b>interface</b> <b>cable</b> that converts the 160 baud TTL serial data being transmitted by the ECM to RS232 or USB serial data [...] but there is not much information transmitted by these early ECMs.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) compliance is crucial during {{the design process}} of a digital circuit board (PCB). This is to control the level of unwanted radiated electomagnetic from the digital circuit board and its <b>interfacing</b> <b>cable.</b> In this paper, radiated emission measurements in a 3 -meter Semi-Anechoic Chamber (SAC) for the digital circuit with unshielded cable attached and its mitigation techniques are presented and discussed. The {{results show that the}} emission level higher than the product standard limit due to the radiation from a long <b>interfacing</b> <b>cable.</b> The level can be minimized significantly {{with the use of a}} short cable. This means, its behaviour as efficient radiating antennas are reduced. The reduction of emission level also can be achieved by considering the employment of multiples common mode chokes...|$|R
50|$|The ImageWriter II was {{compatible}} with Microsoft Windows-based computers using the operating systems' included C-Itoh 8510 driver, while color support was available through third-party drivers.

50|$|A JP1 <b>interface</b> <b>cable</b> connects a JP1 remote to a PC, {{enabling}} the PC {{to read and}} write to the remote's user memory. Schematics for cabling parallel port, serial port or USB connectors to various JP1 remote controls are freely available, and several vendors offer pre-built interface cables.|$|E
50|$|Tracking: Head {{movements}} were tracked with internal sensors for pitch (70 degrees), roll (70 degrees), and yaw (360 degrees). A hand-held controller called the Cyberpuck offered three buttons and internal sensors for pitch and roll.

5000|$|Utilities {{exist to}} {{transfer}} {{data from a}} PC to a CoCo. If {{one does not have}} compatible disk drives for the PC and CoCo, data may still be transferred by using special PC CoCo utilities to create a [...]wav audio file of the data. Hook the CoCo's cassette <b>interface</b> <b>cables</b> directly to the line out of a PC's soundcard, initiate the CLOAD (or CLOADM) command on the CoCo, and then play the sound file from the PC.|$|R
5000|$|The SMD {{interface}} {{is based}} upon a definition of two flat <b>interface</b> <b>cables</b> ("A" [...] control and [...] "B" [...] data) which run from the disk drive to a controller {{and then to a}} computer. This interface allows data to be transferred at 9.6 Mbit/s. The SMD interface was supported by many 8 inch and 14 inch removable and non-removable disk drives. It was mainly implemented on disk drives used with mainframes and minicomputers and was later itself replaced by SCSI.|$|R
50|$|Finer and coarser pitch cables {{are also}} available. For instance, the {{high-speed}} ATA <b>interface</b> <b>cable</b> used for computer hard disk interfaces ULTRA-ATA has 0.025-inch (0.64-mm) pitch. Finer pitches, {{as small as}} 0.3 mm, are found in portable electronic equipment, such as laptops; however, portable electronic equipment usually uses flexible flat cables (FFC).|$|E
50|$|DCS {{can operate}} TMCC {{equipped}} models {{by means of}} an <b>interface</b> <b>cable</b> that connects the Lionel CB-1 command base to the DCS Track Interface Unit. DCS can coexist on the same track at the same time with either Lionel TMCC or Legacy command systems. Engines with either system can be operated simultaneously as long as both command control units are installed on the track.|$|E
50|$|The VX-7R can be {{modified}} to transmit on MARS and CAP frequencies through both hardware and software techniques, however this radio does not meet NTIA standards for either MARS or CAP. The hardware modification requires the removal of small solder contacts located under the battery pack. The software modification {{can be made with}} the VX Commander software through a data <b>interface</b> <b>cable.</b> Both modifications obtain the same result, except that the software modification will be disabled if the radio is hard-reset.|$|E

50|$|In October 2004, Meade {{announced}} the new ETX-PE or Premier Edition. The small right-angle finder scope was replaced on these models by a LNT (Level North Technology) module {{which included a}} level sensor, a magnetic north sensor, accelerometer, real-time clock and a frameless red-dot viewfinder. UHTC was still offered as an option. Also bundled was the PC <b>interface</b> <b>cable.</b> These Premier Edition telescopes had {{an image of the}} North American (ETX125) or Orion (ETX90) Nebulae printed on the optical tube. These scopes were assembled in Meade's new facility located in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|XP-30 {{was sold}} bundled with Emagic Sound Diver (OEM version), a {{powerful}} software editor that allows instant on-screen editing of all XP-30 parameters, {{pretty much like}} Reason or any other software synth.

50|$|The {{technology}} {{pioneered by}} Dr. Iizuka has fueled {{the success of}} digital video devices including laptops, tablets, and 3D televisions. Under Dr. Iizuka’s guidance, THine advanced existing low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) technology to introduce 10-bit LVDS in 2003. The 10-bit LVDS chip as a television’s internal interface supports 1 billion colors compared to 8-bit LVDS’ 16 million colors and was widely accepted as the new value for image quality in television displays. THine also developed the V-by-One HS chip. Considered the next-generation interface for flat-panel displays, this technology can realize high-definition television through eight pairs of internal video <b>interface</b> <b>cables</b> compared to the 48 pairs required with LVDS. V-by-One HS technology can be applied widely to automotives, security systems, document processing, flat panel displays, robotics and amusement markets.|$|R
50|$|The Internet Protocol Suite is the standards-based {{networking}} {{model and}} software specification for forming {{small and large}} computer networks, from local area networks to global communication systems, such as the Internet. It is usually implemented by software and hardware features that use Ethernet network <b>interface</b> cards, <b>cabling,</b> and networking switches or hubs.|$|R
5000|$|One {{possible}} disadvantage {{to digital}} cable telephone service {{is similar to}} a disadvantage of cable Internet access, namely that the medium is shared, which could result in occasional delays and drops when high volumes of bandwidth are used or in some cases shared with entire neighborhoods. These delays could be experienced during the [...] "prime time" [...] parts of the day, when heavy Internet usage and Internet streaming devices can make telephone calls on this system difficult. However, by utilizing Cable Lab's Packet <b>Cable</b> <b>interface</b> specifications, <b>cable</b> operators are able to diminish the effects of heavy internet usage on call quality. This is done by way of QoS provisions present in the Packet Cable specifications.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to use FMS {{with nothing more than}} a keyboard, but anything more responsive than a trainer or slow flyer really needs analog control, such as a twin-stick gamepad controller or PC joystick. Many sources, including radio manufacturer Hitec, make cables to interface most brands of R/C transmitters with the program via the buddy box socket and a computer's USB, microphone or serial port. This adds realism as well as useful transmitter features like trims, dual rates and exponential. A limited amount of exponential can be selected in FMS's setup menu, however. Hitec's website markets their <b>interface</b> <b>cable</b> as a direct connection to FMS and includes a download link on their website.|$|E
