40|$|SummaryPrior to the pairing and {{recombination}} between {{homologous chromosomes}} during meiosis, telomeres {{attach to the}} nuclear envelope and form a transient cluster. However, the protein factors mediating meiotic telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope and the requirement of this attachment for homolog pairing and synapsis have not been determined in animals. Here we show that the inner nuclear membrane protein SUN 1 specifically associates with telomeres between the leptotene and <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages</b> during meiotic prophase I. Disruption of Sun 1 in mice prevents telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope, efficient homolog pairing, and synapsis formation in meiosis. Massive apoptotic events are induced in the mutant gonads, leading to the abolishment of both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. This study provides genetic evidence that SUN 1 -telomere interaction is essential for telomere dynamic movement and is required for efficient homologous chromosome pairing/synapsis during mammalian gametogenesis...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the physiological effects of mitochondrial phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (mPHGPx) overexpression during early male germ cell differentiation, we have generated transgenic mice bearing the rat mPhgpx coding sequence {{driven by the}} mouse synaptonemal complex protein 1 promoter, allowing the transgene to be specifically activated in the testis from the zygotene to <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages</b> of the first meiotic division. Northern/Western blotting and immunocytochemical analyses of endogenous mPHGPx expression during spermatogenesis showed a low enzyme level in middle-late pachytene spermatocytes, but not in earlier meiotic stages, and {{a significant increase in}} mPHGPx content in round spermatids. The histological and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling analysis of transgenic testes revealed a number of spermatogenetic defects, including primary spermatocyte apoptosis, haploid cell loss, and seminiferous epithelium disorganization. In line with these features, adult transgenic male mice also displayed a reduction in fertility. Results obtained in this study suggest that mPHGPx expression is tightly regulated in pachytene spermatocytes, with any spatial-temporal increase in mPHGPx expression resulting in damage to spermatogenesis and eventual loss of haploid cells. Present findings in the mouse may be of interest to human male fertility. Copyright © 2007 by The Endocrine Society...|$|R

They were first described by Walther Flemming in 1882. Lampbrush chromosomes of tailed and tailless amphibians, birds and insects are described best of all. Chromosomes transform into the lampbrush form during the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> of meiotic prophase I due to an active transcription of many genes. They are highly extended meiotic half-bivalents, each consisting of 2 sister chromatids. Lampbrush chromosomes are clearly visible even in the light microscope, where they are seen to be organized {{into a series of}} chromomeres with large chromatin loops extended laterally.

50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis. At the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The testes {{of fully}} mature bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, were studied by light microscope. The germ {{cells in the}} {{developing}} testis can be classified into 12 stages based on nuclear characteristics. Primary(type A) and secondary(type B) spermatogonia are the earliest germ cells, with the former showing large and completely euchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli and the latter with small blocks of heterochromatin distributed along the nuclear envelope. Spermatocytes consist of five stages; namely, leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis metaphase spermatocytes. Succeeding stages show increasing condensation of chromatin: from the coarse fibers, that are evenly distributed throughout the nucleus in leptotene stage to the highly condensed blocks of heterochromatin in pachytene and <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages.</b> Nucleoli are not detected in any stages. Secondary spermatocytes have blocks of completely condensed heterochromatin attaching to the nuclear envelopes. There are three stages of spermatids: the early stage shows coarse chromatin granules occurs evenly over the nucleus, the middle stage has increased chromatin condensation over the entire oval nucleus while the nuclear size decreases. The late stage exhibits completely condensed chromatin in an elongated nucleus, and its cytoplasm becomes highly vacuolized and starts to degenerate. In fully mature spermatozoa, the nucleus becomes highly elongated and chromatin completely condensed. During development of the testis, sex cords i...|$|R
40|$|Cohesins are {{chromosomal}} {{proteins that}} form complexes {{involved in the}} maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during division of somatic and germ cells. Three meiosis-specific cohesin subunits {{have been reported in}} mammals, REC 8, STAG 3 and SMC 1 beta; their expression in mouse spermatocytes has also been described. Here we studied the localization of different meiotic and mitotic cohesin components during prophase I in human and murine female germ cells. In normal and atretic human fetal oocytes, from leptotene to <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages,</b> REC 8 and STAG 3 colocalize in fibers. In murine oocytes, SMC 1 beta, SMC 3 and STAG 3 are localized along fibers that correspond first to the chromosome axis and then to the synaptonemal complex in pachytene. Mitotic cohesin subunit RAD 21 is also found in fibers that decorate the SC during prophase I in mouse oocytes, suggesting a role for this cohesin in mammalian sister chromatid cohesion in female meiosis. We observed that, unlike human oocytes, murine synaptonemal complex protein SYCP 3 localizes to nucleoli throughout prophase I stages, and centromeres cluster in discrete locations from leptotene to dictyate. At difference from meiosis in male mice, the cohesin axis is progressively lost during the first week after birth in females with a parallel destruction of the axial elements at dictyate arrest, demonstrating sexual dimorphism in sister chromatid cohesion in meiosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of RNA and protein by cultures of isolated microsporocytes has been demonstrated. The variation in capacities of such cultures to perform syntheses {{is a function}} of meiotic stage and parallels the pattern of changes observed for microsporocytes in situ. A principal feature of this pattern is the induction of syntheses during pachytene and <b>diplotene,</b> <b>stages</b> at which the chromosomes are partly contracted. By use of Actinomycin D, chloramphenicol, pulse-labeling with P 32 -phosphate, and nucleotide analyses of RNA digests, part of the RNA synthesized has been shown to correspond to messenger RNA. Analysis of reaction rates and the overlappings of protein and RNA synthesis indicates that the spread of cytological events in Trillium is not purely a function of the low temperature at which it occurs but, presumably, arises from a complement of regulatory devices which govern the periodic onset of reactions within the cells. The main conclusion drawn from the whole of these studies is that the sequence of morphological changes associated with chromosome contraction and movement during meiosis is accompanied by a set of gene transcriptions. Although comparatively few genes are presumed to be active during meiosis, the action of such genes may be essential to a translation of some of the information embodying the meiotic sequence which has been stored in the genome in the course of evolution...|$|R
5000|$|In females, meiosis {{occurs in}} cells known as oocytes (singular: oocyte). Each oocyte that initiates meiosis divides twice, unequally in each case. The first {{division}} produces a daughter cell that will undergo a second division, {{and a much}} smaller [...] "polar body" [...] that is extruded {{from the surface of}} the cell and does not divide further. Following Meiosis II, a [...] "second polar body" [...] is extruded, and the single remaining haploid cell enlarges to become an ovum. Since the first polar body normally disintegrates rather than dividing again, meiosis in female mammals results in three products, the oocyte and two polar bodies. However, before these divisions occur, these cells stop at the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> of meiosis I and lie dormant within a protective shell of somatic cells called the follicle. Follicles begin growth at a steady pace in a process known as folliculogenesis, and a small number enter the menstrual cycle. Menstruated oocytes continue meiosis I and arrest at meiosis II until fertilization. The process of meiosis in females occurs during oogenesis, and differs from the typical meiosis in that it features a long period of meiotic arrest known as the dictyate stage and lacks the assistance of centrosomes.|$|E

40|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} Bcl-xL protein {{is the presence}} of an unstructured loop domain between α 1 and α 2 helices, a domain not essential for its anti-apoptotic function and absent in CED- 9 protein. Within this domain, Bcl-xL undergoes dynamic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser 49 and Ser 62 during G 2 and mitosis in human cells. Studies have revealed that when these residues are mutated, cells harbour mitotic defects, including chromosome mis-attachment, lagging, bridging and mis-segregation with, ultimately, chromosome instability and aneuploidy. We undertook genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans to understand the importance of Bcl-xL (Ser 49) and (Ser 62) in vivo. Transgenic worms carrying single-site S 49 A, S 62 A, S 49 D, S 62 D and dual site S 49 / 62 A mutants were generated and their effects were analyzed in germlines of young adult worms.

Some of these transgenic strains, particularly the Ser to Ala variants, also showed slight modulations of lifespan compared to their controls.

40|$|In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function {{mutations}} in the A-type cyclin CYCA 1; 2 /TARDY ASYNCHRONOUS MEIOSIS (TAM) gene {{lead to the}} production of abnormal meiotic products including triads and dyads. Here we report that overexpression of TAM by the ASK 1 :TAM transgene also led {{to the production of}} triads and dyads in meiosis, as well as shriveled seeds, in a dominant fashion. However, the partial loss-of-function mutant tam- 1, an ASK 1 :TAM line, and the wild type differed in dynamic changes in chromosome thread thickness from zygotene to diplotene. We also found that the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions in male meiocytes in tam- 1 and tam- 2 (a null allele) frequently formed a tight cluster at the pachytene and <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages,</b> in contrast to the infrequent occurrences of such clusters in the wild type and the ASK 1 :TAM line.

The level of ASY 1, however, was greatly reduced in another ASK 1 :TAM line with much overexpressed TAM. Our results indicate that the reduction and increase in the activity of TAM differentially affect chromosomal morphology and the action of ASY 1 in prophase I. Based on these results, we propose that either the different meiotic defects or a common defect such as missing ASY 1 on the chromosomal axes triggers a hitherto uncharacterized cell cycle checkpoint in the male meiocytes in the ta...|$|R
40|$|Background: Telomeres have crucial meiosis-specific {{roles in}} the orderly {{reduction}} of chromosome numbers and in ensuring {{the integrity of the}} genome during meiosis. One such role is the attachment of telomeres to trans-nuclear envelope protein complexes that connect telomeres to motor proteins in the cytoplasm. These trans-nuclear envelope connections between telomeres and cytoplasmic motor proteins permit the active movement of telomeres and chromosomes during the first meiotic prophase. Movements of chromosomes/telomeres facilitate the meiotic recombination process, and allow high fidelity pairing of homologous chromosomes. Pairing of homologous chromosomes is a prerequisite for their correct segregation during the first meiotic division. Although inner-nuclear envelope proteins, such as SUN 1 and potentially SUN 2, are known to bind and recruit meiotic telomeres, these proteins are not meiosis-specific, therefore cannot solely account for telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or for other meiosis-specific characteristics of telomeres in mammals. Results: We identify CCDC 79, alternatively named TERB 1, as a meiosis-specific protein that localizes to telomeres from leptotene to <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages</b> of the first meiotic prophase. CCDC 79 and SUN 1 associate with telomeres almost concurrently at the onset of prophase, indicating a possible role for CCDC 79 in telomere-nuclear envelope interactions and/or telomere movements. Consistent with this scenario, CCDC 79 is missing from most telomeres that fail to connect to SUN 1 protein in spermatocytes lacking the meiosis-specific cohesin SMC 1 B. SMC 1 B-deficient spermatocytes display both reduced efficiency in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and reduced stability of telomeres specifically during meiotic prophase. Importantly, CCDC 79 associates with telomeres in SUN 1 -deficient spermatocytes, which strongly indicates that localization of CCDC 79 to telomeres does not require telomere-nuclear envelope attachment. Conclusion: CCDC 79 is a meiosis-specific telomere associated protein. Based on our findings we propose that CCDC 79 plays a role in meiosis-specific telomere functions. In particular, we favour the possibility that CCDC 79 is involved in telomere-nuclear envelope attachment and/or the stabilization of meiotic telomeres. These conclusions are consistent with the findings of an independently initiated study that analysed CCDC 79 /TERB 1 functions...|$|R

40|$|In the rat ovary, germ {{and somatic}} cells become {{organized}} into primordial follicles 48 - 72 h after birth. Although several genes have {{been implicated in}} the control of early follicular growth, less {{is known about the}} factors involved in the formation of primordial follicles. Using the method of differential display of mRNAs, we found several genes differentially expressed at the time of follicular assembly. One of them encodes synaptonemal complex protein- 1 (SCP 1), a core component of the protein complex that maintains recombining chromosomes together during prophase I of the first meiotic division in germ cells. This association, evident during the pachytene stage, ends when chromosomal desynapsis begins in the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> at the end of prophase I. Oocytes become arrested in the diplotene/dictate stage before becoming enclosed into primordial follicles, suggesting that oocytes must complete meiotic prophase I before becoming competent to direct follicle assembly. We now show that attainment of the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> results in follicular formation. In developing rat ovaries, SCP 1 mRNAexpression is confined to oocytes and decreases precipitously within 24 h after birth, preceding the organization of primordial follicles. The premature loss of SCP 1, achieved via treatment with an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting SCP 1 mRNA, resulted in more oocytes reaching the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage,</b> as evidenced by a {{decrease in the number of}} oocytes containing germ cell nuclear antigen- 1 (a nuclear protein whose expression ceases in diplotene) and an increase in the number of oocytes expressing MSY 2 (a cytoplasmic Y box protein expressed in oocytes that have become arrested in diplotene).

40|$|Manuscript {{provides}} {{insights into}} the biology of long-lived plants, different from Arabidopsis, tomato or grass species that are widely studied. In the European larch the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> lasts approximately 5 months {{and it is possible}} to divide it into several substages and to observe each of them in details. The <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> is a period of intensive microsporocyte growth associated with the synthesis and accumulation of different RNA and proteins. Larch microsporocytes display changes in chromatin morphology during this stage, alternating between 4 short stages of chromatin condensation (contraction) and 5 longer diffusion (relaxation) stages. The occurrence of a diplotene diffusion stage has been observed in many plant species. Interestingly, they have also been observed during spermiogenesis and oogenesis in animals. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine whether chromatin relaxation during the diplotene is accompanied by the synthesis and maturation of mRNA. The results reveal a correlation between the diffusion and chromatin decondensation, transcriptional activity. We also found decreasing amount of poly(A) mRNA synthesis in the consecutive diffusion stages. During the early diffusion stages, mRNA is intensively synthesized. In the nuclei large amounts of RNA polymerase II, and high levels of snRNPs were observed. In the late diffusion stages, the synthesized mRNA is not directly subjected to translation but it is stored in the nucleus, and later transported to the cytoplasm and translated. In the last diffusion stage, the level of poly(A) RNA is low, but that of splicing factors is still high. It appears that the mRNA synthesized in early stages is used during the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> and is not transmitted to dyad and tetrads. In contrast, splicing factors accumulate and are most likely transmitted to the dyad and tetrads, where they are used after the resumption of intense transcription. Similar meiotic process were observed during oogenesis in animals. This indicates the existence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of chromatin-based regulation of gene expression during meiotic prophase I...|$|E

Phenotype analyses show the S-AR-/y mice were indistinguishable from WT AR mice (B 6 AR+/y) {{with the exception of}} testes, which were significantly atrophied.

40|$|Chromosome {{behavior}} during spermatogenesis is considered in {{several species of}} Drosophila. The material is not favorable for detailed study. Perhaps the most favorable species is D. funebris; but since the genetic behavior of this species is not well known, others are used for the main account, supplemented by observations on funebris. Homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis in the telophase of the last spermatogonial division, as in other Diptera, and apparently remain in intimate association during the growth stages. The sex chromosomes remain relatively condensed and attached to or incorporated in the nucleolus, which shows wide divergence in size and appearance in different species. The autosomes become diffuse at an early growth stage and are so indistinct that no account can be given of their detailed behavior. In D. funebris they form a granulated canopy or net-like cap at {{one side of the}} nucleus and arise in prophase by the condensation of this and coalescence of the granules. No indications of definite threads such as seen during the leptotene and early <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages</b> of many insects and other animals are found here. It is difficult to attach any positive significance to the chromosome behavior so far as the question of genetic crossing over is concerned. The enormous growth of the spermatocytes brings into prominence many interesting cytoplasmic structures which have been noted here but not really studied, although they merit careful observation. The nuclear wall remains intact at both divisions, permitting a distinction between cytoplasmic and nuclear components. In some species numerous non-chromosomal bodies (fragments of nucleolus, cytoplasmic granules, etc.) stain deeply and sometimes bear a slight superficial resemblance to chromosomes, at the first division. Both maturation divisions are normal as far as chromosome distribution is concerned — the first division being reductional so far as known (e. g. where dimorphic sex chromosomes are found). At the first division the chromosomes tend to be drawn out and irregular in contour, especially when long and V-shaped. And they do not, as a rule, form a flat metaphase plate, save in D. obscura and its relatives. Figures are consequently best analysed in side view. The second division is more nearly of the ordinary type and presents no special peculiarities. The behavior of the sex-chromosomes in the first spermatocyte prophase is such as to permit their identification on this basis alone. The evidence indicates that Y remains relatively dense and compact while X behaves more like the autosomes. This leads to the view that Y may remain relatively inert or passive while X is more active during the growth period. X and Y appear to be connected only for a short region, or regions; from which it is inferred that they many be similar in constitution in these regions only...|$|R

It was reported that the C-terminal region of mSYCP 2 {{was found to be}} responsible for the association of SYCP 3 and SYCP 1 for SC formation. Consistent with the localization of the SC and the centromere to male MI chromosomes, SYCP 2 and SYCP 3, as the lateral elements, begin to localize to the chromosome core during the leptotene stage and continue to localize until the diakinesis stage when all but the crossover sites and the centromeres are broken down (Bisig et al., 2012). Therefore, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that SYCP 2 may act as a bridge that brings the SC and centromere together. SYCP 1 has no detectable immunofluorescence signals during the late <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> before the nuclear envelop breaks down; also, parts of SYCP 3 begin to gradually disappear during the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage,</b> whereas the remnants are maintained at the centromere as microtubules for assembly until anaphase I (Bisig et al., 2012). These results indicate that SYCP 1 and SYCP 3 are less likely to be responsible for the association of the SC with the centromere. Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that other unidentified proteins may contribute to their association. Thus, we proposed a model in which mSYCP 2 bridges the SC with the centromere (Fig.  2 F).|$|E

The factors controlling this are obscure, they may be connected with stimulating factors produced by sex differentiation, by the mesonephros or the rete ovarii; the resumption of meiosis after resting is controlled by gonadotrophins. The origin of the granulosa cells and of the zona pellucida is also discussed; the interdigitation of microvilli growing from the oocyte and from the granulosa cells into the zona pellucida may indicate the transfer of material from the mother to the embryo. For follicular growth, gonadotrophins are needed as a trigger, but then development proceeds wihout them during the preantral stage; in the later stages, however, they are needed permanently. The factors regulating th degeneration of germ cells (atresia) are poorly understood; they may be genetic (e. g., loss of one X chromosome), environmental (loss, or genetic incompatibility of granulosa cells, and gonadotrophins produce atresia, estrogens act in the opposite way), or metabolic. The purpose of atresia is to regulate litter size and to increase the supply of steroid hormones. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{double strand}} breaks (DSBs) are induced by {{ionizing}} radiation, and during meiotic recombination. DSBs are repaired via two main pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non homologous end-joining (NHEJ). There are three main types of male germ cells, spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. Spermatogonia include stem cells and subsequent types of proliferating spermatogonia and express many DNA repair proteins including gamma-H 2 AX (a marker for DSBs) and p 53 binding protein 1 (53 BP 1) but not MDC 1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint). MDC 1 {{is an important}} protein that functions in both HR and NHEJ. In the lack of MDC 1, spermatogonia differ from proliferating somatic cells, and this may explain why our studies revealed a slow and incomplete repair of DSBs in spermatogonia. In early spermatocytes (leptotene, zygotene and early pachytene stages of the meiotic prophase) during meiotic recombination DSB are induced. Our findings indicate that, the error prone repair via NHEJ does not take place in early spermatocytes, also not to repair radiation induced DSBs. First, these cells do not express 53 BP 1, an important protein in NHEJ. Second, this notion could be further established by studying the repair of recombination related DSBs and of DSBs induced by irradiation in scid mice (deficient for NHEJ) and in Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice, potentially deficient for HR. Repair of DSBs in early spermatocytes in scid mice {{was similar to that}} in wild type mice, however the repair was significantly lower in Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice. Hence, DSB repair in early spermatocytes is exclusively carried out through HR. In late spermatocytes (mid-pachytene through <b>diplotene</b> <b>stages)</b> all important repair proteins were found and using Rad 54 /Rad 54 B deficient mice, and scid mice, we could establish that both NHEJ and HR pathways are active in these cells, NHEJ probably being the most important. The meiotic divisions render round spermatids that elongate and transform into spermatozoa. In spermatids, HR is not possible as thy are haploid and earlier results indicate that in these cells DNA-PKcs, a protein indispensable for classical NHEJ, is not expressed or at very low levels. Nevertheless, after irradiation gamma-H 2 AX foci disappear in these cells indicating that these cells are capable of DSB repair. Using scid mice and mice in which PARP 1 protein function was inhibited, we could establish that in spermatids some residual classical NHEJ takes place and that about half of the repair takes place through the recently discovered alternative pathway for NHEJ, involving the PARP 1 /XRCC 1 proteins. Nevertheless, DSB repair in round spermatids is slow and incomplete. We also found that, in contrast to other somatic cells in the testis, Sertoli cells, the supporting somatic cells in the seminiferous epithelium, express several DNA repair proteins and repair DSBs, as shown by the in vivo disappearance of 53 BP 1 foci after irradiation and the results of the comet assay. This, together with our finding that adult Sertoli cells resume proliferation in culture indicates that adult Sertoli cells can no longer be regarded as a classical example of terminally differentiated cells that are no longer able to proliferate and do not repair DNA DSBs...|$|R
40|$|The {{immature}} oocyte and unfertilized eggs of Urechis caupo, {{a marine}} echiuroid worm, contain many nuclear bodies and a main nucleolus. These bodies {{are similar to}} prenucleolar bodies of other materials {{with respect to their}} origin, structure, cytochemical and biochemical characteristics. They are formed in large numbers during the diffuse <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage,</b> perhaps by an aggregation of nucleolar materials which had been associated with chromosomes. They are fibrillar in structure, made up mainly of some nucleolar proteins, and are inactive in RNA synthesis. Biochemical analyses suggest the possibility that these structures contain a small amount of ribosomal RNA precursors which may have originated from the main nucleolus. An accumulation of prenucleolar bodies in Urechis oocytes may result from the lack of formation of multiple functional nucleoli, such as those found in amphibian oocytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{was done on}} histological sections of testes of twelve specimens of white subspecies of blind cave salamander Proteus anguinus anguinus. The testes were analyzed {{for the presence of}} testis-ova, including the size and morphology of oocytes. The stage of the testes was also determined, based on the stage of the developing spermatogonia and/or spermatocytes. Oocytes were found in the testes of 25 % of specimens independently of the stage of testes. The oocytes were found in the testes with early as well as with late stages of spermatogenesis. In all cases, the oocytes in the testes were located in the lobules with early stages of spermatogenesis (among the spermatogonia and spermatocytes). The testis-ova were large, from 58 to 120 µm, with the characteristics of <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> of the first meiotic division. In their nuclei, we found many nucleoli and lampbrush chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} for fertilization and development is {{acquired by the}} oocyte after {{a long period of}} growth and development. This process involves both the synthesis of cytoplasmic components and a rearrangement and reduction in the chromosomes. These two processes are linked and their timing is critical to ensure that the oocyte reaches nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation simultaneously. Embryonic development is readily compro-mised by faulty oocyte maturation. Meiosis begins in early fetal life but is arrested and remains at the <b>diplotene</b> <b>stage</b> until the oocyte either degenerates during atresia or resumes meiosis just before ovulation. Pig oocytes in preovulatory follicles com-plete the first meiotic division about 36 – 40 h after the gonado-trophin surge, before ovulation, and then enter a second period of arrest which usually persists until the egg is activated by sperm fusion at fertilization.

40|$|Condensation of chromatin, {{mediated}} {{in part by}} posttranslational {{modifications of}} histones, is essential for cell division during mitosis. Histone H 3 tails are dimethylated on lysine (Kme 2) and become phosphorylated on serine (Sp) residues during mitosis. We have explored the possibility that these double modifications {{are involved in the}} establishment of H 3 tail conformations during the cell cycle. Here we describe a specific chromatin conformation occurring at Kme 2 and adjacently phosphorylated S of H 3 tails upon formation of a hydrogen bond. This conformation appears exclusively between early prophase and early anaphase of the mitosis, when chromatin condensation is highest. Moreover, we observed that the conformed H 3 Kme 2 Sp tail is present at the <b>diplotene</b> and metaphase <b>stages</b> in spermatocytes and oocytes. Our data together with results obtained by cryoelectron microscopy suggest that the conformation of Kme 2 Sp-modified H 3 tails changes during mitosis and meiosis. This is supported by biostructural modeling of a modified histone H 3 tail bound by an antibody, indicating that Kme 2 Sp-modified H 3 tails can adopt at least two different conformations. Thus, the H 3 K 9 me 2 S 10 p and the H 3 K 27 me 2 S 28 p sites are involved in the acquisition of specific chromatin conformations during chromatin condensation for cell division...|$|R
40|$|AbstractJuvenile {{zebrafish}} are hermaphroditic; undifferentiated gonads first {{develop into}} ovary-like tissues, which then either become ovaries and produce oocytes (female) or degenerate and develop into testes (male). In order to fully capture the dynamic processes of germ cells' proliferation and juvenile hermaphroditism in zebrafish, we established transgenic lines TG(β-actin:EGFP), harboring an enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) gene driven by a medaka β-actin promoter. In TG(β-actin:EGFP), proliferating germ cells and female gonads strongly expressed EGFP, but fluorescence was only dimly detected in male gonads. Based on the fluorescent (+) or nonfluorescent (−) appearance of germ cells seen in living animals, three distinct groups were evident among TG(β-actin:EGFP). Transgenics in ++ group (44 %) were females, had fluorescent germ cells as juveniles, and female gonads continuously fluoresced throughout sexual maturation. Transgenics in +− (23 %) and −− (33 %) groups were males. Fluorescent germ cells were transiently detected in +− transgenics from 14 to 34 days postfertilization (dpf), but were not detected in −− transgenics throughout their life span. Histological analyses showed that 26 -dpf-old transgenics in ++, +−, and −− groups all developed ovary-like tissues: Germ cells in −− group juveniles arrested at the gonocyte stage and accumulated low quantities of EGFP, while those in ++ group juveniles highly proliferated into <b>diplotene</b> to perinucleolar <b>stages</b> and accumulated high quantities of EGFP. In +− group juveniles, degenerating oocytes, gonocytes, and spermatogonia were coexistent in transiently fluorescent gonads. Therefore, the fluorescent appearance of gonads {{in this study was}} synchronous with the differentiation of ovary-like tissues. Thus, TG(β-actin:EGFP) can be used to visualize germ cells' proliferation and juvenile hermaphroditism in living zebrafish for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Strict {{control of}} cell {{proliferation}} and cell loss {{is essential for}} the coordinated functions of different cell populations in complex multicellular organisms. Oogenesis is characterized by a first phase occurring during embryo-fetal life and in common with spermatogenesis, during which mitotic proliferation of the germline stem cells, the primordial germ cells (PGC), prevails over germ cell death. The result is the formation of a relatively high number of germ cells depending on the species, ready to enter sex specific differentiation. In the female, PGC enter into meiosis and become oocytes, thereby ending their stem cell potential. After entering into meiosis in the fetal ovary, oocytes pass through leptotene, zygotene and pachytene stages before arresting in the last stage of meiotic prophase I, the <b>diplotene</b> or dictyate <b>stage</b> at about the time of birth. The most part of oocytes die during the fetal period or shortly after birth. It is widely accepted that in mammals a female is born with a fixed number of oocytes within the ovaries, which over the years progressively decreases without possibility for renewal. Once the oocyte reserve has been exhausted, ovarian senescence, driving what {{is referred to as the}} menopause in women, rapidly ensues. The fertile lifespan of a female depends by the size of the oocyte pool at birth and the rapidity of the oocyte pool depletion. Which mechanisms control PGC proliferation? Why do most of the oocytes die during fetal life and what are the mechanisms of such massive degeneration? Is it possible to prolong the lifespan of a female by reducing oocyte lost during the fetal life? This review reports some of the most recent results obtained in an attempt to answer these questions...|$|R
