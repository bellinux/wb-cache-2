In this project theoretical framework is formulated as a doubling of two different philosophical schools of thought: epistemology and phenomenology. They converge as a bigger theoretical constellation in order to interpret how architecture phenomenon is constructed in the city of Bucharest. The following findings are then converted into series of different mappings, 2. 5 models and assemblages. They address the question how architecture and in particular its representation can be used to express this dialectical mods of understandings [...] . Yet it's only a refraction of a larger phenomena. This methodology of creating visual apparatus reflected in the final architectural design. Form follows refraction is a architectural design manifesto where architecture is an assemblage of various transparent materials and their various physical characteristics that can refract, reflect, mirror, blur, architecture space. This architecture can't no longer be perceived as a whole and is creating an oligopticon where you can read only a small piece of a larger panorama. So the final architectural result operates in a very similar mods as does Forensic type of work but this time operating on architecture itself. Bridging theory to design...|$|E
40|$|SmartWater is a {{chemical}} taggant {{used as a}} crime deterrent. The chemical taggant is a colorless liquid that fluoresces yellow under ultra-violet (UV) light and contains distinctive, identifiable and traceable elemental composition. For instance, upon a break and entry scenario, the burglar is sprayed with a solution that has an elemental signature custom-made to a specific location. The residues of this taggant persist on skin and other objects and can be easily recovered for further analysis. The product has been effectively used in Europe as a crime deterrent and has been recently introduced in South Florida. In 2014, Fourt Lauderdale Police Department reported the use of SmartWater products with a reduction in burglaries of 14 % [1]. The International <b>Forensic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute</b> (IFRI) at FIU validated the scientific foundation of the methods of recovery and analysis of these chemical tagging systems using LA-ICP-MS. Analytical figures of merit of the method such as precision, accuracy, limits of detection, linearity and selectivity are reported in this study. Moreover, blind samples were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS to compare the chemical signatures to the company’s database and evaluate error rates and {{the accuracy of the}} method. This study demonstrated that LA-ICP-MS could be used to effectively detect these traceable taggants to assist law enforcement agencies in the United States with cases involving transfer of these forensic coding systems...|$|E

40|$|Given that pets live {{in close}} {{proximity}} to their owners, {{it is not uncommon to}} find canine DNA at crime scenes. As genetic and forensic technology advances, new non-human DNA profiling kits have been developed. The purpose of this research study is to assess the current and prospective reliability and robustness of the StockMarks® for Dogs Genotyping Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City. CA) in the amplification of microsatellite markers recommended by the American Kennel Club (AKC). Dogs will be sampled using buccal swabs to obtain the biological material for DNA typing. Once extracted and quantified the DNA will be amplified via PCR and sequenced through capillary electrophoresis. Several tests will be performed to evaluate the STR multiplex such as sensitivity testing, reproducibility studies, peak height ratio determination, artifact analysis and characterization, mixture analyses and species specificity. Current limitations of the StockMarks® for Dogs Genotyping Kit include the lack of a sex-determining marker which will be added as part of this research project. In addition, DNA from fecal samples will be tested as part of an innovative strategy to assess the performance of the kit. It is expected that the canine DNA samples will amplify successfully and consistently generate reliable and reproducible results from small amounts of genetic material. By identifying possible drawbacks and working to improve them, the validation studies will help optimize the kit in the hopes of making it more suitable for research and forensic case work, particularly for utilization at the International <b>Forensic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute</b> (IFRI) of Florida International University...|$|E
40|$|Detection canines {{represent}} the fastest and most versatile means of illicit material detection. This research endeavor {{in its most}} simplistic form is the improvement of detection canines through training, training aids, and calibration. This study focuses on developing a universal calibration compound for which all detection canines, regardless of detection substance, can be tested daily {{to ensure that they}} are working with acceptable parameters. Surrogate continuation aids (SCAs) were developed for peroxide based explosives along with the validation of the SCAs already developed within the International <b>Forensic</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Institute</b> (IFRI) prototype surrogate explosives kit. Storage parameters of the SCAs were evaluated to give recommendations to the detection canine community on the best possible training aid storage solution that minimizes the likelihood of contamination. Two commonly used and accepted detection canine imprinting methods were also evaluated for the speed in which the canine is trained and their reliability. ^ As a result of the completion of this study, SCAs have been developed for explosive detection canine use covering: peroxide based explosives, TNT based explosives, nitroglycerin based explosives, tagged explosives, plasticized explosives, and smokeless powders. Through the use of these surrogate continuation aids a more uniform and reliable system of training can be implemented in the field than is currently used today. By examining the storage parameters of the SCAs, an ideal storage system has been developed using three levels of containment for the reduction of possible contamination. The developed calibration compound will ease the growing concerns over the legality and reliability of detection canine use by detailing the daily working parameters of the canine, allowing for Daubert rules of evidence admissibility to be applied. Through canine field testing, {{it has been shown that}} the IFRI SCAs outperform other commercially available training aids on the market. Additionally, of the imprinting methods tested, no difference was found in the speed in which the canines are trained or their reliability to detect illicit materials. Therefore, if the recommendations discovered in this study are followed, the detection canine community will greatly benefit through the use of scientifically validated training techniques and training aids. ...|$|E

50|$|The law {{enforcement}} agency conducting the rape investigation can send the rape kit, {{in whole or in}} part, to the forensic science crime lab for analysis. Forensic scientists will try to develop a DNA profile of the assailant using the samples collected in the rape kit. If successful, the crime lab will search the DNA profile against DNA profiles of convicted offenders and other crime scenes using a DNA database. For example, crime labs in the United States run DNA profiles through the three-tiered Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which was developed in 1990 and contains DNA profiles at the national, state, and local level. Similarly, the need to solve sexual assault crimes in Brazil led the <b>Forensic</b> DNA <b>Research</b> <b>Institute</b> of Federal District Civil Police to create a DNA database in 1998 containing evidence specifically collected in sexual assault cases. DNA matches in such databases not only aid in identifying the assailant where unknown to the victim, but also may help determine whether the assailant (known or unknown to the victim) is a serial rapist. These findings eventually may be made available for use in court.|$|R
