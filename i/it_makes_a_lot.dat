5000|$|Toby Manning, {{the match}} referee for AlphaGo vs. Fan Hui, has {{described}} the program's style as [...] "conservative". AlphaGo's playing style strongly favours greater probability of winning by fewer points over lesser probability of winning by more points. Its strategy of maximising its probability of winning is distinct from what human players tend to do which is to maximise territorial gains, and explains some of its odd-looking moves. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of opening moves that have never or seldom been made by humans, while avoiding many second-line opening moves that human players like to make.

5000|$|Forsberg runs 10 km in 36 minutes. She is also {{a strong}} uphill runner as {{witnessed}} by her results in vertical kilometer races. But her real strength is downhill running where she constantly outruns her competitors and sets new records. Says Forsberg: [...] "I’m so comfortable in that terrain so it doesn’t feel fast at all. Training helps and also I think <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of difference that I have always just played outside running on trails, rocks etc."Forsberg claims that she has only fallen twice while running, once during the 2014 Transvulcania race where she fell running uphill after being pushed from behind and sustained a hand and arm injury that required immediate medical care, once on a road when running with her boyfriend.|$|E

[...] He also wrote that Gnomz had much less charm than the title it was supposedly inspired by, Super Mario War: [...] "Mario defeating enemies by stomping on their heads has always been a key part of his character - <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> less sense to see a bunch of garden gnomes trying to do the same thing." ...|$|E

She {{was inspired by the}} planned nature of Canberra, and has described the work as: [...] "My question is what if evolution went a different way and instead of going back into the sea, from which they came originally, they went into the air and we evolved a nature that could fly instead of swim. In fact coming from a place like Canberra where it's a planned city that's really tried to integrate and blend in with the natural environment, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sense to make this sort of huge, gigantic, but artificial and natural-looking creature".|$|E

[...] Sarah Rainey, writing for The Daily Telegraph gave it {{four out of five}} stars, called it a [...] "bitter-sweet offering" [...] and said: [...] "The script offered a good mix of humour and poignancy, and there were also some unexpectedly lovely scenes of the countryside". Ellen Jones of The Independent said: [...] "The laboriously regional script didnt make it any easier. The dialogue was so crammed with earthy wisdom and quaint sexual euphemisms that the actors struggled to get a breath in." [...] and [...] "Truckers debt to films such as Brassed Off and The Full Monty was made obvious".|$|E
5000|$|Carr deplored {{the rise}} of Structuralism. Carr wrote there was the structuralist approach, which Carr called a [...] "horizontal" [...] way of {{understanding}} history [...] "which analyses a society {{in terms of the}} functional or structural inter-relation of its parts". Against it, there was what Carr called the [...] "vertical" [...] approach [...] "which analyses it society in terms of where it has come from and where it is going". Through Carr was willing to allow that a structural approach had some advantages, he wrote: [...] "But <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of difference which attracts historian's main emphasis and concern. This depends partly, no doubt, on his temperament, but largely on the environment in which he works. We live in a society which thinks of change chiefly as change for the worse, dreads it and prefers the [...] "horizontal" [...] view which calls only for minor adjustments".|$|E

5000|$|.....without {{a guitar}} player you can't {{rely on the}} {{standard}} hooks that punk rock and rock n' roll in general relies on. The guitar player - the guitar god quote unquote - was such a focus {{for so long that}} by the nature of not having a guitar player, the bass and the drums {{have to do a lot}} more. It also makes the vocals more important, or at least <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more room for the vocals. You don't have guitar solos, you don't have the wash of high end. And the things you do on the drums are different, if you just did a straight four beat on the drums it would get kinda dull after awhile. It isn't as though bass guitar hasn't been a prominent instrument at times in other bands but it made us approach things differently, our song structure couldn't just be verse-chorus-verse. It had everything to do with how our sound got off to a unique start.|$|E
5000|$|Another trend among craft brewers is {{to package}} {{at least some}} of their {{products}} in aluminum cans instead of traditional bottles including the large Growler (jug). For example, Ottawa’s Beyond The Pale Brewing Co. once used only bottles, including one and two litre growlers, but the company added a canning system in 2015. [...] "If you are trying to put out a premium product, it’s better for the beer to be in cans. It’s more convenient, it’s better for the environment, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sense," [...] said co-owner Rob McIsaac. Most of their beer is now sold in cans. Cameron’s Brewing Company in Mississauaga, Ontario also sell the majority of their beer in cans. Craft brewer Black Bridge in Saskatchewan is strongly in favour of cans, due to the lower weight ("we can transport more beer while reducing our carbon footprint") and much greater resistance to light and oxygen that can reduce shelf life in addition to lower packaging and shipping costs.|$|E
5000|$|The Gangadhar {{inscription}} {{is important}} for the history of Indian religion because, in the description of the Mother goddess shrine, it provides the first documented use of the term ḍakinī, a type of female celestial being that comes to plays a prominent protective role Tantric Buddhism. The description of the goddesses has also prompted debate because it appears, at first glance, to give the oldest description of a Tantric temple. The discussion of the word tantra in the record has been summarised by David Lorenzen. These interpretations were revisited by Bruce M. Sullivan who noted: [...] "To me, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more sense to take it in the usual meaning for tāntra, namely, stringed instrument. Thus, we get the climatic effects mentioned in the inscription being caused by music (accompanied by booming clouds), not by “magic rites” (Fleet) nor by tantric texts (Lorenzen)." [...] Responding indirectly to Sullivan's call for the inscription to be studied closely, Michael Willis noted that the word given is tāntra rather than tantra. Following André Padoux, Willis remarked that [...] "... the word tāntra in the inscription {{has little to do with}} occidental Tantrism but rather with a stringed musical instrument, i.e. an object on which the strings are ‘stretched’ (√tan) across a curved frame." [...] He thus re-edited and re-translated the relevant verse as follows: ...|$|E
