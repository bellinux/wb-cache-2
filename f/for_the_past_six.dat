25|$|With {{the end of}} the Peninsular War in 1814, {{the courts}} of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony.

However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the Liberal Revolution of 1820), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the 1817 Pernambucan Revolt.|$|E

By this time, a united Republican Party was deemed likely to defeat the Democratic/Populist combine that had ruled Idaho <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> years. The 1902 Idaho state Republican convention showed that Borah had, likely, the most support among the people, but the choice of senator was generally dictated by the caucus of the majority party in the legislature.

[...] There were three other Republicans seeking the Senate seat, including Weldon B. Heyburn, a mining lawyer from {{the northern part of the}} state. When the legislature met in early 1903, Borah led on early caucus ballots, but then the other candidates withdrew and backed Heyburn, who was chosen by the caucus, and then by the legislature. There were many rumors of corruption in the choice of Heyburn, and Borah determined that the defeat would not end his political career, deciding to seek the seat of Senator Dubois (by then a Democrat) when it was filled by the legislature in early 1907.|$|E
500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness {{to take a risk}} make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E

2500|$|Spain in {{particular}} receives {{most of the}} immigrants coming illegally to Europe from Africa, probably due to its large coastal area and its proximity to and land borders with Morocco at Ceuta and Melilla; African immigrants try to enter the country by boat from Morocco or Senegal or by jumping the border fences.
