40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} energy source produced from natural oils and fats, and is {{being used as a}} substitute for petroleum diesel. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of using spent coffee grounds for biodiesel production and its by-products to produce pelletized fuel, which is expected to help the biodiesel production process achieve zero waste. For this experiment, spent coffee grounds sample was collected from Kaldis coffee, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Extraction of the spent coffee grounds oil was then conducted using n-hexane, ether and mixture of isopropanol to hexane ratio (50 : 50 %vol), and resulted in oil yield of 15. 6, 17. 5 and 21. 5 %w/w respectively. A two-step process was used in biodiesel production with conversion of about 82 %w/w. The biodiesel quality parameters were evaluated using the American Standard for Testing Material (ASTM D 6751). The major fatty acid compositions found by Gas chromatography were linoleic acid (37. 6 %), palmitic acid (39. 8 %), oleic (11. 7 %), and stearic acid (8. 6 %). In addition, solid waste remaining after oil extraction and <b>glycerin</b> <b>ratio</b> (glycerin content from 20 - 40 %) was evaluated for fuel pellet (19. 3 - 21. 6 MJ/Kg) applications. Therefore, the results of this work could offer a new perspective to the production of biofuel from waste materials without growing plants and/or converting food to fuel...|$|E

The study compared the combustion temperatures and mass reduction over time during combustion. The environmental impact was also studied by detecting acrolein gas. The experiments were carried out using briquette fuel mixed by sawdust, molass and <b>glycerin</b> of different <b>ratios.</b> The results indicated that increasing of the <b>ratio</b> of <b>glycerin</b> affected on higher combustion temperature, and higher mass reduction.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} liquisolid {{technique}} on the dissolution profile of spironolactone was evaluated. Different formulations of spironolactone liquisolid compacts were prepared using various amounts of non-volatile vehicles (Poly ethylene glycol 400 and <b>glycerin).</b> The <b>ratio</b> of microcrystalline cellulose (as carrier) to silica (as coating powder material) was 20 for all formulations. After preparing tablets by direct compression with constant compression load, the release profiles were evaluated by USP paddle method. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and FTIR were used to evaluate any interaction between spironolactone and other ingredients. The liquisolid tablets exhibited significantly higher dissolution rates in comparison with conventionally direct compressed tablets. Furthermore results showed dissolution rate enhancement of liquisolid tablets by increase in the amounts of non-volatile vehicles. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that, the drug has got solubilized in the liquid vehicle. FT-IR spectroscopy studies of pure spironolactone, liquisolid compacts, glycerin and PEG 400 supported solubilization of the drug in the liquid vehicle too. The FT-IR spectra also showed that no interactions have been occurred between spironolactone and other ingredients. In conclusion the liquisolid technique can be a suitable method in order to prepare rapid release tablets of poorly water-soluble drugs such as spironolactone...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{broadband}} behavior of complex electrical properties of glycerin and water mixtures over the frequency range of 0. 1 - 25. 0 GHz, especially {{as they relate}} to using these liquids as coupling media for microwave tomographic imaging. Their combination is unique in that they are mutually miscible over the full range of concentrations, which allows them to be tailored to dielectric property matching for biological tissues. While the resultant mixture properties are partially driven by differences in the inherent low-frequency permittivity of each constituent, relaxation frequency shifts play a disproportionately larger role in increasing the permittivity dispersion while also dramatically increasing the effective conductivity over the frequency range of 1 - 3 GHz. For the full range of mixture ratios, the relaxation frequency shifts from 17. 5 GHz for 0 % glycerin to less than 0. 1 GHz for 100 % glycerin. Of particular interest {{is the fact that the}} conductivity stays above 1. 0 S/m over the 1 - 3 -GHz range for <b>glycerin</b> mixture <b>ratios</b> (70 %- 90 % glycerin) we use for microwave breast tomography. The high level of attenuation is critical for suppressing unwanted multipath signals. This paper presents a full characterization of these liquids along with a discussion of their benefits and limitations in the context of microwave tomography...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out in a {{horizontal}} superposed fluid and porous layer contained in a test box 24 cm x 12 cm x 4 cm high. The porous layer consisted of 3 mm diameter glass beads, and the fluids used were water, 60 and 90 percent glycerin-water solutions, and 100 percent <b>glycerin.</b> The depth <b>ratio</b> d, which is the ratio of the thickness of the fluid layer to that of the porous layer, varied from 0 to 1. 0. Fluids of increasingly higher viscosity were used for cases with larger d {{in order to keep the}} temperature difference across the tank within reasonable limits. The size of the convection cells was inferred from temperature measurements made with embedded thermocouples and from temperature distributions at the top of the layer by use of liquid crystal film. The experimental results showed: (1) a precipitous decrease in the critical Rayleigh number as the depth of the fluid layer was increased from zero, and (2) an eightfold decrease in the critical wavelength between d = 0. 1 and 0. 2. Both of these results were predicted by the linear stability theory reported earlier (Chen and Chen, 1988) ...|$|R
40|$|Received 28 Sep, 2008; Accepted 6 May, 2009) AbstractBackground and purpose: The {{increasing}} {{effect of}} liquisolid systems on dissolution behavior of poor soluble drugs has been proved. In this research, {{the effect of}} glycerin, as a nonvolatile solvent, on release profile of indomethacin was evaluated. Materials and methods: The Avicel as carrier and silica as coating powder material in 20 : 1 ratio were used. Indomethacin was dispersed in <b>glycerin</b> with different <b>ratios.</b> The binary mixtures of Avicel and silica {{were added to the}} mixture containing the drug and glycerin under continuous mixing. Starch as disintegrate was mixed with all formulations for a period of 10 minutes. After preparing several formulations, the release profiles were evaluated. To evaluate any interaction between indomethacin and the other components in liquisolid formulations, the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used. Results: The results showed that liquisolid formulations exhibited significantly higher drug dissolution rates in comparison with directly compressed tablet. The enhanced rate of indomethacin dissolution from liquisolid tablets was probably due to an increase in wetting properties and surface area of drug particles available for dissolution. Also, {{it has been shown that}} the fraction of molecularly dispersed drug (FM) in the liquid medication of liquisolid systems was directly proportional to their indomethacin dissolution rate (DR). An attempt was made to correlate the percentage drug dissolved in 10 -minutes with the solubility of indomethacin in glycerin. Conclusion: The liquisolid compacts technique can be a promising alternative for the formulation of water insoluble drugs, such as indomethacin into rapid release tablets.

40|$|HIV {{epidemic}} {{is an ongoing}} health concern globally. Sexual transmission accounts for {{the overwhelming majority of}} new infections. Vaginal microbicides are under investigation as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) products for HIV prevention. Although progress has been made, the development of more efficacious products is warranted. Cervicovaginal tissue and draining lymph nodes contain an adequate amount of HIV target cells and play critical roles in HIV replication and sedimentation at the early stage of infection. Improved efficacy can be achieved with the use of specially designed drug delivery systems which achieve greater drug concentrations in these two sites of action. In this dissertation, we hypothesized that the hydrophobic microbicide candidate CSIC can be formulated in a polymeric vaginal film and a nanocrystal formulation with high loading capacities using multiple formulation strategies. We further hypothesized that the nano-delivery strategy can improve cervicovaginal tissue drug penetration and achieve lymphatic drug delivery. Series of preformulation studies were conducted to evaluate the physicochemical and biological properties of the drug candidate CSIC. The major challenge for CISC formulation development was identified as its hydrophobicity. Therefore, a cosolvent system comprising PEG 400, propylene glycol, and <b>glycerin</b> at a <b>ratio</b> of 5 : 2 : 1 has been optimized and utilized in a polymer based vaginal film formulation for increased drug solubility, long term stability, and lack of leakage. Additionally, a CSIC nanocrystal formulation, with a particle size of 243 nm and near neutral surface charge, was developed. CSIC nanocrystals have been proved to possess increased drug saturation solubility, rapid mucus penetration properties, and improved drug permeation in the cervicovaginal tissue. More importantly, the pharmacokinetic study provided the first evidence of lymphatic targeting after intravaginal application without causing any epithelial damage. Furthermore, CSIC was able to release from the nanocrystals in a sustained mode, indicating its potential use as a coitally independent PrEP product that could improve user adherence. In summary, this work sets the stage to create new opportunities for sexually transmitted HIV prevention through the development of a novel dual targeting delivery system. The developed approaches can be used to deliver other drugs that lack solubility or require lymphatic targeting. ...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido a partir de três experimentos. O primeiro foi conduzido para caracterizar quimicamente os compostos presentes na glicerina bruta proveniente da indústria do {{biodiesel}} e determinar o seu valor energético em dietas para bovinos de corte. Para o ensaio de determinação do valor energético da glicerina foram utilizados oito bovinos, machos não castrados, mestiços e com peso inicial médio de 334 ± 121, 13 kg. O delineamento experimental utilizado foi o quadrado latino 2 × 2 com agrupamento de quatro quadrados simultâneos. Dentro de cada quadrado foram implementados duas proporções de glicerina e volumoso (5 : 95 e 15 : 85) e dois períodos experimentais. A glicerina apresentou 105. 4 g. kg- 1 de umidade, 90. 09 g. kg- 1 de matéria mineral, 805, 5 g. kg- 1 de glicerol e 160 mg. kg- 1 de metanol. Para os valores energéticos foram encontrados 934, 46 g. kg- 1 e 4, 01 e 3, 64 Mcal. kg- 1 para NDT, Energia digestível e metabolizável, respectivamente. No segundo experimento, utilizaram-se cinco bovinos mestiços (Nelore x Red Angus), não-castrados, com peso inicial médio de 346 ± 21, 42 kg, fistulados no rúmen e no abomaso e distribuídos em um quadrado latino 5 x 5, com objetivo de avaliar o efeito de inclusão da glicerina bruta em substituição ao milho em dietas de bovinos de corte terminados em confinamento, sobre o consumo, digestibilidade aparente total e parcial da matéria seca e dos nutrientes, cinética de passagem e digestão ruminal, pH, concentrações de amônia e ácidos graxos voláteis (AGV), estimativa da produção microbiana e excreção de compostos nitrogenados na urina. A alimentação basal foi composta por 50 % de silagem de milho e o restante do concentrado à base de milho e farelo de soja. Os tratamentos consistiam de cinco níveis de substituição do milho do concentrado por uma mistura de glicerina e glúten de milho, em que a glicerina compunha 0, 5, 10, 15 e 20 % da matéria seca da dieta. Foram utilizados cinco períodos experimentais com 15 dias cada, sendo sete para adaptação e oito para coletas. Com exceção do consumo de EE, não houve efeito (P> 0, 05) da glicerina sobre o consumo de MS e dos nutrientes. A inclusão de glicerina aumentou (P 0, 05) pelos níveis de glicerina, mas a taxa de digestão da MS, MO e FDNcp aumentaram (P 0, 05), no entanto, a concentração de amônia reduziu linearmente (P 0, 05) sobre consumo de energia metabolizável e relação entre insulina e glicose. Da mesma forma, a proporção de fibras no músculo não foi afetada (P > 0, 05). No entanto o diâmetro das fibras do tipo I e IIA aumentou (P 0, 05) pela inclusão de glicerina bruta. Em relação às perdas da carne também não foram detectadas diferenças (P> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos. Os valores de luminosidade (L*), intensidade de vermelho (a*) e intensidade de amarelo (b*) da carne não diferiram (P> 0, 05). A inclusão de glicerina bruta até 20 % da matéria seca pode ser usada em dietas de terminação de bovinos de corte, pois não promove nenhum efeito deletério a nenhuma das principais variáveis qualitativas da carne. This thesis {{consists of}} three experiments. The first experiment was conducted aiming to determine the crude glycerin compounds from the biodiesel industry and the energy value on diets for beef cattle. For the test for determining the energy value of glycerin were used eight cattle, steers, and crossbred with an average initial weight of 334 ± 121. 13 kg. The experiment was evaluated following the four-by-four Latin Square design. Within each square, two treatments were implemented according crude <b>glycerin</b> and roughage <b>ratio</b> (5 : 95 and 15 : 85 on DM) and two experimental periods. Crude glycerin had 105. 4 g. kg- 1 of moisture and 90. 09 g. kg- 1 of mineral matter, 805. 5 g. kg- 1 of glycerol and 160 mg. kg- 1 of methanol on DM. For energy values were found 934. 46 g. kg- 1 and 4. 01 and 3. 64 for Mcal. kg- 1 TDN, digestible and metabolizable energy, respectively. In the second experiment five crossbred bulls were used, with 346 ± 21. 42 kg of body weight cannulated in te rumen and abomasum. The experimental design was Latin Square 5 x 5 (five periods and five treatments). Each experimental period had duration of 15 d, seven days to adaptation and eight to the collections. Animals were fed a basal diet based containing 50 % corn silage and 50 % concentrate, in dry matter basis (DM). It was used five diets with five levels of crude glycerin inclusion (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 %DM). Corn was replaced by an equivalent amount of food grade glycerin and corn gluten feed. This study was conducted aiming to evaluate the effect of replacing corn by crude glycerin on feed intake, ruminal and total digestibility, ruminal digestion an passage rate, fermentation characteristics, protein efficiency, microbial protein yield and urinary nitrogenous excretion. Only the EE intake was increased (P 0. 05) but digestion rate of DM, OM and NDFap were linearly increased (P 0. 05) in ruminal pH and volatile fatty acid concentration were observed, however ammonia concentration decreased (P 0. 05) of crude glycerin levels on protein efficiency, microbial protein yield and urinary nitrogenous excretion.. It can be concluded Crude glycerin should replace corn up to 20 %DM in diets in finishing diets of beef cattle. The third trial consists of two different works. The fist study was developed {{with the objective of}} evaluating the effect of replacing corn with crude glycerin on the intake and total apparent digestibility of diet components, performance, carcass traits, yields of commercial cuts, and carcass composition of beef cattle under feedlot conditions. Thirty-four crossbreed Red Angus x Nellore bulls with an average initial weight of 343. 9 ± 16. 56 kg were used. Four animals that served as the control group were slaughtered {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, and the remaining animals (n = 30) were assigned to a complete randomized design with five treatments and six replications per treatments (0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 % glycerin inclusion on DM basis). At the end of the experiment all the animals were slaughtered. The insulin was linearly increased (P > 0. 05) by the treatments, but the glucose was unaffected. The dry matter feed intake (DMI), nutrients digestibility were unaffected (P> 0. 05) by treatment. Similarly, glycerin level did not affect (P > 0, 05) the empty body average daily body weight gain, carcass daily weight gain, carcass deposition efficiency, carcass composition and physical and chemical composition of carcass gain. Dietary treatments also unaffected (P > 0. 05) dressing percentage (59. 72 ± 1. 2950 %), LM (78. 09 ± 7. 3424 cm 2) a carcass backfat (5. 28 ± 2. 13 mm). It can concluded that Crude glycerin substitution of corn ground could be included in finishing cattle diet up to 20 % of the DM without lead to detrimental effects on intake, growth performance, carcass performance or basic cut yields. In the second study were used carcasses from the previous study. After 24 -h chill, data of carcass weight and pH. After carcass data collection, a boneless Longissimus section between the 9 th and 11 th ribs was removed, vacuum packaged, frozen and held at - 200 C. No effect of inclusion level of glycerin (P> 0. 05) on metabolizable energy intake and insulin to glucose ratio. Similarly, muscle fibers proportions were unaffected by treatment. However, an increased fiber diameter to type I and IIA was observed (P 0. 05) by the crude glycerin level. No changes were observed (P > 0, 05) to meat losses by the treatments. The grude glycerin level did not affect (P> 0. 05) the instrumental color of the Longissimus. The means to L *, a * and b * were unaffected. In addition, diets containing up to 20 % of crude glycerin on dry matter can be used in diets for finishing beef cattle because it does not lead to detrimental effects on carcass traits and meat quality variables...|$|R
