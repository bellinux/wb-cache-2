40|$|We {{present a}} method {{currently}} being {{applied to the}} Afar Region of the African Rift to rapidly map large volcanic areas. At BGS we apply an integrated approach involving remote sensing and three-dimensional image analysis of topography and surface rock chemistry based on mineral maps generated from false colour Landsat and ASTER imagery within an immersive visualisation suite. Subsequently these digital images and first pass geological interpretations are transferred to a field data tablet, enabling digital data capture in the field. Alternatively, <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>printouts</b> are generated of the various data layers. Ground truthing in the field involves targeted spot mapping, transects and detailed mapping of poor resolution areas. This approach {{is proving to be}} particularly successful in producing a subdivision of basaltic lava flows based on surface features, morphology of flow lobes and emplacement styles, where chemostratigraphic applications fail to identify individual eruption units. Within this structure, further applications such as chemostratigraphy may be utilised in order to elucidate process orientated research of a temporally related series of eruptions. The success of this technique is particularly significant when working in areas which are difficult to access, and may be applied in the future within environmentally or logistically challenging regions...|$|R
40|$|English Heritage is the {{national}} body with {{the responsibility for the}} survey and management of archaeological and historic remains in England. The Aerial Survey & Investigation team within the Research Department deals with the recording and interpretation of sites and landscapes visible on aerial imagery. In England aerial photography has been examined in this way for over 40 years, but {{it is only in the}} last decade that the potential of using lidar for archaeological survey has become apparent. As greater interest has developed in the technique and its use has become more widespread, it became clear that there was a need to produce guidance to help those intending to use the data for archaeological survey. Lidar data can be immensely useful and has unrivalled capabilities for mapping in certain environments, such as within particular types of woodland. There are, however, still lots of uncertainties within the broader archaeological community about just what it can and cannot do. There are also many aspects of the data collection that need to be clearly understood and correctly specified if the data provided is to be as useful as possible. To this end English Heritage has produced a set of guidelines to help those intending to use lidar for archaeological survey. These cover the major aspects of data collection (i. e. issues of resolution and data formats), as well as issues related to using the data in day-to-day survey ranging from producing viable <b>hard</b> <b>copy</b> <b>printouts</b> for use in the field, to mapping with fully interactive raster surfaces in CAD and GIS. 1...|$|R
