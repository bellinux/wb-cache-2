My dad {{used to call me}} after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I was {{speechless}} and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} Dave Besseling of GQ, in 2014, described Kapoor as [...] "friendly, chirpy, affable frat-boy type. Someone you’d {{want to play}} {{video games}} with on a Sunday, but keep the hell away from your sister". However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental. Vickey Lalwani of Mumbai Mirror wrote in 2012 that this perceived media image hindered certain filmmakers from approaching him for roles. Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the media if I’m {{not talking about a}} film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E

500|$|As well as source {{information}} for Cheyenne military and social history, {{the book is}} a rich source of anecdotes. [...] One tale describes how Wooden Leg and Little Bird chase a fleeing Reno soldier. [...] Neither Indian was willing to shoot a fleeing man, as it [...] "seemed not brave" [...] to do so. [...] This did not prevent the soldier from shooting Little Bird, after which Wooden Leg clubbed the soldier off his horse. [...] Wooden Leg describes the screams of his mother when she is presented with a scalp as a present. In another story, Wooden Leg is sitting in the lodge with his friend, Noisy Walking, who is dying of his battle wounds. He wants to support his friend but doesn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> There are many other examples.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her {{dilapidated}} Belgrade apartment. [...] "I don't know <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> when people say I was lucky... life is so hard today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

500|$|Because of the {{significant}} changes made by her translators, Austen was received as {{a different kind of}} novelist in continental Europe than in Britain. For example, the French novelist Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into a genre in which Montolieu herself wrote: the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's Pride and Prejudice, for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones. Elizabeth's claim that she has [...] "always seen a great similarity in the turn of [...] minds" [...] (her and Darcy's) because they are [...] "unwilling to speak, unless [...] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room" [...] becomes [...] "Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet." [...] ("Me, I keep silent, because I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, [...] "the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced". Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his work}} as a playwright, DeLillo has said that he feels his plays are not {{influenced}} by the same writers as his novels: [...] "I'm not sure who influenced me [...] I've seen some reviews that mention Beckett and Pinter, but I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about that.

There was a lot of {{friction}} with management at the time. Some of it might have been my fault." ...|$|E

2500|$|Girls Aloud's website {{describes}} Out of Control as [...] "their {{most exciting}} and thrilling album yet."

We can't tell you anything." [...] It also comes from a lyric in [...] "We Wanna Party". Nicola Roberts revealed that the album was nearly titled Girls Aloud: Revolution, after the song [...] "Revolution in the Head". The artwork for Out of Control was revealed on Girls Aloud's official website on 16 October 2008.|$|E

Tylik later criticised President Putin because he [...] "did not answer direct questions" [...] at the meeting. [...] "Maybe he did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> But we did not receive concrete answers to concrete questions," [...] she said. Tylik told the St. Petersburg Times that she will go to any lengths to learn the truth about the submarine disaster [...] "They told us lies the whole time, and even now we are unable to get any information," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> It does not inspire you with words. There is nothing you can say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Turner, {{when asked}} to define Isis, {{described}} their sound as [...] "avant-garde, drone-oriented rock, but that doesn't completely cover the bases". At the same time, he is reticent about settling on one label exclusively, and steers away {{from the use of}} specific genre labels – [...] "'heavy, atmospheric, droning, post-epic, post-metal, shoegazer blah blah blah.'" [...] When asked how he reacts to being asked to define Isis' sound, he admits [...] "I never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I'm almost afraid of perpetuating a new tag." [...] Likewise, he also describes their music using a slightly more open-ended tag: as [...] "thinking man's metal"; however, this tag refers to the intellectual elements behind the music, as opposed to exclusively aural ones.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Van der Vaart's {{performances}} were attracting interest {{from some of}} Europe’s top clubs. He had previously been strongly linked to Milan, but {{in the summer of}} 2005, he signed for Bundesliga outfit Hamburger SV in Germany. Van der Vaart's €5.5million transfer to Hamburg, on 1 June 2005, raised many eyebrows. Many other top-flight clubs had shown interest in the midfielder but he chose Hamburg. Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his De Telegraaf column, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about it or what Rafael van der Vaart is doing in Hamburg." [...] He played a massive part in Hamburg’s impressive away form that season, scoring in each of their first four games on the road; in fact, {{in the course of his}} first one and a half seasons with the German club, they did not lose a single match away from home while he was on the pitch. Van der Vaart finished his first season as the team's top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1946, Miles was {{informed}} that by Lockspeiser of the immediate discontinuation {{of the project and}} to cease work on the M.52. Frank Miles later stated of this decision: [...] "I did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or think when this extraordinary decision was sprung upon me, without warning of any kind. At our last official design meeting all members, including the Ministry and Power Jets' representatives, had been cheerful and optimistic". According to Frank Miles, when he approached Lockspeiser for reasons behind the cancellation, he {{was informed}} that it was due to economic reasons; Lockspeiser also stated his believe that aeroplanes would not fly supersonically for many years and may not ever do so. By this point, the postwar Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, had implemented dramatic budget cuts in various areas, which may have provided an inducement for the cancellation of the M.52, which was projected to involve considerable cost. According to Wood, [...] "the decision not to go ahead was purely a political one made by the Attlee Government".|$|E

2500|$|The {{summer before}} her {{freshman}} year of high school, Melinda Sordino meets Andy Evans at a senior party. Outside the woods, Andy rapes her. Melinda calls 9-1-1, but does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and runs home. The police come and break up the party, {{and some people are}} arrested. Melinda does not tell anyone what happened to her, and nobody asks. She starts high school at Merryweather High School as an outcast since all her old friends left her, and is shunned by her peers for calling the police. She remains silent and sinks into depression. Melinda is befriended by Heather, a new girl, who clings to Melinda only to ditch her for [...] "the Marthas", so she can belong to a clique instead of being an outcast like Melinda. As Melinda's depression deepens, she begins to skip school, withdrawing from her already distant parents and other authority figures, who see her silence as means of getting [...] "attention". She slowly befriends her lab partner, David Petrakis, who encourages her to speak up for herself.|$|E
2500|$|Galileo Galilei was {{the first}} to observe the rings of Saturn in 1610 using his telescope, but was unable to {{identify}} them as such. He wrote to the Duke of Tuscany that [...] "The planet Saturn is not alone, but is composed of three, which almost touch one another and never move nor change with respect to one another. They are arranged in a line parallel to the zodiac, and the middle one (Saturn itself) is about {{three times the size of}} the lateral ones." [...] He also described the rings as Saturn's [...] "ears". In 1612 the Earth passed through the plane of the rings and they became invisible. Mystified, Galileo remarked [...] "I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in a case so surprising, so unlooked for and so novel." [...] He mused, [...] "Has Saturn swallowed his children?" [...] — referring to the myth of the Titan Saturn devouring his offspring to forestall the prophecy of them overthrowing him. He was further confused when the rings again became visible in 1613.|$|E
2500|$|Among other songs is {{the ballad}} [...] "Speechless", {{which is a}} 1970s rock-inspired number that talks about abusive relationships: [...] "I can't believe how you slurred at me with your half-wired broken jaw". It {{consists}} of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs, which according to PopMatters, {{is comparable to the}} work of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Gaga's inspiration behind the track was her father's heart condition, and her fear about his death. Gaga recalled that her [...] "dad used to call after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there. I wrote this song as a plea to him." [...] Produced by Ron Fair, [...] "Speechless" [...] was recorded with all live instruments such as drums, guitars, bass and piano played by Gaga. The album's fifth track, [...] "Dance in the Dark", talks about a girl being uncomfortable having sex with the lights on, so she would prefer to perform it in the [...] "dark". Gaga has [...] "resolute" [...] vocals in the song, and the synths ultimately lead to the chorus where she belts, [...] "Baby loves to Dance in the Dark, 'Cause when he's looking she falls apart".|$|E
