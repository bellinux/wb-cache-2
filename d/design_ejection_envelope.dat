When this occurs, the occupant’s head can contact the barrier or an object attached thereto. This impact event, often termed head slap, normally produces a serious injury or fatality.

40|$|Introduction: The modern {{ejection}} seat has evolved {{to a high}} standard of sophistication, significantly expanding the safe <b>ejection</b> <b>envelope.</b> Low-level <b>ejections</b> are {{at the margins of}} this envelope and the outcome depends on numerous factors, including aircraft attitude, airspeed, and vertical rate of descent. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze all published ejection injury studies, with particular emphasis on altitude at the time of ejection, to determine if low-level ejections have an overall higher fatality rate. Methods: The aeromedical literature was reviewed for all studies relating to ejection outcomes in which the ejection altitude was recorded. Used in this analysis were 10 studies covering the period 1952 - 1997. Low-level ejections were defined as ejection below 500 ft (152 m) above ground level. Results: There were 562 low-level ejections identified. Out of this number, there were 274 fatalities, giving a low-level ejection survival rate of 51. 2 %. There were 2607 ejections that occurred above 500 ft (152 m), with a survival rate of 91. 4 %. There was a significant difference between ejection survival rates below and above 500 ft (152 m). Low-level ejections have a significantly increased risk of a fatal outcome (Odds Ratio 10. 07). Conclusions: Ejecting from an aircraft below 500 ft (152 m) has a lower survival rate compared with the survival rate for all ejections. This is due to many factors, including the nature of the emergency, aircraft operating parameters at the time, and the inherent dangers of low-level operations. Low-level emergencies are time-critical events in which an early decision to eject can improve the chances of a successful outcome...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the formation of}} low–mass X–ray binaries containing accreting neutron stars via the helium–star supernova channel. The predicted relative number of short–period transients provides a sensitive test of the input physics in this process. We investigate the effect of varying mean kick velocities, orbital angular momentum loss efficiencies, and common <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> efficiencies on the subpopulation of short–period systems, both transient and persistent. Guided by the thermal–viscous disk instability model in irradiation–dominated disks, we posit that short–period transients have donors {{close to the end}} of core–hydrogen burning. We find that with increasing mean kick velocity the overall short-period fraction, s, grows, while the fraction, r, of systems with evolved donors among short-period systems drops. This effect, acting in opposite directions on these two fractions, allows us to constrain models of LMXB formation through comparison with observational estimates of s and r. Without fine tuning or extreme assumptions about evolutionary parameters, consistency between models and current observations is achieved for a regime of intermediate average kick magnitudes of about 100 – 200 km s − 1, provided that (i) orbital braking for systems with donor masses in the range 1 − 1. 5 M ⊙ is weak, i. e., much less effective than a simple extrapolation of standard magnetic braking beyond 1. 0 M⊙ would suggest, and (ii) the efficiency of common <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> is low...|$|R

A detailed stellar evolution code is used to calculate grids of single-star and binary models and we use these to reconstruct possible evolutionary scenarios. We apply various criteria to select the acceptable solutions from these scenarios. We confirm the conclusion of Nelemans et al. (2000) that formation via conservative mass transfer and a common envelope with spiral-in based on energy balance or via two such spiralins cannot explain the formation of all observed systems. We investigate three different prescriptions of <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> due to dynamical mass loss with angular-momentum balance and show that they can explain the observed masses and orbital periods well. Next, we demand that the age difference of our model is comparable to the observed cooling-age difference and show that this puts a strong constraint on the model solutions. However, the scenario in which the primary loses its envelope in an isotropic wind and the secondary transfers its envelope, which is then re-emitted isotropically, can explain the observed age differences as well.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at: [URL] Copyright The European Southern ObservatoryHot subdwarf B stars (sdBs) in close binary systems {{are assumed to be}} formed via common <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection.</b> According to {{theoretical}} models, the amount of energy and angular momentum deposited in the common envelope scales with the mass of the companion. That low mass companions near or below the core hydrogen-burning limit are able to trigger the <b>ejection</b> of this <b>envelope</b> is well known. The currently known systems have very short periods 0. 1 ??? 0. 3 d. Here we report the discovery of a low mass companion (M 2 > 0. 14 M???) orbiting the sdB star and central star of a planetary nebula EGB 5 with an orbital period of 16. 5 d at a minimum separation of 23 R???. Its long period is only just consistent with the energy balance prescription of the common envelope. The marked difference between the short and long period systems will provide strong constraints on the common envelope phase, in particular if the masses of the sdB stars can be measured accurately. Due to selection effects, the fraction of sdBs with low mass companions and similar or longer periods may be quite high. Low mass stellar and substellar companions may therefore play a significant role for the still unclear formation of hot subdwarf stars. Furthermore, the nebula around EGB 5 may be the remnant of the ejected common envelope making this binary a unique system to study this short und poorly understood phase of binary evolution...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{formation}} of a common envelope system following dynamically unstable mass transfer in a close binary, and the subsequent dynamical evolution and final fate of the envelope. We base our discussion on new three-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations that we have performed for a close binary system containing a 4 M ⊙ red giant with a 0. 7 M ⊙ main-sequence star companion. The initial parameters are chosen to model {{the formation of}} a system resembling V 471 Tau, a typical progenitor of a cataclysmic variable binary. The calculations are performed using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method with up to 5 × 104 particles. As initial condition we use an exact hydrostatic equilibrium configuration at the onset of dynamically unstable mass transfer. The nonlinear development of the instability is followed using SPH until a quasi-static common envelope configuration is formed. In our highest-resolution calculation, we find evidence for a corotating region of gas around the central binary. This is in agreement with the theoretical model proposed by Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister (1979) for the evolution of common envelope systems, in which this central corotating region is coupled to the envelope through viscous angular momentum transport only. We also find evidence that the envelope is convectively unstable, in which case the viscous dissipation time could be as short as ∼ 100 dynamical times, leading to rapid <b>ejection</b> of the <b>envelope.</b> For V 471 Tau, our results, and the observed parameters of the system, are entirely consistent with rapid <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> on a timescale ∼ 1 yr and an efficiency parameter αCE ≃ 1...|$|R

Circa 1985, with the introduction of the M16A2 version, a case deflector was incorporated adjacent to the ejector port to direct discarded shells in a more forward direction, making the rifle even more left hand operator friendly. The deflector is not always effective, however, as the ejected shell still stands a chance of hitting the left-handed shooter's cheek, especially in windy conditions.|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{transient}} phenomena in the Universe reveal {{a spectrum of}} mass-ejection properties associated with massive stars, covering from Type II/Ib/Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe) to giant eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables (LBV) and optical transients. Here, we hypothesize that a fraction of these phenomena may have an explosive origin, the distinguishing ingredient being {{the ratio of the}} prompt energy release E_dep to the envelope binding energy E_binding. Using one-dimensional one-group radiation hydrodynamics and a set of 10 - 25 Msun, massive-star models, we explore the dynamical response of a stellar envelope subject to a strong, sudden, and deeply-rooted energy release. Following energy deposition, a shock systematically forms, crosses the progenitor envelope on a day timescale, and breaks-out with a signal of hour-to-days duration and a 10 ^ 5 - 10 ^ 11 Lsun luminosity. For E_dep > E_binding, full <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> results with a SN-like bolometric luminosity and kinetic energy, modulations being commensurate to the energy deposited and echoing the diversity of Type II-Plateau SNe. For E_dep ~ E_binding, partial <b>envelope</b> <b>ejection</b> results with a small expansion speed, and a more modest but year-long luminosity plateau, reminiscent of LBV eruptions or so-called SN impostors. For E_dep < E_binding, we obtain a "puffed-up" star, secularly relaxing back to thermal equilibrium. In parallel with gravitational collapse and Type II SNe, we argue that the thermonuclear combustion of merely a few 0. 01 Msun of C/O could power a wide range of explosions/eruptions in loosely-bound massive stars, as those in the 8 - 12 Msun range, or in more massive ones owing to their proximity to the Eddington limit and/or critical rotation.

To date we have obtained blue spectra of 40 subdwarf B stars from the Edinburgh-Cape catalogue using the grating spectrograph at the 1. 9 m Radcliffe telescope at the South African Astronomical Observatory. We find that 17 out of these 40 are certain binaries with a few other objects showing radial velocity variations of small amplitude. The binary fraction found in our sample, after correcting for our binary detection efficiency, is 48 %. We have secured the orbital parameters for 4 of the 17 systems and narrowed down the orbits of another 7 to a small range of periods. Out of the four subdwarf B binaries for which we have determined the orbital solution, three have orbital periods that, according to population synthesis studies by Han et al.

The masses of the companions, assuming a canonical mass of 0. 5 M? for the subdwarf B star, suggest that they are probably white dwarfs.
