40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{dispatch}} {{of emergency}} medical services {{at the onset of}} acute stroke is vital in expediting assessment and treatment. We examined the relationship between callers' description of potential stroke symptoms to the emergency medical dispatcher and the subsequent classification and prioritisation of {{emergency medical services}} response. AIM: To identify key 'indicator' words used by people making emergency calls for suspected stroke, comparing these with the subsequent category of response given by the emergency medical dispatcher. METHOD: A retrospective chart review (hospital and emergency medical services) in North West England (October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007) identified digitally recorded emergency medical services calls, which related to patients who had a diagnosis of suspected stroke at some point on the stroke pathway (from the emergency medical services call taker through to final medical diagnosis). Using content analysis, words used to describe stroke by the caller were recorded. A second researcher independently followed the same procedure in order to produce a list of 'indicator' words. Description of stroke-specific and nonstroke-specific problems reported by the caller was compared with subsequent emergency medical services <b>dispatch</b> <b>coding</b> and demographic features.

40|$|AbstractGeneric {{programming}} with C++ templates {{results in}} efficient but inflexible code: efficient, because the exact types of inputs to generic functions are known at compile time; inflexible because {{they must be}} known at compile time. We show how to achieve run-time polymorphism without compromising performance by instantiating the generic algorithm with a comprehensive set of possible parameter types, and choosing the appropriate instantiation at run time. Applying this approach naïvely can result in excessive template bloat: {{a large number of}} template instantiations, many of which are identical at the assembly level. We show practical examples of this approach quickly approaching the limits of the compiler. Consequently, we combine this method of run-time polymorphism for generic programming, with a strategy for reducing the number of necessary template instantiations. We report on using our approach in GIL, Adobe’s open source Generic Image Library. We observed a notable reduction, up to 70 % at times, in executable sizes of our test programs. This was the case even with compilers that perform aggressive template hoisting at the compiler level, due to significantly smaller <b>dispatching</b> <b>code.</b> The framework draws from both the generic and generative programming paradigms, using static metaprogramming to fine tune the compilation of a generic library.

40|$|Objectives This paper aims {{to examine}} whether an {{adaptation}} of the International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding system can be applied retrospectively to final paramedic assessment data in an ambulance dataset {{with a view to}} developing more fine-grained, clinically relevant case definitions than are available through point-of-call data. Methods Over 1. 2 million case records were extracted from the Ambulance Victoria data warehouse. Data fields included <b>dispatch</b> <b>code,</b> cause (CN) and final primary assessment (FPA). Each FPA was converted to an ICD- 10 -AM code using word matching or best fit. ICD- 10 -AM codes were then converted into Major Diagnostic Categories (MDC). CN was aligned with the ICD- 10 -AM codes for external cause of morbidity and mortality. Results The most accurate results were obtained when ICD- 10 -AM codes were assigned using information from both FPA and CN. Comparison of cases coded as unconscious at point-of-call with the associated paramedic assessment highlighted the extra clinical detail obtained when paramedic assessment data are used. Conclusions Ambulance paramedic assessment data can be aligned with ICD- 10 -AM and MDC with relative ease, allowing retrospective coding of large datasets. Coding of ambulance data using ICD- 10 -AM allows for comparison of not only ambulance service users but also with other population groups. What is known about the topic? There is no reliable and standard coding and categorising system for paramedic assessment data contained in ambulance service databases. What does this paper add? This study demonstrates that ambulance paramedic assessment data can be aligned with ICD- 10 -AM and MDC with relative ease, allowing retrospective coding of large datasets. Representation of ambulance case types using ICD- 10 -AM-coded information obtained after paramedic assessment is more fine grained and clinically relevant than point-of-call data, which uses caller information before ambulance attendance. What are the implications for practitioners? This paper describes a model of coding using an internationally recognised standard coding and categorising system to support analysis of paramedic assessment.

40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{ambulance}} call-outs in Norway is increasing owing to societal changes and increased demand from the public. Together with improved but more expensive education of ambulance staff, {{this leads to}} increased costs and staffing shortages. We wanted to study whether the current dispatch triage tools could reliably identify patients who only required transport, and not pre-hospital medical care. This could allow selection of such patients for designated transport units, freeing up highly trained ambulance staff to attend patients in greater need. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was used, drawing on all electronic and paper records in our ambulance service from four random days in 2012. The patients were classified into acuity groups, based on Emergency Medical <b>Dispatch</b> <b>codes,</b> and pre-hospital interventions were extracted from the Patient Report Forms. Results: Of the 1489 ambulance call-outs included in this study, 82 PRFs (5 %) were missing. A highly significant association was found between acuity group and recorded pre-hospital intervention (p ≤ 0. 001). We found no correlation between gender, distance to hospital, age and pre-hospital interventions. Ambulances staffed by paramedics performed more interventions (234 / 917, 26 %) than those with emergency medical technicians (42 / 282, 15 %). The strongest predictor for needing pre-hospital interventions {{was found to be}} the emergency medical dispatch acuity descriptor. Discussion: This study has demonstrated that the Norwegian dispatch system is able to correctly identify patients who do not need pre-hospital interventions. Patients with a low acuity code had a very low level of pre-hospital interventions. Evaluation of adherence to protocol in the Emergency Medical Dispatch is not possible due to the inherent need for medical experience in the triage process. Conclusions: This study validates the Norwegian dispatch tool (Norwegian index) as a predictor of patients who do not need pre-hospital interventions...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{major cause}} of death and disability. Recent changes in the {{treatment}} and care of stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients have improved survival and quality of life. However, these therapies are strictly time-dependent, with improved outcomes for early-arriving patients, while late-arriving patients are excluded from some forms of treatment. The overarching aim of this thesis is to explore the paramedic care of acute stroke/TIA patients, through an investigation of the utilisation of the emergency medical services (EMS) as the first medical contact, current EMS practice and patient-focused outcomes. This population-based study links clinical and operational data from the EMS, with patient data from hospital medical records, to explore whether there is a relationship between paramedic care and patient outcomes in acute stroke/TIA. The observational study adopts a quantitative approach and includes records from 2, 524 stroke/TIA cases. Sixty-four percent of patients in this study, had their first medical contact with a paramedic rather than with a primary care doctor or Emergency Department staff. Four factors were associated with initial contact with an EMS paramedic: increasing patient age, the presence of signs at onset that were recognisable with a FAST test, a final diagnosis of intracerebral haemorrhage compared to TIA and other sub-classifications compared to lacunar circulation infarct. Paramedics recognised 70 percent of stroke/TIA cases. Six factors were associated with non-recognition of stroke/TIA by paramedics. These factors were: a <b>dispatch</b> <b>code</b> other than stroke, absence of a patient or familial history of stroke/TIA, severity described as minor compared to more severe presentations, absence of a documented FAST assessment, a final diagnosis of intracerebral haemorrhage or ischaemic stroke compared to TIA and a classification of posterior compared to lacunar circulation infarction. Among ischaemic stroke patients, first medical contact with an EMS paramedic was associated with a shorter onset-to-door delay compared to initial contact with a primary care doctor. Thrombolysis rates were higher among ischaemic stroke patients when the paramedic recognised the event. Mortality was higher, and functional independence and quality of life scores were lower among EMS patients than those using other prehospital pathways. These poorer patient outcomes were associated with greater dependency prior to stroke onset or a more severe stroke among this group of patients. However, despite greater severity at baseline in the EMS group, {{there was no difference between}} the two groups in the proportion who improved to achieve independent functioning at 28 days. This study identifies a need for increased public awareness of the importance of contacting the EMS in cases of suspected stroke/TIA and of the risk of stroke among younger age groups. Paramedics need to be educated about atypical stroke symptoms and the necessity of screening a wider range of patients in order to improve recognition of stroke/TIA cases. The importance of arriving at a stroke centre as early as possible to maximise the benefits of treatment, rather than within four hours, should be emphasised. Finally, paramedicine as a nascent healthcare profession, should be actively engaged in research collaborations that support evidence-based practice.

Comparisons of a sample of individual emergency patients 2 ̆ 7 syndrome assignments according to the EMS versus each of the two hospital categorization schemes were made by matching EMS run records to their corresponding emergency department patient encounter records. This new, linked dataset was analyzed to assess the level of agreement beyond chance between the three possible pairs of syndrome categorization schemes in assigning patients to a respiratory or non-respiratory syndrome and to a gastrointestinal or non-gastrointestinal syndrome. Cohen 2 ̆ 7 s kappa statistics were used to measure chance-adjusted agreement between categorization schemes (raters). Z-tests and a chi-square-like test based on the variance of the kappa statistic were used to test the equivalence of kappa coefficients across syndromes, population subgroups and pairs of syndrome assignment schemes. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive and predictive value negative of EMS dispatch and chief complaint-based categorization schemes were also calculated, using the ICD- 9 -coded ED diagnosis-based categorization scheme as the criterion standard. Comparisons of all performance characteristic (i. e. sensitivity, specificity, predictive value positive and predictive value negative) values were made across categorization schemes and surveillance syndromes to determine whether they were significantly different. The use of EMS <b>dispatch</b> <b>codes</b> for assigning emergency patients to surveillance syndromes was found to have limited but statistically significant reliability in relation to more commonly used syndrome grouping methods based on chief complaints or ICD- 9 coded ED diagnoses.

40|$|Background. The Medical Priority Dispatch System (MPDS) is a {{commonly}} used computer-based emergency medical dispatch (EMD) {{system that is}} widely used to prioritize 9 - 1 - 1 calls and optimize resource allocation. There are five major priority classes used to dispatch 9 - 1 - 1 calls in the San Francisco System; Alpha codes are the lowest priority (lowest expected acuity) and Echo are the highest priority. Objective. We sought to determine which MPDS <b>dispatch</b> <b>codes</b> are associated with high prehospital nontransport rates (NTRs). Methods. All unique MPDS call categories from 2009 in a highly urbanized, two-tier advanced life support (ALS) system were sorted according to highest NTRs. There are many reasons for nontransport, such as "gone on arrival," and "patient denied transport. " Those categories with greater than 100 annual calls were further evaluated. MPDS groups that included multiple categories with NTRs exceeding 25 % were then identified and each category was analyzed. Results. EMS responded {{to a total of}} 81, 437 calls in 2009, of which 18, 851 were not transported by EMS. The majority of the NTRs were found among "cardiac/ respiratory arrest/death," "assault/sexual assaults," "unknown problem/man down," "traffic/transportation accidents," and "unconscious/fainting. " "Cardiac or respiratory arrest/death -obvious death" (9 B 1) had the highest overall nontransport rate, 99. 25 % (1 / 134), most likely due to declaration of death. "Unknown problem -man down -medical alert notification" had the second highest NTR, 67. 22 % (138 / 421). However, Echo priority codes had the highest overall nontransport rates (45. 45 %) and Charlie had the lowest (13. 84 %). Conclusions. The nontransport rates of individual MPDS categories vary considerably and should be considered in any system design. We identified 52 unique call categories to have a 25 % or greater NTR, 18 of which exceeded 40 %. The majority of NTRs occurred among the "cardiac/respiratory arrest/death," "assault/sexual assaults," "unknown problem/man down," "traffic/transportation accidents," and "unconscious/fainting" categories. The higher the priority code within each subset (AB vs. CDE), the less likely the patient was to be transported. Charlie priority codes had a lower NTR than Delta, and Delta was lower than Echo. Charlie codes were therefore the strongest predictors of hospital transport, while Echo codes (highest priority) were those with the highest nontransport rates and were the worst predictors of hospital transport in the emergent subset. © 2014 National Association of EMS Physicians...|$|R

Thus, it is legal, under the rules of inheritance, to assign an object of type T' to a variable of type T. The reason this type substitutability poses problems is that all object-oriented languages use the dynamic type of at least one method argument (the receiver), in conjunction with the selector, to determine which method to invoke. Since the dynamic type of arguments can be different than the static type, a compiler can not always establish the correct method to execute. Instead, the compiler must often generate code that will compute the appropriate address at runtime. The process of computing the method address at run-time is known as method <b>dispatch.</b> The <b>code</b> generated by the compiler, along with the information this code relies on, makes up a specific method dispatch techniqu...|$|R
40|$|Background Accurate {{dispatch}} {{of emergency}} medical services {{at the onset of}} acute stroke is vital in expediting assessment and treatment. We examined the relationship between callers? description of potential stroke symptoms to the emergency medical dispatcher and the subsequent classification and prioritisation of {{emergency medical services}} response. Aim To identify key ?indicator? words used by people making emergency calls for suspected stroke, comparing these with the subsequent category of response given by the emergency medical dispatcher. Method A retrospective chart review (hospital and emergency medical services) in North West England (October 1, 2006 to September 30, 2007) identified digitally recorded emergency medical services calls, which related to patients who had a diagnosis of suspected stroke at some point on the stroke pathway (from the emergency medical services call taker through to final medical diagnosis). Using content analysis, words used to describe stroke by the caller were recorded. A second researcher independently followed the same procedure in order to produce a list of ?indicator? words. Description of stroke-specific and nonstroke-specific problems reported by the caller was compared with subsequent emergency medical services <b>dispatch</b> <b>coding</b> and demographic features. Results Six hundred forty-three calls were made to emergency medical services of which 592 (92 %) had complete emergency medical services and hospital data. The majority of callers were female (67 %) and family members (55 %). The most frequently reported problems first said by callers to the emergency medical dispatcher were collapse or fall (26 %) and stroke (25 %). Callers who identified that the patient was having a stroke were correct in 89 % of cases. Calls were dispatched as stroke in 45 % of cases, of which 83 % had confirmed stroke. Of the first reported problems, Face Arm Speech Test stroke symptoms were mentioned in less than 5 % of calls, with speech problems being the most common symptom. No callers mentioned all three Face Arm Speech Test symptoms. Conclusion Callers who contacted emergency medical services for suspected stroke and said stroke as the first reported problem were often correct. Calls categorised as stroke by the emergency medical dispatcher were commonly confirmed as stroke in the hospital. Speech problems were the most commonly reported element of the Face Arm Speech Test test to be reported by callers. Recognition of possible stroke diagnosis in fall and other presentations should be considered by emergency medical dispatchers. Further development and training are needed in the community to improve prehospital stroke recognition in order to expedite hyperacute stroke care...|$|R
500|$|Koval enjoyed {{free access}} to much of Oak Ridge; he was made a [...] "health physics officer", and {{monitored}} radiation levels across the facility. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation records, the job gave him top-secret security clearance. At the time, Project scientists discovered reactor-produced plutonium was too unstable for the intended bomb designs, and that polonium initiators (urchin) were needed for the necessary chain reactions to occur. Koval was charged by his handlers with watching Oak Ridge's polonium supply to transmit information about it through a Soviet contact named [...] "Clyde". His information reached Moscow via <b>coded</b> <b>dispatches,</b> couriers, and the Soviet Embassy. Among the intelligence he sent was that Oak Ridge's polonium was being sent to another Project site at Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|R

5000|$|The {{three are}} {{assigned}} to a US Naval destroyer, Dutch and Skeets subordinate to Baltimore, who is promoted to a chief petty officer, because he has served in the navy before. A German U-boat intercepts a sailing ship flying Norwegian colors, and when the German officer boards the ship, the Norwegian captain shares information with him regarding the movements of allied shipping, thus showing us that the Norwegian ship is an undercover [...] "message ship" [...] for the Germans. Shortly after this encounter, the destroyer carrying the three friends also intercepts the sailing ship. In an attempt to destroy incriminating evidence, the Norwegian captain sets the ship afire.

Industry initiatives such as Efficient Consumer Response advocate close collaboration between manufacturers and retailers. Com-panies rely heavily on enabling technologies to support business processes: electronic data interchange (EDI) messages are used to transfer point-of-sale (POS) data, orders, and <b>dispatch</b> advices; bar <b>codes</b> allow companies to identify items, cases, and pallets in the supply chain and in the store; and global data synchronization initiatives are aimed at ensuring consistent product master data between trading partners. The grocery supply chain is driven to an ever-greater extent by information, and due to the increasing focus on inventory reduction and frequent, just-in-time deliveries, there is little margin for error. As a consequence, the importance of data quality is growing...|$|R
