5|$|On November 11, 2009, Cook was {{diagnosed}} with a parathyroid tumor in his neck. Doctors assessed that the tumor was pressing against his vocal cords making it virtually <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to perform. He was treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} DePauw, Julian wanted to obtain his {{doctorate}} in chemistry, but learned {{it would be}} difficult for an African-American to do so. Instead he obtained a position as a chemistry instructor at Fisk University. In 1923 he received an Austin Fellowship in Chemistry, which allowed him to attend Harvard University to obtain his M.S. However, worried that Euro-American students would resent being taught by an African-American, Harvard withdrew Julian's teaching assistantship, making it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to complete his Ph.D. at Harvard.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated {{character}} traits and mannerisms, it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to create his own problems and troubles {{in the manner of}} other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E

They both said that that sort o’ thing wouldn’t look well in writing, not if anybody else {{happened}} to see it, that is; besides which Ginger said it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>’im</b> to say ’ow much money he would ’ave the handling of.

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to do so in}} all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts. Clark deeded much of his land to friends or transferred ownership to family members so his creditors could not seize it. Lenders and their assignees eventually deprived the veteran of {{nearly all of the}} property that remained in his name. Clark, who was at one time the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville. In 1803 Clark built a cabin overlooking the Falls of the Ohio, where he lived until his health failed in 1809. He also operated a small gristmill, which he worked with two African American slaves.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to remain superior of an institute that no longer wanted or listened to him.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a popular}} Malay {{folklore}} which told of a princess with magical powers who resided on the mountain. She was wooed to be {{the wife of the}} then Sultan of Malacca, Sultan Mahmud Shah. However, she set seven <b>impossible</b> conditions <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as a means to reject his proposal.|$|R
60|$|No {{one could}} rebuke the old man--certainly not the master whom he loved so well; {{and though they}} {{knew that it would}} be <b>impossible</b> to provide <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> none of them at the moment had the heart to tell him so.|$|R
5|$|During a later court {{session on}} September 9, Takaesu {{attempted}} to submit medical evidence that Brown {{had suffered a}} back injury in 1999 and had a steel collar and bolts inserted around his spine. According to Brown, these injuries made it <b>impossible</b> to <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to assault V. N. {{as described in the}} police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.|$|R
5|$|Until 1954, the Scotland {{team was}} managed by a SFA {{selection}} committee. The role of manager was first established in May 1954 with {{the appointment of}} Andy Beattie, who took charge on a part-time basis while continuing as manager of Huddersfield Town. Beattie took the team to the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but the SFA only allowed him to select a travelling party of 13 players. Beattie, who felt this restriction made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to perform his duties well, resigned during the tournament. Scotland were eliminated from the tournament after a 7–0 defeat by Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|Gregory's Chronicle, the Chronicle of London, or MS Edgerton 1995, is {{the name}} given to a fifteenth-century English chronicle. It {{takes its name from}} its {{supposed}} author, William Gregory, who started as a skinner in London. Greogory {{went on to become a}} London Alderman, Sheriff from 1436 to 1437, and eventually Mayor from 1450 to 1451. The name 'Gregory' for the manuscript is, however, merely a convenience, as its actual authorship is unknown. Indeed, since the chronicle spans the period 1189 to 1470, and William Gregory died in 1467, it is <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have composed it in its entirety. Other fifteenth-century authors have been proposed, ranging from a contemporary poet to an Ecclesiast, but since even the exact dates of its composition are also debated it has been impossible for historians to definitively attribute the authorship to any known individual.|$|E
60|$|Malchus was {{received}} with great delight {{by his father}} and Hannibal, who had given <b>him</b> up <b>for</b> lost. Nessus had {{over and over again}} recounted all the details of their adventure to his comrades, and the quickness of Malchus at hitting upon the stratagem of returning to the cave, and so escaping from a position where escape seemed well nigh <b>impossible,</b> won <b>for</b> <b>him</b> an even higher place than before in the admiration of his followers.|$|R
60|$|But in this he was unjust to Halidome, forgetting how <b>impossible</b> it was <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to believe}} that a woman could not stand him. He reached his rooms, and, the more freely to enjoy the clear lamplight, the soft, gusty breeze, and waning turmoil of the streets, waited a moment before entering.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} legend centres on the Princess’ {{response to}} Sultan Mahmud’s proposal. During {{the time of}} the old Malay Sultanates the Sultans were believed to have ‘daulat’, a divine right bestowed from God that gives them absolute power over the land and its people. It is because of this that the Princess, though she was not interested in his proposal, did not refuse him outright. Instead she set <b>for</b> <b>him</b> seven <b>impossible</b> tasks <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to fulfil, but Sultan Mahmud was either too proud or too blind to realize that the tasks were her way of turning him down, and when he attempted to fulfil them Malacca fell into ruin.|$|R
5|$|The rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{at the end of}} 1989, when the title was to be decided between Senna and Prost at Suzuka. The two McLarens {{collided}} at the Casio Triangle chicane when Prost blocked an attempted pass by Senna. Prost walked away while Senna returned to the track. Senna {{went on to win the}} race, but was later disqualified in a highly controversial ruling over his path back to the track, as his car was pushed through the road around the chicane. After an unsuccessful appeal by McLaren, the Brazilian received a further US$100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, leading Senna to accuse FIA president Jean-Marie Balestre of favoring his compatriot Prost. Senna's disqualification meant that it was mathematically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to overhaul Prost's points total, and so the 1989 Championship went to the Frenchman. There has been much debate as to whether Senna was overambitious in his overtaking manoeuver, whether Prost intentionally ran into Senna, or whether the collision was simply a racing incident between two teammates who were embittered with each other.|$|E
5|$|During the {{criminal}} trial, {{all the major}} figures in the case were called on to give evidence. Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite {{and at least one}} of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel. As people of low birth, Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion. Le Gris' case involved several strategies; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations. Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question, establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre. Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil, where the crime supposedly took place, in a single day, a round trip of approximately 50miles (80km).|$|E

50|$|But Antonio and Camila {{have gone}} too far, {{regardless}} of Sofia. The economic future of the construction company is at stake, along with a whole neighborhood, a family and the happiness of Rocky. But something will change: Antonio's father, Pedro (Victor Camara), puts Antonio {{out on the street}} for being irresponsible. Antonio decides to marry Sofia and show his father that he has matured, but Sofia already knows what he is, and does not {{want to have anything to}} do with him. Camila, meanwhile, tries to recover Antonio by making life <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> both <b>him</b> and Sofia, without acknowledging she is in love with him.|$|R
60|$|The {{court at}} Westminster during the few months which {{followed}} {{the capture of}} Calais was the most brilliant in Europe. Tournaments and fetes followed each other in rapid succession, and to these knights came from all parts. So great was the reputation of King Edward that deputies came from Germany, where the throne was now vacant, to offer the crown of that kingdom to him. The king declined the offer, for {{it would have been}} <b>impossible</b> indeed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to have united the German crown with that of England, which he already held, and that of France, which he claimed.|$|R
60|$|Trafford's {{conviction}} that Marjorie also wanted, {{with an almost}} equal eagerness, the same opportunity for speech and explanations that he desired, sustained him {{in a series of}} unjustifiable intrusions upon the seclusion of the Popes. But although the manner of Mr. and Mrs. Pope did change considerably for the better after his next visit, it was extraordinary how <b>impossible</b> it seemed <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and Marjorie to achieve their common end of an encounter.|$|R

25|$|On the {{day before}} the jury retired, a {{forensic}} pathologist said that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to determine whether the fatal strike had been inflicted late on the evening of 8 September, around the time that Hannigan's assault had taken place, or at a later date.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, Joffe, {{freed from}} the Siberian exile by the February Revolution, {{returned}} to the Crimea. Crimean social democrats {{sent him to the}} capital, Petrograd, to represent them, but he soon moved to an internationalist revolutionary position, which made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to remain in an organization dominated by less radical Mensheviks. Instead, he joined forces with Trotsky, who had just returned from abroad.|$|E

50|$|Back in Oz, Zelena {{demands that}} the Wizard help her to travel {{back in time to}} stop Cora from abandoning her, but he claims that it's <b>impossible,</b> even <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Suspicious, she uses her power to bring the curtain down. It turns out that the Wizard is none other than Walsh (Emma Swan's boyfriend and ex-fiance), a circus barker from Kansas. Walsh says he does not have magic, but he {{collects}} it. Zelena decides that she has no use <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> but what she could use is a trained circus animal. And after seeing a flying monkey poster, she drags Walsh and transforms him into one to do her bidding. Zelena then uses the magic viewer in the floor to watch Rumplestilskin train Regina, even as she turns green with envy and wicked as ever, vowing that {{by the time she was}} done, Regina would have never even been born.|$|R
25|$|Working with Wendy Greuel, then Chair of the City Council's Transportation Committee, Villaraigosa {{issued an}} {{executive}} directive aimed at banning road construction during rush hour in traffic-plagued Los Angeles, and established anti-gridlock zones and launched Tiger Teams to improve traffic flow during peak rush hour times. Villaraigosa even publicly pledged {{to take the}} subway to work one day a month, {{as reported by the}} Los Angeles Times. This, however, proved <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

Alavoine punctured {{six times in}} that stage, which made it <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> {{to keep up with}} Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead. Heusghem was at that point the strongest rider in the race, and seemed to be {{on the way to the}} overall victory in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The applause, {{by which}} the orator had been {{frequently}} interrupted, at this point became so vociferous and long continued that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to proceed.

60|$|The look of her, the {{tones of}} her voice, made him weak. Then {{he thought of}} his cold, sordid lodgings, and he {{realized}} that one more moment here alone with Mel Iden would make him a coward in his own eyes. He thanked her, and told her how <b>impossible</b> it was <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to stay, and bidding her good night he reeled out into the white gloom. At the gate he was already tired; at the bridge he needed rest. Once more, then, he heard the imagined voices of the waters calling to him.|$|R

Former gymnast and current mentor of Pietro in Njård Espen Jansen claims that he has got advantages which could lead him to new highs. Flemming Solberg, a noticeable gymnast, gives Pietro the following description: [...] "Pietro is a typical all-rounder, one among the greatest talents I have come across in this country. His strength is in his lean lines. He is a stylish gymnast...". In addition, Solberg believes that Pietro lacks a bit of strength and also that completing the qualification for the Olympic Games is not an <b>impossible</b> task <b>for</b> <b>him</b> despite the confronting difficulties. Pietro himself is convinced that he {{will participate in the}} world's grand competition and it {{is just a matter of}} time.|$|R
