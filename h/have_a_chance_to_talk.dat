60|$|Among {{other cases}} {{of young men}} from our own city of Brooklyn I have {{encountered}} and have {{had much to do}} with in hospital here, is John Lowery, wounded, and arm amputated, at Fredericksburg. I saw this young fellow down there last December, immediately after the battle, lying on a blanket on the ground, the stump of his arm bandaged, but he not a bit disheartened. He was soon afterward sent up from the front by way of Aquia creek, and has for the past three months been in the Campbell hospital here, in Ward 6, on the gain slowly but steadily. He thinks a great deal of his physician here, Dr. Frank Hinkle, and as some fifty other soldiers in the ward do the same, and bear testimony in their hearty gratitude, and medical and surgical imprisonment, to the quality of Dr. H., I think he deserves honorable mention in this letter to the people of our city--especially as another Brooklyn soldier in Ward 6, Amos H. Vliet, expresses the same feeling of obligation to the doctor for his faithfulness and kindness. Vliet and Lowery both belong to that old war regiment whose flag has flaunted through more than a score of hot-contested battles, the Fifty-first New York, Colonel Potter; and it is to be remembered that no small portion of the fame of this old veteran regiment may be claimed near home, for many of her officers and men are from Brooklyn. The friends of these two young soldiers will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to them soon in Brooklyn. I have seen a good deal of Jack Lowery, and I find him, and heard of him on the field, as a brave, soldierly fellow. Amos Vliet, too, made a first-rate soldier. He has had frozen feet pretty bad, but now better. Occasionally I meet some of the Brooklyn Fourteenth. In Ward E of Armory hospital I found a member of Company C of that regiment, Isaac Snyder; he is now acting as nurse there, and makes a very good one. Charles Dean, of Co. H of the same regiment, is in Ward A of Armory, acting as ward-master. I also got very well acquainted with a young man of the Brooklyn Fourteenth who lay sick some time in Ward F; he has lately got his discharge and gone home. I have met with others in the H-street and Patent-office hospitals. Colonel Fowler, of the Fourteenth, is in charge, I believe, of the convalescent camp at Alexandria. Lieutenant-Colonel Debevoise is in Brooklyn, in poor health, I am sorry to say. Thus the Brooklyn invalids are scattered around.|$|E

Toinette warns Angelique that her {{stepmother}} is plotting {{to get her}} inheritance, but Angelique does not care, so long as she is allowed to marry as she wishes. She begs Toinette to help her foil her stepmother and father's plans, a proposition to which Toinette is only too delighted to agree. She also endeavors {{to find a way}} to tell Cl√©ante of the intended marriage.|$|E

An ANHRI representative said that Hegazy still plans to appeal the ruling or possibly open a new case. Katarina also plans to file a petition for her right to change her religion to Christianity.|$|E

Furthermore, he tells her that Giasone is {{planning}} to quest for the Golden Fleece and that his ship might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him when his ship passes by.

Kevin faced Pamu's boyfriend in {{a basketball game}} so the visitor could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with her. Pamu was made to watch the two men square off, but skipped the second half. Even if the boyfriend won on a 23-14 score, Kevin acknowledged their relationship to him. Pamu and her boyfriend were {{able to have a}} serious conversation after she was advised of distancing from Kevin if she avoided the talk. The two eventually break up. Meanwhile, the show stopped the voting for the current eviction round while the public were asked to vote on Paco's fate as a House Player. The results denoted that Paco should stay.|$|E

When he saw the boy start to run directly into the line of fire, Web managed to yell at him to stop and slithered himself over to the boy. He gives the boy his hat and a note, warning of the ambush, for the boy to deliver to the reserve unit that TOC is sending in.

50|$|In {{the morning}} of Day 15, Big Brother welcomed Gi, Fe and Teresa, the mothers of Manolo, Joshua and Vickie respectively. They were tasked first to clean the rooms of the housemates.

When these tasks succeed, Manolo, Joshua, and Vickie will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with their mothers and 50 percent of their weekly budget shall be given to them. In the evening, Big Brother {{informed}} Loisa {{that she will be}} helping Joshua's mother, who does not know how to cook, in cooking Joshua's breakfast. The following evening, Maris and Loisa were tasked by Big Brother to bring Joshua in the picnic area without being noticed by the other housemates. Unknown to Joshua, his mother was hiding behind the camera mirrors of the picnic area. At the picnic area, Big Brother asked Joshua to dance Pandango sa Ilaw. After his dance, he met his mother. Meanwhile, Manolo's and Vickie's mothers were tasked to cook the housemates' dinner for the following evening while the housemates are shooting for their webisodes in the picnic area. Chevin instructed Maris to tell the other housemates {{that he was in the}} confession room and that they are not allowed to leave the picnic area without Big Brother's instruction. Later that evening, a series of pranks was made by the boys and the girls to each other until the following day, which led to some confrontations. The next day, Big Brother talked to all the housemates in the confession room and reminded them of the law in the rulebook about cleanliness. He also told them that the teen housemates should not be following the older housemates and that all forms of jokes should have limitations.|$|E
