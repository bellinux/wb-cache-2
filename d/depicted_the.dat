5|$|Although at {{an unusual}} latitude, the storm {{maintained}} this intensity {{for over a}} day before weakening to a tropical storm. During the afternoon of August13, the small system re-intensified into a hurricane. Reconnaissance reported that gale-force winds extended no more than 100mi (155km) from the storm's eye. Shortly thereafter, the system further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, attaining maximum winds of 105mph (160km/h). Weather maps at the time <b>depicted</b> <b>the</b> storm as having a minimum pressure of 987mbar (hPa). By August14, the storm began to weaken once more, gradually becoming a tropical storm on August15. After tunrning northward, the cyclone became extratropical at a high latitude of 39.8°N.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{model for}} the iconography of Saint Jovan Vladimir is an engraving in the 1690 edition of the Greek akolouthia. It is a work by Venetian engraver Isabella Piccini. She <b>depicted</b> <b>the</b> saint with a mustache and short beard, wearing a cloak and a crown inscribed with lilies, holding a cross in his right hand, and his severed head in his left hand. A portable icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, dated around 1700, shows the saint mounted on horseback.|$|E
5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) <b>depicted</b> <b>the</b> witches variously, as have many {{directors}} since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to different cultures, as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety.

In 1795, Loutherbourg <b>depicted</b> <b>the</b> rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E

5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand <b>depicted</b> <b>the</b> {{massacre}} in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer narrative that greatly embellished {{the history of}} the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America.

5|$|Gerðr has {{inspired}} {{works of art}} and literature. The Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger wrote a series of poems referencing Gerðr as collected in (1819) Nordens Guder.
