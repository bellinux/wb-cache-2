As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> are primarily popular in the domestic market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E

25|$|Certain <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> and {{practices}} {{have been described}} as rent-seeking by critics. That is, some <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E
25|$|Many {{insurance}} {{executives are}} opposed to patenting <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> because it creates a new risk for them.

Two type of insurances are available: (1) claim-based insurances, and (2) index-based insurances. In particular in poor countries facing food security problems, index-based insurances offer some interesting advantages: 1) indices can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured; (2) these indices can be delivered at low cost; and (3) the <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurances.|$|E

25|$|Much {{consolidation}} {{occurred in}} the financial services industry since, {{but not at the}} scale some had expected. Retail banks, for example, do not tend to buy insurance underwriters, as they seek to engage in a more profitable business of insurance brokerage by selling products of other insurance companies. Other retail banks were slow to market investments and <b>insurance</b> <b>products</b> and package those products in a convincing way. Brokerage companies had a hard time getting into banking, because {{they do not have a}} large branch and backshop footprint. Banks have recently tended to buy other banks, such as the 2004 Bank of America and Fleet Boston merger, yet they have had less success integrating with investment and insurance companies. Many banks have expanded into investment banking, but have found it hard to package it with their banking services, without resorting to questionable tie-ins which caused scandals at Smith Barney.|$|E

The purpose {{of this research was}} to analyze life insurance purchase intention of college students using  the application of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This research used cross sectional design and involved  250 college students who attended Personal Financial Management Course. Characteristics of college students  were measured among three dimensions that were social demography characteristics, value, and financial knowledge. The results indicated that the most of students had high self-respect value score but low security  value score. The level of financial knowledge, both subjective and objective measurement of knowledge, attitude  toward life <b>insurance</b> <b>product,</b> subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were considered to be at good  level. Further analysis indicates that life insurance purchase intention was significantly correlated with attitudes  toward life <b>insurance</b> <b>product</b> (r= 0, 634; p< 0, 01), subjective norm (r= 0, 470; p< 0, 01), and perceived behavioral  control (r= 0, 508; p< 0, 01).
