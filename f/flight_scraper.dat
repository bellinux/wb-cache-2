50|$|Typically in {{operation}} of API separators the oil layer, which may contain en-trained water and attached suspended solids, is continually skimmed off. This removed oily layer may be re-processing to recover valuable products, or disposed of.

40|$|A trough chain {{conveyor}} has a trough (3) {{consisting of a}} base (16) and side walls (17, 18) and a conveyor chain (15) moving in said trough provided with <b>scraper</b> <b>flights</b> (29, 30). To increase the conveying capacity of such trough {{chain conveyor}}s, {{it is intended to}} extend the cross-section of the trough (3) continuously upward so it can have a trapezoidal shape. At least the outer contour of the <b>scraper</b> <b>flights</b> (29, 30) are partially adapted to the base (16) and the side walls (17, 18) of the trough (3). If an intermediate base (4) is present, the inner contour of the <b>scraper</b> <b>flights</b> (29, 30) and the cross-section of the intermediate base (4) are adapted to each other...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of resuspension {{has been considered}} to be an important factor in the imperfect behavior of sedimentation basins receiving suspensions containing flocculent solids. Resuspension is the entrainment into the flow of particles that have once settled {{to the floor of the}} basin. This investigation has been undertaken to study the resuspension phenomenon and to find ways in which its harmful effects can be reduced. Resuspension has been found extremely difficult to isolate and define scientifically because many other factors produce the same overall effect upon the settling tank. Furthermore it is practically necessary to identify individual particles in order to know whether a particular one found in suspension in the downstream portion of a settling tank had earlier been settled out and resting on the floor. Laboratory studies on settling tank behavior were conducted on a glass-walled "scour flume" 1. 27 ft wide by 14 ft long with depth adjustable from 0. 5 to 2. 0 ft (see Fig. 1. 1). In order to simulate certain aspects of the behavior of full-scale settling tanks the laboratory flume was fitted with moving <b>flight</b> <b>scrapers</b> similar to those installed in primary sewage settling tanks. For some of the later tests the flume was fitted with 14 probes that made it possible to sample the tank contents at practically any point of five cross sections along the length of the flume. Most of the studies on the laboratory flume utilized a discrete suspension of gilsonite s. g. 1. 04) particles or a flocculent suspension of ferric chloride and bentonite clay particles. Tests for critical velocity required for entrainment of particles from a smooth bed showed that fine light particles are more easily lifted from the bed than was previously supposed. With scrapers moving upstream, the critical velocity for two sizes of gilsonite tested was found to vary between 10. 5 and 14. 5 times the particle settling velocity. Field and laboratory studies on one scheme proposed to improve the performance of settling tanks - a series of transverse sloping baffles installed throughout the main body of a rectangular settling tank - both indicate that baffling a tank is not the answer. Tests on full-scale settling tanks of a sewage treatment plant showed that conventional measures of settling tank performance are meaningless when the suspension entering the tank is flocculent (as is sewage). Newer measures of performance are proposed, which show promise in evaluating the behavior of settling tanks receiving flocculent suspensions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Oak Ridge National Laboratory Neutron Sciences Directorate has {{installed}} a neutron imaging beamline at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) cold guide hall. CG- 1 D {{is one of}} the three instruments that make up the CG 1 instrument suite. The beamline optics and detector have recently been upgraded {{to meet the needs of}} the neutron imaging community (better “smoothing” of guide system artifacts, higher flux or spatial resolution). These upgrades comprise a new diffuser/aperture system, two new detectors, a He-filled flight tube and silicon (Si) windows. Shielding inside the <b>flight</b> tube, beam <b>scrapers</b> and a beam stop ensure that biological dose is less than 50 μSv/hr outside of the radiation boundary. A set of diffusers and apertures (pinhole geometry) has been installed at the exit of the guide system to allow motorized L/D variation. Samples sit on a translation/rotation stage for alignment and tomography purposes. Detectors for the CG- 1 D beamline are (1) an ANDOR DW 936 charge coupled device (CCD) camera with a field of view of approximately 7 cm x 7 cm and ∼ 80 microns spatial resolution and 1 frame per second time resolution, (2) a new Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) detector with a 2. 8 cm x 2. 8 cm field of view and 55 microns spatial resolution, and 5 μs timing capability. 6 LiF/ZnS scintillators of thickness varying from 50 to 200 microns are being used at this facility. An overview of the beamline upgrade and preliminary data is presented here...|$|R
