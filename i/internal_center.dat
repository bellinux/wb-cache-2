50|$|If the two circles are {{identical}} (same center, same radius), the <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> is their common center, {{but there is}} no well-defined external center - properly, the function from the parameter space of two circles in the plane to the external center has a non-removable discontinuity on the locus of identical circles. In the limit of two circles with the same radius but distinct centers moving to having the same center, the external center is the point at infinity corresponding to the slope of the line of centers, which can be anything, so no limit exists for all possible pairs of such circles.|$|E

The basic body shape of the ES-137 is very close to Gibson's fully hollow-bodied ES-175. Despite the 137 being somewhat thinner than the ES-175, it is not classed as a thinline model. However, the ES-137 does sport an <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> block inside the body similar to the Gibson ES-335. This design helps combat feedback problems common with hollow-bodied guitars.

50|$|For two circles, {{there are}} {{generally}} four distinct lines that are tangent to both (bitangent) - {{if the two}} circles are outside each other - but in degenerate cases there may be any number between zero and four bitangent lines; these are addressed below. For two of these, the external tangent lines, the circles fall {{on the same side}} of the line; for the two others, the internal tangent lines, the circles fall on opposite sides of the line. The external tangent lines intersect in the external homothetic center, whereas the internal tangent lines intersect at the internal homothetic center. Both the external and internal homothetic centers lie on the line of centers (the line connecting the centers of the two circles), closer to the center of the smaller circle: the <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> is in the segment between the two circles, while the external center is not between the points, but rather outside, on the side of the center of the smaller circle. If the two circles have equal radius, there are still four bitangents, but the external tangent lines are parallel and there is no external center in the affine plane; in the projective plane, the external homothetic center lies at the point at infinity corresponding to the slope of these lines.|$|E
50|$|In 1917 the Scout Brigade {{was created}} and in 1921 the St. Aloysius sports {{facility}} (that in 1950 {{would become the}} St. Aloysius Center). In 1922 the school {{moved to a new}} building built by the architect Cousiño Calavera in Baquedano, though its façade would take three more years to complete. In 1923 Carlos Walker Martínez Literary Academy was founded in the school and published five issues of its magazine Juventud. In 1933 Osvaldo Gómez initiated the Andrés Bello Center of Studies, and the following year Fr. M. Moya founded the Abdón Cifuentes Literary Academy. Juventud was replaced by the Revista del Colegio San Luis, which later became the school Yearbook. Over time, other school activities began, such as painting and philosophy (1941) and several sports. In those years, the enrollment reached a peak of 572 students. The library had 300 books.In 1935 Fr. Blümel asked the new Archbishop Alfredo Cifuentes Gómez to look for a teaching congregation to take charge of the school. The Society of Jesus accepted and the first teachers arrived the same year. In 1936 they took charge of the College. Blümel, who also organized the German School for Ladies, the future Instituto San María, retired in 1936 and died in Antofagasta on 29 October 1940. He was replaced by Fr. Nicanor Marambio, S.J., who had been a rector for the last ten years. This Jesuit's educational activities were not limited to St. Aloysius, as he also founded the J. F. Blümel High School for poor children with educational problems. In 1988 the municipality of Antofagasta gave the name of Fr. Nicanor Marambio to a complex located in the Bonilla settlement, in the northern sector of the city. The school's anthem, Todos unidos, was composed in 1949 by two Jesuits: Carlos Hurtado wrote the lyrics and Rafael Sánchez wrote the music.By the middle of last century, the enrollment grew significantly due to the school's success in the baccalaureate exams. In addition, with the presence of the Jesuits, there was a strong increase in pastoral activities, characteristic of their Ignatian spirit. In addition to scouts, reorganized in 1943 by Fr. Marambio, the Eucharistic Crusade of the school (began in 1936 under Fr. Felix Barandera and in 1941 transformed into the Youth Eucharistic Movement), became the Missionary Student League. There were also the <b>Internal</b> <b>Center</b> of Catholic Action of San Luis, formed in 1942 by Fr. Oscar Ghana and two years later integrated with the Missionary League, and the San Luis Gonzaga Vocation League, created in 1943 by Fr. Victor Ghana, with a chief focus on prayer for religious and priestly vocations. Part of the Vocation League's work was the St. Ignatius Workshop which provided liturgical supplies to the poor churches and chapels of the diocese. The work Los Mil Amigos was founded in 1951 by Fr. Mario Vergara to help needy students in other colleges. A new library was built in 1948 and in 1951 a radio station was acquired.|$|E

The problem is decomposed into two auxiliary problems. When the center of dilatation approaches the crack tip, two kinds of singularity are analytically obtained. If the overburden stress and the friction on crack surface are neglected, both modes I and II stress intensity factors (KI and KII) are induced at the crack tips. The maximum of KI and KII occurs when the center of dilatation is located {{in front of the}} crack tips. The tensile cracking is likely to be prohibited by the overburden stress, while shear cracking remains possible even including the effects of both overburden and friction on the crack surface.

40|$|In the Wigner-covariant rest-frame instant form of {{dynamics}} it {{is possible}} to develop a relativistic kinematics for the N-body problem. The Wigner hyperplanes define the intrinsic rest frame and realize the separation of the center-of-mass. Three notions of external relativistic center of mass can be defined only in terms of the external Poincaré group realization. Inside the Wigner hyperplane, an internal unfaithful realization of the Poincaré group is defined. The three concepts of <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> of mass weakly coincide and are eliminated by the rest-frame conditions. An adapted canonical basis of relative variables is found. The invariant mass is the Hamiltonian for the relative motions. In this framework we can introduce the same dynamical body frames, orientation-shape variables, spin frame and canonical spin bases for the rotational kinematics developed for the non-relativistic N-body problem.

40|$|This article proposes {{the thesis}} that Edith Stein’s late {{anthropology}} has a theocentric orientation. The threefold structure {{of a human being}} consisting of a body, soul and spirit is examined in order to validate the thesis. First of all, the finitude of a human being points out to the eternal being and – consequently – human beings are not conceivable by themselves, without the context of God. Moreover, the hylomorphic union of the body and soul adopted from Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy is enriched in Stein’s anthropology by the concept of spirit. This results in a threefold structure and is reason enough to suggest man’s iconic similarity to the Trinity. Furthermore, Stein takes over St. Teresa of Avila’s concept of an <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> of the soul, which can be a meeting point between a person and God. The analysis of the soul’s center supports the main thesis 1...|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Fracture & Strength of Solids : Pohang, Korea, August 16 - 18, 2000 This paper {{summarizes}} the recent results obtained by Chau and Wong [1] on {{the interaction of}} a two-dimensional crack parallel to the free surface of a half-plane subject to the action of an <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> of dilatation. The method of solution follows the principle of superposition. The problem is first decomposed into two auxiliary problems: (I) a half-plane containing a center of dilatation; and (II) a finite crack in half-plane subjected to traction that cancel those induced by the Auxiliary Problem I. The final solution is obtained as the summation of those of the two Auxiliary Problems. Numerical results suggest {{that as long as}} the crack is not too close to the free surface of the half-plane, the present solution is accurate enough for practical applications. If the overburden stress due to gravity and the friction on crack surface are neglected, both mode I and II stress intensity factors are induced at the crack tips.

The transformers, which were made of hard piezoelectric materials wit`h high mechanical quality factor, Qm, were poled only along the thickness direction.

The electrical properties in terms of voltage step-up ratio, output power, efficiency, and temperature rise were measured under various load resistances. The voltage step-up ratio increased proportionally with load resistance. With the optimum resistive load, RL = 1 /ωCd 2, the efficiency showed a maximum value of more than 90 % and the voltage step-up ratio was 2.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new methodology {{for the analysis}} and control of <b>internal</b> forces and <b>center</b> of mass behavior produced during multi-contact interactions between humanoid robots and the environment. The approach leverages the virtual linkage model which provides a physical representation of the <b>internal</b> and <b>center</b> of mass resultant forces with respect to reaction forces on the supporting surfaces. A grasp/contact matrix describing the complex interactions between contact forces and center of mass behavior is developed. Based on this model, a new torque-based approach for the control of internal forces is suggested and illustrated on the Asimo humanoid robot. The new controller is integrated into the framework for whole-body prioritized multitasking enabling the unified control of center of mass maneuvers, operational tasks, and internal force behavior. The grasp/contact matrix is also proposed to analyze and plan <b>internal</b> force and <b>center</b> of mass control policies that comply with frictional properties of the links in contact.

40|$|Astronomers know {{since the}} 1930 s that the {{universe}} contains more than what meets the eye. Galaxies within clusters of galaxies and stars within galaxies are moving around faster than {{the gravity of the}} visible matter would imply, indicating that a huge amount of invisible matter is pulling on them. The theory of Relation asserts that there are two structures going in opposite directions, the expansion and the condensation, and also, by means of the principle of Compensation (CP), that the loss of negative energy of the expanding electromagnetic (EM) wavelength of flat spacetime is transformed into positive matter and gravific spacetime. The universal expansion decelerates, unlike the current single thought, and is counterbalanced by a continual growing global mass; a perpetual creation of ordinary and dark matter within an incessant big bang process. The global deceleration {{takes the form of a}} local acceleration of every galaxy towards the <b>internal</b> <b>center,</b> a change of direction from the periphery to the center.

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanics}} of interface delamination in CFRP composite laminates is examined using finite element method. For this purpose a 12 -ply CFRP composite, {{with a total}} thickness of 2. 4 mm and anti-symmetric ply sequence of [45 /- 45 / 45 / 0 /- 45 / 0 / 0 / 45 / 0 /- 45 / 45 /- 45] is simulated under three-point bend test setup. Each unidirectional composite lamina is treated as an equivalent elastic and orthotropic panel. Interface behavior is defined using damage, linear elastic constitutive model and employed to describe the initiation and progression of delamination during flexural loading. Complementary three-point bend test on CFRP composite specimen is performed at crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. The measured load-deflection response at mid-span location compares well with predicted values. Interface delamination accounts for up to 46. 7 % reduction in flexural stiffness from the undamaged state. Delamination initiated at the center mid-span region for interfaces in the compressive laminates while edge delamination started in interfaces with tensile flexural stress in the laminates. Anti-symmetric distribution of the delaminated region {{is derived from the}} corresponding anti-symmetric ply sequence in the CFRP composite. The dissipation energy for edge delamination is greater than that for <b>internal</b> <b>center</b> delamination. In addition, delamination failure process in CFRP composite can be described by an exponential rate of fracture energy dissipation under monotonic three-point bend loading...|$|E
