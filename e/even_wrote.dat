5|$|During {{the earlier}} Northern and Southern dynasties (420–589), {{and perhaps even}} earlier, the {{drinking}} of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790–835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) <b>even</b> <b>wrote</b> a treatise {{on the art of}} drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. Indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the Tang era.|$|E

5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He <b>even</b> <b>wrote</b> to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead.|$|E
