50|$|The {{basis for}} the {{development}} of the BNC connector was largely the work of Octavio M. Salati, a graduate of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering of the University of Pennsylvania.

40|$|If {{you study}} {{transmission}} lines in college {{or from the}} ARRL Handbook, you will learn the classic equation for characteristic impedance. ZO = [L/C) ] 1 / 2 What {{most of us have}} long forgotten (and that few universities teach) is that this is the simplified form of the equation. In engineering classes, we make equations simpler by assuming certain conditions will be true for what we think will be the conditions when we use them. That’s fine as long as we don’t forget those assumption, but in this case, most of us have. The full equation for characteristic impedance is ZO = [(R+j 2 πfL) / (G+j 2 πfC) ] 1 / 2 At high frequencies (that is, f is large), (2 πfL) is much larger than R, and (2 πfC) is much larger than G. So at high frequencies, the equation becomes simply ZO = [j 2 πfL) / j 2 πfC) ] 1 / 2 and further simplifies to ZO = [L/C) ] 1 / 2 which is the familiar equation. But what if f is not large? Fig 1 shows the impedance of a typical coaxial cable at audio frequencies using the full equation. Why the wide variation? Because at low frequencies, R is much greater than 2 πfL, and 2 πfC is much greater than G. Thus, at low audio frequencies, the equation simplifies to ZO = [R/j 2 πfC] 1 / 2. Within the audio spectrum and for a decade or so above it, R in this equation is simply the DC resistance of the cable(per the same unit length as the L and C parameters). This causes the impedance to be quite high and predominantly capacitive near zero frequency. As frequency increases, L becomes significant, and ZO transitions to the familiar 50 - 100 ohm impedances at high frequencies. And the transition occurs {{right in the middle of}} the audio spectrum! Through the transition region, the "j " term causes ZO to be a combination of resistance and capacitance. [Although the data presented here is <b>for</b> <b>coaxial</b> <b>cables,</b> virtually all commonly used cables, including twisted pairs, exhibit these characteristics!] Above the audio spectrum, R begins to increase with skin effect as the square root of frequency, causing attenuation to increase...|$|E

25|$|<b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> are {{commonly}} used at audio frequencies and above <b>for</b> convenience. A <b>coaxial</b> <b>cable</b> has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing {{on the surface of}} the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5GHz, the losses (due mainly to the electrical resistance of the central conductor) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium <b>for</b> transmitting energy. <b>Coaxial</b> <b>cables</b> with an air rather than solid dielectric are preferred as they transmit power with lower loss.|$|R
