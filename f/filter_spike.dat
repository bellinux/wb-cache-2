This paper presents a system that exploits the sparse nature of neural signals to address these challenges and provides a reconfigurable low-bandwidth event-driven output. Specifically, we present a novel 64 -channel low noise (2. 1 μVrms, low power (23 μW per analogue channel) neural recording system-on-chip (SoC). This features individually-configurable channels, 10 -bit analogue-to-digital conversion, digital <b>filtering,</b> <b>spike</b> detection, and an event-driven output. Each channel's gain, bandwidth & sampling rate settings can be independently configured to extract Local Field Potentials (LFPs) at a low data-rate and/or Action Potentials (APs) at a higher data rate. The sampled data is streamed through an SRAM buffer that supports additional on-chip processing such as digital <b>filtering</b> and <b>spike</b> detection.

We provide equations describing the optimal value of σ using an error minimization criterion and examine how the optimal σ varies within a parameter space defining the statistics of inhomogeneous Poisson spike trains. The process was studied both analytically and through simulations. The rate functions λ(t) were randomly generated, with the three parameters defining spike statistics being the mean of λ(t), the variance of λ(t), and the exponent α of the Fourier amplitude spectrum 1 /f α of λ(t).
