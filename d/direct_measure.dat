25|$|Event-related {{optical signal}} (EROS) is a brain-scanning {{technique}} which uses infrared light through optical fibers to measure changes in optical properties of active {{areas of the}} cerebral cortex. Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOT) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of haemoglobin, and thus are based on blood flow, EROS {{takes advantage of the}} scattering properties of the neurons themselves, and thus provides a much more <b>direct</b> <b>measure</b> of cellular activity. EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters (spatially) and within milliseconds (temporally). Its biggest downside is the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep. EROS is a new, relatively inexpensive technique that is non-invasive to the test subject. It was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where it is now used in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory of Dr. Gabriele Gratton and Dr. Monica Fabiani.|$|E
40|$|The Atkinson Report {{examined}} {{measurement of}} public services' output and productivity. Traditionally, only inputs {{to the government}} sector were reflected in the National Accounts. This treatment imposed zero productivity growth for the government sector. From the late 1990 s, the United Kingdom — {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of international standards — had started to introduce <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of government output. Rather than count the number of teachers, a measure of the education sector's output would include pupil attendance in schools, for example. Introducing these measures of government output had cast light on what the government sector produces and its productivity in doing so. Sir Tony Atkinson reviewed these methods and recommended improvements. The objectives of introducing <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of government output and the principles he advocated in undertaking this task are summarized in this review. As well as ensuring {{an important part of the}} economy is reflected in the National Accounts, introducing <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of government output into the National Accounts would allow policymakers to make more informed judgments and give greater information on the overall performance of government services.

40|$|Background: Childhood {{overweight}} and obesity remains high, contributing to cardiometabolic risk factors at younger ages. It is unclear which measures of adiposity {{serve as the}} best proxies for identifying children at metabolic risk. This study assessed whether DXA-derived <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of adiposity are more strongly related to cardiometabolic risk factors in children than indirect measures. Methods: Anthropometric and DXA measures of adiposity and a comprehensive assessment of cardiometabolic risk factors were obtained in 288, 9 - 12 year old girls, most being of Hispanic ethnicity. Multiple regression models for each metabolic parameter were run against each adiposity measure while controlling for maturation and ethnicity. In addition, regression models including both indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> were developed to assess whether using <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of adiposity could provide a better prediction of the cardiometabolic risk factors beyond that of using indirect measures alone. Results: Measures of adiposity were significantly correlated with cardiometabolic risk factors (p < 0. 05) except fasting glucose. After adjusting for maturation and ethnicity, indirect measures of adiposity accounted for 29 - 34 % in HOMA-IR, 10 - 13 % in TG, 14 - 17 % in HDL-C, and 5 - 8 % in LDL-C while <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> accounted for 29 - 34 % in HOMA-IR, 10 - 12 % in TG, 13 - 16 % in HDL-C, and 5 - 6 % in LDL-C. The addition of <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of adiposity to indirect measures added significantly to the variance explained for HOMA-IR (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: Anthropometric measures may perform {{as well as the}} more precise <b>direct</b> DXA-derived <b>measures</b> of adiposity for assessing most CVD risk factors in preadolescent girls. The use of DXA-derived adiposity measures together with indirect measures may be advantageous for predicting insulin resistance risk...|$|R

25|$|This {{language}} revival had {{exposed the}} Tamils to {{the richness of}} their literature and more than two thousand years of history. It was seen by Tamils that Hindi, an undeveloped language, was being imposed on them. This renaissance, coupled with the new-found awareness of its uniqueness {{when compared to the}} Northern Indian languages, led to suspicion of anything that was Northern. Anti-Brahminism sentiments that had arisen further complicated the antipathy to the North, since it was seen by leaders like Periyar as an import from the North. Periyar and his DK, as did the DK’s predecessor Justice Party, saw the British Raj as the only alternative to Brahmin dominance. The resultant Tamil nationalism had until then not been expressed as violence. Both under the British and in independent India the Tamils have had a somewhat privileged position, since they were much sought after as labour, partly because the standard of education and knowledge of English have been to some extent higher than elsewhere in India; consequently Tamils have secured a large share of appointments in government service and education. Perhaps because of this, Tamil linguistic feelings had never turned against English. As Tamils saw English not as a threat, but a tool for advancement and protection of their interest, replacing English with Hindi, even as a suggestion, provoked violently adverse reactions, in particular, amongst students. Thus the introduction of Hindi as a national language was seen as <b>direct</b> <b>measure</b> of the North to dominate the South culturally, economically, and politically. For them the use of English as an official language meant social equality where a Northerner and a Southerner start at a same point in English.|$|E

2500|$|While some rankings {{attempt to}} measure {{teaching}} using metrics such as staff to student ratio, the Higher Education Policy Institute {{has pointed out}} that the metrics used are more closely related to research than teaching quality, e.g. [...] "Staff to student ratios are an almost <b>direct</b> <b>measure</b> of research activity", and [...] "The proportion of PhD students is also to a large extent an indication of research activity". Inside Higher Ed similarly states [...] "these criteria do not actually measure teaching, and none even come close to assessing quality of impact". Many rankings are also considered to contain biases towards the natural sciences and, due to the bibilometric sources used, towards publication in English-language journals. Some rankings, including ARWU, also fail to make any correction for the sizes of institutions, so a large institution is ranked considerably higher than a small institution with the same quality of research. Other compilers, such as Scimago and U.S. News and World Report, use a mix of size-dependent and size-independent metrics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{physiological}} and cognitive {{changes that occur}} with aging, accurate physical activity (PA) measurement in older adults represents a unique challenge. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to systematically review measures of PA and their use and appropriateness with older adults. A secondary aim was to determine the level of agreement between PA measures in older adults. Methods Literature was identified through electronic databases. Studies were eligible if they examined the correlation and/or agreement between at least 2 measures, either indirect and/or direct, of PA in older adults (> 65 years of age). Results Thirty-six studies met eligibility criteria. The indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> of PA across the studies differed widely in their ability to address the key dimensions (i. e., frequency, intensity, time, type) of PA in older adults. The average correlation between indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> was moderate (r= 0. 38). The correlation between indirect and other indirect measures (r= 0. 29) was weak, while correlations between <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> with other <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> were high (real world: r= 0. 84; controlled settings: r= 0. 92). Agreement was strongest between <b>direct</b> PA <b>measures</b> with other <b>direct</b> <b>measures</b> in both real world and laboratory settings. While a clear trend regarding the agreement for mean differences between other PA <b>measures</b> (i. e., <b>direct</b> with indirect, indirect with indirect) did not emerge, there were only a limited number of studies that reported comparable units. Conclusions Despite the lack of a clear trend regarding the agreement between PA measures in older adults, the findings underscore the importance of valid, accurate and reliable measurement. To advance this field, researchers will need to approach the assessment of PA in older adults in a more standardized way (i. e., consistent reporting of results, consensus over cut-points and epoch lengths, using appropriate validation tools). Until then researchers should be cautious when choosing measures for PA that are appropriate for their research questions and when comparing PA levels across various studies. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Objective {{measures}} directly assess SA {{by comparing}} an individual's {{perceptions of the}} situation or environment to some [...] "ground truth" [...] reality. Specifically, objective measures collect data from the individual {{on his or her}} perceptions of the situation and compare them to what is actually happening to score the accuracy of their SA at a given moment in time.

Objective measures can be gathered in one of three ways: real-time as the task is completed (e.g., [...] "real-time probes" [...] presented as open questions embedded as verbal communications during the task – Jones & Endsley, 2000), during an interruption in task performance (e.g., situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT) – Endsley, 1995a, or the WOMBAT situational awareness and stress tolerance test mostly used in aviation since the late 1980s and often called HUPEX in Europe), or post-test following completion of the task.|$|E

When one considers that this prodigious series of beautiful designs supplied the place of our common room-papers,--the wealth of poetic imagery among the Ancients, and the corresponding traditional variety and elegance of pictorial treatment, seem equally remarkable.
