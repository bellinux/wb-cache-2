50|$|The pan-tilt {{head has}} {{separate}} axes and controls for tilting and panning, {{so that a}} certain axis can be controlled without risk of affecting the other axes. These heads come in two types, 2-way and 3-way. 2-way heads have 2 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, and one for <b>front</b> <b>tilt.</b> 3-way heads have 3 axes and controls, one for panoramic rotation, <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> and lateral tilt. The controls on these heads are usually handles that can be turned, to loosen or tighten the certain axis. This allows movement in one, a few, or none of the axes. When the movement of all axes of rotation is needed, a ball head is used. There are some pan-tilt heads that use gears, for precision control of each axis. This is helpful for some types of photography, such as macro photography.|$|E
50|$|Assuming lens axis <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> {{here are}} the trade offs in {{choosing}} between a small degree of tilt (say less than 3) and a larger tilt: A small tilt causes a wider or fatter wedge but one that is far off axis from the cone of light seen by the lens. Conversely, a large tilt (say 10 degrees) makes the wedge more aligned with the lens view, but with a narrower wedge. Thus, a modest tilt is often, or even usually, the best starting point.Small and medium format cameras have fixed bodies that do not allow for misalignment of the film and lens planes, intentionally or not. Tilt/shift (“TS”) or perspective control (“PC”) lenses that provide limited movements for these cameras can be purchased {{from a number of}} lens makers. High-quality TS or PC lenses are expensive. The price of a new Canon TS-E or Nikon PC-E lens is comparable to that of a good used large-format camera, which offers a much greater range of adjustment.|$|E
50|$|Several {{configurations}} are practical. Two {{front wheels}} and one rear, where all three wheels tilt, use the acronym 2F3T (i.e. two <b>front</b> three <b>tilt).</b> Other variations 1F1T, where only the <b>front</b> wheel <b>tilts,</b> an example being the Vandenbrink Carver, {{made in the}} Netherlands.|$|R

Our double-ABCD nonparaxial analysis helps to understand and exploit the mechanisms for intensity localization, pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> and grating formation, and includes initial spectral phase and detuning of the wavelength crossing plane.

40|$|A newly {{designed}} UV spectrometer {{will replace the}} current 351 nm, full aperture backscatter (FABS) spectrometer that {{is used in the}} OMEGA laser system. The FABS spectrometer has a time resolution of 270 ps. The new spectrometer will improve the temporal resolution to 10 ps, while maintaining signal throughput by superimposing 27 separate spectra onto the detector. This is accomplished by placing a 27 -element roof mirror array between two identical diffraction gratings operating at opposite orders. The retro-reflecting property of the roof mirror array breaks the 270 ps pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> into 27 10 ps pulse front tilts. FRED, an optical design program, was used to model the spectrometer. Image rotation, pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> and images from other grating orders were analyzed. It was found that image rotation can be corrected by rotating the input slit. The separation between the roof mirror array and the gratings was chosen to prevent images from other grating orders from reaching the detector. The pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> analysis demonstrates that the spectrometer will achieve the desired 10 ps time resolution...|$|E
40|$|For {{realising}} {{fast and}} highly dynamical laser-based material processing, scanner systems are already utilised for many different industrial applications. Furthermore, ultra-short pulsed (< 1 ps) laser sources provide possibilities of processing most different materials with highest accuracy. Owing {{to the large}} spectral bandwidth of ultra-short laser pulses, dispersion in optical components becomes relevant. The dispersion in optical systems for laser scanners may lead to scan angle-depending pulse properties as, for example, pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt.</b> The investigation of these effects is not {{state of the art}} today but absolutely necessary to exploit the full potential of laser scanners for ultra-short pulse applications. By means of an exemplary focusing lens, the simulation and experimental analysis of scan angle-depending pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> is presented for the first time...|$|E

50|$|With {{electrical}} <b>tilting,</b> <b>front</b> {{and back}} lobes tilt in same direction : for example, an electrical downtilt will make both front lobe and back lobe tilt down. This is the property {{used in the}} above example where the signal is pointed down in all directions. On the contrary, mechanical downtilting will make the <b>front</b> lobe <b>tilt</b> down and the back lobe tilt up. In almost all practical cases, antennas are only tilted down - though tilting up is technically possible.|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{we discussed the}} physics of a microbunched electron beam kicked by the dipole field of a corrector magnet by describing the kinematics of coherent undulator radiation after the kick. We demonstrated {{that the effect of}} aberration of light supplies the basis for understanding phenomena like the deflection of coherent undulator radiation by a dipole magnet. We illustrated this fact by examining the operation of an XFEL under the steady state assumption, that is a harmonic time dependence. We argued that in this particular case the microbunch <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> has no objective meaning; in other words, there is no experiment that can discriminate whether an electron beam is endowed with a microbunch <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> of not. In this paper we extend our considerations to time-dependent phenomena related with a finite electron bunch duration, or SASE mode of operation. We focus our attention on the spatiotemporal distortions of an X-ray pulse. Spatiotemporal coupling arises naturally in coherent undulator radiation behind the kick, because the deflection process involves the introduction of a tilt of the bunch profile. This tilt of the bunch profile leads to radiation pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt,</b> which is equivalent to angular dispersion of the output radiation. We remark that our exact results can potentially be useful to developers of new generation XFEL codes for cross-checking their results...|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generally}} applicable velocity matching method for THz-pulse generation by optical rectification {{in the range}} below the phonon frequency of the nonlinear material. Velocity matching is based on pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilting</b> of the ultrashort excitation pulse {{and is able to}} produce a large-area THz beam. Tuning of the THz radiation by changing the tilt angle is experimentally demonstrated for a narrow line in the range between 0. 8 - 0. 97 times the phonon frequency. According to model calculations broad-band THz radiation can be generated at lower frequencies. Advantages of the new velocity matching technique in comparison to the electro-optic Cherenkov effect and non- collinear beam mixing are discussed. (C) 2002 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that simultaneous phase- and group-velocity-matched cascaded parametric processes {{can be achieved}} in two-dimensional quadratic nonlinear photonic crystals by proper matching of noncollinear processes with <b>front</b> <b>tilting</b> of the fundamental pulse. We present examples of cascaded third- and fourthharmonic generation in a poled LiNbO 3 planar structure. © 2006 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 030. 1640, 190. 4420. Frequency conversion of ultrashort optical pulses is important for many applications of optical parametric devices in communications, signal processing, and spectroscopy. It {{is well known that}} the conversion efficiency and phase-matching bandwidth of femtosecond nonlinear optical devices is dramatically limited by the group-velocity mismatch (GVM) between the fundamental- and second-harmonic pulses. Therefore, efficient frequency conversion for ultrashort pulses can be achieved by matching both phase an...|$|R

40|$|Ultrafast-laser {{materials}} processing, including {{modification of}} transparent matter, {{has become an}} attractive and rapidly developing area of research with applications from integrated optics to laser surgery. Interaction of femtosecond light pulses with matter is not yet fully understood {{and can lead to}} unexpected findings. For instance, formation of self-assembled nanogratings was observed inside fused silica glass when irradiated with ultrafast-laser. This type of modification enables controlling anisotropic structures inside isotropic glass medium and can be applied for polarization control devices. Another intriguing effect is quill like behaviour of femtosecond laser beam with tilted intensity front. The effect manifests as the difference in material modification when moving a sample from left to right and vice versa. Recently, it was demonstrated that pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> can be responsible not only for directional dependence but also for anisotropic photosensitivity of isotropic medium. It was shown that pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> {{can be used as a}} new tool for laser processing and optical manipulation. In the nearest future we will seek for the applications of the observed effects in biology and quantum optics...|$|E
40|$|Spatiotemporal focusing, or {{simultaneous}} {{spatial and}} temporal focusing (SSTF) of ultrashort pulses, has drawn more and more attention because of its various applications in microscopy, photoactivation for biological studies, and high precision three-dimensional (3 D) material processing. This conception of focusing relies {{on the fact that}} the axial intensity is highly localized because the pulse duration is not its shortest until all the spectral components are fully overlapped. In this paper, we present the spectral chirps and intensities evolution in SSTF at the focus based on generalized Fresnel diffraction theory. By directly solving the Fresnel diffraction integration equation, the spectral chirps up to 4 th-order are obtained analytically. After that, the intensities evolution at the focus is carried out by numerical simulations as well as mathematical investigations. Especially, the appearance of pulse <b>front</b> <b>tilt</b> (PFT) and intensity plane tilt (IPT) in SSTF are discussed in detail with the help of the given spectral chirps.

As with the TownAce wagon, the MasterAce Surf came equipped with either the medium- or high-roofed body with dual moonroof options for both. Exterior design differences of the MasterAce Surf when compared to the TownAce included larger US-style bumpers and rectangular quad headlamps. In the Japanese market, a wide range of accessories were available, including a refrigerator with ice maker, a seven-speaker audio system, and a color television.

50|$|Tandem rotors are two {{horizontal}} {{main rotor}} assemblies mounted one behind the other. Tandem rotors achieve pitch attitude changes to accelerate and decelerate the helicopter {{through a process}} called cyclic pitch. To pitch forward and accelerate, both rotors increase the pitch at the rear and reduce the pitch at the front (cyclic)keeping torque the same on both rotors, flying sideways is achieved by increasing the pitch {{on one side and}} reducing pitch on the other. Yaw control develops through opposing cyclic pitch in each rotor. To pivot right, the <b>front</b> rotor <b>tilts</b> right and the rear rotor tilts left. To pivot left, the <b>front</b> rotor <b>tilts</b> left and the rear rotor tilts right. All rotor power contributes to lift, and it is simpler to handle changes in the center of gravity fore-aft. However, it requires the expense of two large rotors rather than the more common one large main rotor and a much smaller tail rotor. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is the most common tandem rotor helicopter.|$|R
