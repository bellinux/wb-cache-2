40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of an apparatus for transforming a conventional beam of coherent light, having a Gaussian energy distribution and relatively high divergence, into a beam in which the energy distribution approximates a single, non-zero-order Bessel function and which therefore has much lower divergence. The apparatus comprises a zone plate having transmitting and reflecting zones defined by the pattern of light interference produced by {{the combination of a}} beam of coherent light with a Gaussian energy distribution and one having such a Bessel distribution. The interference pattern between the two beams is a concentric array of multiple annuli, and is preferably recorded as a hologram. The hologram is then used to form the transmitting, and reflecting zones by photo-etching portions of a reflecting layer deposited on a plate made of a transmitting material. A Bessel beam, containing approximately 50 % of the energy of the incident beam, is produced by passing a Gaussian beam through such a Bessel zone plate. The reflected beam, also containing approximately 50 % of the incident beam energy and having a Bessel energy distribution, can be redirected in the same direction and parallel to the transmitted beam. Alternatively, a filter similar to the Bessel zone plate can be placed within the resonator cavity of a conventional laser system having a <b>front</b> <b>mirror</b> and a rear mirror, preferably axially aligned with the mirrors and just inside the <b>front</b> <b>mirror</b> to generate Bessel energy distribution light beams at the laser source...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{involving}} micro- and nanomechanical resonators need to {{be carefully}} designed to reduce mechanical environmental noise. A small scale on-chip approach is to add an additional resonator to {{the system as a}} mechanical low-pass filter. Unfortunately, the inherent low frequency of the low-pass filter causes the system to be easily excited mechanically. Fixating the additional resonator ensures that the resonator itself can not be excited by the environment. This, however, negates the purpose of the low-pass filter. We solve this apparent paradox by applying active feedback to the resonator, thereby minimizing the motion with respect the <b>front</b> <b>mirror</b> of an optomechanical cavity. Not only does this method actively stabilize the cavity length, but it also retains the on-chip vibration isolation. Comment: Minor adjustments mad...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We have {{demonstrated}} a high-performance two-wavelength asymmetric Fabry–Perot modulator (AFPM) by us-ing a novel decoupled cavity design. In this new design, the middle mirror supplies a back-mirror reflectivity for the short-wavelength modulator and, {{at the same}} time, a front-mirror reflectivity for the long-wavelength modulator. The <b>front</b> <b>mirror</b> {{is designed to be}} transparent at the long wavelength and reflective at the short wavelength to eliminate the interference between the two modulators. With this decoupled cavity design, we greatly simplified the matching requirement for the two cavities and obtain much more flexibility in the device design. Experimentally, we {{have demonstrated}} a two-wavelength modulator operated at 860 and 890 nm with operating voltages of 3. 4 and 6. 2 V and reflectivity changes of 62 % and 44 %, respectively.

On the other hand it can be regarded {{as an extension of the}} optical bar scheme. Taking compact-binary inspiral signals as an example, we illustrate how this scheme can be used to improve the sensitivity of the planned Advanced LIGO interferometer, in various scenarios, using a realistic classical-noise budget. We also discuss how this scheme can be implemented in Advanced LIGO with relative ease...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent measurements of Electron efficiency {{which has been}} done with the CLIO Free-electron laser (FEL). The Electron efficiency is the relative energy loss of the electron beam in the undulator during the FEL interaction. It gives an absolute measurement of the optical power produced by the FEL, which is then compared to the direct measurement using a power meter at the exit of the FEL. An analytical expression of the Electron efficiency is given here, and it is compared to the measurements. THE CLIO FREE ELECTRON LASER The CLIO Free Electron Laser (FEL) is an infrared tuneable laser source [1]. It uses a linear accelerator, which produces an electron beam of adjustable energy from 13 MeV to 50 MeV. The laser spectral range is tuneable from 5 µm to about 120 µm. Such a wide broadband is achieved by using, for λ> 100 µm, a special set of toroidal mirrors. Also, {{in order to reduce}} the cavity losses at large wavelength, a waveguide is installed in place of the vacuum chamber in the undulator section. The laser extraction of the cavity is achieved by hole coupling in the <b>front</b> <b>mirror.</b> The best configuration of radius of curvature for the cavity mirrors has been obtained with a numerical code [2] [3]. This code calculates the propagation of the laser wave front A(x,y) in the optical cavity. It uses an iterative process of wave propagation in the cavity, which converges to a steady state laser mode As(x,y) corresponding to the FEL saturation regime. It takes into account the design of the cavity (mirrors, vacuum chamber, 8 ̆ 5) including the waveguide effect in the undulator section, and the hole coupling in the <b>front</b> <b>mirror.</b> This code gives the amplitude distribution As(x,y) of the laser mode at saturation, in any point of the cavity, and it gives all related parameters: the cavity losses L, the extraction rate Tx of hole coupling, the optical mode cross-section Σo...|$|E
