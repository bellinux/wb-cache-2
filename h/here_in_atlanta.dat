50|$|Central Park is a 17.37 acre {{park in the}} Fourth Ward West {{neighborhood}} of the Old Fourth Ward <b>in</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> Georgia. It was known as Bedford-Pine Park prior to 1999.

50|$|Several churches {{located along}} the avenue, such as Big Bethel AME and First Congregational, helped build and {{maintain}} the heritage of the street. The Royal Peacock Club provided an elegant setting where many African Americans could perform and bring the changing styles of black popular music to Atlanta. Originally called the Top Hat Club {{when it opened in}} 1938, the club hosted local talent and national acts such as B.B. King, the Four Tops, the Tams and Atlanta's own Gladys Knight. One of the many significant commercial buildings within the district is the Atlanta Life Insurance Company. The second-largest black insurance company in the United States, Atlanta Life Insurance was founded in 1905 by Alonzo Herndon, a former slave from Walton County, Georgia. The central building of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company complex is a Beaux Arts building facing Auburn Avenue. The district also includes the Rucker Building, Atlanta's first black-owned office building, constructed in 1904 by businessman and politician Henry A. Rucker. For more information about the less well known Henry Allen Rucker, visit The Atlanta History Center Archives and access Terminus, one of the center's databases. (These collections contain data and images of nearly every notable African American <b>in</b> <b>Atlanta</b> and beyond dating from Reconstruction into the late 1970s.) Also located on Auburn Avenue was The Atlanta Daily World, the first black-owned daily newspaper, which was founded <b>here</b> <b>in</b> 1928. (The <b>Atlanta</b> Daily World is still the nation's longest running African American newspaper.) <b>In</b> 1948, the <b>Atlanta</b> Police Department was integrated, hiring eight black police officers, all of whom were assigned to Auburn Avenue.|$|R

40|$|The {{court system}} in the State of Georgia had {{a need for a}} fast and secure {{connection}} to their case management systems with a low barrier to accessibility. The goal was to find an alternative that would provide state wide accessibility and allow the system and all maintenance requirements to be housed <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Atlanta.</b> Cost, ease of implementation, and the mitigation of unknown factors were primary objectives in making a purchase. A decision for the method and means of accessibility had to be made as well as selection of the actual case management system. Considerations: Because the scale of this project extended state-wide, there were a variety of questions that needed to be considered. Both the connection and the case management system itself had to be examined. The deliberations revolved around the scope of the project, technical needs and limitations, education and time frames. o How many courts are involved?

40|$|Despite {{the budget}} {{uncertainties}} that all U. S. government agencies are facing, CDC continues {{to carry out}} its important work. While we are pleased that the President’s proposed budget for FY 2012 increases funding for most programs at the National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), it proposes about a 1 percent reduction to funding for TB elimination. The proposed budget does provide CDC, as well as CDC’s HIV, STD, TB, and viral hepatitis grantees, an option to transfer up to 5 percent of funds between programs to address syndemics among populations with, or at risk for, at least two or more of the above above-mentioned mentioned infections. Funds may also be used by a program to enlist other programs in responding to acute needs. We will provide more information as it becomes available.

I {{could not have}} done it without the support of my colleagues, friends, and family. I want to give a special thanks to my advisor, Dr. Chris Paredis. Chris challenged me to be an independent researcher, but still helped me when I was in need. The gatherings at Chris’s house are some of my fondest memories of my time at Georgia Institute of Technology. I will always admire Chris’s research passion, his competitiveness, and his drive. I’d like to thank my thesis reading committee, Dr. Bert Bras and Dr. Suresh Sitaraman for their valuable feedback with regard to this thesis.

40|$|A Ghanaian proverb in Akan {{language}} says, obi nkyere akwadaa Onyame. This literally means nobody shows a {{child who}} God is. Naturally, the child grows up into this knowledge of God. This growth is spontaneous through informal education embedded within the child 2 ̆ 7 s mother tongue and the culture within {{which he or she}} was born. Our culture is rich with various attributes to God. Such attributes are proverbial and also observed in the names given to people. With the lack of knowledge of the child 2 ̆ 7 s mother tongue, the language and culture that carry these attributes to God, the child is deprived of the knowledge of God. The problem of modernization and easy movement of people {{from one place to another}} in quest of economic, political, educational or religious prosperity or freedom has divorced people from their mother tongues and culture. Thus plunged into foreign cultures and languages, unforeseen social problems leading to frustration and isolation are created. Such problems ostracize people making them strangers to their homelands. Future generations have a total loss of the mother tongue since they only communicate in the foreign language of their residence. My project which is promoting ethnicity and identity among Ewes in Atlanta, Georgia through the study of Ewe language and culture is one way of addressing the above problem facing most immigrants in foreign lands. I started a center of worship and the study of Ewe language and culture <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>Atlanta.</b> The center provides opportunities for learning of the language and culture which are largely used in worship. This type of fellowship galvanizes the Ewes in Atlanta, and provides a platform for the learning and speaking of the language and putting cultural values in practice. It is a proof-text that we can be bilingual and bi-cultural as resident aliens. It is a call to end unconscious child-cultural abuse committed by parents who do not take pains to teach their children the mother tongue and the culture of their origin. To submit a child to a culture that diminishes the child 2 ̆ 7 s self-worth or self-esteem is tantamount to child-cultural abuse which this project seeks to address...|$|E
