5000|$|A tablet of lithographic {{limestone}} called a [...] "litho stone" [...] was {{coated with a}} light-sensitive surface composed of {{a thin layer of}} purified bitumen dissolved in benzene. A reversed <b>halftone</b> <b>negative</b> was then pressed against the coating and exposed to daylight (ten to thirty minutes in summer, up to several hours in winter), causing the bitumen to harden in proportion to the amount of light passing through each portion of the negative. Then a solvent such as turpentine was applied to remove the unhardened bitumen and retouch the tonal scale, strengthening or softening tones as required. Thus the image became imprinted on the stone in bitumen. Each tint was applied using a separate stone that bore the appropriate retouched image. The finished print was produced using at least six, but more commonly ten to fifteen, tint stones.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} identified factors, {{it was hypothesized that}} the level of exposure could influence the plate shoulder angle. It was further hypothesized that an optimization of shoulder angle with respect to halftone dot area may reduce the dot gain of the printing process. An experiment was conducted using a novel method of plate exposure. Continuous-tone masks were placed in contact with the plate back and the <b>halftone</b> <b>negative</b> used on the plate face. The resulting shoulder angles were measured and analyzed for significant fit to a linear mathematical model. For many dot sizes the face exposure level was significant in determining shoulder angle. The plates were printed on a flexographic press, and prints were analyzed to identify any benefits in dot gain reduction. Regression analysis showed very inconsistent correlations between shoulder angle and dot gain for individual dot sizes printed at an optimized level of impression...|$|E
