500|$|Before {{taking office}} as mayor, Booker sued the James administration, seeking to {{terminate}} cut-rate land deals favoring two redevelopment agencies that {{had contributed to}} James's campaigns and listed James {{as a member of}} their advisory boards. Booker argued that the state's [...] "pay-to-play" [...] laws had been violated and that the land deals would cost the city more than $15 million in lost revenue. Specifically, Booker referenced a parcel at Broad and South Streets that would <b>generate</b> <b>only</b> $87,000 under the proposed land deals yet was valued at $3.7 million under then-current market rates. On June 20, 2006, Superior Court Judge Patricia Costello ruled in favor of Booker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{studied the}} dispersion effects in an actively mode-locked inhomogeneously broadened laser. In the positive group velocity dispersion (GVD) re-gion, the laser generates incoherent pulses. Self-phase modulation and resonant dispersion impede {{reduction of the}} pulse duration when the GVD is small or near zero. A single, stable, soliton-like pulse can be <b>generated</b> <b>only</b> when the GVD is within a certain range of negative values. When the negative GVD is too small, the laser <b>generates</b> <b>only</b> multiple soliton-like pulses because of excess gain filtering. When the negative GVD is too large, the soliton pulse-shaping process fails, and the laser <b>generates</b> <b>only</b> incoherent pulses due to insufficient gain filtering. In the experiment, we char-acterized an actively mode-locked inhomogeneously broadened Nd: silicate glass laser and confirmed this GVD dependence. The laser generated self-sustaining, soliton-like pulses as short as 77 fs. Index Terms—Dispersion, inhomogenously broadened lasers, mode-locked lasers, Nd:glass laser, soliton. I...|$|R
