2500|$|In 1975 Don Javier abdicated as the Carlist king {{in favor}} of Carlos Hugo and {{according}} to a source, he would have expelled Sixto from Carlism for refusing to recognize the decision. It {{is not clear what}} his view on the commencing Spanish transición was; following the 1976 Montejurra events he lamented the dead, and officially disowned political line of Don Sixto and called for Carlist unity. However, on a private letter, Don Javier claimed that at Montejurra [...] "the Carlists have confronted the revolutionaries", which has been interpreted as the followers of Don Sixto being the real Carlists according to Don Javier. Early March 1977 proved convulsive. On Friday 4th, accompanied by his son Sixto, he was interviewed by the Spanish press and his responses showed Carlist orthodoxy. That same day he issued a <b>declaration</b> <b>certified</b> by a Paris notary objecting to his name being used to legitimize a [...] "grave doctrinal error within Carlism", and implicitly disowned the political line promoted by Carlos Hugo. However in few days Don Javier issued another <b>declaration,</b> <b>certified</b> by a different Paris notary, confirming his oldest son as [...] "my only political successor and head of Carlism". In order to justify the first declaration, Carlos Hugo alerted the police that his father had been abducted by Sixto, an accusation which was denied publicly by Don Javier himself. Then it was Doña Madalena who declared that her husband had been taken by Carlos Hugo from hospital against medical advice and his own will, and that Carlos Hugo had threatened his father to sign the second declaration. Eventually Don Javier was transferred to Switzerland, where he died shortly; the widow blamed the oldest son and 3 daughters for his death.|$|E

2500|$|On September 14, 2006, Colbert {{introduced}} his guest András Simonyi, Ambassador of the Republic of Hungary to the United States. The ambassador presented Mr. Colbert with a <b>declaration</b> <b>certifying</b> {{him as the}} winner of the second and final round of voting. The document bore the signatures of Hungarian government officials and the country's official seal. Included in the text, as read by the ambassador, were two important conditions required for the name of the bridge to be made official. First, Colbert must be fluent in Hungarian. Colbert responded by pronouncing the Hungarian name Nicholas Zrinyi (incorrectly referring to Miklós Zrínyi) and híd (meaning 'bridge' in Hungarian); Simonyi quickly certified him as fluent. The second requirement proved more onerous: To have the bridge named after him, Colbert would have to be deceased. Colbert protested, but the ambassador presented him with a Hungarian passport and [...] (HUF), noting that this would allow Colbert to enter Hungary at any time, without restriction. He also brought attention to the portrait of King St. Stephen, the first King of Hungary, on the 10,000 HUF bill. Finally Simonyi implied that the question of Colbert's ineligibility by virtue of being alive might be resolved if Colbert were to accept an invitation to visit the bridge site in Budapest; Colbert responded by trying to bribe the ambassador with the 10,000 HUF bill. On September 28, 2006, it was announced that the bridge will be named [...] "Megyeri Bridge", although the name did not make it to the second round. According to the Geographical Name Committee, the name was selected because the bridge connects [...] with Békásmegyer.|$|R

5000|$|In 1972 Don Javier {{suffered}} life-threatening injuries {{resulting from}} a traffic accident and formally transferred all political authority to Carlos Hugo. In 1974, upon childless death of his step-nephew Roberto Bourbon-Parma, Don Javier ascended to head of the Bourbon-Parmas and assumed the Duke of Parma title. On the one hand, he was in position to enjoy family life; though his 4 younger children did not marry, the older 2 did, the marriages producing 8 grandchildren (born between 1960 and 1974). On the other hand, family relations were increasingly subject to political tension. While Hugues, Marie-Thérèse, Cécile and Marie des Neiges formed one team advancing the progressist agenda, the oldest daughter Françoise Marie, the youngest son Sixte and their mother Madeleine opposed the bid. Sixte, in Spain known as Don Sixto, openly challenged his brother; he declared himself the standard-bearer of Traditionalism and started building own organization.In 1975 Don Javier abdicated as the Carlist king in favor of Carlos Hugo and expulsed Sixto from Carlism for refusing to recognize the decision. It {{is not clear what}} his view on the commencing Spanish transición was; following the 1976 Montejurra events he lamented the dead, disowned political line of Don Sixto and called for Carlist unity.

50|$|All Australian jurisdictions {{also have}} justices {{of the peace}} (JP) or commissioners for {{affidavits}} and other unqualified persons who are qualified to take affidavits or statutory <b>declarations</b> and to <b>certify</b> documents.

40|$|The Java thread {{mechanism}} {{allows the}} exploitation of parallelism {{within the confines of}} shared memory multiprocessors by allowing multiple threads to be mapped onto distinct physical processors. Distributed memory machines, however, have been unable to harness the simplicity and elegance of this approach, their programming being reliant on more complex message-passing techniques. Java Distributed Shared Memory (DSM) implementations seek to redress this situation by allowing the thread model to be extended into the realm of distributed memory multicomputers. While a number of Java DSM systems have been implemented, up until now no direct comparison of them has been conducted. This project presents a survey of Java DSM implementations and introduces a multithreaded benchmark suite which can be used to compare the scalability and performance of such systems. Preliminary tests of a number of Java DSM systems were then undertaken using the suite. ii <b>Declaration</b> I <b>certify</b> that this report does not incorporate, without acknowledgment, any material previously submitted for a degree or diploma in any University; and that {{to the best of my}} knowledge and belief it does not contain any material previously published or written by another person except where reference is made in the text...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{compares the}} views of 54 indigenous and 29 Bengali students and five teachers of four schools of Rangamati on the existent teaching techniques of English classes at the secondary level. The researcher has observed three English text based classes and two grammar classes. A total of 83 students and five teachers were given two different sets of questionnaires to collect responses. The finds show that all classes were conducted by the teachers in both English and Bangla languages, and the indigenous learners were more comfortable to have a teacher from their own community. Moreover, all the students wanted to have interactive games and tasks in class. Though such tasks are given in the NCTB book English for Today, the teachers {{do not try to}} use them at all as they think that it is time consuming. The research can be used in the indigenous schools as an example to implement the most preferred and effective teaching techniques in English classes. 1 <b>Declaration</b> I <b>certify</b> that the work presented in this thesis is, {{to the best of my}} knowledge and belief, wherever contributions of other sources and information have been used, they have been acknowledged.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} Internet access for {{businesses}} and individuals has seen an increasing demand on the IPv 4 address space and made IP addresses a valuable asset. As with any asset, a company’s IP address space must be managed well and protected {{from those who}} would damage or despoil it. A system to assist an organization with its efforts ought to be welcome indeed. The main goal of this project is to create such a system. The project analyzes some currently employed methods of IP address management and prevention of IP theft in particular. Methods such as layer- 2 -implemented theft prevention and passive reconnaissance tools are discussed and their shortcomings noted. A review of the pertinent literature is offered. The proposed solution, a combination of an active reconnaissance tool and record management system, is explained from both design and construction aspects. Finally, the system is evaluated and, based on its user reception and performance, recommendations are made for further work. <b>DECLARATION</b> I hereby <b>certify</b> that this dissertation constitutes my own product, tha...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a few months since we made the use of MedXPress {{mandatory}} for all pilots. The transition was fairly smooth, and MedXPress has made the medical application process much more efficient than the old paper system. However, we did experience some “growing pains. ” I {{thought it might be}} helpful to share some of the lessons we have learned, and {{to let you know that}} we are working hard to make this system as efficient and effective as it can possibly be. In January 2013, we received a call from an aviation medical examiner (AME) who said that he had an airman in his office who was completing his MedXPress application using the AME’s computer. The airman was attempting to enter the date of his most recent exam which had been accomplished in January of 2012. However, each time the airman entered the exam date, he got an error message stating that he could not enter a future date for a previous exam. Needless to say, the airman and the AME were very frustrated. It turns out that the AME had installed his computer in 2004 and never updated the system clock. Consequently, the system would not let the airman enter a date that it “thought ” was eight years into the future. Remember to keep your system’s clock up to date — LESSON 1. We received calls stating that the aerospace medical certification subsystem (AMCS) would not retrieve an application when a confirmation number was entered. MedXPress automatically eliminates applications if an airman has not provided the AME with a confirmation number within 60 days of application submission — LESSON 2. Airmen have wished to make corrections to a submitted application, but they discovered they no longer had access. If an airman calls you with this concern, simply tell him or her you can make the corrections in your office. You can revise every item on the applicant’s history page with the exception of block 20 (Applicant’s National Driver Register and <b>Certifying</b> <b>Declarations)</b> — LESSON 3. I understand some AMEs are experiencing printing problems. Some of these problems are resolved as AMEs get more familiar with the system. However, there also appear to be some issues with Adobe Reader, the free PDF Reader application. We are working to simplify the printing process, but in the meantime if you experience any printing problems, you can email us a...|$|R
