5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Hollywood and Graham; Zelda {{returned to}} the hospital. She nonetheless made progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was released. She was nearing forty now, <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. Scott was increasingly embittered by his own failures and his old friend Hemingway's continued success. They wrote each other frequently until Scott's death in December 1940. Zelda was unable to attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In early September 2007, she was {{featured}} {{as the lead}} story on the Yahoo! homepage, which boosted her ratings up to as high as 4000 viewers at any given moment. As of late September 2007, {{she was living in}} Pittsburgh and held a position as spokesperson for Pittsburgh Councilman Bill Peduto. She also landed a job with Xtrain, which was a firm that specializes in new media expert training. Although her father remained supportive, <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> beginning to tire of the intrusive nature of her activities by the end of 2007. In October 2007, she was described as one of the web's most popular lifecasters in Tribune Company affiliates such as the Chicago Tribune. That fall, she was a featured participant in the first annual BlogWorld & New Media Expo, which bills itself as the World's Largest Social Media Conference.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Los Angeles, Cameron befriended the socialite Samson De Brier and {{established}} herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> the filmmakers Curtis Harrington and Kenneth Anger. She appeared {{in two of}} Harrington's films, The Wormwood Star and Night Tide, {{as well as in}} Anger's film Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome. In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by John Chamberlain and Chick Strand. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in Joshua Tree, San Francisco, and Santa Fe. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from cancer in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in West Hollywood, where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.|$|E

25|$|In 1943 {{she spent}} {{a year at the}} University of California, Berkeley on a {{fellowship}} for graduate work in psychology with Erik Erikson. She became more politically active, continuing to mix with Marxists (many of <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> investigated by the FBI). In her memoirs, she claimed that her boyfriend at the time had pressured her into turning down a Ph.D. fellowship for further study and abandoning her academic career.|$|E
25|$|After realizing <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> {{making music}} but not getting {{television}} exposure {{other than what}} was seen on Video Music Box, Darlene Lewis (model/lyricist), along with Darryl Washington and Dean Carroll, brought hip hop music to the First Exposure cable show on Paragon cable, and then created the On Broadway television show. There, rappers had opportunities to be interviewed and have their music videos played. This pre-dated MTV or Video Soul on BET. The commercialization has made hip hop less edgy and authentic, {{but it also has}} enabled hip hop artists to become successful.|$|E
25|$|After {{her death}} Mead's Samoan {{research}} was criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who {{published a book}} that argued against many of Mead's conclusions. Freeman argued that Mead had misunderstood Samoan culture when she argued that Samoan culture did not place many restrictions on youths' sexual explorations. Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants. Freeman's critique was met with a considerable backlash and harsh criticism from the anthropology community, whereas it was received enthusiastically by communities of scientists who believed that sexual mores {{were more or less}} universal across cultures. Some anthropologists who studied Samoan culture argued in favor of Freeman's findings and contradicted those of Mead, whereas others argued that Freeman's work did not invalidate Mead's work because Samoan culture had been changed by the integration of Christianity in the decades between Mead's and Freeman's fieldwork periods. While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having wilfully misled Mead. She said that she and <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> having fun with Mead and telling her stories.|$|E

[...] She {{felt that it was}} [...] "typical" [...] of her to be thinking and [...] "deciding what was wrong" [...] because she felt that things in her head [...] "were not clear." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the summer}} progresses, Nick {{eventually}} receives {{an invitation to}} one of Gatsby's parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party, and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917, when Daisy and <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> doing volunteer services' work with young Officers headed to Europe. [...] From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy. Even more, he became obsessed {{with the idea of}} her, and the ideal of living in the world he saw her living in, as the fulfillment of all the possible dreams he could ever have.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, country {{pop singer}} Taylor Swift used Bieber's [...] "One Time" [...] as {{background}} music and music {{that she and}} <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> dancing to in a tour video diary that she posted on her official YouTube account. In response to Swift using his song, Bieber posted an acoustic rendition of the then never-before heard [...] "Favorite Girl" [...] on his YouTube. When asked about his learning of Swift using his song, Bieber stated, [...] "It was really funny because I heard about it from a fan. I watched {{it and it was}} hilarious!" [...] Bieber and Swift then met in person at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later invited him to be a special guest on her Fearless Tour when she returned to the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|The {{first episode}} showed the couple meeting at a funeral, marrying, {{and going through}} the honeymoon phase. The last section of the episode {{features}} a confrontation between Becky and Mark, in which the former admits that she is an adulteress before realising that all of <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> hiding around her living room {{in preparation for a}} surprise party for her. The story continues directly into episode two, when Robert and Tracy return to the flat to check on Mark after his wife's departure. The three recall the circumstances in which they had first met. After their first date, the couple go back to Becky's flat. While she is in the bathroom, he strips down to his boxer shorts and handcuffs himself to the bedpost. Unable to free himself, Robert and Tracy walk in on him. Moffat used a similar scenario for the Coupling episode [...] "The Freckle, the Key, and the Couple who Weren't" [...] and reveals in its audio commentary that it is based on a situation with one of his ex-girlfriends.|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there‚Äîone of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez {{said she}} liked the pairing of Poehler and Theroux, but found [...] "Leslie's House" [...] slower than {{previous}} episodes, and felt the comedic talents of Ansari and Offerman were underused. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode for its use {{of a wide range}} of characters to provide humor, saying [...] "Everyone got a chance to shine in this episode. They all took turns giving us a laugh and 'Leslie's House' was a tremendous example of this series firing on all cylinders." [...] Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode's satirical bent about elected officials. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club favorably compared [...] "Leslie's House" [...] to [...] "Dinner Party", an episode of The Office, the other comedy series created by Parks co-creator Greg Daniels. However, he said [...] "Leslie's House" [...] was different in that <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> willing to attend her party and help her out, whereas in the Office episode, the characters did not want to attend the dinner party held by protagonist Michael Scott. Heisler said the fact that the characters liked each other so much in Parks and Recreation differentiated itself from the other series in a positive way.|$|E

500|$|Mitford had no {{training}} as a writer or journalist; her style, particularly in the pre-war novels, is chatty and informal, much as in her letters. She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles, who in his youth during the Franco-Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as [...] "extremely graphic and amusing". Mitford's fiction, based on upper-class family life and , belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners. Her protagonists‚Äîtypically, intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing‚Äîare broadly autobiographical. [...] It is unsurprising, says Thompson, that Mitford should first attempt {{to write a novel}} in the early 1930s, since many of <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> doing the same thing. What is surprising, Thompson adds, is the ease with which [...] she found a publisher for this first book. Perhaps, says Thompson, her [...] publishers Thornton Butterworth [...] "liked the idea of this pretty, well-connected girl who wrote in the style du jour". Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels; Rachel Cooke, writing on their reissue in 2011, believes she had no reason to be: [...] "There is a special kind of energy here, and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer who would rather die than be boring".|$|E
500|$|To protect Wollstonecraft, Imlay {{registered}} her as {{his wife}} in 1793, {{even though they were}} not married. After declaring war on Britain, France was blockaded by the Royal Navy, which caused shortages that worsened the problem of inflation. Imlay engaged in blockade-running, chartering ships to be bring in food and soap from America into France, which explained why both he and Wollstonecraft were not arrested during the Reign of Terror. As the Terror began in France with arrests and executions occurring daily, Wollstonecraft came under suspicion as someone from a nation that was at war with France and who was known to be a friend of leading Girondins, which led Imlay to make a false statement to the U.S. embassy in Paris that he had married her, automatically making her into an American citizen, in order to protect her from arrest. Some of <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> not so lucky; many, like Thomas Paine, were arrested, and some were even guillotined (Wollstonecraft's sisters believed she had been imprisoned). Wollstonecraft called life under the Jacobins [...] "nightmarish" [...] with gigantic parades in the day where everyone had to cheer, lest they fall under suspicion of not being committed to the republic, and police raids at night to arrest [...] "enemies of the republic". In a letter to her sister Everina, written in March 1794, Wollstonecraft wrote: [...] "It is impossible for you to have any idea of the impression the sad scenes I have been a witness to have left on my mind...death and misery, in every shape of terror, haunted this devoted country ‚Äì I certainly am glad that I came to France, because I never could have had else a just opinion of the most extraordinary event that has ever been recorded." ...|$|E
500|$|Merryman had a {{relationship}} with stock car racing driver Jeff Gordon. She first met Gordon in 2000 while she was employed in Palm Beach, Florida at a Neiman Marcus store in a mall where she advised customers about cosmetics products. Merryman did not recognize the race-car driver at their first meeting, though <b>her</b> <b>friends</b> <b>were</b> excited to meet him during the same encounter. Initially Merryman turned down Gordon's request to take her out for lunch. One year after their initial encounter, they began {{a relationship}}. They were romantically-linked for 11 months. Merryman and Gordon vacationed together in Saint-Jean, Saint Barth√©lemy in the Caribbean in January 2003 to celebrate the New Year. This relationship caused difficulty for his then-ongoing marriage to Brooke Sealy. Sealy discovered Gordon's relationship with Merryman and subsequently divorced the race-car driver. Gordon's wife, who also went by the name Jennifer Brooke Gordon, cited Merryman by name in her divorce papers with the racecar driver. Merryman was featured in the October 2003 issue of Playboy magazine, where she was interviewed about her relationship with Gordon. Merryman stated that Gordon had confided in her: [...] "He got married when he was 23 and has been on the racetrack since he was a kid. He used to tell me all the time he {{never had a chance to}} have fun." [...] She reflected on what she had learned after her period of time with Gordon, saying in the future she would avoid relationships both with men of his occupation and those who were married. Gordon did not comment on Merryman's 2003 appearance in the magazine. When asked about the article, Gordon refused to comment on it. He stated: [...] "It's not even worth commenting on. All I want to talk about is being fast". Gordon's divorce was finalized in June 2003.|$|E
