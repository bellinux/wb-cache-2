5|$|Along {{with his}} brother John, {{beginning}} in 1640, Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Kraków. On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub Zadzik, bishop of Kraków. The next year, on 2 June 1643, Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent Władysław IV for everything he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Nodworski College. Two months earlier, in April 1643, Marek and John Sobieski began studies at Kraków Academy. In 1644 Sobieski became Starosta of Krasnystaw.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, aged eight, Gielgud went to Hillside preparatory {{school in}} Surrey as his elder {{brothers}} <b>had</b> <b>done.</b> <b>For</b> {{a child with}} no interest in sport he acquitted himself reasonably well in cricket and rugby for the school. In class, he hated mathematics, was fair at classics, and excelled at English and divinity. Hillside encouraged his interest in drama, and he played several leading roles in school productions, including Mark Antony in Julius Caesar and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element of}} the actinides, {{actinium}} gave the group its name, much as lanthanum <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the lanthanides. The group of elements is more diverse than the lanthanides and therefore {{it was not until}} 1928 that Charles Janet proposed the most significant change to Dmitri Mendeleev's periodic table since the recognition of the lanthanides, by introducing the actinides, a move suggested again in 1945 by Glenn T. Seaborg.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead. Macmillan Publishing, which had published We the Living, rejected the book after Rand insisted they provide more publicity for her new novel than they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the first one. Rand's agent began submitting the book to other publishers; in 1938, Knopf signed a contract to publish the book. When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book. When Rand's agent began to criticize the novel, Rand fired the agent and decided to handle submissions herself. Twelve publishers (including Macmillan and Knopf) rejected the book.|$|E

5|$|As he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé {{was careful to}} obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it would probably be unseaworthy.|$|E
5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss which side Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third part.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} second semi-final, a winner's press conference was held for the ten {{qualifying}} countries. As part of this press conference, the qualifying artists {{took part in a}} draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in. This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi-final. Austria was drawn to compete in the first half. Following this draw, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final, as they <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the semi-finals. Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11, following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany. On the day of the grand final, Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition, placed only behind the entry from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{publication}} of Summer Cooking, David was wooed away from her regular column in Harpers by Vogue magazine, which offered her more money and more prominence—a full central page with a continuing column following, and a full page photograph. The new contract meant she also wrote for Vogues sister magazine House & Garden. Audrey Withers, the editor of Vogue, wanted David to write more personal columns than she <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Harper's, and paid her £20 a month for food ingredients {{and from time to time}} £100 for research trips to France.|$|E
5|$|Synge's plays {{helped to}} set the {{dominant}} style of plays at the Abbey Theatre until the 1940s. The stylised realism of his writing {{was reflected in the}} training given at the theatre's school of acting, and plays of peasant life were the main staple of the repertoire {{until the end of the}} 1950s. Sean O'Casey, the next major dramatist to write for the Abbey, knew Synge's work well and attempted to do for the Dublin working classes what Synge <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the rural poor. Brendan Behan, Brinsley MacNamara, and Lennox Robinson were all indebted to Synge.|$|E

5|$|While match referee Massimo Busacca and {{his assistants}} {{collected}} their mementoes of the final, the Barcelona team formed a {{guard of honour}} for the Manchester United players, just as the English side <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Chelsea in 2008. Led by their manager, Alex Ferguson, and team captain, Ryan Giggs, the Manchester United team then ascended the specially constructed rostrum to collect their runners-up medals from UEFA president Michel Platini and secretary David Taylor. Other dignitaries present included Manchester United chief executive David Gill; The Football Association's president Prince William, and chairman Lord Triesman; Barcelona president Joan Laporta; Juan Carlos I of Spain; Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar; and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Ferguson also collected a commemorative plaque from Platini, but immediately handed it to Giggs.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} {{became popular}} {{on a large}} scale {{at the time of the}} First World War, when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was Dick, Kerr's Ladies of Preston, England. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from Paris, France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a Scottish Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} centuries BCE, {{the worship of}} Isis spread from Egypt across the Mediterranean world, and she {{became one of the}} most popular deities in the region. Although this new, {{multicultural}} form of Isis absorbed characteristics from many other deities, her original mythological nature as a wife and mother was key to her appeal. Horus and Osiris, being central figures in her story, spread along with her. The Greek and Roman cult of Isis developed a series of initiation rites dedicated to Isis and Osiris, based on earlier Greco-Roman mystery rites but colored by Egyptian afterlife beliefs. The initiate went through an experience that simulated descent into the underworld. Elements of this ritual resemble Osiris's merging with the sun in Egyptian funerary texts. Isis's Greek and Roman devotees, like the Egyptians, believed that she protected the dead in the afterlife as she <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Osiris, and they said that undergoing the initiation guaranteed to them a blessed afterlife. It was to a Greek priestess of Isis that Plutarch wrote his account of the myth of Osiris.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a {{successful}} call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> Elliott before.|$|E
5|$|Quinn {{attended}} Lee High School in Houston, Texas and Stephen F. Austin State University. He {{started playing}} football {{in high school}} and played at university, where he started for one season, his senior season. After he went undrafted in the 1997 NFL Draft he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers. With Pittsburgh, he ended up making the roster as the thirdstring quarterback. Following the season, he was allocated to the Rhein Fire, whom he led to the championship game. He spent 1998 and 1999 as a backup for the Indianapolis Colts and Dallas Cowboys before signing with the Miami Dolphins. Quinn spent two seasons backing up for the Dolphins. In 2002, {{he was one of the}} first group of players signed by the National Football League (NFL) expansion franchise, the Houston Texans. As he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>for</b> the previous years in his career, Quinn spent two seasons as a backup for the new franchise. The final year of his NFL career was spent with the Denver Broncos in training camp and with the Steelers' practice squad. After going unsigned, Quinn signed with the Montreal Alouettes joining their practice squad in August 2005, leaving the team after the season. Quinn joined another Canadian team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in March 2006 but after receiving playing time in a backup role he was released later that year, in August.|$|E
