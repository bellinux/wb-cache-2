500|$|The English {{script was}} nearly four {{megabytes}} in size, yet Working Designs completed the translation in only eight weeks after a marathon programming session. [...] During translation, the developers did {{find time to}} inject {{some of their own}} humor in to the game's text, dropping in sentences such as <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> tried swimming in lemon jello?, and numerous light-hearted pop culture references not seen in the original version, including allusions to American commercials, celebrities, colloquialisms, products, and role-playing game clichés.|$|E

500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video <b>Have</b> <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> Really Loved A Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E

[...] Among the first film industry witnesses subpoenaed by the Committee were ten who decided not to cooperate. These men, who became known as the [...] "Hollywood Ten", cited the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and free assembly, which they believed legally protected them from being required to answer the Committee's questions. This tactic failed, and the ten were sentenced to prison for contempt of Congress. Two of the ten were sentenced to six months, the rest to a year.|$|E
