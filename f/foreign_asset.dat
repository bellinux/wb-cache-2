40|$|This paper studies net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> and the {{differential}} returns between gross <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities for {{a sample of}} 49 countries between 1981 and 2007. It shows that investment income {{is more important than}} capital gains in imparting a drift to net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> over the long-run, whereas the latter dominate short-term dynamics. Excess returns on net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> of the United States are indeed exorbitant from a global perspective, only occasionally matched by other countries and mainly accounted for by positive valuation effects. The role of the United States as levered investor did not contribute to its exorbitant privilege. The econometric panel analysis also fails to find a robust positive relationship between leverage and excess returns. Notably, instead, real exchange rate depreciations increase excess returns through capital gains, proportionally to the relative foreign currency exposure. Excess yields on investment income are positively associated with the country risk rating.

By comparison, net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> have a more robust effect on national price levels than productivity differentials. Basic theoretical implications are confirmed by the price level data of OECD countries. price levels; productivity; net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect that}} windfalls from international commodity price booms have on net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> in a panel of 145 countries during the period 1970 - 2007.

In ethnically polarized countries, net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> significantly decreased. To explain this asymmetry, the paper shows that in ethnically polarized countries commodity windfalls lead to large increases in government spending, political corruption, and the risk of expropriation, with no overall effect on GDP per capita growth.

For example, as of 2000, General Electric was the second largest multinational corporation in terms of foreign assert ownership. However, it ranked only 73rd by the TNI, with an index of only 40%. Although the company had large investments outside of the United States, most of its sales, employment, and assets were within the U.S.. In contrast, Exxon has a TNI of 68% and Vodafone has a TNI of 81%. As of 2001, General Electric ranked 75th, with a TNI of 36.7%. The 14 most transnational corporations originated in small countries (Switzerland, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada), whereas the largest multinational corporations in terms of <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> ownership all had low TNI scores. General Motors, the fourth largest multinational corporation in terms of <b>foreign</b> <b>asset</b> ownership only ranked 83rd (30.7%) on the TNI top 100.

Under flexible prices, the nominal exchange rate exhibits a unit root. However, today's exchange rate also depends on the stock of real net <b>foreign</b> <b>assets</b> accumulated in the previous period. The predictive power of net assets for the exchange rate is stronger the closer assets to non-stationary and the higher the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods in consumption.
