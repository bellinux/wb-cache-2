5|$|Crest badges, {{much like}} clan tartans, {{do not have}} a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century. The {{original}} badges used by clans are said to have been specific plants worn in bonnets or <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pole or spear.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Robert Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) is {{a detective}} with the Seattle Police Department's {{homicide}} division. Bletcher {{had worked with}} Black during Black's law-enforcement career, and becomes his liaison with the police when Black returns to Seattle. The detective is murdered by Lucy Butler when she breaks into the Blacks' house, and he is <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> basement rafter.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} remained open to {{the public}} until 2005, when it was closed for a third restoration. The $12-million restoration, by Olin Conservation, Inc., of Great Falls, Virginia, started with the 26 sections of the painting and recreated its original shape of 14 panels <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> circular railing, slightly flared out at the bottom. In the process, some original pieces were found of the 12 circumferential feet that had been cut away. Fourteen vertical feet of sky was also restored.|$|E
50|$|Mass {{production}} systems for items made of numerous parts are usually organized into assembly lines. The assemblies pass by on a conveyor, {{or if they}} are heavy, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> overhead crane or monorail.|$|R
50|$|As {{originally}} constructed, {{the church}} had no belfry, the bell being <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> old-growth cedar directly behind the church. Although to all appearances dead, this tree was still standing until felled by Hurricane Fabian in 2003.|$|R
50|$|The hanging perch is a {{variation}} on the perch where the pole is <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> aerial mount point, and a pair of fliers perform tricks and stunts from the pole. Usually this includes the base being supported by an ankle strap on the pole. This allows him or her to stand out on the pole and hold a flyer while he/she performs various acrobatic maneuvers.|$|R
5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags would be at half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E
5|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches {{were scheduled}} on the event's card. The main event saw WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defeat The Undertaker to retain his championship in a match where a chain was <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pole {{and the first}} man to reach it could use it as a legal weapon in what was called a Biker Chain match. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard. In a standard match for the WWE United States Championship, the Big Show defeated Eddie Guerrero to win the title. The other was also a standard match, in which Kurt Angle defeated John Cena.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a quiver, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E

6000|$|Hiding Game.--In hiding {{game from}} birds of prey, brush it over, {{and they will}} seldom find it out; birds cannot smell well, but they have keen eyes. The meat should be <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> {{overhanging}} bough; then, if the birds find it out, {{there will be no}} place for them to stand on and tear it. Leaving a handkerchief or a short to flutter <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree, will scare animals of prey for a short time. (See [...] "Scarecrows." ...|$|R
60|$|But thou sayest, methinks this white-lead chapter about {{whiteness}} {{is but a}} {{white flag}} <b>hung</b> out <b>from</b> <b>a</b> craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.|$|R
25|$|The early {{variants}} of the Order were screw back badges to allow wear on clothing. Later variants (from 1943) <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> standard Soviet pentagonal mount with a ring through the suspension loop. The mount {{was covered with}} an overlapping 24mm wide red silk moiré ribbon with 1.5mm wide white edge stripes and a 7mm wide white central stripe.|$|E
25|$|Sam Browne VC was a British {{army officer}} serving in India in the 19th century. In those days {{officers}} always carried a sword into battle. It <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small metal clip on the waistbelt, called a 'frog'. However, the scabbard tended to slide {{around a lot}} when they charged the enemy, meaning {{that it had to}} be steadied with the left hand before being drawn.|$|E
25|$|The harquebusier {{would usually}} have been {{armed with a}} doglock carbine, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> swivel {{attached}} to a baldric, pistols, either wheellock or flintlock, in saddle holsters and a stout, straight-bladed, sword. The 'dog' of the doglock was a type of safety-catch, very useful to prevent the unintentional firing of the carbine when on horseback. Records also indicate that some harquebusiers were also armed with a horseman's poleaxe or pick, these were hafted weapons with axe or hammer heads and armour-piercing spikes.|$|E
60|$|The light {{revealed}} a small natural cavern of rock, {{not much more}} than six feet high and ten or twelve wide, but of irregular shape, and extending into obscurity in one direction. The only objects in the cave besides the ladder by which they entered it were a few barrels partially covered with deerskin, an unusually small table, rudely but strongly made, and an enormous mass of rock enclosed in a net of strong rope which <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> iron hook in the roof.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure. That man {{tried to}} kill his wife and seven children, and then <b>hung</b> himself <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree not far from here. They say that twice a month his ghost appears." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{corpse of}} the 76th-generation Duke Yansheng {{was removed from}} its grave and <b>hung</b> naked <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree {{in front of the}} palace during the desecration of the {{cemetery}} in the Cultural Revolution.|$|R
25|$|This {{medallion}} is worn on {{the left}} chest, on a 31.8mm wide ribbon coloured red with three vertical blue stripes: for men, <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bar, and for women, on a ribbon bow, both pinned to the left chest. Should an individual already possessing a Medal of Bravery be awarded the medal again for subsequent acts of bravery, {{he or she is}} granted a medal bar, in silver and bearing a maple leaf, for wear on the ribbon from which the original medal is suspended.|$|E
25|$|When {{the nearby}} village of Desertmartin held the county court of County Coleraine, all those {{condemned}} to die were executed or <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> stone that projected {{out over the}} door of the old Kilcronaghan parish church. This stone had a gutter cut to embrace the rope and prevent it from slipping from the stone during an execution. During the rebellion of 1641, in which Phelim O'Neill was engaged, and even in subsequent periods, the old Kilcronaghan parish church was still the scene of executions. The hanging stone was in 1806 built into the new church.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, {{he played}} {{baseball}} with Sonny and David Rooslet (a neighborhood friend of Marciano's), worked out on homemade weightlifting equipment (later in his life, Marciano {{was also a}} client of Charles Atlas) and used a stuffed mailbag that <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree in his back yard as a heavy bag. He attended Brockton High School, where he played both baseball and football. However, he was cut from the school baseball team because he had joined a church league, violating a school rule forbidding players from joining other teams. He {{dropped out of school}} after finishing tenth grade.|$|E
50|$|Another {{variation}} is that Apollo played his instrument (the lyre) upside down. Marsyas {{could not do}} this with his instrument (the flute), and so Apollo <b>hung</b> him <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree and flayed him alive.|$|R
50|$|These {{reactors}} use vertical polyethylene sleeves <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> iron frame. Glass tubes {{can also}} be used alternatively.Microalgae are also cultured in vertical alveolar panels (VAP) that are a type of photobioreactor. This photobioreactor is characterised by low productivity. However, this problem can be overcome by modifying the surface area to volume ratio; where a higher ratio can increase productivity. Mixing and deoxygenation are drawbacks of this system and can be addressed by bubbling air continuously at a mean flow rate. The two main types of vertical photobioreactors are the Flow-through VAP and the Bubble Column VAP.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sides of}} the piece of {{cardboard}} have the same image. The cardboard is <b>hung</b> vertically <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wire so it can rotate around continuously, or {{is attached to a}} vertical mechanically rotating axis for continuous rotation.|$|R
25|$|Another symbol used by clan {{members is}} a clan badge, or {{sometimes}} called a plant badge. The original clan badges were merely plants worn in bonnets or <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pole or spear. Today, the clan badge attributed to Clan MacNeil is dryas. Trefoil {{has also been}} attributed to the clan, however this clan badge may actually {{be attributed to the}} McNeills of Gigha, a branch of Clan MacNeil. Trefoil has also been attributed to the Lamonts, another clan in Argyl. The Lamonts and MacNeils/McNeills both claim descent from the same O'Neill who settled in Scotland in the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} {{of discrimination against}} Muslims include the desecration of 148 French Muslim graves near Arras. A pig's head was <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> headstone and profanities insulting Islam and Muslims were daubed on some graves. Destruction and vandalism of Muslim graves in France were seen as Islamophobic by {{a report of the}} European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. A number of mosques have also been vandalized in France over the years. On 14 January 2015 it was reported that 26 mosques in France had been subject to attack since the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Longline culture (rope culture): Mussels are {{cultivated}} {{extensively in}} New Zealand, {{where the most}} common method is to attach mussels to ropes which are <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rope back-bone supported by large plastic floats. The most common species cultivated in New Zealand is the New Zealand green-lipped mussel. Longline culture is the most recent development for mussel culture and are often used {{as an alternative to}} raft culture in areas that are more exposed to high wave energy. A long-line is suspended by a series of small anchored floats and ropes or socks of mussels are then suspended vertically from the line.|$|E
5000|$|Usually gib-arms are {{attached}} to a vertical mast or tower or sometimes to an inclined [...] In other jib-less designs such as derricks, the load is <b>hung</b> directly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> boom which is often anomalously called a jib.|$|R
60|$|Before Berenger {{knew where}} he was, a door was opened, {{and he found himself}} in the church. The {{building}} was almost entirely dark; there were two tall lights at the altar in distance, and a few little slender tapers burning before certain niches and shrines, but without power to conquer with the gloom more than enough to spread a pale circle of yellow light beneath them, and to show mysteriously a bit of vaulting above. <b>A</b> single lamp <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> arch near the door, and beneath it, near a pillar, knelt, or rather crouched, on the floor, a female figure with a dark peasant cloak drawn over her head.|$|R
50|$|Contenders and {{opposing}} warriors <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> undulating metal grid roughly 10 {{feet off}} the ground. The contender attempted to kick the warrior (most often Bubba King) off the grid within 60 seconds without being removed from the grid themselves. Kicks to the head were technically against the rules and would result in DQ's. At least 1 contender was DQ'd because of head shots. If the contender kicked the warrior off the grid, the contender scored 50 points. Draws scored 25 points. Most contenders were lucky to score short of a DQ of the warrior. Bubba King and Sleepwalker were almost impossible to beat, but O'Dell actually was impossible to defeat, as he never lost a match and rarely surrendered a draw.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{practical}} rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> centered mast. The sail was symmetric across the yard, and to shunt, what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing {{the direction of the}} sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and {{is often referred to as}} the Gibbons/Dierking rig.|$|E
25|$|Amber Lewis' {{sculpture}} {{is similar}} to the readymade in that each component of the artwork is readily available when you step outside (tree and rocks) or can be easily bought at any local hardware store (rope and bucket.) This piece diverts from Duchamp's readymades in that Lewis' sculpture can not be easily moved since it is site specific and is <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tree which is immobile. Part of the sculpture is the way the tree changes over time and never looks the same from day to day. The tree from which the bucket hangs is constantly changing with the seasons. In winter the tree has no leaves, but blooms in the spring to eventually create leaves in the summer, only to drop them in the fall.|$|E
500|$|Brine mining: Around 500 BCE, {{the ancient}} Chinese dug {{hundreds}} of brine wells, {{some of which}} were over 100 meters (330 feet) in depth. Bamboo towers were erected, similar in style to modern-day oil derricks. Bamboo was used for ropes, casing, and derricks since it was salt resistant. Iron wedges were <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bamboo cable attached to a lever on a platform constructed atop the tower. The derricks required two to three men jumping on and off the lever that moved the iron wedge pounded into the ground to dig a hole deep enough into the ground to hit the brine.|$|E
50|$|The valiant Polish force {{continues}} to hold out against the Cossacks and Tartars. Huge assault towers are burnt to the ground by a sally led by Skrzetuski; in the action the Polish soldiers are nearly taken but are saved by the hussars. Chmielnicki summons Zaćwilichowski for negotiations but his monstrous demands are rejected by Prince Jeremi, so the fighting continues. Hunger sets in, and Longin decides to steal through the enemy’s lines to tell {{the king of the}} army's flight. However, he is discovered after stumbling into some Tartar horse-herders and is killed by Tartar arrows after a last stand. His naked body is <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> assault machine, which the Poles storm to cut him down so he can be given a military funeral.|$|R
5000|$|Pinewood {{painted with}} {{washable}} <b>hung</b> <b>from</b> the ceiling. <b>A</b> {{month and a}} half ago, they took it off in order to wash the sponge on the ceiling. It was full of smoke. It doesn't wash. I hope they didn't wash it with solvent.|$|R
50|$|A 3-by-5-inch {{aluminum}} plaque commemorating Evans’ death once <b>hung</b> discreetly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{telephone pole}} near {{the scene of}} the lynching. The plaque was vandalized with graffiti and has since been removed. There are multiple plaques hanging around downtown commemorating similar instances. It is not commonly known who put them up.|$|R
