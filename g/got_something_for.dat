5|$|In a side plot, a love {{triangle}} develops between Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza) and Ann. In an interview, Ann says Andy {{is a fun}} {{person but}} was a terrible boyfriend because he is completely reliant on others. When learning self-defense from Ron, Ann takes down Andy with a wrist grab, impressing Andy but making April jealous. After Andy is accidentally knocked out by Ron, Ann later approaches Andy at his shoe shine stand and brings him gifts to help him feel better. April arrives and Andy gives her a vegetarian muffin. Surprised Andy <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> someone other than himself, Ann believes Andy has changed.|$|E
25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E
2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. [...] "It means so much [...] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing," [...] Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. [...] "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents." ...|$|E

6000|$|Lopez {{was in a}} {{very good}} humour when he took his wife down, and he walked her round the {{terraces}} and esplanades of that not sufficiently well-known marine paradise, now bidding her admire the sea and now laughing at the finery of the people, till she became gradually filled with an idea that as he was making himself pleasant, she also ought to do the same. Of course she was not happy. The gilding had so completely and so rapidly been washed off her idol that she could not be very happy. But she also could be good-humoured. [...] "And now," [...] said he, smiling, [...] "I have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> you to do for me,--something that you will find very disagreeable." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{found that}} the Triscoes were going to a quiet old hotel {{on the way to}} Stuyvesant Square, quite in his own neighborhood, and he quickly {{arranged}} for all the ladies and the general to drive together while he was to follow with his son on foot and by car. They got away from the scene of the customs' havoc while the steamer shed, with its vast darkness dimly lit by its many lamps, still showed like a battle-field where the inspectors groped among the scattered baggage like details from the victorious army searching for the wounded. His son clapped him on the shoulder when he suggested this notion, and said he was the same old father; and they got home as gayly together as the dispiriting influences of the New York ugliness would permit. It was still in those good and decent times, now so remote, when the city <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> the money paid out to keep its streets clean, and those they passed through were not foul but merely mean.|$|E
60|$|The man I {{took to be}} my old shipmate, {{also seemed}} to know me. I was but a lad when I quitted the Sterling, it is true; but they tell me I have not altered {{a great deal in}} general appearance. My hair is still black; and then, when I was in the very prime of life, it must have been easy to {{recognize}} me. So strongly was I impressed, at the time, that I saw an old acquaintance, I was about to call him by name, when, luckily, it crossed my mind this might be dangerous. The pirates wished clearly to be unknown, and it was wisest to let them think they were so. My supposed shipmate, however, proved my friend, and I received no more personal ill treatment after he had spoken to his companion. I sometimes think he was the means, indeed, of saving all our lives. He asked me if there was any money, and, on my denying it, he told me they knew better: the schooner was in ballast, and must have <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> her outward cargo. I refused to tell, and he ordered me into their boat, whither the captain had been sent before me. In doing all this, his manner wore an appearance, to me, of assumed severity.|$|E
6000|$|We had {{not been}} {{a quarter of an hour}} in his tent but Sir John Hepburn came in again, and {{addressing}} to me, told me he was glad to find me there; that he came to the captain's tent to inquire how to send to me; and that I must do him the honour to go with him to wait on the king, who had a mind to hear the account I could give him of the Imperial army from my own mouth. I must confess I was at some loss in my mind how to make my address to his Majesty, but I had heard so much of the conversable temper of the king, and his particular sweetness of humour with the meanest soldier, that I made no more difficulty, but having paid my respects to Colonel Hepburn, thanked him for the honour he had done me, and offered to rise and wait upon him. [...] "Nay," [...] says the Colonel, [...] "we will eat first, for I find Gourdon," [...] which was the captain's name, [...] "has <b>got</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> supper, and the king's order is at seven o'clock." [...] So we went to supper, and Sir John, becoming very friendly, must know my name; which, when I had told him, and of what place and family, he rose from his seat, and embracing me, told me he knew my father very well, and had been intimately acquainted with him, and told me several passages wherein my father had particularly obliged him. After this we went to supper, and the king's health being drank round, the colonel moved the sooner because he had a mind to talk with me.|$|E
