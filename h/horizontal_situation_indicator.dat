2500|$|The cockpit {{area of the}} Islander had not {{suffered}} significant damage, {{and there}} was sufficient space for the pilot to survive. The pilot's seat belt and shoulder harness were found undamaged and unbuckled, with all stitching intact and the buckle still functional. There {{was no sign of}} impact on the controls or the instrument panel. Both fuel tanks contained a significant amount of fuel, which investigators calculated to be approximately 100 US gallons in each of the two wing tanks, and the fuel selector valve was in the correct position. Several instruments were damaged by the impact or by the pressure and corrosion from sitting on the seabed for six days. The aircraft's <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator,</b> or HSI (a navigational instrument to direct the pilot to or from ground-based navigation aids, including the MAC VOR), was not set properly for the approach. The instrument's course selector was set to 103°, though the approach called for a setting of 115°. A second device on the HSI, called the [...] "heading bug", is a prominent marker for the pilot to set to the desired heading so that when the aircraft is flying that heading, the bug {{is at the top of}} the instrument's display and aligned with a vertical white line. The heading bug on the HSI was set to 157°. A second instrument situated below the HSI and capable of the same VOR navigation, called the omni bearing indicator (OBI), was also set incorrectly to 309° when it too should have been set to 115°.|$|E

500|$|The crew used Jeppesen charts dated 21 January 1994. According to procedures, both <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> (HSI) {{were set}} to 283°, but the {{magnetic}} localizer course of 300° was not set. A global positioning system (GPS) {{was used as a}} back-up. No requests were made for VHF direction finding. From [...] MSL until impact, the flight was carried out in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and the flight controlled by automatic stabilization mode, with lateral navigation controlled by the navigator.|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{symbology}} was encoded {{to provide}} additional information concerning the traffic, which was displayed on the pilot's electronic <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> (EHSI). A research airplane representing an advanced operational environment {{was used to assess}} the benefit of coded traffic symbology in a realistic work-load environment. Traffic scenarios, involving both conflict-free and conflict situations, were employed. Subjective pilot commentary was obtained {{through the use of a}} questionnaire and extensive pilot debriefings. These results grouped conveniently under two categories: display factors and task performance. A major item under the display factor category was the problem of display clutter. The primary contributors to clutter were the use of large map-scale factors, the use of traffic data blocks, and the presentation of more than a few airplanes. In terms of task performance, the cockpit-displayed traffic information was found to provide excellent overall situation awareness. Additionally, mile separation prescribed during these tests...|$|R

40|$|Both {{scientists}} and politicians increasingly emphasise {{the importance of}} well-being as an indicator for economic performance, next to purely financial indicators such as national income and product accounts. There is an ongoing discussion about the most appropriate indicators to measure well-being. In this paper we use the set of eight life <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> used by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research, and concentrate on the regional dimension of well-being, by comparing the spatial variation in well-being in the Netherlands with the spatial patterns of the separate life <b>situation</b> <b>indicators,</b> that have been shown in this years' series of The Netherlands in Maps, in the successive issues of TESG's 2011 volume.

5000|$|These {{include the}} <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (HSI) and Attitude Director Indicator (ADI). The HSI {{combines}} the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a Glide slope. The navigation information {{comes from a}} VOR/Localizer, or GPS.

40|$|A {{head up display}} (HUD) format {{developed}} at NASA Ames Research Center to provide pilots of V/STOL aircraft with complete flight guidance and control information for category- 3 C terminal-area flight operations, is described in detail. These flight operations cover a large spectrum, from STOL operations on land-based runways to VTOL operations on small ships in high seas. Included in this description is a complete geometrical specification of the HUD elements and their drive laws. The principal features of this display format are {{the integration of the}} flightpath and pursuit guidance information into a narrow field of view, easily assimilated by the pilot with a single glance, and the superposition of vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> information. The display is a derivative of a successful design developed for conventional transport aircraft. The design is the outcome of many piloted simulations conducted over a four-year period. Whereas the concepts on which the display format rests could not be fully exploited because of field-of-view restrictions, and some reservations remain about the acceptability of superimposing vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> information, the design successfully fulfilled its intended objectives...|$|R

2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that the term situational awareness was first employed at the Douglas Aircraft Company during human factors engineering research while developing vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> displays and evaluating digital-control placement {{for the next generation of}} commercial aircraft. Research programs in flight-crew computer interaction and mental workload measurement [...] built on the concept of awareness measurement from a series of experiments that measured contingency awareness during learning, and later extended to mental workload and fatigue.|$|R
5000|$|According to McDonnell Douglas, a {{short circuit}} or an open circuit in certain models of VOR/ILS {{receivers}} could cause navigation instruments to indicate [...] "zero deviation". Thus, raw data deviation {{information on the}} attitude direction indicator, displayed by the flight director bars, and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> could center and remain centered with no failure or warning flag in view.|$|E
50|$|These {{approaches}} {{include a}} localizer approach, localizer/DME approach, localizer back course approach, and a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). In cases where an ILS is installed, a back course {{may be available}} {{in conjunction with the}} localizer. Reverse sensing occurs on the back course using standard VOR equipment. With a <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) system, reverse sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front course.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI): Pearson {{contends that}} the HSI's needle could have alerted the pilots of their course {{deviation}}. [...] He postulates that the needle of each pilot's HSI, capable of showing deviation only up to 8 nmi km, should have been [...] "pegged" [...] {{all the way to}} the side. The pilots, thus, could in theory have known that they were at least 8 nmi km off course.|$|E

The results also illustrate the potential tracking accuracy of such a display. Recommendations concerning display location and map orientation are made...|$|R
50|$|The Mk.

30|$|Finally, Eq. (6) is {{the main}} {{equation}} corresponding to the single equation approach outlined before. The explanatory variables of interest are parental education, the economic <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> and the ability score of the child.

50|$|The heading {{indicator}} (also {{known as the}} directional gyro, or DG) displays the aircraft's heading with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass. Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession, which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass. In many advanced aircraft (including almost all jet aircraft), the {{heading indicator}} {{is replaced by a}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) which provides the same heading information, but also assists with navigation.|$|E
50|$|This {{instrument}} display {{can replace}} {{a magnetic compass}} display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic Heading Indicator. The Heading Indicator can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator.</b> The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI's much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an Omni Bearing Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots.|$|E
50|$|An {{electronic}} {{flight instrument}} system (EFIS) is a flight deck instrument display system that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally {{consists of a}} primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical attitude director indicator (ADI) and <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.|$|E

50|$|A {{carrier and}} {{sideband}} (CSB), and sideband only (SBO) signal, transmitted from localizer and glidepath antennas produce a space-modulated signal {{resulting from the}} vectorial addition {{of two or more}} audio signals that vary according to position of the receiving aircraft.The difference between the two modulation depths produce an error current signal in the airborne receiver. When an aircraft follows the course line, {{the difference between the two}} frequencies is zero percent (0%).This difference is traditionally displayed by the deflection of a moving coil indicator or needle/s on an instrument known as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator,</b> HSI.|$|E
