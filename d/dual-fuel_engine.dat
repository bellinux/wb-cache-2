50|$|Conversion: A four-cylinder, 1.7-litre {{common-rail}} {{turbo diesel}} engine in dual-fuel configuration, {{based on a}} Mercedes-Benz, provides future-oriented and highly environmentally friendly propulsion. The engine runs on a mixture of natural gas and diesel fuel at a 40/60 ratio. Natural gas is a very clean-burning fuel, which consists almost entirely of methane with sulfur content near zero. However, since a diesel engine has no spark plug {{to act as an}} ignition source, operation on natural gas alone is technically impossible. The operating principle of the <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is simple: Natural gas is injected into the intake air of the engine. Just like in the production engine the diesel fuel is injected into the combustion chamber where it ignites a mixture of natural gas and air rather than just plain air.|$|E
50|$|Various {{ignition}} {{systems have}} been used, including hot-tube ignitors and spark ignition.

The CNG/diesel <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> showed equally satisfactory coordinate torque and power regardless of CNG mixing ratio. The PM emission was low at any CNG mixing ratio because of very small diesel pilot injection. In case of NOx and HC, high CNG mixing ratio showed low NOx and HC emissions at low speed. At medium & high speed, low CNG mixing ratio showed low NOx and HC emissions. Therefore, it would be optimized by controlling CNG mixing ratio...|$|E

40|$|Natural gas {{substitution}} for diesel {{can result in}} significant reduction in pollutant emissions. Based on current fuel price projections, operating costs would be lower. With a high ignition temperature and relatively low reactivity, natural gas can enable promising approaches to combustion engine design. In particular, the combination of low reactivity natural gas and high reactivity diesel may allow for optimal operation as a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine, which has potential for high eciency and low emissions. In this computational study, a lean mixture of natural gas is ignited by direct injection of diesel fuel in {{a model of the}} heavy-duty CAT 3401 diesel engine. ^ Dual-fuel combustion of natural gas-diesel (NGD) may provide a wider range of reactivity control than other dual-fuel combustion strategies such as gasoline-diesel dual fuel. Accurate and ecient combustion modeling can aid NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> control and optimization. In this study, multi-dimensional simulation was performed using a nite-volume computational code for fuel spray, combustion and emission processes. Adaptive mesh renement (AMR) and multi-zone reaction modeling enables simulation in a reasonable time. The latter approach avoids expensive kinetic calculations in every computational cell, with considerable speedup. Two approaches to combustion modeling are used within the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework. The rst approach uses direct integration of the detailed chemistry and no turbulence-chemistry interaction modeling. The model produces encouraging agreement between the simulation and experimental data. ^ For reasonable accuracy and computation cost, a minimum cell size of 0. 2 millimeters is suggested for NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> combustion. In addition, the role of dierent chemical reaction mechanism on the NGD dual-fuel combustion is considered with this model. ^ This work considers fundamental questions regarding combustion in NGD dualfuel combustion, particularly about how and where fuels react, and the dierence between combustion in the dual fuel mode and conventional diesel mode. ^ The results show that in part-load working condition main part of CH 4 cannot burn and it has significant effect in high level of HC emission in NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> The CFD results revel that homogeneous mixture of CH 4 and air is too lean and it cannot ignite in regions that any species from C 7 H 16 chemical mechanism does not exist. ^ It is shown that multi-injection of diesel fuel with an early main injection can reduce HC emission significantly in the NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> In addition, the results revel that increasing the air fuel ratio by decreasing the air amount could be a promising idea for HC emission reduction in NGD <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine,</b> too. ...|$|E

The study used a zero-dimensional multiphase mathematical model of a <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> to simulate the impact of enhancing Natural Gas (NG) with other gases on the combustion process. The model simulated the thermodynamic parameters of the gas mixture in the cylinder of a dual-fuel (NG/Diesel), turbocharged, four cylinder CRDI (Common-Rail Direct Injection) engine.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} chemical kinetics and computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) {{analysis were}} performed to evaluate the combustion of syngas derived from biomass and coke-oven solid feedstock in a micro-pilot ignited supercharged <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>engine</b> under lean conditions. The developed syngas chemical kinetics mechanism was validated by comparing ignition delay, in-cylinder pressure, temperature and laminar flame speed predictions against corresponding experimental and simulated data obtained by using {{the most commonly used}} chemical kinetics mechanisms developed by other authors. Sensitivity analysis showed that reactivity of syngas mixtures was found to be governed by H 2 and CO chemistry for hydrogen concentrations lower than 50 % and mostly by H 2 chemistry for hydrogen concentrations higher than 50 %. In the mechanism validation, particular emphasis is placed on predicting the combustion under high pressure conditions. For high hydrogen concentration in syngas under high pressure, the reactions HO 2 + HO 2 = H 2 O 2 + O 2 and H 2 O 2 + H = H 2 + HO 2 were found to play important role in in-cylinder combustion and heat production. The rate constants for H 2 O 2 + H = H 2 + HO 2 reaction showed strong sensitivity to high-pressure ignition times and has considerable uncertainty. Developed mechanism was used in CFD analysis to predict in-cylinder combustion of syngas and results were compared with experimental data.

For this analysis, a reduced syngas chemical kinetics mechanism was constructed and validated by comparing the ignition delay and laminar flame speed data with those obtained from experiments and other detail chemical kinetics mechanisms available in the literature. The reaction sensitivity analysis was conducted for ignition delay at elevated pressures {{in order to identify}} important chemical reactions that govern the combustion process. We have confirmed the statements of other authors that HO 2 +OH=H 2 O+O 2, H 2 O 2 +M=OH+OH+M and H 2 O 2 +H=H 2 +HO 2 reactions showed very high sensitivity during high-pressure ignition delay times and had considerable uncertainty. The chemical kinetics of NOx formation was analyzed for H 2 /CO/CO 2 /CH 4 syngas mixtures by using counter flow burner and premixed laminar flame speed reactor. The new mechanism showed a very good agreement with experimental measurements and accurately reproduced the effect of pressure, temperature and equivalence ratio on NOx formation. In order to identify the species important for NOx formation, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for pressures 4 bar, 10 bar and 16 bar and preheat temperature 300 K. The results show that the NOx formation is driven mostly by hydrogen based species while other species, such as N 2, CO 2 and CH 4, have also important effects on combustion.

Nevertheless, further increases of the methane share may produce significant reductions of the energy released associated to a poor combustion quality, as well as increase the likelihood of the onset of knocking. The exhaust gas recirculation is mainly characterized by reductions of the oxygen content present within the intake mass flow. It is demonstrated how EGR rates below 15 % bring notorious reductions of NOx without significantly compromising the thermal efficiency.
