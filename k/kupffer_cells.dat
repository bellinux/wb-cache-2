5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cells,</b> which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
25|$|After {{transmission}} from a mosquito, {{the viruses}} replicate in {{the lymph nodes}} and infect dendritic cells in particular.

In six other patients with similar hepatocyte dysfunction but no encephalopathy, <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> function was not significantly different from that of controls.

40|$|Although {{studies have}} shown that 17 β-estradiol (estradiol) {{normalized}} <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> function following trauma-hemorrhage, the mechanism by which E 2 maintains immune function remains unclear. Activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) initiates an inflammatory cascade, involving activation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). This leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that the salutary effects of estradiol on <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> function following trauma-hemorrhage are mediated via negative regulation of TLR 4 -dependent p 38 MAPK and NF-κB. TLR 4 mutant (C 3 H/HeJ) and wild type (C 3 H/HeOuJ) mice were subjected to trauma-hemorrhage (mean BP 35 ± 5 mmHg ~ 90 min, then resuscitation) or sham operation. Administration of estradiol following trauma-hemorrhage in wild type mice decreased <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> TLR 4 expression as well as prevented the phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and NF-κB. This was accompanied by normalization of <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> production capacities of IL- 6, TNF-α, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) - 1 α, and MIP- 2 and the decrease in plasma cytokine levels. In contrast, TLR 4 mutant mice did not exhibit the increase in <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> p 38 MAPK and NF-κB activation, cytokine production, or the increase in circulating cytokine levels following trauma-hemorrhage. No difference was observed in activation of PI 3 K among groups. These results suggest that the protective effect of estradiol on <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> function is mediated via downregulation of TLR 4 -dependent p 38 MAPK and NF-κB signaling following trauma-hemorrhage, which prevents the systemic release of cytokines...|$|R

25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants aggressive treatment. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cells</b> in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of gram negative bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{elucidate}} the submicroscopic pathological findings; of the <b>Kupffer's</b> <b>cell</b> observed to be swollen and increased in number on light microscope. In order to accomplish this purpose a small piece of the biopsied spicimens was fixed in Palade's cold buffered osmium tetraoxide and embedded in methacrylate.

Intravenonsly administration of S. F. O. was carried out in the rats injured by carbon tetrachloride injection in advance. The animals were killed 24 hours or one month after the treatment. The results are as follows: 1) Normal liver. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear menbranes of the <b>Kupffer's</b> <b>cell</b> were relatively even. The smooth and rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum were relatively poor in the development. Mitochondria and Golgi apparatus remained small in size. 2) Diabetes mellius. The <b>Kupffer's</b> <b>cell</b> was provided with numerous smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum. Increased reticular fibers often were found in the space of Disse. The fat-storing cell (Ito) having large fat vacuoles (inclusious) was observes between the liver cells and the endothelial lining. This was clearly differenciated from the <b>Kupffer's</b> <b>cell.</b> 3) Chronic viral hepatitis. The swelling of the <b>Kupffer's</b> <b>cell</b> and the endothelial lining occluded the lumen of the sinusoid. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear menbranes had irregular surfaces.

50|$|<b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> {{activation}} {{is responsible}} for early ethanol-induced liver injury, common in chronic alcoholics. Chronic alcoholism and liver injury deal with a two hit system. The second hit is characterized by an activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, receptors on the <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> that internalize endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide or LPS). This activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNFα) and production of superoxides (a pro-oxidant). TNFα will then enter the stellate cell in the liver, leading to collagen synthesis and fibrosis. Fibrosis will eventually cause cirrhosis, or loss of function of the liver.|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} acute {{inflammation}} is initiated by cells already {{present in all}} tissues, mainly resident macrophages, dendritic cells, histiocytes, <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cells,</b> and mastocytes. These cells present receptors contained on the surface or within the cell, named pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize molecules that are broadly shared by pathogens but distinguishable from host molecules, collectively referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

2500|$|Alcoholic {{hepatitis}} {{is characterized}} by the inflammation of hepatocytes. Between 10% and 35% of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis (NIAAA, 1993). [...] While development of hepatitis is not directly related to the dose of alcohol, some people seem more prone to this reaction than others. [...] This is called alcoholic steato necrosis and the inflammation appears to predispose to liver fibrosis. Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL6 and IL8) are thought to be essential in the initiation and perpetuation of liver injury by inducing apoptosis and necrosis. One possible mechanism for the increased activity of TNF-α is the increased intestinal permeability due to liver disease. This facilitates the absorption of the gut-produced endotoxin into the portal circulation. The <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cells</b> of the liver then phagocytose endotoxin, stimulating the release of TNF-α. TNF-α then triggers apoptotic pathways through the activation of caspases, resulting in cell death.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the hepatocellular transferrin receptor expression in 55 human liver specimens with secondary siderosis, with an indirect immunoperoxidase technique on frozen sections using 3 monoclonal anti-transferrin receptor antibodies. For comparison, specimens were also stained with the monoclonal antibody BK 19. 9, recognizing an antigen which is biochemically {{similar to the}} transferrin receptor, and with a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor. The degree of iron overload was estimated semi-quantitatively, taking into account hepatocellular and <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> iron deposition. In 47 out of 55 specimens hepatocellular transferrin receptor expression was present. The positivity was predominantly localized on hemosiderin-free hepatocytes. With increasing hepatocellular iron deposition, the proportion of cases with absent transferrin receptor immunoreactivity increased. This supports the previously reported disappearance of hepatocellular transferrin receptor expression in primary hemochromatosis cases with severe iron deposition. However, the transferrin receptor negative cases included four specimens in which <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> iron deposition clearly exceeded hepatocyte iron load. This finding suggests {{that in addition to}} hepatocellular iron load other factors may regulate the expression of parenchymal transferrin receptors in iron overload diseases. These may include plasma levels of various iron sources and/or <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> iron load. The iron deposition did not influence the staining of the hepatocellular epidermal growth factor receptor nor the <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> staining by the BK 19. 9 antibody.

40|$|Background & Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} protective mechanisms of cold machine perfusion in liver grafts donated after cardiac death. Methods: Pig livers exposed to 60 -min warm ischemia were cold stored for 7 h or treated after 6 -h cold storage with 1 -h hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) through the portal vein. Different physical (perfusion pressure) and chemical (oxygen, mitochondrial transition pore inhibition) parameters were analyzed during machine perfusion to dissect key steps of mechanism. Results: HOPE treatment led to a significant slowdown of mitochondrial respiration rate during 1 -h machine perfusion. After reperfusion following low pressure HOPE, mitochondrial injury, nuclear injury, <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> activation and endothelial injury were significantly improved, as tested on an isolated liver perfusion model. In contrast, machine perfusion with deoxygenated perfusate showed no protection from hepatocyte injury and <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> activation. However, endothelial injury was also prevented by low pressure machine perfusion in the absence of oxygen. Perfusion with higher pressure provoked endothelial damage and <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> activation. Conclusions: The mechanisms of protection by hypothermic machine perfusion appear to be at least twofold. First, oxygenation under hypothermic conditions protects from mitochondrial and nuclear injury by downregulation of mitochondrial activity before reperfusion. Second, cold perfusion itself, under low pressure conditions, prevents endothelial damage, independently of oxygen...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} epidemiological, biochemical, viro-logical, and histological {{factors associated with}} liver steatosis in chronic hepatitis C. Subjects: the medical histories of 53 patients biopsied for chronic hepatitis C diagnosis between June 2000 and December 2002 were retrospectively studied. Epidemiological, biochemical, and virological data were collected. Patients with hepatitis B virus or human immunodeficiency virus coinfection were excluded. Liv-er biopsy specimens were reviewed and scored by one patholo-gist. Weight and height were measured at liver biopsy time. The statistic association between qualitative and quantitative variables {{and the presence of}} liver steatosis was studied. Results: steatosis was identified in 52 % of biopsies. There was no statistic association with age, sex, method of transmission, duration of infection, alcohol consumption, other diseases, body mass index, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, or viral load. Liver steatosis was associated with serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. Genotype 3 was also associated with steatosis. Piecemeal necro-sis, hepatocellular injury, <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia, liver iron, and portal fibrosis were also associated with steatosis. A multivariate analysis showed that genotype 3, <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> hyperplasia, and liv-er iron were associated with the presence of steatosis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} effects on fat {{metabolism}} and <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> morphology by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with two different fat emulsions. DESIGN: Thirty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into three groups, were investigated. Rats fed orally were used as a reference group, {{and a group of}} rats receiving TPN with fat emulsions containing pure long-chain triglycerides (LCT) was compared to a group of rats receiving fat emulsions containing both long-chain triglycerides and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT). The TPN regimens were equicaloric and administered continuously via a jugular catheter for 10 days. INTERVENTIONS: After suffocation, blood of the rats was collected for the determination of serum lipids. Epididymal fat and heart were collected for the analysis of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activities, and liver specimens were saved for analyses of hepatic triglyceride concentration, as well as activities of hepatic lipase (HL) and lysosomal enzymes. Light and electron microscopy were used for examination of the <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> reaction. RESULTS: Directly after termination of parenteral feeding, the levels of serum triglycerides and high density lipoprotein (HDL) triglycerides were higher in the MCT/LCT group than in the LCT group, while no differences concerning cholesterol and phospholipid concentrations were found. No significant difference in liver steatosis was found between the two TPN groups. Comparison of the TPN groups showed that the MCT/ LCT group had significantly decreased LPL activity in adipose tissue, while the LCT group had significantly increased LPL activity in the heart. The activity of HL was low in both groups, but significantly lower in the LCT group. Lipid accumulation and an increased number of lysosomes were found in all <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> when TPN with LCTemulsions was used. Moreover, TPN induced a pronounced increase in various liver lysosomal enzyme activities, but there was no notable difference between LCT and MCT/LCT effects. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to treatment with pure LCTemulsions, treatment with MCT/LCT emulsions evoked weaker biochemical reactions in terms of lower activity of lipoprotein lipase in fat and heart together with higher serum and HDL triglyceride levels.

40|$|The <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> {{receptor}} for glycoproteins {{has been}} reported to have a role in clearance of galactose- and fucose-terminated glycoproteins from circulation. Although the gene and a cDNA encoding the receptor have been described, there has been little study of the receptor protein. To address some questions about possible ligands and functions for this receptor, fragments representing portions of the extracellular domain have been expressed and characterized. The extra-cellular domain consists of a trimer stabilized by an extended coiled-coil of a-helices. The receptor displays monosacchar-ide-binding characteristics similar to the hepatic asialoglyco-protein receptor, but with somewhat less selectivity. The two best monosaccharide ligands are GalNAc and galactose. a-Methyl fucoside is a particularly poor ligand. Analysis of <b>Kupffer</b> <b>cell</b> receptor binding to glycoproteins and oligosac-charides released from them reveals highest affinity for desia-lylated, complex N-linked glycans. The best glycoprotein ligands contain multiple highly branched oligosaccharides. A human ortholog of the rat receptor gene does not encode a full-length protein and is not expressed in liver.
