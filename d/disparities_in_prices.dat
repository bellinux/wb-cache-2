Only {{towards the end of}} 2000, when the key <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> were somewhat corrected, it began to acquire characteristics of economically organized production. Nevertheless, some things remained, like the existence of state premiums for milk which are an effort to bridge the differences between real production costs, on the one hand, and the very low purchasing power of the wider strata of society, on the other. The objective of this work was to review several farm models typical for our country, and to point out the best solutions for developing industrial dairy farming in our very good geographic conditions and other natural resources, and all for the purpose of introducing optimal conditions for feeding and technology with economically justified production...|$|E
40|$|Fertilizer {{policy in}} the country has evolved from {{pervasive}} interventionism in the 1970 s to today's market-oriented regime. Government has abandoned price policies and subsidies, focusing rather on standard setting, quality regulation, and training. Over the same period domestic demand for fertilizer has continually been increasing, though recently resurgent fertilizer prices have reduced total utilization. Evidence suggests that farmers are under-applying fertilizer, thereby forfeiting efficiency gains at the margin. On the supply side, imports {{have in the past}} few decades emerged, as the main source of fertilizer as domestic production has dwindled. With deregulation, numerous private sector players have taken over the distribution of fertilizers; analysis of the supply chain points to low marketing margins. Integration analysis fails to find systematic arbitrage opportunities between the domestic and world markets. Within the domestic market, however, there remain large <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> across regions. Priorities for research and policy are therefore understanding the behavior of farmers in terms of fertilizer application and addressing internal price disparities, perhaps by improved transport infrastructure and logistics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectivesTo compare {{prices of}} new drugs between France {{and the other}} EU 4. MethodsStudy used IMS MIDAS {{database}} for economic data such as prices and sales volume and LEEM database (French association of the pharmaceutical manufacturers) for the ASMR scale (HAS assessment of the drug’s added value/innovation). All the products applying {{for the first time}} for reimbursement by the French Public health insurance between January 2008 and June 2012 were included in the study (except those restricted to hospital use in France) and having an ASMR rating and an official price in June 2012. Paasche and Laspeyres price-index were calculated for drugs with: a) high ASMR, b) ASMR IV, c) ASMR V and d) all drugs. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to measure the effect of different weighting options. ResultsA total of 107 products (245 dosages) were included in this study. Fifty-one (48 %) have been found available in the community pharmacies of all the 5 countries. The availability analysis by pair of countries (France + another) is higher: 94 for Germany, 79 for UK, 71 for Spain and 69 for Italy (Italy often restricts drug’s access to hospitals only). French prices are generally equal to or lower than prices in the four other markets, which shows a relative price index decrease for France since 2008 studies. The only significant exception are UK prices for products ranked in France ASMR 1 - 2 - 3 (20 % less expensive). Prices are regularly and significantly higher in Germany than in all other countries. Interestingly, the highest <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> occur for the ones ranked as most innovative in France – while ASMR IV have surprisingly consistent prices across EU 5.

Using this index, we show that the magnitude of momentum returns for the period 1984 to 2001 is positively related to short sales constraints, and loser stocks rather than winner stocks drive this result.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{global burden}} of disease from cancer is rapidly increasing, {{especially}} in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Organization (WHO) publishes an Essential Medicines List (EML), which includes 48 medications in its “Antineoplastic and Immunosuppressives” category. The effectiveness of this list in promoting access and affordability of cancer medications in international settings should be assessed. METHODS: Medications listed on national formularies from 116 countries (mostly LMICs) were compared against cancer medications listed on the EML. Concordance between the two lists was compared with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at purchasing power parity, per capita health expenditures, the human development index, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity, and smoking prevalence. Purchase prices for cancer medications on the EML were collected and compared to one another, as well as across countries, regions, GDP, cancer incidence, formulation, generic status, medication category, and year of purchase. RESULTS: Fewer than half of cancer medications on the EML were present on most LMIC national formularies, with no country exhibiting full concordance. Concordance was positively associated with all indicators of economic development. Concordance was also positively associated with prevalence of overweight and obesity. Statistical tests found significant <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> paid for essential cancer medication across countries, regions, individual medications, generic status, and medication categories. CONCLUSION: Concordance was low in nearly all LMICs. Countries with greater economic development exhibited greater concordance. Cancer medications, on average, were much more expensive than medications in other categories, and several cancer medications exhibited median prices over $ 100 per package. On its own, the EML does not sufficiently ensure access and affordability of cancer drugs in international settings. Given that the expected prevalence of this already-pervasive disease will rapidly rise in the future, the authors propose expanding {{the mandate of the}} International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) such that it can facilitate the affordable procurement of chemotherapy by LMICs...|$|E

40|$|As {{the search}} for low carbon sources of {{electricity}} in the US continues {{it makes sense to}} consider those systems which are already providing electricity without significant CO 2 emissions. In the US there are a few states with emissions which are significantly lower than the national average, California is one such example and it has been pointed to many times {{as a model for the}} rest of the country to follow. In determining whether or not these types of changes would be possible at a national level, the differences between the US and California must be understood as well as quantifying what the changes might be. Major differences between the two include climate, generation mix and levels of consumption among others. The changes necessary entail greatly reducing electricity consumption and in addition generating much more electricity from natural gas and renewable sources while almost totally phasing out coal. 	While there would be significant reductions in CO 2 emissions and other gases associated with coal combustion by transforming the US electricity system to one like California’s, the costs and impacts of such changes make the transition unlikely. Greatly increased dependence on natural gas would lead to higher prices and the use of coal would need to be tightly controlled. On the bright side, the <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> <b>price</b> between the US and California indicates that as <b>prices</b> rise <b>in</b> the rest of the country, there may be a substantial demand response. In addition there is potential for further demand reductions by implementing the most effective efficiency programs such as decoupling and the re-investment of utility profits. There are many important lessons that can be learned from the experience in California but the path that the US takes to lower CO 2 emissions will likely be implemented differently than how it was in California...|$|R
