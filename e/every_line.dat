The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in <b>every</b> <b>line</b> to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E

25|$|Sequent {{calculus}} is, in essence, a {{style of}} formal logical argumentation where <b>every</b> <b>line</b> of a proof is a conditional tautology (called a sequent by Gerhard Gentzen) instead of an unconditional tautology. Each conditional tautology is inferred from other conditional tautologies on earlier lines in a formal argument according to rules and procedures of inference, giving a better approximation to the style of natural deduction used by mathematicians than David Hilbert's earlier style of formal logic where <b>every</b> <b>line</b> was an unconditional tautology. There may be more subtle distinctions to be made; for example, there may be non-logical axioms upon which all propositions are implicitly dependent. Then sequents signify conditional theorems in a first-order language rather than conditional tautologies.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{extensive}} {{analysis of the}} co-authorship theory is that of Brian Vickers in 2002. A strong advocate of the Peele theory, Vickers opens his preface by arguing [...] "given that collaboration was very common in Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline theatre, and that every major and most minor dramatists shared {{in the writing of}} plays, it would be highly unusual if Shakespeare had not done so." [...] As well as elaborating on the work of previous analysts such as Parrott, Timberlake, Dover Wilson, Tarlinskaja, Boyd and Jackson, Vickers devises three additional authorship tests. The first is an analysis of polysyllabic words (words of three syllables or more, excluding names), a test which has been successfully used to distinguish the work of John Webster and Thomas Dekker. Vickers shows that in Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, polysyllabic words occur <b>every</b> 2.8 <b>lines,</b> a comparable number to elsewhere in Peele. Elsewhere in Titus, however, the rate is <b>every</b> 3.3 <b>lines,</b> similar to elsewhere in Shakespeare. His second test involves counting examples of alliteration, a technique favoured by Peele throughout his career. In Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, alliteration is found at a rate of once <b>every</b> 2.7 <b>lines.</b> Elsewhere in the play, it occurs <b>every</b> 4.3 <b>lines.</b> The high rate of Act 1 corresponds to the average rate in Peele and the low rate elsewhere to the rate in Shakespeare. The third test is counting vocatives. In Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1, the rate of vocatives is once <b>every</b> 4.2 <b>lines.</b> Elsewhere it is once <b>every</b> 8.7 <b>lines.</b> As comparison, in Peele's Edward I, the rate is once <b>every</b> 4.3 <b>lines,</b> and throughout Shakespeare, it never falls below once <b>every</b> 6.3 <b>lines.</b> Again, the numbers seem to equate Peele with Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1 and Shakespeare {{with the rest of the}} play. Vickers also attempts to show that Shakespeare is much more adept at employing rhetorical devices than Peele; and gives numerous examples throughout the play of the use of antimetabole, anadiplosis, epanalepsis, epizeuxis, articulus, epanorthosis, epistrophe, aposiopesis, anaphora, polyptoton, synoeciosis, polysyndeton and asteismus. His analysis of these devices leads him to conclude [...] "whether using the same rhetorical figures as Peele had used, or deploying his own much wider thesaurus, Shakespeare distinguishes himself from his co-author by the economy, functionality and the expressive power with which he employs these traditional resources." ...|$|R
