5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the undissolved and <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> content of a tissue cannot be {{independently}} measured {{either directly or indirectly}} then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials and it will not be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model for gas exchange. He proposes a best fit double compartment model for <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
5|$|Where Ptissue {{represents}} the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> tension, Pambient, the ambient pressure and a and b two coefficients. This linear relationship between <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> and ambient pressure {{has the same}} mathematical form as an M value, which suggests that all the Haldanean models using M-values (including the US Navy tables previous to those based on the E-L model, the Bühlmann tables and all the French Navy tables), may be considered expressions of the critical volume criterion, though their authors may have argued for other interpretations.|$|E
5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E

5|$|Two {{different}} concepts {{have been}} used for decompression modelling. The first assumes that <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> is eliminated while in the dissolved phase, and that bubbles are not formed during asymptomatic decompression. The second, which is supported by experimental observation, assumes that bubbles are formed during most asymptomatic decompressions, and that gas elimination must consider both dissolved and bubble phases.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

5|$|Once dissolved, {{distribution}} of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} bulk flow of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (in this case blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues stabilizes, or saturates, at a rate that depends on solubility, diffusion rate and perfusion, all of which vary in the different tissues of the body. This process is referred to as in-gassing, and is usually modeled as an inverse exponential process.|$|E
5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas,</b> the stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low solubility in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced solubility, little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced solubility offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E

5000|$|In chemistry, sparging, {{also known}} as gas {{flushing}} in metallurgy, is a technique which involves bubbling a chemically inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon, or helium, through a liquid.

By Henry's Law, the amount of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> in a liquid depend on the partial pressure of the gases exposed to the liquid. Sparging increases the gas-liquid interface.|$|R

25|$|The partial {{pressure}} gradient is the variation of {{partial pressure}} (or more accurately, the concentration) of the solute (<b>dissolved</b> <b>gas)</b> from {{one point to}} another in the solvent. The solute molecules will randomly collide with the other molecules present, and tend over time to spread out until the distribution is statistically uniform. This has the effect that molecules will diffuse from regions of higher concentration (partial pressure) to regions of lower concentration, {{and the rate of}} diffusion is proportional to the rate of change of the concentration. Tissues in which an inert gas is more soluble will eventually develop a higher <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> content than tissues where the gas is less soluble.|$|E
25|$|Tissues may {{be assumed}} to be in series, where <b>dissolved</b> <b>gas</b> must diffuse through one tissue to reach the next, which has {{different}} solubility properties, in parallel, where diffusion {{into and out of}} each tissue is considered to be independent of the others, and as combinations of series and parallel tissues, which becomes computationally complex.|$|E

40|$|Proper {{treatment}} of boiler feed water {{is an important}} part of operating and maintaining a boiler system. As steam is produced, dissolved solids become concentrated and form deposits inside the boiler. This leads to poor heat transfer and reduces the efficiency of the boiler. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>gasses</b> such as oxygen and carbon dioxide will react with the metals in the boiler system and lead to boiler corrosion. In order to protect the boiler from these contaminates, they should be controlled or removed. There are several different technologies that are widely used in the industry for removing these contaminants. Dissolved solids can be removed with reverse osmosis membrane and ion exchange systems. <b>Dissolved</b> <b>gasses</b> have historically been removed using forced draft degasifiers, chemical agents and steam deareators Recently Membrane Contactors have been utilized to remove the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gasses</b> in boiler feed water. Membrane Contactors are widely used in the semiconductor, power, pharmaceutical and other industries to control <b>dissolved</b> <b>gasses</b> in water systems. Their use in boiler feed water degasification systems has grown steadily since the development of new industrial grade devices. Membrane Contactors are constructed using microporous hydrophobic membranes. The membrane is used to bring a gas and liquid in direct contact without mixing. Contactors operate by lowering the pressure of gas in contact with the liquid to create a driving force to remove the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gasses</b> from the water. They are highly efficient, compact and can be used inline under pressure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the first geochemical data set {{regarding}} long-term monitoring of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> in thermal waters from a seismic area. Three sites in Umbria (Central Apennines, Italy) were studied {{both for the}} chemical and for the helium isotopic composition of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases.</b> Data were collected {{during and after the}} seismic crisis that struck the region in 1997 â 1998. The chemical composition of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> revealed that a CO 2 -rich gas phase was always mixed with an atmospheric-derived component dominated by N 2. A normal faulting {{marked the beginning of the}} seismic activity enhancing the release of CO 2 on a regional scale. Variations in both the chemical and isotopic compositions of the <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> were also observed as preseismic, synseismic, and postseismic phenomena related to the seismic shock of March 1998. Those geochemical modifications were interpreted as being the consequence of a drop in the CO 2 degassing rate, in good agreement with the compressive focal mechanism of that seismic event. Furthermore, this interpretation was also consistent with the geologic and tectonic setting of the study area and induced us to postulate that changes in the local rock permeability, due to crustal deformations (i. e., coseismic deformation and postseismic release), were responsible for the geochemical modifications observed. On the basis of the foregoing, we have concluded that the geochemistry of <b>dissolved</b> <b>gases</b> in groundwaters represents a useful tool for the investigation of the relationships between circulating fluids and seismic activity...|$|R
