5000|$|Rhyzopertha is a {{monotypic}} genus of beetles in {{the family}} Bostrichidae, the false powderpost beetles. The sole species, Rhyzopertha dominica, is known commonly as the lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> American wheat weevil, Australian wheat weevil, and stored <b>grain</b> <b>borer.</b> It is a beetle found nearly worldwide as a pest of stored cereal grains. It is also a major pest of peanuts.|$|E
50|$|Its roots can {{be ground}} into a fine powder {{which is used}} to protect stored grains. Methyl {{salicylate}} is a well-known plant stress signal which often has insect repellent properties. Methyl salicylate constitutes up to 90% of the volatile component of its roots, which is very uncommon in other grains or legume seeds. A mixture of methanol extract and methyl salicylate creates a very effective natural pesticide against weevils and other insects in stored grains. Studies done on grains such as corn and cowpea indicated that after 6 days of exposure to S. longipedunculata, the mortality rate of adult beetles was 100% in an enclosed jar. In addition, when S. longipedunculata powder was applied to grains already infested with weevils, the damage done to the grains was reduced by 65%. The beetles that are most likely to infest stored grains are Sitophilus zeamais (Maize weevil), Rhyzopertha dominica (Lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer),</b> and Prostephanus truncatus (Larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer).</b> Studies suggest that the Maize weevil is able to detect the scent of methyl salicylate and tends to avoid it. It is a repellent for insects as well as a poison, which helps {{to reduce the number of}} female eggs in the grains. As this type of pesticide use is very efficient, it allows storage of the grains for at least 9 months. This discovery provides some small-scale farmers in Africa with a low cost, natural alternative to synthetic pesticides. In some developing countries, it is difficult for poor farmers to access good quality and affordable synthetic pesticides. In addition these can harm the environment if they are not properly implemented. Such indigenous practices require further validation.|$|E
40|$|The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus) {{has been}} known for many years as a pest of farm-stored maize in Central America, but since the late 1970 s it has spread widely in Africa. In 1981 it was {{identified}} as a new pest causing severe losses to farm-stored maize in the hot, dry Tabora region of Tanzania. It subsequently spread widely within Tanzania and into Southern Kenya, Burundi and recently Malawi. In West Africa, a serious outbreak of the pest was found in 1984 in Togo, and more recently it has been identified in Ghana, Benin, Guinea Conakry, Burkina Faso and Nigeria. It is believed that the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has the potential to spread to all the major maize-producing regions in Africa. The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> is also a major pest of dried cassava. Losses as high as 30 % have been recorded in some cases. Additionally, adults bore into a wide range of foodstuffs and other materials, such as wood. In heavy infestations, wooden storage structures may become damaged and act as reservoirs of infestation from which the new harvest may be attacked. Neither is the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> restricted to stores: it occurs widely in the natural environment and is dispersed by flight. A leaflet on the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has been produced by the Group for Assistance on Systems Relating to Grain After Harvest (GASGA) and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and published by CTA. It covers recognition, distribution, life history, damage, control in storage, monitoring and sensible precautions - all succinctly covered in just a few pages. The aim of the leaflet is to create awareness and to provide guidance to extension workers and other professionals concerned with the identification and control of this pest. Experience in those countries already suffering from larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> suggest that application of appropriate control and containment measures can keep food losses within acceptable bounds. leaflet on the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> has been produced by the Group for Assistance on Systems Relating to Grain After Harvest (GASGA) and the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and published by CT...|$|E

40|$|More than 55 % of Africans {{earn their}} {{livelihood}} from agriculture, {{which is also}} the key to economic development of the continent. The agriculture is largely traditional and grains constitute the bulk of food production. Sorghum, maize, rice, wheat and millet for cereals and cowpeas, dry beans, groundnut, chickpea and bambara groundnut for pulses, are most common in Africa. Because agricultural production is seasonal while the demands for agricultural commodities are more evenly spread throughout the year, grain storage becomes a particularly important agricultural activity. Grain storage is done on-farm, peasant farmers’ residences (family granaries), community stores and large warehouses. Since most of the grains produced in Africa are destined for human consumption, storage in family granaries predominates. Unfortunately, the technology and management of family granaries and other storage structures are seriously wanting. These predispose the grains to serious attacks from biotic constraints such as insects, rodents, birds and micro-organisms. The rate of insect proliferation in these storage structures could be alarmingly high, especially with the warm climate in tropical Africa. Annual grain losses of up to 50 % in cereals and 100 % in pulses have been reported, although average losses stand at roughly 20 %. Major insects that attack cereals and pulses include <b>grain</b> weevils, <b>grain</b> <b>borers,</b> <b>grain</b> beetles and grain moths. Pest prevention, early detection and pest control would greatly reduce grain losses during storage. Control methods comprise physical, chemical and phytochemical measures with emphasis on the use of traditional botanical pesticides. This paper discusses the major cereals and pulses stored in Africa, the different storage structures, storage losses, constraints, control measures, and the relationship between storage structures and pest infestation. It also attempts to highlight peculiarities to the African storage environment and research trends over the years, and suggests recommendations for improving grain storage in the continent...|$|R

Tests with Calliodis showed that although it reduced borer population eventually, it was ineffective until populations were high and damage to the grain had already been done. T. nigrescens on the other hand showed that it was well adapted to its host, its population keeping in step wit-in that of the borer. The beetle can also survive for some time without food, should the borer population be reduced, and will not attack other insects such as bees or silkworms.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{laboratory}} {{roller mill}} system was modified {{to measure and}} analyze the electrical conductance of wheat as it was crushed. The electrical conductance of normal wheat kernels is normally low and fairly constant. In contrast, the electrical conductance of wheat kernels infested with live insects is substantially higher, {{depending on the size}} of the larvae and the resulting contact of the crushed larvae between the rolls. This instrument was designed to detect internal insect infestations in wheat that has a moisture content of 13. 5 % or less. The laboratory mill can test a kilogram (kg) of wheat in less than 2 min and 100 g in less than 10 s. Hard red winter and soft red winter wheat containing larvae of rice weevils and lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borers</b> of a variety of sizes were tested. On average, the instrument detected 8. 3 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat containing the larger sized insects (fourth instar or pupae). Kernels infested with medium‐sized larvae (second or third instar) were detected at an average rate of 7. 4 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat. Finally, kernels infested with the small‐sized larvae (first or second instar) were detected at a rate of 5. 9 out of 10 infested kernels per 100 g of wheat. Under reasonable grain moisture contents there were no false positive errors, or noninfested kernels classified as insect infested.

40|$|The {{selection}} of grain-hosts {{by the larger}} <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> Prostephanus truncatus was investigated in environments containing both uninfested maize grains and grains previously infested by the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais. The grain-host selection preference of P. truncatus {{was reflected in the}} number of adults in each type of grain and the number of damaged grains. Results showed that P. truncatus individuals were significantly more attracted to uninfested grains than to infested grains. Several densities (according to egg density) of S. zeamais infested maize grains mixed together with uninfested grains were exposed to P. truncatus. The larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> damaged significantly more uninfested grains relative to infested ones. Infested grains seemed to have a deterrent effect on the larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer.</b> We hypothesised that this behaviour was due to larval activity and to deterrent substances deposited on maize by adults of the maize weevil. To verify the first hypothesis, adults of P. truncatus were placed with uninfested grains and infested grains bearing immature stages of S. zeamais. Results showed that the infested grains were preferentially damaged during the first two weeks, while three and four weeks after infestation with S. zeamais the uninfested grains were more damaged by P. truncatus. These observations indicated a close relationship between the development of S. zeamais larvae inside maize grains and the {{selection of}} grain-host by 19 truncatus.

40|$|Mycotoxins are toxic compounds, {{produced}} by fungi and {{recognized as the}} main cause of chronic intoxications in the world. Maize is one of the crops subjected to the most critical mycotoxin problems throughout the world. Limitations set by the European Commission and by other nations of the world on the maximum levels of mycotoxins in cereal grain have had an important socio-economic impact on the global cereal market. As a consequence, producing maize grain with acceptable mycotoxin content and simultaneously maintaining profitability has become more and more difficult, with important socio-economic consequences. Mycotoxin contamination in maize grain {{is the result of a}} complex plant pathosystem (a system defined by parasitism and in which a plant is the host) formed by maize plants, toxigenic fungi and insect borers. Fungi development and mycotoxin synthesis is influenced by climatic conditions and by the fungi competitive relationships, which determine their prevalent geographical distribution. As a consequence, warming of the climate system could have an important impact on the pathosystem and the potential effects are very difficult to foresee. The modelling of mycotoxin contamination in maize grain during the field phase represents a great opportunity for maize producers, policy makers, and for scientists, to manage the mycotoxin problem in maize and to study the pathosystem and the effects of climate change. The project MIMYCS (Maize Infection and MYcotoxin Contamination Simulator) have started in 2010 and aims at the development of a simulation model system to simulate the complex pathosystem which leads to mycotoxin contamination in maize grain. The project aims at providing a first operational tool to simulate at EU scale mycotoxin contamination in maize grain in different climatic, environmental and agro-management situations. In this context, the development of MIMYCS will allow an easy re-use of it for performing simulations (i) to inform European policy makers involved in food and feed safety of the effects of European mycotoxin policies and help them to fix safe and, at the same time, feasible contamination limits, (ii) to assess about climate change scenario effects on the pathosystem and on future maize-based food and feed products safety, (iii) to assist maize producers in controlling mycotoxin contamination through agro-management and improving maize grain safety. The MIMYCS model has been implemented as a component of the framework BioMA ([URL] the modelling platform used at the European Commission Joint Research Centre. MIMYCS has been developed as composed by three main model components: MIMYCS. Maize, MIMYCS. Borers, MIMYCS. Fungi. MIMYCS. Maize simulates maize phenological development and it implements the impact of the insect borer damage to the ears, fungi infection and mycotoxin accumulation in maize <b>grain.</b> MIMYCS. <b>Borers</b> simulate two maize borers (Ostrinia nubilalis and Sesamia nonagrioides) development and feeding activity which produces the damage to the ear, enhancing fungi growth and development. MIMYCS. Fungi simulates fungi development and their interactions, using information received from Maize and the Borers modules.

The global sorghum areas remained static as the increased area in Africa compensated the area loss in Asia. In spite of rapid decline in sorghum area in Asia due to competition from other remunerative crops, sorghum grain production levels have not declined at the same rate owing to adoption of high yielding hybrids. Though impressive gains have been made in improving productivity levels, biotic and abiotic challenges such as shoot fly, stem <b>borer,</b> <b>grain</b> molds, and terminal drought stress continue to haunt the sorghum growers across the world.

40|$|Sorghum is {{the fifth}} most {{important}} cereal crop in the world. It is largely grown on marginal soils with residual moisture where other major cereals cannot be grown due to inadequate water. Sorghum is a multipurpose crop and the species shows great diversity. For {{a large part of}} Asia and Africa, sorghum’s grain is used as food and its stalk as fodder and feed. In rest of the world, sorghum is considered as forage crop and also as stock for ethanol production. Sorghum yield has been substantially increased through conventional breeding in India. However, resistance to abiotic stresses and biotic stresses such as shoot fly, stem <b>borer,</b> <b>grain</b> mold, and charcoal rot is limited due to inadequate genetic resources that can be readily used in crop improvement programs. Therefore, genetic engineering technology can assist the production of agronomically desirable crops that exhibit increased resistance to pests, pathogens, and environmental stress and enhancement of nutritional qualities. Sorghum research has received less attention compared to other cereals for adoption of modern molecular tools, and very few laboratories in the world are addressing sorghum crop improvement programs through novel methods.

Storing as a community can often be cheaper than storing as an individual, and as Mr Joseph Banda, a farmer from Coma in the Southern Province of Zambia explains, seed banking can strengthen the local community?s harvest. In the following interview, Mr Banda talks to Christopher Kakunta. He passes on this advice. In the interview, ?open-pollinated varieties? or OPV?s are mentioned. These are varieties of plants which can are pollinated by insects or bees, rather than by themselves. IN:		?When you go to some shops? OUT:		?even during the rainy season. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Christopher Kakunta talking to Mr Joseph Banda, a farmer in the Southern Province of Zambia, {{about the need for}} local communities to preserve and use seed banks. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Banda	When you go to some shops you could find that there are no seeds. So we thought maybe {{with the help of the}} Ministry of Agriculture and staff, we can plant the OPVs, open pollinated varieties, and keep them. We make a seed bank so that when we require the seed we plant there and then. Kakunta	But for the sake of our discussion maybe let us narrow down to maize. What is the process of actually coming up with a seed bank? Banda	The process is like that. You grow maize in a garden maybe in a wetland or in a field, let me just talk about the obatampa that we have. Kakunta	What is obatampa? Banda	It is an open-pollinated variety. Kakunta	It is a maize variety? Banda	It is a maize variety, yes. Kakunta	Wonderful. Banda	In-between plants, it is 30 centimetres, then between the rows is 90 centimetres. Kakunta	So after you have planted what do you do? Banda	We irrigate using treadle pumps. Kakunta	When the crop has finally grown up, are there steps that you need to take to ensure that the seed is of high quality? Banda	Yes. Kakunta	What are these steps? Banda	After planting the seed inspector comes. When the seed inspector comes he inspects the field, after inspecting the field even at cobbing level, the inspector as well comes, when the cobs are formed, even before harvesting the inspector comes so that at least he looks at the seed and how it has performed, and then he advises on how do we separate the seeds. So that is done as well. Kakunta	So that is grading now. Banda	Yes. Kakunta	Once you have graded your seed what next? Banda	After we have graded the maize, that is after we get the seed from the cob then we add a certain chemical so that at least we prevent it from being attacked from the weevils, the stalk <b>borers,</b> the large <b>grain</b> <b>borers</b> and the like. Kakunta	So once you have done that is this a time now you are able to take the seed to the community bank? Banda	Yes that is when we take it to the community bank and? Kakunta	Keep it for the future? Banda	Yes. Then after growing the seed people within the village or around the villages come to buy that seed at a reduced price, so we are able to market our seed as well as planting in our own fields. Kakunta	Now tell me how it is to manage a seed bank? Because we are talking about 30 people how do you manage it? Banda	We rotate, we have a management committee that is taking care of the same. So from there the management committee is able to determine the price of the seed with the help of MARCO, so we are able to look at the people within ourselves either to exchange it with the chicken or any other means to buy the seed so that at least they are able to get the seed at the right time that they want it. Kakunta	So the seed bank is actually used as an income-generating activity at the same time to help the individual members within the group? Banda	Yes it is working within that line. Kakunta	Now in terms of sharing this seed, is there any mechanism that you use? Banda	Yes for those that are growing the seed at least they are getting a benefit. One, the knowledge that they are getting from the growing of that seed; secondly the money that we get after selling the seed is shared depending on how much one puts in as a farmer. Kakunta	You mentioned that you are about 30 in your group. Are they women as well? Banda	Yes it is gender-sensitive: we involve youth, men and women. Kakunta	From your own experience since you started this particular project what are some of the lessons that you have learned in terms of community seed banks? Banda	When you do not have the seed, you can use the seed bank, the seed that is there in the seed bank and plant. And besides you do not waste a lot of money in buying that seed because you can buy it at a negotiable price that the committee can decide there and then. And the other thing is within the locality that you stay in you can get the seed without wasting money. Kakunta	Is this a viable project? Is it something that you would encourage other farmers, other communities to get involved in, in terms of formation of farmer groups that are involved in seed banks? Banda	I would encourage everyone, those that are organised to come and learn maybe from us or any other MARCO staff so that least this is really helping our community especially because this time we are even thinking of going commercial just because of the seed banks that we have at our centre. Kakunta	You have actually been talking about involvement of MARCO, for the sake of our listeners, MARCO is the ministry of Agriculture and Co-operatives. Do you think training is very important from the Ministry or from agricultural experts for you to manage seed banks properly? Banda	Yes because those are the people that have the know-how, so in order for you to prosper and work well you should really use the officers or extension officers that are there, in order to get the guidance and the knowledge that you require as a farmer. Kakunta	As we come to the end of this interview Mr Banda, could you tell me some of the key issues that you would want to share with the listeners in terms of seed banks, community seed banks? Banda	Key issues that I can just advise or share with my fellow farmers is the benefit is there. At least let us all form groups that are viable, it is very important to have a seed bank around, whether you are 10, 20 or 30 that can really help as an income- generating activity, then as seed you can just get it within your locality or within the area that you are coming from. Kakunta	Earlier on we talked about the Southern Province being prone to drought and farmers at the end of the day having no seed, so during the times of the drought for instance, do you go back to the seed banks? Banda	That is the real benefit that we have because even if those that we plant during the rainy season do not do well, the seed that we reserved during the dry season can be found even during the rainy season. End of track. Can community seed banks benefit your community...|$|R
40|$|Development of maize, Zea mays L., {{germplasm}} {{resistant to}} the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner) and Fusarium fungal pests has been in progress {{for more than three}} decades as a worldwide cooperative effort. Some of the host plant resistance to the European corn borer and Fusarium has been attributed to the phytochemical product 6 -methoxybenzoxazolinone. However, it has been shown that seasonal weather impacts concurrently on maize development, corn borer and Fusarium phenology. It was hypothesized that some of the maize resistance to both pests depended directly on climatological conditions. In the United States, genotype selection for first generation borer resistance is achieved during June infestations using leaf feeding assessment. In Canada, first selection began at the silk stage of plant development in July. The second genotype selection is conducted at grain harvest in October by plant dissections. The larval population, number of tunnels and tunnel length in the first 30 cm of the stalk above the soil surface were used to differentiate genotype susceptibility to corn <b>borers.</b> <b>Grain</b> moisture was directly correlated with genotype resistance to corn borer. Fungi encountered comprised Fusarium moniliforme, F. graminearum, F. sporotrichioides, F. oxysporum, F. avenaceum, and F. equiseti. Two species, F. moniliforme and F. equiseti, were recovered throughout the season. These fungi were first recovered from pollen caught in the leaf collar sheath. As the leaf sheath of maize is relaxed with plant development, the Fusarium contaminated soil and the pollen run down past the ligule by wind, rain splash, and insect movement to settle within the sheath cavity. Undamage pith samples (by the <b>borer)</b> taken at <b>grain</b> harvest showed sporadic tissue contamination by Fusarium. Oppositely, as the corn borer larvae migrated downward on the plant, they drilled the collar sheath, the stalk rind and dug galleries in the stalk to feed on the pith tissue to complete their development. Consequently, the larvae and borer tunnels were repeatedly contaminated with Fusarium. It was shown that pith tissues were initially colonized by primary fungi such as F. equiseti which initiate pith breakdown; then these fungi were overgrown by more competitive species such as F. moniliforme or F. sporotrichioides. Correlation of the stalk rot incidence to genotype maturity and the stalk rot incidence to grain moisture were both negative and significant; indicating that physiological activity during October protected the stalk against fungi infection. It was hypothesized that genotype maturity based on the heat unit rating (given by companies) or grain moisture at harvest (indicator of genotype maturity) were the two common factors related to Fusarium stalk rot resistance.

Experimental treatments were: 1) control 04. 0 % moisture), 2) lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (LGB) (14 % moisture with initial infestation of 4. 5 adults/lb of grain) and 3) fungal (Fungal) (15. 5 % moisture). Control grain was used to formulate a 17 % crude protein diet. The remaining dietary treatments were formulated by replacing the control grain with the two damaged grains on a weight basis. Forty-five female Yorkshire and 12 crossbred male pigs, with an average initial weight of 22 lb were used in growth (35 days) and metabolism studies, respectively. Results indicated similar average daily gains and digestibilities for {{the two types of}} damaged grain when compared with the control. Pigs fed the diet containing the insect-damaged grain showed an 18 % poorer feed conversion rate and a 21 % higher average daily feed consumption during the 14 to 35 -day interval.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in the central region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan comprising seven districts: Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Kohat and Hangu, during 2010. The objective was to analyze the perceived effect of Farmer Field School (FFS) approach on farmers ’ capacity in controlling pre- and post-harvest losses. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data collected from 280 randomly selected farmer respondents. The analysis revealed that FFS had remarkably built up farmers ’ capacity in controlling pre and post-harvest losses caused by rodents, birds, immature harvesting/picking, and inappropriate packing, storing, and transportation of the produce. Furthermore, FFS helped farmers in reducing losses at the market and controlling <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> wheat weevil, and store weevils effectively. The study concluded that the highest improvement as a result of FFS activities was in controlling losses by rodents, proper packaging and labeling of the produce, and controlling some stored grain pests like <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> and wheat weevil. By and large, farmers ’ capacity was built up in almost all aspects of controlling pre- and post-harvest losses, except a few i. e. losses due to immature harvesting of crops, and controlling losses caused by store insects, which needed special focus of the authorities concerned...|$|E
40|$|The {{maize weevil}} (Sitophilus zeamais) and larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (Prostephanus truncatus) are economically-important postharvest insect pests that cause severe losses in stored grain. The use of host-plant {{resistance}} {{is the most}} effective and benign way of overcoming storage-pest damage. The objectives of this study were to estimate heritability and to identify maize inbred lines with dual resistance to weevil and larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> (LGB). One hundred and twenty (120) inbred lines were evaluated in the field for adaptation and tested in the laboratory for resistance to the LGB and weevil. Insect-damage parameters namely grain damage, weight loss, flour weight and number of insects, were measured. Heritability, genotypic and phenotypic variances for the damage traits were determined. Genotype stability for insect pest resistance was determined based on genotypic variance and coefficient of variation (CVi) for each genotype. There were significant differences (P< 0. 001) among the lines for all the traits measured. Heritability values were high (ranging from 0. 7 - 0. 9) in all the traits, and the genotypic variance was higher (ranging from 0. 012 - 0. 04) than the environmental variances (0. 007 - 0. 033) for all the traits. Dual resistance and stability were observed in CKSPL 10028, CKSPL 10035, CKSPL 10088, CKSPL 10021, CKSPL 10042, CKSPL 10295 and CKSPL 10112...|$|E
40|$|Many insects show {{a greater}} {{attraction}} to multimodal cues, e. g. odour and colour combined, than to either cue alone. Despite {{the potential to}} apply the knowledge to improve control strategies, studies of multiple stimuli have not been undertaken for stored product pest insects. We tested orientation towards a food odour (crushed white maize) in combination with a colour cue (coloured paper with different surface spectral reflectance properties) in three storage pest beetle species, using motion tracking to monitor their behaviour. While the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch.), showed attraction to both odour and colour stimuli, particularly to both cues in combination, this was not observed in the bostrichid pests Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer)</b> or Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (larger <b>grain</b> <b>borer).</b> The yellow stimulus was particularly attractive to S. zeamais, and control experiments showed that this was neither {{a result of the}} insects moving towards darker-coloured areas of the arena, nor their being repelled by optical brighteners in white paper. Visual stimuli {{may play a role in}} location of host material by S. zeamais, and can be used to inform trap design for the control or monitoring of maize weevils. The lack of visual responses by the two grain borers is likely to relate to their different host-seeking behaviours and ecological background, which should be taken into account when devising control methods...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Temperature {{profiles}} {{and insect}} populations were compared in wheat {{that had been}} aerated with low airflow rates during the summer in addition to two autumn aeration cycles, versus wheat aerated in autumn only or unaerated wheat. Tests were conducted in 2000 - 2001, 2001 - 2002, and 2002 - 2003, and data were analyzed separately for each year. Grain mass temperature profiles at depths of 0. 9 and 1. 8 m from the surface in the grain mass showed distinct declines in temperature for each aeration cycle {{during the first two}} years of the study, however, summer aeration did not result in as large of temperature declines in 2002 - 2003, partly because the summer aerated bin was loaded with warmer grain. The effectiveness of summer aeration was estimated using confined insect populations in tube cages placed on the surface of the grain and by sampling the grain for natural insect populations using pitfall probe traps. At the conclusion of the summer aeration cycle, the number of lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer,</b> Rhyzopertha dominica (Fabricius), red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) in the tube cages were consistently lower in bins that had not been aerated during the summer. Pitfall trap catch of rusty grain beetles, Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens), hairy fungus beetle, Typhaea stercorea (L.), foreign grain beetle, Ahasverus advena (Walt), and lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> was consistently lower in bins with summer aeration, indicating a reduction in natural insect populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The wheat {{industry}} {{is in need}} of an automated, economical, and rapid means of detecting whole wheat kernels with internal insect infestation. The feasibility of the Perten Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) to detect internal insect infestations was studied. The SKCS monitors compression force and electrical conductance as individual kernels are crushed. Samples of hard red winter (HRW) wheat and soft red winter (SRW) wheat infested with rice weevil [Sitophilus oryzae (L.) ] and lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer</b> [Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) ] were run through the SKCS and the conductance/force signals saved for post-run processing. Algorithms were developed to detect kernels with live internal insects, kernels with dead internal insects, and kernels from which insects have emerged. The conductance signal was used to detect live infestations and the force signal for dead and emerged infestations. Live insect detection rates were 24. 5 % for small-sized larvae, 62. 2 % for medium-sized larvae, 87. 5 % for large-sized larvae, and 88. 4 % for pupae. The predicted, and observed, false positive (sound kernels classified as infested) rate was 0. 01 %. Dead insect detection rates were 60. 7 % for large-sized larvae, 65. 1 % for pupae, and 72. 6 % for kernels where the insect emerged. The false positive rate of the dead insect detection algorithm ranged from 0. 2 % for SRW to 0. 5 % for HRW. In all cases, insect detection rates were higher for rice weevil than lesser <b>grain</b> <b>borer.</b> The classification algorithms were robust {{for a wide range of}} moisture contents...|$|E

Adults of the above species were exposed on wheat (or maize in the case of P. truncatus) treated with thiamethoxam at 0. 1, 1, and 10 ppm for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 40, 72, and 96 h. After each of these intervals, mortality was recorded (immediate mortality) and the surviving individuals were transferred in untreated wheat (or maize), where mortality was recorded again 7 d later (delayed mortality). During both immediate and delayed mortality counts, the number of adults that were knocked down was also recorded. Immediate mortality was low in all exposures, with the exception of the highest dose rate and after 72 - 96 h. At these conditions, during this interval, most of the surviving individuals were knocked down. Delayed mortality was further increased with the increase of dose and the initial exposure, but knockdown was extremely low, with the exception of P. truncatus. The results of the present work show that O. surinamensis was the least susceptible species, while P. truncatus was the most susceptible. These findings show that, despite the increased mortality, recovery after short exposures is likely for all species tested here. In this regard, partially treated areas on which the insects are exposed only for short intervals may reduce thiamethoxam efficacy...|$|E
