25|$|On 6 December 1978, Embraer {{was officially}} awarded a {{contract}} to produce two prototypes and two airframes for <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> The specifications were concluded in February 1979, and the main differences from the EMB-311 were the more powerful PT6A-25C engine, raised rear cockpit, {{and the addition of}} ejection seats. Eventually, the original specifications underwent a major modification, including a smaller fuselage with an upright cruciform tail instead of a swept-back tail; a more domed canopy; extended elevators; greater distance between the nosewheel and back wheel; reduction of the wing root; and an increased wingspan, tailplane, and landing gear. By late 1979, a full-scale mock-up was built with a cockpit for the evaluation of flight instruments, and a subscale, radio-controlled research model was designed to evaluate the free-flight characteristics before building a full-scale prototype.|$|E
500|$|When A-10 {{full rate}} {{production}} was first authorized the planned service life was 6,000 hours. A small reinforcement {{to the design}} was quickly adopted when the A-10 failed initial fatigue testing at 80% of testing; with the fix, the A-10 passed the <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests.</b> 8,000 flight hour service lives were becoming common at the time, so fatigue testing of the A-10 continued with a new 8,000 hour target. Fatigue testing for the new target quickly discovered serious cracks at Wing Station 23 (WS23) where the outboard portions of the wings are joined to the fuselage. The first production change was to add cold working at WS23 to address this problem. [...] Soon after that, the Air Force determined that the real world A-10 fleet fatigue was more harsh than estimated forcing them to change their fatigue testing, introducing [...] "spectrum 3" [...] equivalent flight hour testing.|$|E

The fatigue {{performance}} {{study of}} high-strength engineering machinery steel {{is of great}} significance, as they often bear the reciprocating cycle load, which prone to fatigue fracture damage. Recently, the requirement of <b>fatigue</b> <b>test</b> of kinds of high grade steel is increasing rapidly.

For {{reducing}} the development time and cost, determining the load of accelerated contact <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> of a multi-case and multi-stage drive train, multilevel design load method {{was used to}} calculate the pitting equivalent loads of gears according to the load spectrum. A reasonable load of pitting <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> was determined after analyzing and studying the pitting equivalent loads of gears. Based on a reducer used for a cement mixer, the pitting equivalent loads of gears were calculated, and the load of pitting <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> was determined.

5000|$|An initial {{attempt to}} solve the blade {{fracture}} problem by increasing {{the breadth of the}} blade roots from 7 to 14 mm was unsuccessful. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> and stress analysis by the CSIR showed that both sizes of blades failed due to fatigue at the sharp fillets {{as a result of the}} repeated changes in the centrifugal load due to variations in the turbine rotational speed. The solution was arrived at when it was realised that none of the single [...] "lock" [...] blades, which were supported by two conical pins, of any rotor had ever failed. When such conical pins were also introduced between all the other blades in the rotors, <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> showed that this made them considerably stronger. Some time later it was found that welding the blades onto the rotor edge proved to be a good cheaper alternative. The design was eventually amended with the redesigned exhaust fan being manufactured from manganese steel and the problem was solved.|$|E

50|$|Through many experiments, it {{has been}} found that {{characteristics}} of a material can change as a result of LCF. Fracture ductility tends to decrease, with the magnitude depending on the presence of small cracks to begin with. To perform these tests, an electro-hydraulic servo-controlled testing machine was generally used, as it is capable of not changing the stress amplitude. It was also discovered that performing low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> on specimens with holes already drilled in them were more susceptible to crack propagation, and hence a greater decrease in fracture ductility.
