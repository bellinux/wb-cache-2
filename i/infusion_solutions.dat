50|$|The {{cornerstone}} of treatment is administration of free water {{to correct the}} relative water deficit. Water can be replaced orally or intravenously. Water alone cannot be administered intravenously (because of osmolarity issue), but rather can be given with addition to dextrose or saline <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions.</b> However, overly rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially very dangerous. The body (in particular the brain) adapts to the higher sodium concentration. Rapidly lowering the sodium concentration with free water, once this adaptation has occurred, causes water to flow into brain cells and causes them to swell. This can lead to cerebral edema, potentially resulting in seizures, permanent brain damage, or death. Therefore, significant hypernatremia should be treated carefully by a physician or other medical professional with experience in treatment of electrolyte imbalance, specific treatment like ACE inhibitors in heart failure and corticosteroids in nephropathy also can be used.|$|E

The problem of improving the technology of <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> assigned in stationary conditions, including combined drugs of individual manufacture is especially acute. The aim of this work was to study and analyze the options for the extemporaneous manufacture of combined drugs for infusion introduction in hospital pharmacies. Materials and methods. The methodological basis {{of the study was}} a systemic approach, which makes it possible to identify the key elements of two different options for the extemporaneous manufacture of combined drugs for infusion administration. The research uses methods of logical and functional analyses. Results and discussion. The analysis of scientific sources on the issues of manufacturing of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> for the needs of stationary patients showed that manufacturing is carried out according to the traditional scheme for the Russian Federation, i. e. in the conditions of the procedural room of the department. In pharmacies of medical organizations, two variants of small-scale extemporal manufacture of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> are permissible using pharmaceutical substances and using sterile drugs of industrial production. The presence of a number of critical points of the first variant shows the irrationality and limitations of the use of such a scheme for the manufacture of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> in the pharmacy of a medical organization. The second version of the extemporal manufacture of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> is characterized by the simplicity of the technological scheme, the absence of complex calculations, a number of preparatory operations, filtration and sterilization steps, a simplified version of quality control, and the lack of complex equipment. This allows the rapid and large-scale production of various combinations of drugs for infusion. Conclusion. Manufacturing intravenous admixtures from commercial medicines allows the rapid and large production of various combinations of drugs for infusion introduction, does not contradict the current legislation, which makes it possible to consider it as the main variant of manufacturing of combined <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> in hospital pharmacies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Hemodynamic {{optimization}} by goal-directed {{application of}} intravenous infusions represents {{a cornerstone of}} maintaining intraoperative homeostasis to reduce postoperative complications. The aim of this work was to develop an outcome-based, clinically applicable and internationally consented hemodynamic algorithm. Based on a systematic literature search the following hemodynamic goals were defined: 1) optimization of stroke volume according to the Frank-Starling principle by intravenous infusion, 2) maintenance of mean arterial pressure by vasopressors and 3) avoidance of cardiac low-output states below 2. 5 ml/min/m² by positive inotropes. The developed algorithm represents the basis for comparing different types of <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> and hemodynamic monitoring systems within a standardized treatment algorithm in clinical situations. The comparison of an unbalanced crystalloid with a balanced crystalloid-colloid infusion solution in medium risk surgery within a goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm revealed that unbalanced in contrast to balanced <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> were associated with a decrease of standard base excess and an increase of plasmatic chloride levels. Since {{there were no differences}} in the administered amount of <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> or in the hemodynamic stability between the study groups, the change of base excess and plasmatic chloride levels were not considered to be based on differences in tissue perfusion, but as a direct effect of unbalanced <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> on the acid-base metabolism. The comparison of a balanced crystalloid and a balanced colloid infusion solution in high-risk surgery within a goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm revealed that the colloid infusion solution was associated with an improved hemodynamic stability and with less transfusion of fresh frozen plasma units. The difference of the amount of infusion solution as the primary outcome measure could only be shown in the later course during high-risk surgery, suggesting that the differences of crystalloid and colloid <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> could be estimated context-sensitive. The hemodynamic monitoring systems to optimize stroke volume were compared within the goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm regarding their ability to track hemodynamic changes as the basis for an optimal therapy. The comparison showed that the oesophageal doppler and a pulse-contour method were not interchangeable in tracking hemodynamic changes and that the hemodynamic algorithms validated for the oesophageal doppler should be adapted for the use with other monitoring systems. A goal-directed hemodynamic algorithm adapted for the special needs of different types of surgery was examined in a study of patients undergoing liver resections. A preload optimization of stroke volume according to the Frank-Starling principle in liver surgery would lead to massive bleeding due to the venous back current out of the right ventricle. By adaption of the algorithm we were able to ensure maintainance of cardiocirculatory flow without increasing the incidence of massive bleeding in the liver resection area with less infusion. Despite positive effects of the goal-directed hemodynamic therapy patients still suffer high postoperative complication rates according to the surgical risk. Investigations of the microvascular reactivity showed pathological changes at the tissue level which were associated to postoperative organ dysfunction and hospital length of stay. Future studies should aim to further examine the changes of microvascular reactivity as well as the venous part of the circulation to develop new treatment options by optimizing these circulation parameters leading to a further reduction of postoperative complications...|$|E

40|$|HSA {{preparations}} for i. v. use are administered in critically ill patients. Although increasing intravascular osmotic pressure {{seems to be}} a pathophysiologically orientated treatment, clinical trials do not indicate a benefit for mortality in HSA-treated patients. Instead, there is evidence for inflammatory reactions upon infusion of different HSA batches. A neglected issue concerning the safety and quality of these therapeutics is processing-related post-transcriptional protein modifications, such as AGEs. We therefore tested the hypothesis that commercially available <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> contain AGEs and studied whether these protein modifications influence outcome and inflammation in a murine model of sepsis induced by CLP. Screening of different HSA and Ig preparations in this study revealed an up to approximate tenfold difference in the amount of AGE modifications. Application of clinically relevant concentrations of CML-modified HSA in CLP led to increased inflammation and enhanced mortality in wild-type mice but not in mice lacking the RAGE. Lethality was paralleled by increased activation of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, NF-κB-dependent gene expression, and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the peritoneal cavity. This study implies that <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> containing a high load of the AGE-modified protein have the potential to activate RAGE/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory reactions, causing increased mortality in experimental peritonitis...|$|E

Objective: The physical and chemical stability of a new 1 -vial formulation of docetaxel (Taxotere® 1 -vial, sanofiaventis, Dagenham, UK) in {{a large number of}} <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> was studied following refrigerated storage. Methods: Taxotere® 1 -vial <b>infusion</b> <b>solutions</b> were prepared by adding 200 mg of docetaxel, using a single introduction of 10 mL docetaxel concentrate (20 mg/mL), into 250 mL polyethylene bags filled with 0. 9 % saline. Infusion bags were stored under refrigeration at 5 °C and removed after either two (n = 60 bags) or seven (n = 60 bags) days. The infusion bags were assessed immediately upon removal and then again at various time intervals, up to a maximum of 24 hours, following storage at ambient temperature (about 20 °C). Physical stability, determined by crystallisation, was assessed by careful visual examination. The same solution from several of the infusion bags used to assess physical stability was used to assess chemical stability, and this was performed using HPLC to determine the docetaxel content and {{the presence or absence of}} degradation impurities. Results: No visible crystallisation was observed in any of the Taxotere® 1 -vial infusion bags following refrigerated storage for either two or seven days and subsequent storage for 24 hours at approximately 20 °C.

In the current study we sought to elucidate why combining these particular drugs is such a popular choice among party-drug users. This was investigated through characterisation of the possible interactive effects of MDMA on METH intravenous self-administration. The first experiment involved characterisation of the METH dose–response curve for intravenous self-administration. Male Hooded–Wistar rats were trained to self-administer intravenous METH (0. 01 – 0. 3 mg/kg/infusion) and an inverted-U dose–response curve was obtained. In Experiment 2, a second squad of rats self-administered 0. 01, 0. 03 or 0. 1 mg/kg/infusion METH and had small amounts of MDMA (0. 001 – 0. 03 mg/kg) then introduced into the <b>infusion</b> <b>solution.</b> Addition of MDMA to the METH <b>infusion</b> <b>solution</b> resulted in a dose independent reduction in responding. In Experiment 3, a third squad of rats was treated 20 min pre-session with an intraperitoneal injection of saline, 1. 25 or 2. 5 mg/kg of MDMA or METH to evaluate whether the reduction in responding evident in Experiment 2 was due to an MDMA-induced decrease in locomotor activity.

Lacosamide is a novel anticonvulsant drug that is available as <b>infusion</b> <b>solution.</b> We describe seven patients with focal SE who were treated with intravenous Lacosamide. All patients in our case series were unsuccessfully treated with other antiepileptic drugs before Lacosamide i. v. was added. In all cases, SE was terminated within 24 h after Lacosamide. There were no serious side effects or adverse events attributable to Lacosamide i. v. Our data suggest that Lacosamide might be an effective add-on treatment, if standard drugs fail or are unsuitable...|$|R

This corresponds to what Marik et al. described when using carotid artery Doppler ultrasound to assess hemodynamically unstable patients (Marik et al. 2013). In that study, a passive leg raising (PLR) maneuver, {{used as a}} temporary and reversible volume loading, induced an 80  % increase in carotid blood flow. Interestingly, similar to our observation, the simultaneously assessed diameter of the CCA likewise increased in that study. However, according to the formula “flow rate = ¼ × π × diameter 2  × velocity”, an, e.g., 20  % increase in diameter contributes to more than the half {{of the increase in}} carotid blood flow (Nocke et al. 2014).|$|R
