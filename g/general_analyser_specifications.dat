We propose to develop <b>Specification</b> <b>Analyser</b> that accepts <b>specification</b> like statement coverage, code coverage for the generation of efficient test cases from test suite. The <b>Specification</b> <b>Analyser</b> compares the information about the techniques like Precision, Efficiency, Inclusiveness and Generality. The Fault detection capability tool provides the minimized size of test suite which satisfies the above criteria. By reducing the test suite size, we can reduce the execution cost and time, validation and management of the test cases from the suite for future releases of the software and able to maintain the fault detection capability by reusing the refined test cases. The prioritization method will increase time-effectiveness in detecting the faults. An improved rate of fault detection can provide faster feedback of the system under test...|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} front-end {{research for}} a low-cost spectrum analyser. Requirement of the front-end are derived and a topology study is performed, both from an analogue as a digital perspective. Simulations {{are carried out}} to confirm the findings. This master project was initiated by Bruco B. V., and deals with a feasibility study of a low-cost spectrum analyser front-end. Market research shows a demand for low-cost spectrum analysis for various applications, where moderate specifications compared to commercial available spectrum analysers can be acceptable. The aim is to design a spectrum analyser system with a maximum degree of integration, since this provides large cost-savings and a competitive product. The project {{is divided into two}} parts; the analysis and design of an analogue spectrum analyser front-end, and the analysis from a digital perspective. For the analogue part, typical spectum <b>analyser</b> <b>specifications</b> are examined and relations and trade-offs between them are derived. This results in a balanced set of requirements. Receiver system architectures are explored and a spectrum analyser frontend design is presented. The design consists of a frequency conversion, frequency selection and a measurement sub-block. These are further discussed and their effect on the achievable performance is estimated. For the digital part, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the use of digital processing for spectrum analysis are researched. A design is proposed that combines the best of both worlds; the performance of the analogue front-end and the flexibility of digital signal processing. The design is simulated, using MATLAB for the analogue part, while using a specialised reconfigurable architecture for the digital part; the Montium Tile Processor...|$|R

The model {{is based on}} an extension to factor analysis where the low dimensional subspace is modelled with a mixture of Gaussians hidden Markov model (HMM) and the observation noise by a Gaussian mixture model. Here the HMM output vectors are the latent variables of a <b>general</b> factor <b>analyser.</b> The model combines shared factor analysis with a dynamic version of independent factor analysis. This factor analysed HMM (FAHMM) provides an alternative, compact, model to handle intra-frame correlation. Furthermore, it allows variable dimension subspaces to be explored.

Keywords: Morphology, incomplete lexicon, text-to-speech systems Background When a text-to-speech synthesis system is used, {{it is likely that}} the text being processed will contain a few words which do not appear in the lexicon as entries in their own right. If the lexicon consists only of whole-word entries, then the method for producing a pronunciation for such "unknown" words is simply to pass them through a set of letter-to-sound rules followed by word stress assignment rules and vowel reduction rules. The resulting pronunciation may well be inaccurate, particularly in English (which often shows a poor relationship between spelling and pronunciation). In addition, t [...] ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{introduces}} a numerical scheme to simulate water impact on rigid structures, {{in which the}} air-water two phase flow is solved using the pressure-based Computational Fluid Dynamics method. This method is implemented using an in-house code, the <b>General</b> Transport Equation <b>Analyser,</b> which is an unstructured grid finite volume solver. The performance of the PC is greatly developed, so as expected the network can provide great computational capability. Based on this point, we developed a data structure system and parallel code. Two simple test cases have been done with the program and reasonable results were obtained. The air cushion has a great effect on the peak pressure of the impact process, while the impulse is almost constant with different air densities. Air density also influences the free surface distribution, which causes different flow characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Astrée is a {{parametric}} Abstract Interpretation based static analyser {{that aims}} at proving {{the absence of}} RTE (Run-Time Errors) in control programs written in C. Such properties are clearly safety properties since the behaviour of a C program is undefined after a RTE. When it analyses a program of the class {{for which it is}} specialised, Astrée is far more precise than <b>general</b> purpose static <b>analysers.</b> Nevertheless, for safety and industrial reasons, the small number of false alarms first produced by the tool must be reduced down to zero by a new fine tuned analysis. Through the description of experiments made on real programs, the paper shows how Abstract Interpretation based static analysis will contribute to the safety of avionics programs and how a user from industry can achieve the false alarm reduction process via a dedicated method.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{the problem of}} analyses of message content as one of making specific inferences from recorded text to characteristics of a source that are not directly observable. The problem is common {{to a variety of}} analytical situations in the humanities and in the social sciences; and the way adequate solutions are found therefore deserves systematic attention. Choices among investigative techniques always imply assumptions regarding the structure of a source. In message analysis, investigative methods crucially affect the conceivable relations between the recorded text and the content if presumable conveys to the analyst. While there is no appropriate theory of these (basically semantic) relations to which the notion of 2 ̆ 2 message 2 ̆ 2 refers, it seems that three classes of analytical constructs of basic models of messages account for much of current investigative efforts. This paper examines the nature and limitations of these models which are as follows: Association models of message are identified by their use of statistical correlations as a logical basis for content inferences from text. Whether correlations are demonstrated or postulated, such models assume that content indicators permeate throughout a text, that the text is not purposively intended and that syntactic constructions and their possible referentiality can be ignored. While preferred by many content analysts, association models provide the weakest basis for content inferences. Discourse models take linguistic references as the primary basis for inferences from text. Requisite analytical procedures are not statistical but essentially algebaical and incoporate psychological or social constructs of the semantic domain of a discourse. Discourse models are incapable of handling instrumental uses of language. 2 ̆ 2 Communication models of messages 2 ̆ 2 refers to a class of analytical procedures that go beyond linguistic references and/or associations by considering the behavioral constraints that the exchange of messages may impose on a system of interacting communicators. Recorded texts then take the form of chronologies of exchanges and communication models render such chronologies informative about the parameters of an interaction system including the relations among the communicators and their mutual control. While communication models are the most interesting, least is known about them. This paper therefore elaborates only on some of their formal prerequisites. Association models empoly familiar behavioral science methods and therefore provide so serious obstacles for their possible computerization. Algorithms for discourse models presuppose a considerable thoretical work, particularly in linguistics and semantics, and it is already evident that no 2 ̆ 2 <b>general</b> discourse <b>analyser</b> 2 ̆ 2 can be constructed. So far attempts to computerize communication models of messages have been limited to the most reduced situations. Further, although such models are potentially most powerful very little can be expected from current computational technology. The paper finally suggests that efforts should be directed toward formalizations of content inference processes if analytical success is to be improved...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} that the 2 ̆ 7 ultrasonic scattering layers 2 ̆ 7 give significant effects not only upon the biological workings {{in the formation of}} fishing ground but upon the planning, researching and using of the various underwater acoustic instruments - those which are concerned with navigation, fisheries and investigations; including oceanic life, oceanophysics, submarine resources, and so on. Owing the fact that the researches of the ultrasonic scattering layers have been performed by the oceanographically advanced countries, a greatnumber of information have been obtained, concerning both biological and physiological issues. However, about such important issues as ① the relationship between the ultrasonic scattering layers and the fisheries, ② composition organisms in the layers, ③ ultrasonic scattering characteristics, and so on, no accurate information have been obtained, yet. Accordingly, with the intention of clarifying the oceanic state as it is, the author carried outsome investigations on the Kagoshima bay where no existence of the ultrasonic scattering layers having diurnal vertical migration had been confirmed, yet. Firstly, some information about the ultrasonic scattering layers were obtained by means of the 50 kHz fish finder - in other words, a number of records were fixed continuously, day and night, on board the Training ship Nansei maru belonging to the Faculty of Fisheries, Kagoshima University, at both the innermost, and the middle, areas of the Kagoshima bay, in the respective seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter. Both vertical and horizontaltowings were carried out by the closing plankton net and the Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl net for the purpose of ascertaining the composition organisms of each layer. On the other hand, for the elucidation of the ultrasonic scattering characteristics, the scattering strengths of the respectivelayers were measured, and, in order to ascertain the physical features in the ocean, the vertical distributions of the water temperature from the sea surface to the sea bottom were observed by DBT (digital bathythermo graph); with the performed confirmation of the submarine illumination by an under water illuminometer. ""The number of the ultrasonic layers having diurnal vertical migration was fixed to be 2 ̆ 7 three 2 ̆ 7, being unvaried through the whole year, both at the innermost and the middle, areas of the Kagoshima bay. Occasionally, only 2 ̆ 7 two 2 ̆ 7 layers were recorded during the period from autumn to winter. Although more or less complicated phases were noted in the vertical migrations of therespective layers, in the outlined patterns, a close resemblance was noted. It was ascertained that there was a close relationship between the cause of the vertical migration, the depth where the respective layers were situated, and the degree of the submarine illumination. The optimum submarine illumination was fixed as in the following : the 1 st layer, 10 ^[- 7] lux 10 ^[- 9] lux; the 2 nd layer, 10 ^[- 4] lux 10 ^[- 7] lux, and in case of the 3 rd layer, 10 ^[0] lux 10 ^[- 2] lux. No directrelationship was noted between the vertical distribution of water temperatures and the cause ofvertical migration; however, the depth of the ultrasonic scattering layer showing no verticalmigration agreed quite well with the depth of thermocline. The mean value of the maximumvelosity of the vertical migration at each layer was as follows : the 1 st layer 2. 5 m/min., the 2 nd layer 2. 0 m/min., and the 3 rd layer 0. 8 m/min. respectively. The mean value of thescattering strength of each layer was as follows : the 1 st layer, - 39. 1 dB, the 2 nd layer, - 34. 7 dB and the 3 rd layer, - 36. 0 dB. The composition organisms of each layer were as follows: the 1 st layer, Pollichthys maulli, Maurolicus japonicus, Lophogaster japonicus; the 2 nd layer,Bemthosema pterotu, and the 3 rd layer, Pilchard.
