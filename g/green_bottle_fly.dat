25|$|The common <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>fly</b> (Lucilia sericata) is a blow fly {{found in}} most areas of the world, and the most {{well-known}} of the numerous <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>fly</b> species. It is 10–14mm long, slightly larger than a house fly, and has brilliant, metallic, blue-green or golden coloration with black markings. It has short, sparse black bristles (setae) and three cross-grooves on the thorax. The wings are clear with light brown veins, and the legs and antennae are black. The maggots (larvae) of the fly are used for maggot therapy.|$|E
25|$|Myiasis often {{occurs in}} wild, and {{domestic}} animals. In particular, rabbits, pigs, dogs and sheep can be victims of “blowfly strike” {{because of the}} urine or fecal matter stuck to their fur, fleece, or hind quarters through neglect, poor captivity and living conditions, or ill-health. “Blowfly strike” is a well-recognized and economically damaging problem primarily seen in sheep. “Blowfly strike” is estimated to cost the Australian sheep industry at least $161 million annually. 9 of the 10 cases submitted by the British Columbia Veterinary Medical Association stated that the insects colonizing most animals were the metallic Blue-Green Blow Fly (Lucilia illustris, Meigen) or the <b>Green</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>Fly</b> (Phaenicia sericata, Meigen). In the one case, the larvae of botfly (Cuterebra jellison, Curran) colonized a pet rabbit. Lucilia illustris and Phaenicia sericata are common and ubiquitous blow fly species that are frequently reported in forensic cases involving human homicide and wildlife crime.|$|E
25|$|Insects are {{valuable}} as forensic indicators {{in cases of}} abuse and neglect. Some insects, such as the <b>Green</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>Fly,</b> (Lucilia sericata (Meigen)), are drawn to odors, such as ammonia, resulting from urine or fecal contamination. Adult green bottle flies tend to be attracted to an incontinent individual who lacks the voluntary control of excretory functions. Such examples include a baby who has not had its diapers changed often or an incontinent elderly person {{who has not been}} helped in maintaining routine bodily hygiene. Flies lay their eggs in and around clothing and skin which, if left undiscovered, will hatch into maggots (larvae) which begin feeding upon flesh, open wounds, ulcers, and any natural bodily entry point. Over time, the flesh will be eaten away, and the region may be further infected by bacteria or invaded by other insects. This is known as myiasis.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, yellowthroats, <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>flies,</b> beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|R
25|$|Lucilia mexicana is {{a species}} of <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> blow <b>fly</b> of the family Calliphoridae. Its habitat range extends from southwestern North America to Brazil. L. mexicana is {{typically}} 6–9mm in length with metallic blue-green coloring. This species is very similar in appearance to L. coeruleiviridis, the primary difference being that L. mexicana has two or more complete rows of post-ocular setae. L. mexicana {{has the potential to}} be forensically important in the stored-products and medicocriminal fields, but more research is needed for the fly to be used as evidence in criminal investigations.|$|R
500|$|Later, {{the head}} of another guard, Fornier, is found inside a paint can. An {{examination}} of the head shows the premature appearance of larvae. The prison coroner tells Scully that the first guard's lungs were completely infested with the larvae, belonging to the <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>fly.</b> Meanwhile, Mulder talks to Roque, who wants a transfer out of the prison in exchange for revealing the remaining three people on the list. Brodeur later finds Fornier's headless body in his office. While searching Neech's cell, Mulder discovers evidence of his obsession with reincarnation. Scully, of course, is skeptical. They later talk to Neech's fearful widow, Danielle Manley (April Grace), who is secretly seeing Parmelly. Roque is brought to the showers, where he is beaten to death by Brodeur after revealing he is the fifth person on the list.|$|E

[...] Her foot, which she had wrapped in a plastic bag, was infected with Lucilia sericata (<b>Green</b> <b>Bottle</b> <b>Fly)</b> larvae. [...] The woman did not clean her toilet and had placed clothing in it, which encouraged flies. [...] The post mortem interval was estimated to be about two days. [...] The maggots were estimated to be about 4 days old. [...] It was found that the maggots had been feeding on her foot for a week while she was still alive.|$|E

50|$|Like all <b>green</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>flies</b> in its family, the Lucilia coeruleiviridis {{adult is}} a {{metallic}} blue-green bodied fly. The facial region is white with large red compound eyes. There are also bristles present {{as well as}} plumose aristae. The thorax also contains bristles, {{all of which are}} evenly paired. Just behind the head, the anterior spiracle is black in color, as is the thoracic posterior spiracle. The meron, just below the wing, is bristled. The veination of the wing is “incomplete” in that it does not reach the wing edge. The basicosta of the wing, or the “shoulder” area, is yellow in coloration, and the calypters—the scale-like structures just below the wing base— are white and of unequal size. The legs of the adult are usually brown to black in color. Like most flies, it also has tarsal pulvilli, or soft pads, {{at the end of each}} foot used to “stick” to surfaces, that are slightly yellow in color. As with all insects, coloration is very important in identification of a species, as well as the presence of bristles. Sometimes, the presence of a pair of bristles on the thoracic plate is the only way to identify one species from another.|$|R
