Their functioning is based on a principle much akin to that of a fountain pen in that fluids are actuated by capillarity. Once a voltage is applied, an electrospray is formed at the nib tip. The nib fabrication relies on micromachining techniques using the epoxy-based negative photoresist SU- 8 and a double exposure photolithographic process. Two types of nib-like sources were fabricated; they were made either conductive by metallization with a nickel layer or non-conductive but hydrophilic by covering them with a SiO 2 layer. In the latter case, the HV was applied via a Pt wire inserted into the reservoir feature of the nib.

A GIS is working by fingerprinting the <b>ionization</b> breakdown <b>voltage</b> of unknown gases which displays good selectivity even in the very low gas pressure. In GIS, electron impact ionization mechanism leads to the breakdown of gas inside an ionization cell. Since breakdown voltage (V b) is a unique quantity of each gas, by measuring this voltage, the existence and type of the unknown gases can be found. To fabricate the GIS, vertically aligned arrays of AgNWs were employed. The AgNWs were synthesized by template-assisted electroplating method. To obtain freestanding metals nanowires without any bundling, Anodized Alumina Oxide (AAO) template with well ordered pore morphology was required. The AAO templates were fabricated using the modified two steps anodization process. By applying various anodization conditions, AAO templates with interpore distance varying from 40 nm to 150 nm were fabricated. Besides, the dependency of the interpore distance and applied voltage in the AAO was confirmed.

40|$|Rydberg atoms have {{attracted}} considerable interest {{due to their}} huge interaction among {{each other and with}} external fields. They demonstrate characteristic scaling laws in dependence on the principal quantum number n for features such as the magnetic field for level crossing. While bearing striking similarities to Rydberg atoms, fundamentally new insights may be obtained for Rydberg excitons, as the crystal environment gives easy optical access to many states within an exciton multiplet. Here we study experimentally and theoretically the scaling of several characteristic parameters of Rydberg excitons with n. From absorption spectra in magnetic field we find for the first crossing of levels with adjacent principal quantum numbers a B_r ∝ n^- 4 dependence of the resonance field strength, B_r, due to the dominant paramagnetic term unlike in the atomic case where the diamagnetic contribution is decisive. By contrast, in electric field we find scaling laws just like for Rydberg atoms. The resonance electric field strength scales as E_r ∝ n^- 5. We observe anticrossings of the states belonging to multiplets with different principal quantum numbers. The energy splittings at the avoided crossings scale as n^- 4 which we relate to the crystal specific deviation of the exciton Hamiltonian from the hydrogen model. We observe the exciton polarizability in the electric field to scale as n^ 7. In magnetic field the crossover field strength from a hydrogen-like exciton to a magnetoexciton dominated by electron and hole Landau level quantization scales as n^- 3.

40|$|Electron impact {{ionization}} (ElI) is used extensively in mass spectrometry for gas-phase analytes. Due to the {{significant amount of}} fragmentation generated by ElI, the spectrum is usually very noisy. In addition, the thermionic emission electron source used in ElI has a slow response time and consumes large amount of power. To address these two issues, double-gated vertically aligned carbon nanofiber (VACNF) field emission and field ionization arrays have been developed. These arrays were characterized as field ionizers, which could produce molecular ions without severe fragmentation; and as field emitters, which act as an electron source with a fast response time and consume less power than using thermionic emission. Self-aligned double-gated isolated VACNF arrays, which were fabricated using a photoresist-based planarization process, are reported. These arrays were designed such that the tip electric field is maximized and the shielding effect from the neighboring tips is minimized while the device is capable of handling large voltages during field emission and field ionization. Two types of arrays were fabricated: (1) CNFs with tips in-plane with the gate and (2) CNFs with tips 0. 9 tm below the gate. (cont.) These arrays were characterized as a field emitter and a low field emission turn-on voltage of 24 V is reported.

30|$|The samples {{used for}} the {{quantification}} of intracellular metabolites {{were obtained from the}} 5  L bioreactor during the exponential growth phase. The extraction process has been introduced above. To accurately determine the metabolites concentration, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method (Wu et al. 2005) was used. Extracted metabolites were resuspended in 1  mL deionized water, and 200  µL of 13 C-labeled intracellular metabolites were added as internal standards. The uniformly 13 C-labeled metabolites were extracted from the P. pastoris biomass cultivated in a fed-batch fermentation using uniformly 13 C-labeled glucose as sole substrate. The obtained labeled cell extract contained the whole yeast metabolome. After internal standards added, samples were injected into a liquid chromatography (Waters Acquity T 3 column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) with dimensions 150  mm ×  2.1  mm ×  1.8  mm was used for organic acids and sugar phosphates, ACQUITY UPLCR BEH Amide (Waters) 1.7  μm ×  2.1  ×  100  mm for nucleosides, Xselect™ HSS T 3 1.8  μm ×  2.1  ×  100  mm Column for amino acids) coupled to a Thermo TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with electrospray <b>ionization.</b> The spray <b>voltage,</b> vaporizer temperature, sheath gas pressure, ion sweep gas pressure, aux gas pressure, capillary temperature used in the detection of amino acids were + 3500  V, 300  °C, 15, 0, 10  psi, and 300  °C, respectively. The parameters for organic acids, nucleosides, and sugar phosphate detection were − 3000  V, 200  °C, 15, 0, 10  psi, and 200  °C, respectively.|$|R
