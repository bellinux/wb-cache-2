He is the first person to discover Sei's true sex and he is her main confidant on matters relating to it. He had wanted her {{to go back to a}} normal girl's life after she had <b>gotten</b> <b>her</b> revenge because of the brutality of the life of a samurai. After the Ikedaya Affair, he admits he has affections for Sei as if she were his own kin. Over a year after those events he realizes he is in love with her. When he was 17, a woman he rejected attempted suicide in front of him and Okita came to the conclusion that falling in love was not worth such pain, and he has kept his distance from women ever since. Another hindrance to romance is that he has dedicated his life to the path of the samurai and has vowed to himself that he will never marry. The character is based on the historical figure of Okita Sōji.|$|E

500|$|Wood {{rested his}} case {{on behalf of}} the plaintiff; McNamara offered no {{evidence}} but again moved to dismiss, which Humphrey denied. The judge told the all-male jury that if the LIRR employees [...] "omitted to do the things which prudent and careful trainmen do for the safety of those who are boarding their trains, as well as the safety of those who are standing upon the platform waiting for other trains, and that the failure resulted in the plaintiff's injury, then the defendant would be liable." [...] The jury was out for two hours and 35 minutes, including the lunch hour, and they awarded Palsgraf $6,000 ($ today). Pursuant to statute, she also recovered costs of $142, an amount added to the verdict. A motion for a new trial was denied on May 27, 1927 by Justice Humphrey, who did not issue a written opinion, and a judgment was entered on the verdict on May 31, from which the LIRR appealed on June 14. Once Palsgraf had <b>gotten</b> <b>her</b> jury verdict, the Gerhardts also sued the railroad, with Wood as their counsel.|$|E

She desperately wanted the role of Roy Scheider's wife in Jaws, and urged her husband to give it to her. Zanuck asked director Steven Spielberg if he would consider Harrison, but Spielberg preferred actress Lorraine Gary, whom he had seen in a TV movie, The Marcus Nelson Murders, and cast her instead of Harrison [...] "because she was right for the part." [...] Harrison was upset over Spielberg's preference for Gary, feeling that her husband should have <b>gotten</b> <b>her</b> the part. [...] "I really wanted Dick to go to bat for me this one time." [...] As a consolation, Universal chief Sid Sheinberg, Lorraine Gary's husband, got Harrison a part in Airport 1975 as Gloria Swanson's personal assistant, Winnie. Though the movie starred Harrison's long-time idol, Charlton Heston, Harrison had no scenes with him, and [...] "would have much rather had Jaws on my resume."

As this precedence {{is supposed to}} be regulated by propinquity to the defunct, the undertaker, however skilful a master of these lugubrious ceremonies, did not escape giving some offence. To be related to Mrs. Bertram was to be of kin to the lands of Singleside, and was a propinquity of which each relative present at that moment was particularly jealous. Some murmurs there were on the occasion, and our friend Dinmont gave more open offence, being unable either to repress his discontent or to utter it in the key properly modulated to the solemnity. 'I think ye might hae at least gi'en me a leg o' her to carry,' he exclaimed, in a voice considerably louder than propriety admitted.

He trailed that wagon-train to the next camp, where on the busy road he lost the wheel-tracks. Next day he rode horseback all the way in to Benton. But all his hunting and questioning availed nothing. Gloom, heartsickness, and despair surged in upon him, but he did not think of giving up. He remembered all Allie had told him. Those fiends had <b>gotten</b> <b>her</b> again. He believed now all that she had said; and there was something of hope in the thought that if Durade had found her again she would at least not be at the mercy of ruffians like Fresno. But this was a forlorn hope. Still, it upheld Neale and determined him to seek her during the time in which his work did not occupy him.|$|E

"But I {{have been}} {{surprised}} with such a denial that no woman in such circumstances ever gave to a man; for certainly it was never known that any woman refused to marry a man that had first lain with her, much less a man that had <b>gotten</b> <b>her</b> with child. But you go upon different notions from all the world, and though you reason upon it so strongly that a man knows hardly what to answer, yet I must own {{there is something in}} it shocking to nature, and something very unkind to yourself. But, above all, it is unkind to the child that is yet unborn, who, if we marry, will come into the world with advantage enough, but if not, is ruined before it is born; must bear the eternal reproach of what it is not guilty of; must be branded from its cradle with a mark of infamy, be loaded with the crimes and follies of its parents, and suffer for sins that it never committed. This I take to be very hard, and, indeed, cruel to the poor infant not yet born, who you cannot think of with any patience, if you have the common affection of a mother, and not do that for it which should at once place it on a level {{with the rest of the}} world, and not leave it to curse its parents for what also we ought to be ashamed of.
