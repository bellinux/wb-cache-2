A half-height expansion bay could take either a 5¼-inch floppy disk drive or a QIC-type cartridge tape drive, capacity 30 MB, 45 MB, or 60 MB depending on cartridge. For printer access, the system came with a serial port as standard; a serial/parallel expansion card could provide a parallel printer port if this was required.|$|R

50|$|A {{manufactured}} home, once assembled, {{goes through}} a ‘settling-in’ period, where the home will settle into its location. During this period, some drywall cracking may appear, and any <b>incorrectly</b> <b>installed</b> appliances, wiring <b>or</b> plumbing should be repaired, hopefully under warranty.

The secondary repair team must be scheduled, and may not be available immediately for most repairs. Just because a manufactured home has been assembled does not mean it is immediately habitable; appropriate ventilation, heating, plumbing, and electrical systems must be installed by a set-up crew, otherwise, the buyer must wait for the manufacturer repair team or do it themselves.|$|R
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a union representing employees at an elementary school {{because of concerns about}} possible exposure to mold in the school building. In 2014, some elementary school employees went on medical leave reportedly because of illness from mold exposure after receiving results from fungal immunoglobulin G (IgG) blood tests and urine mycotoxin tests. Knowledge of these results prompted over 20 additional school employees to have their blood tested for IgG to fungi. Some of these employees and their physicians interpreted their blood test results as meaning they had high levels of mold in their bodies. Other employees had recurring upper respiratory and sinus infections and throat and eye irritation that they attributed to their work environment. During our evaluation, we (1) checked for moisture, water damage, and mold inside the building and in the crawl spaces beneath the building, (2) evaluated the ventilation systems, (3) measured carbon dioxide, temperature, and relative humidity, and (4) asked employees about their work, medical history, and work-related health concerns. We found no moisture, signs of water damage, or mold in the school or crawl spaces, except for three classrooms with minor mold growth. Some classroom unit ventilators did not work, had <b>incorrectly</b> <b>installed</b> <b>or</b> missing air filters, or were blocked. Carbon dioxide levels were high in some classrooms. Our employee interviews and review of medical records found symptoms often associated with damp buildings or inadequate ventilation but that are common in the general population. We found no evidence that problems such as neuropathy, thrush, and cancer were related to the school. Lacking an explanation for all symptoms led some employees to seek answers from unvalidated medical tests. To address indoor environmental quality concerns, we recommended the school (1) stop environmental sampling and blood testing for molds and urine testing for mycotoxins; (2) hire a licensed professional mechanical engineer to assess the ventilation systems; (3) encourage employees to report water leaks or water damage; and (4) create a system for employees to report building concerns and to receive feedback on how issues were resolved. We recommended employees report work-related health concerns and see an occupational medicine physician about health problems they think may be work related.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our approach}} to the quantitative modeling and analysis of highly (re) configurable systems, such as software product lines. Different combinations of the optional features of such a system give rise to combinatorially many individual system variants. We use a formal modeling language {{that allows us to}} model systems with probabilistic behavior, possibly subject to quantitative feature constraints, and able to dynamically <b>install,</b> remove <b>or</b> <b>replace</b> features. More precisely, our models are defined in the probabilistic feature-oriented language QFLan, a rich domain specific language (DSL) for systems with variability defined in terms of features. QFLan specifications are automatically encoded in terms of a process algebra whose operational behavior interacts with a store of constraints, and hence allows to separate system configuration from system behavior. The resulting probabilistic configurations and behavior converge seamlessly in a semantics based on discrete-time Markov chains, thus enabling quantitative analysis. Our analysis is based on statistical model checking techniques, which allow us to scale to larger models with respect to precise probabilistic analysis techniques. The analyses we can conduct range from the likelihood of specific behavior to the expected average cost, in terms of feature attributes, of specific system variants. Our approach is supported by a novel Eclipse-based tool which includes state-of-the-art DSL utilities for QFLan based on the Xtext framework as well as analysis plug-ins to seamlessly run statistical model checking analyses. We provide a number of case studies that have driven and validated the development of our framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{technical}} evaluation of fish passage conditions {{is becoming an}} integral part of projects to <b>install</b> new <b>or</b> <b>replace</b> existing hydroelectric turbine units. In the design phase, these evaluations depend on laboratory and computational modeling techniques that simulate prototype conditions. For instance, laboratory experiments with beads have yielded observational data on collision occurrence and frequency in turbine physical models. On the computational model side, simulations have been used to assess hydraulic conditions hazardous to fish passage such as rapid decompression, extreme shear flow, and likelihood of collision on turbine runner blades. The present work expands on the previous modeling studies of biological performance assessment at projects in the Columbia River Basin, in the U. S. Pacific Northwest. The preceding studies have laid the groundwork for the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in biological assessment of turbine passage. This presentation describes continued work by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (funded by US Department of Energy) to improve its biological performance assessment (BioPA) software and to test the model against field observations. Specifically, two model enhancements will be discussed: (1) the generation of multiple passage pathways through the turbine to account for turbulent dispersion in BioPA, and (2) the implementation of overset (moving) mesh simulations to better account for the actual motion of fish and autonomous sensor devices. We incorporated these recent developments into the BioPA for an existing Kaplan turbine unit installed at the Ice Harbor Dam on the Snake River. Autonomous sensor devices were used in past field studies to evaluate the hydraulic conditions when the unit operated at three discharges. We calculate and compare statistics from both the field data and BioPA modeling results to assess the accuracy of the simulation model and its assumptions. Specifically, we compare signatures of absolute pressure and probability of collision with the runner blades...|$|R
40|$|Most {{accidents}} {{that happen}} in stationary battery locations occur when batteries are being delivered, <b>installed,</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>or</b> removed. Handling batteries in dedicated battery rooms, equipment rooms, data centers and remote sites has never been easy. The same old handling equipment {{seems to have been}} around for ages and some that is being used is not really suitable for the job. It is the author’s experience that things are getting more difficult as batteries are increasingly being deployed in non-traditional locations. Some battery units (modules), particularly Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid (VRLA), are getting heavier and are being squeezed into tighter and less accessible spaces. Increasingly, untrained and unqualified personnel are being used for battery work and consequently, safer handling methods are required. This paper examines the current battery handling techniques and problems including transporting, moving and positioning batteries. Codes are examined to determine what is applicable. The lack of specific codes and standards is also highlighted and discussed. The paper offers possible and realistic solutions.

40|$|Within the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has {{a vision}} of a future with clean, abundant, reliable, and {{affordable}} energy. Within EERE, the Industrial Technologies Program (ITP), formerly the Office of Industrial Technologies, works in partnership with industry to increase energy efficiency, improve environmental performance, and boost productivity. The BestPractices (BP) Program, within ITP, works directly with industries to encourage energy efficiency. The purpose of the BP Program is to improve energy utilization and management practices in the industrial sector. The program targets distinct technology areas, including pumps, process heating, steam, compressed air, motors, and insulation. This targeting is accomplished with a variety of delivery channels, such as computer software, printed publications, Internet-based resources, technical training, technical assessments, and other technical assistance. A team of program evaluators from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was tasked to evaluate the fiscal year 2002 (FY 02) energy savings of the program. The ORNL assessment enumerates levels of program activity for technology areas across delivery channels. In addition, several mechanisms that target multiple technology areas [...] e. g., Plant-wide Assessments (PWAs), the ''Energy Matters'' newsletter, and special events [...] are also evaluated for their impacts. When possible, the assessment relies on published reports and the Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) database for estimates of energy savings that result from particular actions. Data were also provided by ORNL, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Project Performance Corporation (PPC), the ITP Clearinghouse at Washington State University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Energetics Inc., and the Industrial Technologies Program Office. The estimated energy savings in FY 02 resulting from activities of the BP Program are almost 81. 9 trillion Btu (0. 0819 Quad), which is about 0. 25 % of the 32. 5 Quads of energy consumed during FY 02 by the industrial sector in the United States. The technology area with the largest estimated savings is steam, with 32 % of the total energy savings. The delivery mechanism with the largest savings is that of software systems distribution, encompassing 44 % of the total savings. Training results in an energy savings of 33 %. Energy savings from PWAs and PWA replications equal 10 %. Sources of overestimation of energy savings might derive from (1) a possible overlap of energy savings resulting from separate events (delivery channels) occurring in conjunction with one another (e. g., a training event and CTA at the same plant), and (2) a possible issue {{with the use of the}} average CTA value to assess savings for training and software distribution. Any overestimation attributable to these sources probably is outweighed by underestimations caused by the exclusion of savings resulting from general awareness workshops, data not submitted to the ITP Tracking Database, omission of savings attributable to web downloads of publications, use of BP products by participants over multiple years, and the continued utilization of equipment <b>installed</b> <b>or</b> <b>replaced</b> in previous years. Next steps in improving these energy savings estimates include continuing to enhance the design of the ITP Tracking Database and to improve reporting of program activities for the distribution of products and services; obtaining more detailed information on implementation rates and savings estimates for software training, tools, and assessments; continuing attempts to quantify savings based on Qualified Specialist activities; defining a methodology for assessing savings based on web downloads of publications; establishing a protocol for evaluating savings from other BP-sponsored events and activities; and continuing to refine the estimation methodology and reduction factors...|$|R

40|$|Following Title VII 2 ̆ 7 s enactment, group-based {{employment}} discrimination actions flourished due to disparate {{impact theory}} and the class action device. Courts recognized that subordination that defined a group 2 ̆ 7 s social identity was also sufficient legally to bind members together, even when relief had to be issued individually. Woven through these cases was a notion of panethnicity that united inherently unrelated groups into a common identity, for example, Asian Americans. Stringent judicial interpretation subsequently eroded both legal frameworks {{and it has become}} increasingly difficult to assert collective employment actions, even against discriminatory practices affecting an entire group. This deconstruction has immensely disadvantaged persons with disabilities. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), individual employee claims to accommodate specific impairments, such as whether to <b>install</b> ramps <b>or</b> <b>replace</b> computer screens, have all but eclipsed a coherent theory of disability based disparate impact law. Moreover, the class action device has been virtually nonexistent in disability discrimination employment cases. The absence of collective action has been especially harmful because the realm of the workplace is precisely where group-based remedies are needed most. Specifically, a crucial but overlooked issue in disability integration is the harder-to-reach embedded norms that require job and policy modifications. The Article argues that pandisability theory serves as an analogue to earlier notions of panethnicity and provides an equally compelling heuristic for determining class identity. It shows that pandisability undergirds ADA public service and public accommodation class actions in which individualized remedy assessments have been accepted as part of group-based challenges to social exclusion. The Article also demonstrates that this broader vision of collective action is consistent with the history underlying the class action device. Taking advantage of the relatively blank slate of writing on group-based disability discrimination, it offers an intrepid vision of the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s potential for transforming workplace environments. In advocating for a return to an earlier paradigm of collective action in the disability context, the Article also provides some thoughts on challenging race- and sex-based discrimination...|$|R
