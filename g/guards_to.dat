In May 1968, {{he sent the}} <b>Guard</b> <b>to</b> Louisville to break up race-related protests that followed peaceful civil rights marches. This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state. In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the <b>Guard</b> <b>to</b> quell protests against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky, and imposed a curfew that interfered with final examinations. The latter protest culminated in the burning {{of one of the}} university's ROTC buildings.|$|R

5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was required, and which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March, Rodzianko sent <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> Putyatina's {{apartment}} to ensure Michael's safety, and Michael signed a document {{drawn up by}} Rodzianko and Grand Duke Paul proposing {{the creation of a}} constitutional monarchy.

5|$|While {{chairman}} of the AEC, Seaborg participated on the negotiating team for the Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT), in which the US, UK, and USSR agreed to ban all above-ground test detonations of nuclear weapons.

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> the museum's basement. They handcuffed the <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E

5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the children at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons. Firstly, that almost half the children at Jastrebarsko were older children more able to cope with the harsh conditions. More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{political}} moments that brought Berkman and Goldman together was the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania owned by Andrew Carnegie {{became the focus of}} national attention when talks between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) broke down. The factory's manager was Henry Clay Frick, a fierce opponent of the union. When a final round of talks failed at the end of June, management closed the plant and locked out the workers, who immediately went on strike. Strikebreakers were brought in and the company hired Pinkerton <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> protect them. On July 6, a fight broke out between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of armed union workers. During the twelve-hour gunfight, seven guards and nine strikers were killed.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger {{describe}} Caligula as {{an insane}} emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and indulged {{in too much}} spending and sex. He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it, killing for mere amusement, deliberately wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation, and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship. Once, at some games at which he was presiding, he ordered his <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> throw an entire section of the audience into the arena during the intermission to be eaten by the wild beasts {{because there were no}} prisoners to be used and he was bored.|$|E

5|$|Some SS {{members were}} subject to summary execution, torture, and beatings {{at the hands of}} freed prisoners, {{displaced}} persons, or Allied soldiers. American soldiers of the 157th Regiment, who entered the concentration camp at Dachau in April 1945 and saw the human deprivation and cruelty committed by the SS, shot some of the remaining SS camp guards. On 15 April 1945, British troops entered Bergen-Belsen. They placed the SS guards on starvation rations, made them work without breaks, forced them to deal with the remaining corpses, and stabbed them with bayonets or struck them with their rifle butts if they slowed their pace. Some members of the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps delivered captured SS camp <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> displaced persons camps, where they knew they would be subject to summary execution.|$|E
5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> rescue a survivor existed.

5|$|Steuart was {{exchanged}} {{later in}} the summer of 1864, returning to command a brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia, in the division of Major General George Pickett. Steuart's brigade consisted of the 9th, 14th, 38th, 53rd and 57th Virginia regiments, and served in the trenches north of the James River during the Siege of Petersburg (June 9, 1864– March 25, 1865). By this stage of the war, Confederate supplies had dwindled to the point where Lee's army began to go hungry, and the theft of food became a serious problem. Steuart was forced to send armed <b>guards</b> <b>to</b> the supply depot at Petersburg {{in order to ensure that}} his men's packages were not stolen by looters.|$|E
