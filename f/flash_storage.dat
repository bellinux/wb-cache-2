On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast <b>flash</b> <b>storage,</b> increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model. The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120×2880 displays. The 15-inch models were released {{with the same}} Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} a method for acquiring and extracting data from NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices and to validate that methodology. Furthermore, a validated and reproducible framework for the acquisition and extraction of data from the NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> chip is developed as a guideline for forensic investigators who are required to preserve and recover data stored on NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices in a forensically acceptable manner. The digital forensic community is currently facing a situation determined by the rapidly increasing popularity of NAND flash memory technology. NAND flash technology is significantly different from other storage memory technologies. Like any technology that is new and evolving, manufacturers are still experimenting with the design and implementation of their versions. Compared to magnetic drives, there is no standardized approach to producing the NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices. The {{first part of this}} thesis presented the results of a literature review of NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices, digital forensics practices and principles, an understanding of the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) and the characteristics of the NAND flash memory chip, together with, logical versus physical acquisition and forensic guidelines. The literature review examined how the NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> chip differs architecturally from a traditional magnetic hard disk drive (HDD) and also highlighted that, given the increased use of NAND flash technology related devices as part of digital devices, NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices {{are an integral part of}} the creation of digital artefacts that may later need to be considered as evidence in criminal or civil proceedings. Existing forensic guidelines and procedures were developed based mainly on HDD technology and although NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices are widely accepted by consumers, they are poorly integrated into the forensic guidelines which have been explicitly discussed by forensic and data recovery experts. This thesis then identifies the gaps between well reputed forensic guidelines and further outlines through a series of experiments and analysis carried out with various parameters and concludes that those well repute forensic practices and principles are inadequate to handle the NAND flash memory technology in a forensic manner. Through a series of experiments and iterations, the analysis showed that a complex forensic framework for the acquisition and extraction of NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> chip was created, verified and validated. This reinforces the need to recognise the issues raised by NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices to maximise the chance of data recovery. Specific processes were identified and the data recovery rate was measured for testing. In conclusion, this thesis develops a validated forensic framework and method in the acquisition and extraction of NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> chip that existing forensic techniques and guidelines are incapable of addressing thereby generating new knowledge and perspectives on ways to acquire and extract raw data from NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> device in general. This innovative model provides a new perspective on the acquisition and extraction of raw data from NAND <b>flash</b> memory <b>storage</b> devices which may be potentially useful in a court of law or similar...|$|R

The floppy disk provides for a controlled means of file transfer by permitting only a few files to be transmitted. This is as USB ports on enterprise computer terminals/workstations are often disabled in order to prevent employees from using a flash memory drive to take large amounts of data for unauthorized use. The capacity limit and low transfer speed of the floppy disk are advantages in this case. In addition, the loss of a floppy disk has less consequence than the loss of any modern piece of removable <b>flash</b> <b>storage,</b> and furthermore, the floppy disk, being much larger than most flash memory card formatssome of which are smaller than a fingernailis harder to lose.|$|E

25|$|The concerts were {{digitally}} {{recorded by}} 28 HD cameras, both human operated and robotic, collecting about 500 gigabytes of audio/video per hour—roughly a terabyte (TB) per show. To handle their data storage needs, U2 used several products from EMC Corporation, {{the first time}} the company had a musical client. To archive uncompressed footage and access it on-demand during the shows' production, the tour staff used an EMC VNXe3200 portable <b>flash</b> <b>storage</b> unit worth about US$25,000; it was configured with 22.9 TB of storage but was expandable up to 450 TB. After each show, tour staff used an EMC Data Domain 2500 system to back up footage; with storage up to 6.6 petabytes and an hourly throughput of 13.4 TB, the Data Domain system could complete a nightly backup before the crew disassembled the stage. On previous tours, U2 relied on USB flash drives for storage. Video imagery was loaded on the set's video screens with two d3 Technologies d3 4×4 media servers. Due to the need to load video on the fly, all storage was locally networked, as a cloud storage configuration would have increased latency. EMC's solution satisfied certain requirements dictated by the band, such as: mobility through a flight case form factor; expandable storage; and the capability to handle the large data loads from many cameras.|$|E
