5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus and the <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus {{to the oval}} window, a membrane-covered opening to the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial nerve.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the genes}} {{responsible}} for the regulation of <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> formation and its morphogenesis {{are members of the}} homeobox gene family such as Pax, Msx and Otx homeobox genes. The development of <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> structures such as the cochlea is regulated by Dlx5/Dlx6, Otx1/Otx2 and Pax2, which in turn are controlled by the master gene Shh. Shh is secreted by the notochord.|$|E
5|$|The {{round window}} {{allows for the}} fluid within the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> moves and pushes the membrane of the round window out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
50|$|Sound {{vibrations}} {{travel through}} a medium, and sound is heard when sound waves {{travel through the}} medium of air or bones/teeth to arrive at the <b>inner</b> <b>ears.</b> The SoundBite Hearing System uses sound waves travelling through bone, known as bone conduction to transmit subtle vibrations through bones to the <b>inner</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R

5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>ear</b> congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The movement of liquids within the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form the bony labyrinth.|$|E
50|$|Bilateral Vestibulopathy {{results as}} the {{culmination}} of damage done to both <b>inner</b> <b>ears.</b> Bilateral Vestibulopathy causes problems in vision, hearing and motor coordination.|$|R

As a morphological substrate, a strong enhancement of both <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> and vestibulocochlear nerves were found on gadolinium-enhanced MR scans. The serological tests identified an active infection with Treponema pallidum. After a high-dose treatment with penicillin G and prednisolone, the auditory and vestibular functions and the MR morphology of the vestibulocochlear nerves and <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> on both sides returned to normal...|$|R
50|$|At its base, the flocculus {{receives}} {{input from}} the <b>inner</b> <b>ear's</b> vestibular system and regulates balance. Many floccular projections connect to the motor nuclei involved in control of eye movement.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it is hard}} to {{test the}} hearing of sharks, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can {{possibly}} hear prey from many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> has been lost.|$|E
5|$|Compared with Giraffititan, the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> of A. sp. shows a more basal morphology. That {{feature is}} {{possibly}} {{related to a}} restricted range of possible movements that involve head-turning.|$|E
5|$|During {{embryogenesis}} the ear develops {{as three}} distinct structures: the <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> {{the middle ear}} and the outer ear. Each structure originates from a different germ layer: the ectoderm, endoderm and mesenchyme.|$|E

3000|$|... mice was {{conducted}} by Frimorpho, Inc. (Fribourg, Switzerland). Briefly, after anaesthesia, each mouse was perfused with Karnovky-fixative. The <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> were isolated, decalcified in EDTA, and then dehydrated through graded alcohol series. For a global analysis, organs were embedded in paraffin and subjected to classical procedures for hematoxylin-eosin staining. Pictures were taken with a Leica digital camera. For electron microscopy, the <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> were embedded in epon 812. Semithin sections were cut with a Reichert Ultramicrotome mounted on glass slides and stained with Toluidine Blue. Ultrathin-sectioning {{was performed on the}} same instrument, followed by lead citrate contrasting and uranyl acetate staining. Transmission electron-microscopy was made on a Philips EM- 10. Photographic plates were from Ilford.|$|R
50|$|After {{attempting}} {{to resume his}} playing career,he {{was diagnosed with a}} rare neurological condition called bilateral vestibulopathy, in which the portions of both <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> that control balance are damaged. Due to this, Cumberland was forced to announce his retirement at the age of 22.|$|R
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The semicircular canals within the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal is parallel to the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Sound waves {{travel through}} the outer ear, are {{modulated}} by the middle ear, and are transmitted to the vestibulocochlear nerve in the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> This nerve transmits information to the temporal lobe of the brain, where it is registered as sound.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

50|$|During his career, Kuhn {{was only}} {{one of a handful of}} professors in Germany who {{specialized}} in the field of otology.

5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The ear canal of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle ear}} lies between the outer ear and the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> It {{consists}} of an air-filled cavity called the tympanic cavity and includes the three ossicles and their attaching ligaments; the auditory tube; and the round and oval windows. The ossicles are three small bones that function together to receive, amplify, and transmit the sound from the eardrum to the <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The ossicles are the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes (stirrup). The stapes is the smallest named bone in the body. The middle ear also connects to the upper throat at the nasopharynx via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and <b>inner</b> <b>ear.</b> Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E

50|$|Karnavedha is a Vedic rite of passage. Common {{between male}} and females, it is {{intended}} to open the <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> of the child for receiving sacred sounds.

5|$|Parts of the {{otic vesicle}} in turn form the vestibulocochlear nerve. These form bipolar neurons which supply {{sensation}} {{to parts of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> (namely the sensory parts of the semicircular canals, macular of the utricle and saccule, and organ of Corti). The nerve begins to form around the 28th day.|$|E
5|$|The <b>inner</b> <b>ear</b> is {{supplied}} by the anterior tympanic branch of the maxillary artery; the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery; the petrosal branch of middle meningeal artery; and the labyrinthine artery, arising from either the anterior inferior cerebellar artery or the basilar artery.|$|E
5|$|Hearing loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When hearing loss is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive hearing loss. When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the <b>inner</b> <b>ear,</b> vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural hearing loss.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the middle}} and <b>inner</b> <b>ears</b> are {{necessary}} for hearing, people with complete agenesis of the ears are totally deaf. Minor agenesis that affects only the visible parts of the outer ear, which may be called microtia, typically produces cosmetic concerns and perhaps hearing impairment if the opening to the ear canal is blocked, but not deafness.|$|R
