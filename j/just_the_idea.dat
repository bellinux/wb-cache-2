When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and {{what happens if you}} take out the clip." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Blow" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero. The video was released on February 25, 2011. Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that was cool and random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later {{to wake up to}} the emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club is a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured {{the bundle}} theory of {{personal}} identity. In this theory, [...] "the mind itself, {{far from being}} an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' without unity or cohesive quality". The self {{is nothing but a}} bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as [...] "self", [...] "person", or [...] "mind" [...] referred to collections of [...] "sense-contents". A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his Reasons and Persons.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{comprehensive}} {{examination of the}} KLF's announcement and its context, Select called it [...] "the last grand gesture, the most heroic act of public self destruction {{in the history of}} pop. And it's also Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty's final extravagant howl of self disgust, defiance and contempt for a music world gone foul and corrupt." [...] Many of the KLF's friends and collaborators gave their reactions in the magazine. Movie director Bill Butt said that [...] "Like everything, they're dealing with it in a very realistic way, a fresh, unbitter way, which is very often not the case. A lot of bands disappear with such a terrible loss of dignity". Scott Piering said that [...] "They've got a huge buzz off this, that's for sure, because it's something that's finally thrilling. It's scary to have thrown away a fortune which I know they have. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of starting over is exciting. Starting over on what? Well, they have such great ideas, like buying submarines". Even Kenny Gates, who as a director of the KLF's distributors APT stood to lose financially from the move, called it [...] "Conceptually and philosophically... absolutely brilliant". Mark Stent reported the doubts of many when he said that [...] "I [...] had so many people who I know, heads of record companies, A men saying, 'Come on, It's a big scam.' But I firmly believe it's over". [...] "For the very last spectacularly insane time", the magazine concluded, [...] "The KLF have done what was least expected of them".|$|E
2500|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he {{was saying}} as I approached, [...] "what do we mean when we say that a man is 'some pumpkins'? We mean that he is full of ideas just as a pumpkin is full of seeds. What do we mean when we {{say that he is}} a 'brick'? Why, a brick is part of a building. Let us now {{consider}} the attraction of gravitation, that mysterious force which binds together atoms and worlds, princes and parallelograms, cones, pyramids and the Sphinx. A traveler is lost on a Western prairie. He has wandered all day, far from home and with nothing to eat. Night comes on. The wolves begin to howl in the darkness. At last he reaches a log cabin, almost in ruins. No matter, it will afford him shelter for the night. Scarcely has he entered and composed himself to rest when a violent storm arises. Thunders roar. Lightnings flash. The snow heaps against the door. It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and freeze to death. Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.' That is <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea.</b> He can't stay there and freeze. His soul—but {{what do we know about}} the soul? Is it homogeneous or heterogeneous? Who can tell? Who except me, Daniel Pratt, the Great American Traveler, and soon to be President of the United States? Why not? Was not imperial Rome once saved by the cackling of a goose?" ...|$|E

50|$|Lord Hoffman {{concluded}} that the Ixia expression was more than <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a flower-stripe combination, and therefore original enough to represent the author's skill and labour and form {{a substantial part of}} the originality of the work. A writer for the European Intellectual Property Review explained that while he did not explicitly state it, Lord Hoffman provided a new test for whether a substantial part of the original work was copied. The proposed test is whether the part taken would itself attract copyright protection.|$|E

50|$|In any position, an {{employee}} wants {{to feel that}} their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay.

It is the subtle variables that also {{play an important role in}} the feeling of equity. <b>Just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes.|$|E
5000|$|... "That's Not Me" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Brian Wilson and Tony Asher for American rock band the Beach Boys, the third track from their 1966 album Pet Sounds. It is a work {{influenced}} by psychedelic drugs that inspired Wilson to turn his attention inward and probe his deep-seated self-doubts. Wilson explained that the song [...] "reveals a lot about myself, <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that you're {{going to look at}} yourself and say, 'Hey, now look, that's not me, kind of square off with yourself and say 'this is me, that's not me'."
