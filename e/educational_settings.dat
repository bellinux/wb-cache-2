5|$|Caged Bird was {{nominated}} for a National Book Award in 1970 and remained on The New York Times paperback bestseller list for two years. It has been used in <b>educational</b> <b>settings</b> from high schools to universities, and the book has been celebrated for creating new literary avenues for the American memoir. However, the book's graphic depiction of childhood rape, racism, and sexuality has caused it to be challenged or banned in some schools and libraries.|$|E

40|$|Motivation is an {{important}} aspect of learning in <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings</b> because it affects the choices visitors make regarding what to attend to, the amount of effort they devote to learning, {{and the extent to which}} they enjoy the experience. Commonly, however, visitors seek entertainment, social or restorative experiences as well as, or in preference to, a learning experience. This research investigates the impact of motivational factors on the experience of learning in <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings.</b> Motivational factors are considered in terms of four components - personal goals, capability beliefs, context beliefs and situational incentives. The experience of learning is considered in terms of visitors’ perceptions of the experience, rather than objective measures of learning outcomes, as the experience itself is seen as the desired outcome of the visit. Visitors to six different <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings</b> in South East Queensland were invited to participate in the research, including a museum, an art gallery, a wildlife centre, an aquarium, and guided tours of natural and cultural heritage sites. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using questionnaires (499 participants) and interviews (52 participants) in order to ascertain the importance to visitors of different types of learning experiences; identify the extent to which motivations for learning vary across sites and visitor groups; investigate the relationships between the educational, entertainment, social and restorative aspects of the visitors’ experience; and examine the impact of motivational factors on visitors’ experience of learning in leisure settings. The findings support the importance of learning to visitors in a range of <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings.</b> Visitors seek an experience that combines elements of learning and discovery, and is perceived to be both effortless and fun. It is concluded that the characteristics of learning in <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings</b> contribute to a synergy between the educational and entertainment aspects of the experience. Situational factors are more important than personal factors in motivating visitors to engage in and experience this type of learning. This is of great significance to <b>educational</b> leisure <b>settings</b> as it implies that sites have a reasonable degree of control over the motivational factors that influence visitor engagement in learning...|$|R

A two-stage non-proportional probability strata sample combined with quota sampling yielded a nationally representative sample of 500 young adults. Most of the alumni present positive outcomes, with full matriculation, complete army service, steady income and housing arrangements, and they are in good physical and mental health. Still, 5 - 10 % of the alumni demonstrate outcomes that are not as good. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} is {{the branch of}} psychology concerned with {{the scientific study of}} human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various <b>educational</b> <b>settings</b> across the lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in <b>educational</b> <b>settings.</b> There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with what the teacher does. Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the teacher does has on the students.|$|E

Applications to other <b>educational</b> <b>settings</b> developed quickly as a way to enhance writing development and the teacher-student relationship across linguistic and cultural barriers, with increasing use in second language instruction, deaf education, and adult literacy education.

25|$|Artistic - Carolyn {{also works}} as an {{abstract}} artist. She studied art for 17 years in northern Virginia under the award-winning painter, Irene Wood-Montgomery. Her paintings and sculpture have been exhibited in galleries, <b>educational</b> <b>settings,</b> and nursing homes throughout the state of Virginia. Carolyn is an abstract colorist, whose preferred medium is acrylic. Influenced by the non-representational style of Jackson Pollock and by the Washington, D.C. color field painter, Sam Gilliam, Carolyn experiments with color effects to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. Inspired by the late work of Henri Matisse, Carolyn creates textured cut-outs to achieve a representational effect.|$|E
25|$|While digital voice {{recorders}} are now common, Compact Cassette—or microcassette—recorders may be cheaper and of sufficient quality {{to serve as}} adjuncts or substitutes for note taking in business and <b>educational</b> <b>settings.</b> Audiobooks, church services, and other spoken word material are still frequently sold on cassette, as lower fidelity generally is not a drawback for such content, and some people prefer the convenience of the tape controls for rewinding to repeat a missed passage. While most publishers sell CD audiobooks, they usually also offered a cassette version at the same price well into the 2000s.
