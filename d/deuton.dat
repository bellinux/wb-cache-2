40|$|ACCProduction of {{radioactive}} ions has started at GANIL on the SPIRAL facility since 2001 and numerous multicharged radioactive ion beams have been delivered for high energy nuclear experiments. This article makes {{an overview of}} the different beams that have been produced. In the mean time, an important R and D research program is continued in oder to produce new species {{of radioactive}} elements. A new concept of multicharged radioactive production that couples a monocharged ion source, based on the monolithe concept, to an ecr ion source like nanogan 3 is under developments and is described The development of monocharged ion sources with high efficiencies is also motivated by a new big project that is under studies at GANIL : the SPIRAL 2 Project. The goal of this project consists in extending the disponible radioactive ion beams to very heavy elements created with a new method of production : while the spiral 1 facility uses the projectile fragmentation for radioactive nuclei production, the spiral 2 project is based on the fission of a Uranium carbide target induced by a neutron flow created by a high intensity <b>deuton</b> beam.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} research axes related to nuclear energy concerns the management of nuclear wastes. In this context, certain innovative pathways are being explored to provide options {{which could lead to}} a major reduction of the quantities of radioactive nuclides requiring long-term geological storage. An important aspect is the development of advanced nuclear systems which allow the transmutation of long-lived minor actinides, the ADS (accelerator driven system) concept often being proposed for the purpose. Various important developments are necessary for these new systems, one of {{the principal}} needs being the qualification of calculational tools to enable the reliable design of an ADS demonstrator. In the present research, related numerical and experimental studies have been carried out in the framework of the MUSE 4 programme, which was developed on the MASURCA facility at Cadarache, France. This programme consists of investigations of a reference critical configuration (MOX fuel with sodium), and several subcritical configurations driven by an external neutron source. The source is obtained {{with the help of a}} <b>deuton</b> accelerator, called GENEPI, which produces neutrons via a nuclear reaction, either with a tritium target (14. 1 MeV neutrons), or with a deuterium target (2. 7 MeV neutrons). The experimental techniques implemented in this research address the study of spectral variations via foil activation measurements near interfaces characteristic of ADSs. The additional value of such experimental results, compared to standard fission rate traverses obtained using fission chambers (which were also analysed), has been highlighted. An important novel set of integral parameters has thus been made available for the validation of different numerical codes and nuclear data. The activation and fission rate measurements carried out, as also experimental results for other parameters such askeff, βeff and φ*, have been interpreted using various calculational codes (mainly ERANOS and MCNP) and several different nuclear data libraries (JEF- 2. 2, ERALIB 1, ENDF/B 6 v 2). Supplementary information on the performance of the calculational methods has been obtained in the context of the MUSE 4 benchmark exercise, conducted by the NEA. The present investigations have led to the resolution of various problems encountered during the earlier MUSE 3 programme at MASURCA, viz. uncertainties related to description of the intrinsic source description, difficulties in interpreting fission traverses near the external source, etc. A detailed study has thus been made possible of the important factors which characterise subritical fast systems driven by an external source, i. e. influence of the subcriticality level and of the external source intensity. The various analyses carried out have permitted to establish several recommendations concerning the modeling of the external source and the accelerator tube, as well as the most appropriate numerical methods and data sets to be applied. In this context, the specificity of subcritical configurations, as regards the prediction of parameters such as spatial indices and absolute reaction rates, has been clearly brought out. Certain difficulties (interpretation of high threshold reactions, absolute flux determination, etc.) have thereby been highlighted, pointing at the need for further numerical and experimental investigations. Finally, some recent ERANOS developments have allowed a study to be carried out of the representativity of MUSE 4 configurations with respect to alternative ADS concepts proposed in the framework of the international PDS-XADS project. In brief, the representativity of the MUSE 4 configurations is found to be quite satisfactory for XADS-Na and XADS-gas. However, in the case of the XADS-Pb/Bi system, effects of the significant uncertainties associated with the nuclear data of lead and bismuth have been clearly highlighted, indicating the desirability of new, more specific experiments for XADS-Pb/Bi validation...|$|E

40|$|Dawning {{neutron physics}} was {{more complex than}} one might expect. The chance that the neutron {{comprised}} a proton and an electron was diffusely taken into account after {{the discovery of the}} neutron. Moreover, uncertainties persisted about the composition of beryllium radiation until it was realized that the latter comprised both neutrons and gamma-rays. The interaction of neutrons with matter and nuclei was soon investigated. Both a spatial symmetry, a symmetry of charge, and a symmetry in the nuclear reactions soon emerged. The relation of negative beta-decay to the neutron abundance in nuclei was moreover reviewed. Positive beta-radioactivity induced by alpha-particles was eventually announced, having been foreseen some weeks before. Accelerated <b>deutons</b> and protons shortly afterwards revealed to be efficient in inducing radioactivity. The physics institute in Rome got ready to start research on neutrons, but apparently it only planned to go through alpha-induced radioactivity, at first. If so, it is then plausible that some new results achieved by foreign laboratories eventually bent Fermi to neutrons. Fermi's discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity is reviewed with regard to investigations then current, once more showing simplicity as a distinctive trait of Fermi's way of doing physics.
