25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the short ballot in the early 20th century, as {{described}} above, the most common means of electing the presidential electors was through the general ticket. The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process <b>in</b> <b>states</b> <b>like</b> New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by North Carolina and Ohio in 1932. Alabama was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 {{and was one of the}} last states to switch to the short ballot.|$|E

25|$|Following the Rath Yatra and the {{associated}} protests, the BJP withdrew its support to the National Front central government led by V. P. Singh, leading to its collapse. It also prompted the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh state government, in its eagerness to consolidate the Muslim vote bank, to use excessive police force against BJP workers and kar-sevaks, resulting in the alienation of Hindu communities from Singh's Samajwadi party in India's most populous state. This BJP strategy paid rich dividends in the May–June 1991 parliamentary elections. Relative to the 1989 general election, the BJP doubled its percentage of votes nationwide and made gains <b>in</b> <b>states</b> <b>like</b> Karnataka and Telangana in the South and Assam in the Northeast. It emerged as the second largest party in the Lok Sabha, after the Indian National Congress (INC).

2500|$|In {{addition}} to disparate treatment, employing entities may not use practices having an unjustified disparate impact on protected groups. In Griggs v Duke Power Co, a power {{company on the}} Dan River, North Carolina, required {{a high school diploma}} for staff to transfer to higher paying non-manual jobs. Because of racial segregation <b>in</b> <b>states</b> <b>like</b> North Carolina, fewer black employees than white employees had diplomas. The Court found a diploma was wholly unnecessary to perform the tasks in higher paying non-manual jobs. Burger CJ, for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the [...] "Act proscribes not only overt discrimination, but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation." [...] An employer could show that a practice with disparate impact followed [...] "business necessity" [...] that was [...] "related to job performance" [...] but otherwise such practices would be prohibited. It is not necessary to show any intention to discriminate, just a discriminatory effect. Since amendments by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, if disparate impact is shown the law requires employers [...] "to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity" [...] and that any non-discriminatory [...] "alternative employment practice" [...] is not feasible. On the other hand, in Ricci v DeStefano five Supreme Court judges held the City of New Haven had acted unlawfully by discarding test results for firefighters, which it concluded could have had an unjustified disparate impact by race. In a further concurrence, Scalia J said [...] "resolution of this dispute merely postpones the evil day" [...] when a disparate impact might be found unconstitutional, against the equal protection clause because, in his view, the lack of a good faith defense meant employers were compelled to do [...] "racial decision making" [...] that [...] "is... discriminatory." [...] In dissent, Ginsburg J pointed out that disparate impact theory advances equality, and in no way requires behavior that is not geared to identifying people with skills necessary for jobs.|$|E
