5000|$|The Polled Hereford Breed Origin Site is a {{historic}} site located southwest of Indianola, Iowa, United States. The American owners of Hereford cattle in the 19th century knew that the breed occasionally produced calves that did not develop horns. They are known as polled, which means [...] "naturally hornless." [...] As early as 1893 attempts were made in Kansas and Ontario in Canada to produce the hornless variant. Warren Gammon, a Des Moines lawyer, developed his plan after seeing polled Herefords at the Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1893. With his son Bert, he leased 5 acre of a farm that was owned by the Angus Coal Mining Company. He acquired four bulls and ten cows of purebred Herefords that had failed to develop horns. Two cows were infertile and one bull had to be eliminated. Beside the windmill where the bull [...] "Giant" [...] was tied up the first planned mating with a Polled <b>Hereford</b> <b>cow</b> took place on February 21, 1902. By 1976, the Polled Hereford breed was numerically greater than the horned variety in the United States, and was about three-fourths of the Iowa's Hereford stock.

A carga animal não afetou significativamente a produção de leite das vacas (CA 280 = 6, 16 e CA 360 = 5, 88 kg leite/vaca/dia). A composição racial das vacas influenciou significativamente a produção de leite, tendo as vacas ½ Nelore ½ Hereford maior produção diária que as ¼ Nelore ¾ Hereford (6, 21 vs 5, 84 kg leite/vaca/dia, respectivamente). A carga animal não influenciou significativamente o peso e o ganho médio diário (GMD) dos bezerros até a desmama. Bezerros filhos de vacas ½ Nelore ½ Hereford tiveram GMD do nascimento à desmama e pesos à desmama significativamente maiores que filhos de vacas ¼ Nelore ¾ Hereford (0, 799 vs 0, 727 kg/dia e 211, 51 vs 193. 12 kg, respectivamente). O sexo dos bezerros não influenciou significativamente a produção de leite das vacas e o GMD e o peso à desmama dos bezerros. Portanto, o desempenho dos bezerros não diferiu significativamente entre as cargas animais e foi melhor para bezerros filhos de vacas ½ Nelore ½ Hereford do que de vacas ¼ Nelore ¾ Hereford.

The stocking rate did not affect milk production (CA 280 = 6. 16 and CA 360 = 5. 88 kg/cow/day). Breed composition of cows significantly affected milk production, with ½ Nelore ½ <b>Hereford</b> <b>cows</b> showing higher daily yield production than ¼ Nelore ¾ <b>Hereford</b> <b>cows</b> (6. 21 vs. 5. 84 kg, respectively).

5000|$|The Model T was {{introduced}} in 1908 and it revolutionized society. With its introduction, automobiles became available to most everyone. It gave people the freedom to roam and had {{a major role in}} developing mountain tourism in Northern California. The earliest accounts of this place indicate a man named Henry M. (Slim) Jori began the commercial development of this place in the early 1920s. Jori's parents had just arrived from Switzerland when Jori was born in Sacramento in 1890. After a career as a machinist at a brewery in Sacramento, he decided, at age 27, to leave the city life and become a cowboy. He moved to Paynes Creek, and worked as superintendent of the RW Hanna stock ranch in Paynes Creek. Jori drove cattle through Lassen Lodge as it was roughly halfway between Hanna's Paynes Creek ranch and the Mill Creek Meadows ranches. This was a great resting spot for the cattle as they would have just climbed over 1000 feet in only a few miles. There was water, and huge troughs were built for the cattle to drink, and shade from the large trees that grow at this elevation. Henri Jori saw an opportunity, in 1912, there were one million registered vehicles but by 1923, there were some 15.2 million cars registered in the United States. Jori recognized the demand for services to these new travelers. Auto camping became a fad. People would outfit their cars with camping equipment and just go. These [...] "tourists" [...] viewed themselves as pioneers or adventurers. They relished the challenges of the road, seeing the [...] "real" [...] America on their own timetable, and stopping to camp whenever and wherever they wished. And the newly created Lassen National Park would have been the perfect destination for these new travelers. Commercial enterprises were developed early to appeal to the motorists—first tourist camps, then tourist cottages, then tourist courts, then motels. These were complemented by filling stations, gift shops, restaurants and attractions, all with convenient auto parking.Jori set up a seasonal store and restaurant at this location in 1922, where he sold gas and other convenience items there during the summers. The store and restaurant consisted of a cabin and tent platform. He could do this because {{he was one of the}} few owners of a truck, that he could transport the goods and gasoline in to this convenient location. Jori's boss, RW Hanna was a director of the Standard Oil Company. Is it possible Hanna inspired or helped Jori in this business venture? His wife Clara (Hurt) was the cook and she was well known for her biscuits and gravy. She was also the bookkeeper for RW Hanna. Clara told of an ongoing battle with the owners of Childs Meadow resort over a large rock at the side of the road that they would paint to advertise their services. Each party would paint over the others sign. The Joris homesteaded and lived down the road in the upper eastern portion of the current Mt Meadows Ranch. In another business venture of Jori's, he bought 2,000 Angora Goats, at which time, construction of Highway 36 was taking place. The construction included a lot of blasting, and the story is, the goats ate the blasting caps and for days there were goats exploding! Henri also traveled 5 days by train to Denver to bring back the first Domino <b>Hereford</b> <b>cow</b> in California. Clara was also a very lively person who was known as the bird lady of California. She ran a huge bird sanctuary at the Mountain Meadow Ranch, a facility that reintroduced many indigenous birds back to the area.|$|E

The herd included 23 <b>Hereford</b> <b>cows</b> ranging in age from 2 to 12 years and 14 Simmental-Hereford half-blood cows aged 3 to 9 years. The suckling calves were sired by Hereford bulls. The average daily milk yield of 6. 16 kg was affected by the cow breed. Simmental-Hereford cows produced 7. 11 kg of milk per day, while the Herefords produced 5. 21 kg per day. Milk production declined with increased days in lactation. The decline was linear in the Simmental- <b>Hereford</b> <b>cows</b> and quadratic in the Herefords. Milk production was also affected by the sex of the suckling calf. Heifer calves received 6. 44 kg per day compared t o 5. 80 kg per day for bull calves. Calf birth weight and test day weight influenced milk yield as cows nursing heavier calves produced more milk. Cow breed affected milk composition. Simmental-Hereford cows had higher percent solids-not-fat, while Herefords were higher for percent protein. Calf weights were affected by sex of calf. Bull calves weighed 33. 89 kg at birth, while heifers weighed 32. 14 kg. At weaning, bulls weighed 188. 63 kg, while heifers weighed 177. 14 kg.

40|$|Most ranchers know {{crossbreeding}} {{can increase}} output, but perhaps, don’t appreciate the potential 25 % crossbred advantage in lifetime productivity of crossbred cows. Yes, {{you read that}} correctly; 25 % crossbred advantage in lifetime productivity. In recent years many commercial cow herds have changed dramatically as producers have opted to repeatedly top-cross Angus bulls on their commercial cows resulting in loss of heterosis and loss of complementary breed effects. Some {{of the reasons for}} this shift are; 1) a desire to simplify breeding programs (perception that crossbreeding systems are too complex), 2) use of black hide color as a proxy for market quality, 3) the belief that high percentage purebred commercial cattle produce more uniformity and consistency, 4) effective marketing of the Angus EPD’s and carcass database, and 5) the Angus brand (CAB) impact (desire to get away from marketing commodity products). A number of textbook crossbreeding systems are not “rancher friendly” in terms of management ease even though they deliver maximum heterosis. Additionally, dealing with grazing rotations, labor constraints and variable market targets require tough decisions that may tilt the crossbreeding system away from the original plan. Utilization of heterosis and breed differences in a crossbreeding system must be coupled with common sense ranch management {{in such a way that}} optimum (not maximum) heterosis is produced. There are some simplified crossbreeding systems that can meet this need very well. Ranchers would be wise to crossbreed even if heterosis was zero, due to the complementary effects of matching strengths of one breed to offset weaknesses of another breed. The opportunity to mate bulls and cows of different breeds or paternal / maternal lines to take advantage of complementarity is an important part of the total crossbred advantage. Just think back 40 years to what the Angus x <b>Hereford</b> <b>cow</b> did to match up the strengths of those two breeds and mask some of the weaknesses of each; that was complementarity! The formation of composite breed types based on a multi-breed foundation is an attractive alternative to traditional crossbreeding systems. Composite breed types are based on matings among crossbreds of two or more breeds. Once a composite is formed, it can be managed as a straightbred in a one-pasture system with none of the problems associated with small herd size or fluctuation in breed composition...|$|E
