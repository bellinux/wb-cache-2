40|$|The {{observation}} of gravitational waves {{with a global}} network of interferometric detectors such as advanced LIGO, advanced Virgo, and KAGRA {{will make it possible}} to probe into the nature of space-time structure. Besides Einstein's general theory of relativity, there are several theories of gravitation that passed experimental tests so far. The gravitational-wave observation provides a new experimental test of alternative theories of gravity because a gravitational wave may have at most six <b>independent</b> <b>modes</b> of polarization, of which properties and number of modes are dependent on theories of gravity. This paper proposes a method to reconstruct the <b>independent</b> <b>modes</b> of polarization in time-series data of an advanced detector network.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) guided re-test mode on short- and long-term measurement variability of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness obtained by spectral domain-SLO optical coherence tomography (SD-SLO/OCT). Methods: Seventy five healthy eyes were scanned 3 times per day (intra-session variability) by both the SLO guided re-test <b>mode</b> and the <b>independent</b> <b>mode</b> of SD-SLO/OCT. Subjects were scanned 3 times by both modes at visits within a 2 -week interval (inter-session variability). For testing longitudinal variability, 3 separate exams were performed over 6 months by both modes. The coefficient of variation (CV), reproducibility coefficient (RC) and intraclass correlation coefficient of RNFL thickness were compared between the two modes. Results: The intra-session RC and CV ranged from 5. 4 to 12. 9 microns and 1. 76 % to 5. 72 % when measured by <b>independent</b> <b>mode</b> and 5. 4 to 12. 5 microns and 1. 75 % to 5. 58 % by re-test mode, respectively. The inter-session RC and CV ranged from 5. 8 to 13. 3 microns and 1. 89 % to 5. 78 % by <b>independent</b> <b>mode</b> and 5. 8 to 12. 7 microns and 1. 90 % to 5. 54 % by re-test mode, respectively.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the emotion recognition from natural speech as realized for the robot head MEXI. We use a fuzzy logic approach {{for analysis of}} prosody in natural speech. Since MEXI often communicates with well known persons but also with unknown humans, for instance at exhibitions, we realized a speaker dependent mode {{as well as a}} speaker <b>independent</b> <b>mode</b> in our prosody based emotion recognition. A key point of our approach is that it automatically selects the most significant features from a set of twenty analyzed features based on a training database of speech samples. This is important according to our results, since the set of significant features differs considerably between the distinguished emotions. With our approach we reach average recognition rates of 84 % in speaker dependent mode and 60 % in speaker <b>independent</b> <b>mode.</b> Index Terms — Emotion recognition, prosody, fuzzy rules, robot hea...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend towards}} learner {{autonomy}} in EFL {{in recent years}} has run in parallel with the proliferation of self-access centres and the increasing availability of multimedia self-study materials. However, unless the learners themselves are ready for <b>independent</b> <b>modes</b> of learning, they may make poor use of such facilities. It is thus important to ascertain the degree of readiness for learner independence among our students. To this end, a 45 -item questionnaire designed and used in a British university was administered to a group of Spanish students studying English at a University language centre. While the Spanish students stated that they took responsibility for their own learning and enjoyed some independent work, they also exhibited a high degree of teacher dependence and felt that they could not improve without a class. It can be concluded that Spanish students value highly the teacher-class framework for language learning. Although a shift towards greater independence in language learning is positive, it would be unwise to promote this aspect {{at the expense of the}} traditional teacher-class structure. The ideal solution would be to incorporate aspects of learner training and greater autonomy within the existing structures, or to seek ways of integrating the affective and organizational aspects of the teacher-class system into more <b>independent</b> <b>modes</b> of learning. 1...|$|R
