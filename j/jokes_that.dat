5|$|Warner Home Video {{released}} a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> were included on prior DVD releases, {{and are therefore}} presented in their NBC broadcast versions.|$|E
5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, Faramir {{is played by}} David Wenham. The actor <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> he got the role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in Unfinished Tales, lacked beards.|$|E

"The {{fact was}} earnest," [...] our friend maintained, [...] "but {{the spirit in}} which it was {{realized}} was that of a brotherly persuasion that I would see the affair in its true light, as a <b>joke</b> <b>that</b> was on me. It was a <b>joke</b> <b>that</b> cost me thirty dollars." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is very simple," [...] {{replied the}} other. [...] "Hitherto {{it was the}} ruin of a <b>joke</b> <b>that</b> people did not see it. Now it is the sublime victory of a <b>joke</b> <b>that</b> people do not see it. Humour, my friends, is the one {{sanctity}} remaining to mankind. It {{is the one thing}} you are thoroughly afraid of. Look at that tree." ...|$|R
5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Settling in California, Đujić {{played an}} {{important}} role in Serbian émigré circles and founded the Ravna Gora Movement of Serbian Chetniks alongside other exiled Chetnik fighters. He later retired to San Marcos, where he wrote poems and <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> were published in both the United States and Serbia. He was instrumental in perpetuating Chetnik ideas in the Yugoslav Wars and controversially appointed Vojislav Šešelj as a Chetnik vojvoda in 1989. In 1998, Đujić said that he regretted awarding the title to Šešelj on account of his involvement with Slobodan Milošević. On 21 May 1998, Biljana Plavšić, President of the Republika Srpska at the time, awarded him the Order of the Star of Karađorđe (First Class). Đujić died at a hospice in San Diego in 1999, aged 92.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's love {{of music}} led him to serve for twenty years as {{chairman}} of the council of Hymns Ancient & Modern Ltd. During this time the company expanded its scope. From producing the hymnbooks Hymns Ancient and Modern (A), and The English Hymnal, it also took ownership of Canterbury Press, SCM Press, and the Church Times, leading to <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> Chadwick was an ecclesiastical Rupert Murdoch. He was heavily involved in the editorial process leading to the supplements to A, 100 Hymns for Today, More Hymns for Today, Worship Songs Ancient and Modern, and Hymns Ancient and Modern New Standard, which combined the best of the original book with that from the supplements into a single volume, and also the most recent revision, Common Praise. He had particularly argued for the inclusion of the Spiritual, Steal Away, and this was amongst the music used at his funeral.|$|E

5|$|Godley {{continued}} as divisional commander {{for most of}} the campaign at Gallipoli. Of tall stature, he made constant tours of the front line amidst <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> the communication trenches needed to be dug deeply to allow for his height. On one visit to Quinn's Post on 7 May, he personally directed troop deployments to counter a potential Turkish counterattack. Despite his inspections, his reputation amongst the rank and file of the division did not improve. Nor was his co-ordination of offensive operations sound; during the August offensive, his lack of oversight allowed one of his brigade commanders, Brigadier General Francis Johnston, a British Army officer on secondment to the NZEF, to vacillate over deployment of reinforcements. On the morning of 8 August, the Wellington Infantry Battalion was in tenuous possession of Chunuk Bair but required support to consolidate its position. Johnstone did not order his reinforcements forward until later that day. Crucial momentum was lost and Chunuk Bair was later recaptured by the Turks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This turned him into a heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Every {{category}} has numerous untranslatable <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> rely on linguistic puns, wordplay, and the Russian language {{vocabulary of}} foul language. Below, (L) marks jokes whose humor value critically depends on intrinsic {{features of the}} Russian language.|$|E

25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane than it really is. Hutton is too antic — {{he seems to be}} playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|In his office, Slim {{does not}} keep a {{computer}} and instead prefers to keep all his financial data in thoroughly kept notebooks. Slim is well versed in technology but prefers to write by hand instead of on a computer. Due to the vast size of his business empire, Slim often <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> he can't keep track of all the companies he manages. Carlos Slim is a Maronite Catholic, and {{he is one of}} the prominent backers of Legion of Christ, a Roman Catholic religious institute.|$|E
25|$|He {{has also}} been a {{frequent}} guest panellist for many years on the radio panel games Just a Minute and Trivia Test Match. Rice often <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> he is most recognised in America for his appearance in the film About a Boy. The film includes several clips from an edition of the game show Countdown on which he was the guest adjudicator. His other interests include cricket (he was President of the MCC in 2002) and maths. He wrote the foreword to the book Why Do Buses Come In Threes by Rob Eastaway and Jeremy Wyndham, and featured prominently in Tony Hawks's One Hit Wonderland, where he co-wrote the song which gave Hawks a top twenty hit in Albania.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas II always remembered George and his {{wonderful}} {{sense of}} humour. He would tell great <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> amused his brother very much. Nicholas would dutifully write {{out the best}} jokes on pieces of paper and save them in a box. Years later, the Tsar would be heard laughing by himself in his room, looking through his old box of George's jokes. George's title as Heir Presumptive was passed to his younger brother, Michael, until the birth, in 1904, of Nicholas' son, Alexei. In 1910, Michael named his newborn son, George, after his late brother. This George would also die young; {{he was killed in}} a car crash in 1931 at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|Al Gore {{was unable}} to attend the table reads of the script, so Maurice LaMarche read his lines. He notes in the DVD {{commentary}} that Gore's daughter Kristin, who wrote for Futurama, was also at the table read, and he <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> {{this was one of}} the highlights of his career. Additional voice roles in the episode include Tress MacNeille as Joan Rivers' preserved head in a jar and LaMarche as the headless body of Spiro Agnew. Billy West, who voices Nixon's head, says that his impression of Nixon is not meant to be an accurate impression but it intentionally plays up certain quirks and flaws. West also voices the C-3PO-esque robot which appears early in the Professor's flashback. He accomplished the voice effect by speaking into a coffee cup during the recording of the lines.|$|E
500|$|For example, {{citing the}} {{narrative}} of [...] "Paradise", Rundgren <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> he can't imagine Steinman being at a lakeside with the most beautiful girl in school, but he can imagine Steinman imagining it.|$|E

James Baxter served as the supervising animator for Rafiki.|$|E
500|$|Jeanie leaves, and Bob appears. Bob tells Sidney {{he likes}} dating Jeanie, {{but does not}} plan to marry her. When Sidney <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> Jeanie {{can do better than}} Bob, the larger man {{momentarily}} chokes him. Jeanie sees this, adding to her doubts about Bob. Larry, the assistant stage manager, is also attracted to Jeanie (reprise of [...] "That's the Way it Happens").|$|E
500|$|His {{reputation}} for scholarship endured {{for at least}} a century. In Athens, the comic playwright Strato made <b>jokes</b> <b>that</b> assumed audiences knew about Philitas' vocabulary, and the vocabulary was criticized more than a century later by the influential Homeric scholar Aristarchus of Samothrace in his Against Philitas (Πρὸς Φιλίταν, [...] ). The geographer Strabo described him three centuries later as [...] "simultaneously a poet and a critic".|$|E
