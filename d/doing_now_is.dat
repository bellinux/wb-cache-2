500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. I have had three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, I suppose. But they were actually quite rotten and false, abusive to me. What I am <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> learning to fall in love with myself." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My Man" [...] is a pop and R {{song with}} {{influences}} of electro. described by Nick Levine of Digital Spy as a [...] "sassy R club banger". The song is notably different from her previous ballad, [...] "It's My Time", featuring a more contemporary R sound than the latter. Speaking upon {{the change in}} musical direction, Ewen clarified: [...] "What I'm now <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> really me, [...] so if people don't like it I'm {{going to take it}} more personally." [...] "My Man" [...] opens with electro and bass-driven R beats, synthesizers that are reminiscent of those featured in [...] "Yeah!" [...] by Usher, and later develops into [...] "a pop/R stormer". The lyrical content of [...] "My Man" [...] is about a woman who [...] "pledges devotion to a man who sounds almost too good to be true". Ewen stated that the lyrics were not directed at any man in particular.|$|E
500|$|Scalia was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, {{and his son}} Paul entered the priesthood. Uncomfortable with the changes brought about {{following}} VaticanII, Scalia drove long distances to parishes he felt were more in accord with his beliefs, such as the Tridentine Latin Mass in both Chicago and Washington and also the Latin version of the Mass of Paul VI at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Virginia. In a 2013 interview with Jennifer Senior for New York magazine, Scalia was asked whether his beliefs extended to the Devil, and he stated, [...] "Of course! Yeah, he's a real person. Hey, c'mon, that's standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that". When asked whether he had seen recent evidence of the Devil, Scalia replied: [...] "You know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He's making pigs run off cliffs, he's possessing people and whatnot... What he's <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> getting people not to believe in him or in God. He's much more successful that way". In another 2013 interview, Scalia said, [...] "In order for capitalism to work, in order for it to produce a good and stable society, traditional Christian virtues are essential".|$|E

2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, {{statements}} made by Morsi in 2010, gained wide attention in the Western media, following a report in Forbes magazine on 11 January that criticized big media outlets for having ignored it. In videos posted by MEMRI, Morsi had declared [...] "The Zionists {{have no right to}} the land of Palestine. There is no place for them on the land of Palestine. What they took before 1947–48 constitutes plunder, and what they are <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a continuation of this plundering. By no means do we recognize their Green Line. The land of Palestine belongs to the Palestinians, not to the Zionists." [...] In September 2010, calling the Israelis [...] "blood-suckers", [...] "warmongers" [...] and [...] "descendants of apes and pigs", Morsi said [...] "These futile [...] negotiations are {{a waste of time and}} opportunities. The Zionists buy time and gain more opportunities, as the Palestinians, the Arabs, and the Muslims lose time and opportunities, and they get nothing out of it. We can see how this dream has dissipated. This dream has always been an illusion... This [...] Authority was created by the Zionist and American enemies for the sole purpose of opposing the will of the Palestinian people and its interests." [...] White House spokesman Jay Carney tried to downplay Morsi's remarks, saying that U.S. policy is focused on actions, not words. Morsi later contended that his remarks were [...] "taken out of context", and his exchange with a delegation headed by John McCain was made public: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he said at}} last, {{in answer}} to my looks rather than to my words, [...] "I AM nervous, Dr. Hamilton. I {{have always been a}} timid man, and my {{timidity}} depends upon my frail physical health. But my soul is firm, and I can bring myself up to face a danger which a less-nervous man might shrink from. What I am <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> done from no compulsion, but entirely from a sense of duty, and yet it is, beyond doubt, a desperate risk. If things should go wrong, I will have some claims to the title of martyr." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thank you}} all out of my heart for this fraternal welcome, and it seems almost too fine, almost too magnificent, for a humble Missourian such as I am, far from his native haunts {{on the banks of}} the Mississippi; yet my modesty is in a degree {{fortified}} by observing that I am not the only Missourian who has been honored here to-night, for I see at this very table-here is a Missourian [indicating Mr. McKelway], and there is a Missourian [indicating Mr. Depew], and there is another Missourian--and Hendrix and Clemens; and last but not least, the greatest Missourian of them all--here he sits--Tom Reed, who has always concealed his birth till now. And since I have been away I know what has been happening in his case: he has deserted politics, and now is leading a creditable life. He has reformed, and God prosper him; and I judge, by a remark which he made up-stairs awhile ago, that he had found a new business that is utterly suited to his make and constitution, and all he is <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> that he is around raising the average of personal beauty.|$|E

60|$|But to return: we rowed {{away with}} a hundred confused, but most {{pleasant}} new impressions, amid innumerable salaams to the Governor by these kindly courteous people, and then passed between the larger limestone islands into the roadstead of Chaguaramas, which ought to be, and some day may be, the harbour for the British West India fleet; and for the shipping, too, of that commerce which, as Humboldt prophesied, must some day spring up between Europe and the boundless wealth of the Upper Orinoco, as yet lying waste. Already gold discoveries in the Sierra de Parima (of which more hereafter) are indicating the honesty of poor murdered Raleigh. Already the good President of Ciudad Bolivar (Angostura) has disbanded the ruffian army, which is the usual curse of a Spanish American republic, and has inaugurated, {{it is to be}} hoped, a reign of peace and commerce. Already an American line of steamers runs as far as Nutrias, some eight hundred miles up the Orinoco and Apure; while a second will soon run up the Meta, almost to Santa Fe de Bogota, and bring down the Orinoco the wealth, not only of Southern Venezuela, but of central New Grenada; and then a day may come when the admirable harbour of Chaguaramas {{may be one of the}} entrepots of the world; if a certain swamp to windward, which now makes the place pestilential, could but be drained. The usual method of so <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> to lay the swamp as dry as possible by open ditches, and then plant it, with coconuts, whose roots have some mysterious power both of drying and purifying the soil; but were Chaguaramas ever needed as an entrepot, it would not be worth while to wait for coconuts to grow. A dyke across the mouth, and a steam-pump on it, as in the fens of Norfolk and of Guiana, to throw the land-water over into the sea, would probably expel the evil spirit of malaria at once and for ever.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{is about}} a man who wonders what his former lover is {{currently}} doing and what her whereabouts are ("last I heard she had moved to Boulder").

5000|$|Psychiatrists {{have been}} trying to {{differentiate}} mental disorders based on clinical interviews since the era of Kraepelin, but now realize that their diagnostic criteria are imperfect.

What we are <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> just like trying to diagnose diabetes mellitus without measuring blood sugar." ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 2015, Solomon {{changed his}} stage name to Solomon Ray. He told Out Magazine, Advocate and HIV Plus Magazine, “The music I’m <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} and more refined. I can’t group it together with my older stuff. So I felt {{a new name}} was appropriate. Still Solomon, but just a different ending.” [...] To coincide with his name change the artist released a cover of Beck's [...] "Guess I'm Doing Fine".|$|E

5000|$|The band {{announced}} they were rehearsing and writing {{again for a}} new Waves album. Gash said: [...] "I'm very conscious it's very hard to beat the old songs that people will love. You tend to disappoint people with your follow-up stuff, {{but having said that}} I think what we are <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> better. It is just as song-based so it's not like it's gone somewhere else, but as songs there is some really strong material there.|$|E

5000|$|The record {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, the album has an average score of 75 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews" [...] based on 24 reviews. Writing for Exclaim!, Ian Gormely {{noted that the}} band's ambition was perhaps their sole stumbling block, though pursuing all musical avenues makes the result [...] "overstuffed, awkwardly titled and frequently brilliant." [...] In Drowned in Sound's review of the album, they praised the album's eclecticism and lyricism, concluding that [...] "What they’ve made is a bold body of work that sounds effortless and odd and sophisticated. What they do next {{is likely to be}} stadium-filling and bonkers and brilliant, but it matters little when what they're <b>doing</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> so sensational." ...|$|E
