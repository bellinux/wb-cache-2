40|$|Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI) {{provides}} a valuable framework for practical integration of multiple energy users. Previous studies have introduced {{the idea of}} utilising process <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pockets</b> to assist TSHI. However, these methods are shown to be effective for only some Total Site (TS) problems. As a result, this paper presents a new method for calculating assisted heat transfer and shaft work targets for an example TS problem. Analysis results show that assisted heat transfer increases TSHI only when a process <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pocket</b> spans the TS Pinch Region. The maximum assisted TSHI can be targeted by comparing each <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pocket</b> to the Site Utility Grand Composite Curve (SUGCC) using background/foreground analysis. Where <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pockets</b> span two steam pressure levels away from the TS Pinch Region (usually above), the example shows the potential for assisted shaft work production. In this case, the source segment of the <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pocket</b> generates steam (e. g. MPS), which replaces steam that {{would otherwise have been}} extracted from a steam turbine. The sink segment of the <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pocket</b> consumes lower pressure steam (e. g. LPS), which is extracted from the turbine. If a <b>heat</b> recovery <b>pocket</b> falls outside these two situations (assuming direct inter - process integration is disallowed), the entire pocket should be recovered internal to a process...|$|R

5000|$|Dielectric heating at low frequencies, as a {{near-field}} effect, {{requires a}} distance from electromagnetic radiator to absorber of less than [...] ≈ [...] of a wavelength. It is thus a contact process or near-contact process, since it usually sandwiches the material to be heated (usually a non-metal) between metal plates taking {{the place of the}} dielectric in what is effectively a very large capacitor. However, actual electrical contact is not necessary for heating a dielectric inside a capacitor, as the electric fields that form inside a capacitor subjected to a voltage do not require electrical contact of the capacitor plates with the (non-conducting) dielectric material between the plates. Because lower frequency electrical fields penetrate non-conductive materials far more deeply than do microwaves, <b>heating</b> <b>pockets</b> of water and organisms deep inside dry materials like wood, {{it can be used to}} rapidly heat and prepare many non-electrically conducting food and agricultural items, so long as they fit between the capacitor plates.|$|R
40|$|Infrared {{dark clouds}} (IRDCs) are dense, {{molecular}} {{structures in the}} interstellar medium that can harbour sites of high-mass star formation. IRDCs contain supersonic turbulence, {{which is expected to}} generate shocks that locally <b>heat</b> <b>pockets</b> of gas within the clouds. We present observations of the CO J = 8 - 7, 9 - 8, and 10 - 9 transitions, taken with the Herschel Space Observatory, towards four dense, starless clumps within IRDCs (C 1 in G 028. 37 + 00. 07, F 1 and F 2 in G 034. 43 + 0007, and G 2 in G 034. 77 - 0. 55). We detect the CO J = 8 - 7 and 9 - 8 transitions towards three of the clumps (C 1, F 1, and F 2) at intensity levels greater than expected from photodissociation region (PDR) models. The average ratio of the 8 - 7 to 9 - 8 lines is also found to be between 1. 6 and 2. 6 in the three clumps with detections, significantly smaller than expected from PDR models. These low line ratios and large line intensities strongly suggest that the C 1, F 1, and F 2 clumps contain a hot gas component not accounted for by standard PDR models. Such a hot gas component could be generated by turbulence dissipating in low velocity shocks.

40|$|This paper investigates {{opportunities}} for integration of a Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) process based on thermal gasification of lignocellulosic biomass {{in an industrial}} process plant currently importing natural gas (NG) for further processing to speciality chemicals. The assumed SNG process configuration {{is similar to that}} selected for the ongoing Gothenburg Biomass Gasification demonstration project (GoBiGas) and is modelled in Aspen Plus. The heat and power integration potentials are investigated using Pinch Analysis tools. Three cases have been investigated: the steam production potential from the SNG process excess heat, the electricity production potential by maximizing the heat recovery in the SNG process without additional fuel firing, and the electricity production potential with increased steam cycle efficiency and additional fuel firing. The results show that 217 MWLHV of woody biomass are required to substitute the site’s natural gas demand with SNG (162 MWLHV). The results indicate that excess heat from the SNG process has the potential to completely cover the site’s net steam demand (19 MW) or to produce enough electricity to cover the demand of the SNG process (21 MWel). The study also shows {{that it is possible to}} fully exploit the <b>heat</b> <b>pockets</b> in the SNG process Grand Composite Curve (GCC) resulting in an increase of the steam cycle electricity output. In this case, there is a potential to cover the site’s net steam demand and to produce 30 MWel with an efficiency of 1 MWel/MWadded heat. However, this configuration requires combustion of 36 MWLHV of additional fuel, resulting in a marginal generation efficiency of 0. 80 MWel/MWfuel (i. e. comparing the obtained electricity production potentials with and without additional fuel firing) ...|$|R
50|$|Blubber has {{advantages}} over fur (as in sea otters) in that, though fur retains <b>heat</b> by holding <b>pockets</b> of air, the air expels under pressure (i.e., when the animal dives). Blubber, however, does not compress under pressure. It is effective enough that some whales can dwell in temperatures {{as low as}} 40 F. While diving in cold water, blood vessels covering the blubber constrict and decrease blood flow, thus increasing blubber's efficiency as an insulator.|$|R
40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} of {{the cells}} of the thermogenic appendix of Sauromatum guttatum has revealed a fusion event between pocket-like structures of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and the plasma membrane. As a result of the fusion event, many regions of the plasma membrane have paired unit membranes (four leaflets instead of two). The fusion allows the transfer of osmiophilic material from the rER pockets to the plasma membrane, where the osmiophilic material is confined to bilayer, pocket-like structures. A clear correlation is found between the presence of the osmiophilic compound and sesquiterpenes. Prior to heat production, the rER- and plasma-membrane pockets are electron dense, and sesquiterpenes are detectable only in tissue extracts. On the day of <b>heat</b> production, electron-translucent <b>pockets</b> are subsequently found and the stored sesquiterpenes are released to the atmosphere. Three sesquiterpenes have been identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as alpha-copaene and beta- and alpha-caryophyllene...|$|R
40|$|Cities often {{experience}} a distinguished climate termed the “Urban Climate”. Urban climates {{are characterized by}} differences in climatic variables (air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and amount of precipitation) from those of less built-up areas. The major factors contributing to these differences are the land use and land cover transformations. These land use changes often includes replacements of natural surfaces with highly reflective parking lots, concrete masses, asphalt roads etc affecting the thermal environment in cities. Researches show that urban places are warmer than surrounding rural environments and are generally termed as "urban heat island". The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the variations in the thermal environment that exists throughout the city due to different land cover conditions. This study analyzes the land surface temperature differences in the city of Chennai and compares with the land use and land cover types using TM and ETM+ data of 1991 and 2000. The data indicated the increase in urban built up areas and the reduction of vegetated areas. The thermal band of Landsat TM is used in identifying the specific locations of micro urban heat islands with in the city. From the study it is evident that the <b>heat</b> island <b>pockets</b> are obviously going up, not only increased in area but also in intensity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an {{infection}} of the subcutaneous tissue leading to chronic necrotizing skin ulcers. The causative pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans, grows best at 30 degrees C- 33 degrees C and not above 37 degrees C. We explored the safety, tolerability and efficacy of phase change material (PCM), a novel heat application system for thermotherapy of BU. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a prospective observational single centre proof-of-principle trial in Ayos/Cameroon, six laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative Buruli lesions received 28 - 31 (ulcers 2 cm) days of thermotherapy with the PCM sodium acetate trihydrate as heat application system. This PCM is widely used in commercial <b>pocket</b> <b>heat</b> pads, {{it is easy to}} apply, rechargeable in hot water, non-toxic and non-hazardous to the environment. All patients enrolled in the trial completed treatment. Being completely mobile during the well-tolerated heat application, acceptability of the PCM bandages was very high. In patients with smaller ulcers, wounds healed completely without further intervention. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment. Heat treatment was not associated with marked increases in local inflammation or the development of ectopic lymphoid tissue. One and a half years after completion of treatment, all patients are relapse-free. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our reusable PCM-based heat application device appears perfectly suited to treat BU in endemic countries with limited resources and infrastructure.

40|$|Fifteen Lateglacial to Holocene rhyolitic, dominantly primary tephra layers piston-cored and drilled (ICDP Paleovan {{drilling}} project) {{in western}} Lake Van (eastern Anatolia, Turkey) were precisely correlated {{to either of}} the two adjacent and active large volcanoes Nemrut and Süphan based on shard textures, mineralogy and mineral and glass compositions. The young peralkaline (comenditic to pantelleritic) primary rhyolitic Nemrut tephras are characterized by anorthoclase, hedenbergitic to augitic clinopyroxene, fayalitic olivine, minor quartz, and rare accessory chevkinite and zircon. Phenocrysts in subalkaline primary rhyolitic Süphan tephras are chiefly oligoclase-labradorite, with minor K-rich sanidine in some, biotite, amphibole, hypersthene, rare augitic clinopyroxene, relatively common allanite and rare zircon. Two contrasting explosive eruptive modes are distinguished from each other: episodic (Süphan) and periodic (Nemrut). The Lateglacial Süphan tephra swarm covers a short time interval of ca. 338 years between ca. 13, 078 vy BP and 12, 740 vy BP, eruptions having occurred statistically every ca. 42 years with especially short intervals between V- 11 (reworked) and V- 14. Causes for the strongly episodic Süphan explosive behavior might include seismic triggering of a volcano–magma system unable to erupt explosively without the benefit of external triggering, as reflected in pervasive faulting preceding the Süphan tephra swarm. Seismic triggering may have caused the rise of more mafic (“trachyandesitic”) parent magma, <b>heating</b> near-surface <b>pockets</b> of highly evolved magma – that might have formed silicic domes during this stage of volcano evolution – resulting in ascent and finally explosive fragmentation of magma essentially by external factors, probably significantly enhanced by magma–water/ice interaction. Explosive eruptions of the Nemrut volcano system, interpreted to be underlain by a large fractionating magma reservoir, follow a more periodic mode of (a) long-term relatively constant supply of parent magma, (b) evolution by low pressure crystal fractionation resulting in sporadic relatively low-volume eruption of trachytic and minor rhyolitic magmas, (c) evolution of a large magma reservoir to the point of highly explosive large-volume peralkaline rhyolitic Plinian eruptions at temporal intervals of ca. 20 – 40 ky, some accompanied by ignimbrites and inferred caldera collapse. A striking tephra gap between ca. 14 ka and ca. 30 ka, i. e. during glacial climate conditions, is postulated to be due to climate-forcing via lithosphere unloading following deglaciation...|$|R
40|$|Assuming {{a closed}} {{universe}} with slight positive curvature, cosmic expansion is modeled as a heat engine where the '"system'" is defined collectively as those regions of space within the observable universe which will later evolve into voids or empty space, and the '"surroundings'" are identified collectively as those pockets of space which will eventually develop into matter filled galaxies, clusters, super-clusters and filament walls. Using this model, {{we show that}} the energy needed for cosmic expansion can be found using basic thermodynamic principles, and that cosmic expansion had as its origin, a finite initial energy density, pressure, volume, and temperature. Inflation in the traditional sense, with the inflaton field, may also not be required {{as it can be}} argued that homogeneities and in-homogeneities in the WMAP temperature profile can be attributed to quantum mechanical fluctuations about a fixed background temperature in the initial isothermal expansion phase. Fluctuations in temperature can cause certain regions of space to lose <b>heat</b> to other <b>pockets</b> producing voids forcing, i. e., fueling expansion of the latter and creating slightly cooler temperatures in the former, where matter will later congregate. Upon freeze-out, this could produce the observed WMAP signature with its associated CBR fluctuation in magnitude. Finally, we estimate that the freeze-out temperature and time for WMAP in-homogeneities occurred at roughly 3. 02 * 1027 K and 2. 54 * 10 - 35 s, respectively, after first initiation of volume expansion, in line with current estimates for the end of the inflationary epoch. The work done in the inflationary phase is estimated to be W = 1. 45 * 1095 J, and the system volume increases by a factor of only 5. 65.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 223 - 242 The {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearing}} load capacity-speed envelope {{is divided into}} three major regions by speed. Each region has its own set of limiting physical phenomenon that must be included in the analysis and presents a design challenge. For instance, the high speed region has high lubricant shear rates possibly including turbulence that change pad thermal crowning and local babbitt temperature and pressure, thus limiting the bearing performance in terms of load and speed. Various design tools are used to set the bearing geometry such that the phenomenon limits are not exceeded, and an appropriate design safety factor is present. Several applications are presented that illustrate how the various design modifications such as pivot type, pivot radial and circumferential offset, pad spacing, and pad thickness may be varied to design a thrust bearing for a specific region. Three dimensional finite element models for the fluid film generate film thickness, pressure and temperature distributions, which when coupled with a pad finite element model for thermal conduction, convection, thermal deflection, and elastic deflection show thrust bearing pad performance. Turbulence is included along with hot oil carryover from the previous pad. Methods are shown that reduce vibratory motion by using the squeeze film damping attributes of double thrust bearings. The benefits of offset pivot, chrome copper pads, and controlled lubrication in a load-speed region are reviewed so that the user has an appreciation of how each feature is affecting his thrust bearing's performance. Of primary interest {{is an example of a}} high speed application where controlled lubrication increased machine efficiency by minimizing parasitic losses. Three dimensional maps of velocity, fluid mixing, temperature, and viscous <b>heating</b> in the <b>pocket</b> result in two dimensional temperature fields at the pad entrance. Accurate determination of the pad entrance temperature distribution allows for calculation of the pad maximum temperatures or bearing capacity.

40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) hits {{thousands}} of individuals {{every year in}} over 30 countries worldwide, primarily children in remote areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This devastating necrotizing skin infection is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, a cytotoxic macrolide producing environmental pathogen. The disease distorts and cripples those affected and has great socio-economic impact on people living in endemic regions. Currently recommended treatment options are surgical excision of the lesion, systemic administration of as rifampicin and streptomycin (R-S) {{or a combination of}} both. Clinical diagnosis of BU lesions requires the expertise of a skilled physician or health worker, and proper medical care is expensive, time-consuming or not available at all in many BU endemic regions of Africa. Thus, rapid diagnostic tools as well as improved established or new alternative therapies which are safe, inexpensive and easy to handle in a rural setting are urgently needed and the present work focused on these important issues. Histopathological hallmark of progressing BU disease is a poor inflammatory response despite clusters of extracellular bacilli inside necrotic subcutaneous areas. We conducted detailed histopathological studies on the efficacy of chemotherapy with R-S to restore the local immune responses in early (nodule and plaque) and late (ulcerative) BU lesions, respectively. In early lesions AFB internalized by macrophages and neutrophils were already found after two to four weeks of treatment and started to display irregular ZN staining after eight weeks. Final clearance of the bacterial load depended on the initial size of clusters and the surrounding necrosis. After eight weeks of R-S therapy ulcerative lesions comprised only mycobacterial debris inside focally distributed mononuclear phagocytes. Local cellular immune responses were re-activated very quickly (after two weeks acute infiltration was already prominent) and developed further during the course of antibiotic therapy, resulting in the formation of ectopic tertiary lymphoid tissue. Granulomas and other lymphoid structures developed both in early and late stage lesions in the course of antibiotic treatment, but only nodules and plaques showed abscessus formation, severe haemorrhages and extensive necrosis after completion of eight to twelve weeks chemotherapy. Administration of R-S is efficacious to cure BU, but immunopathological adverse events due to a chronic overreaction of the immune system may cause healing retardation. Thus, treatment strategies have to be further improved. Our results demonstrate that histopathology can serve as a valuable tool for efficacy evaluation. M. ulcerans grows best at temperatures around 30 °C and not above 37 °C and this property makes the application of heat a treatment option. We employed the phase change material sodiumacetatetrihydrate which is widely used in commercial <b>pocket</b> <b>heat</b> pads as a heat application system for thermotherapy. Laboratory reconfirmed patients with ulcerative BU lesions were included in a proof of principle study and treated for four to six weeks. Patients with large defects had skin grafting after successful heat treatment while smaller ulcers healed completely without further intervention. Punch biopsies were analysed for histopathological changes and local immunological reactions during heat therapy. While massive cellular infiltration was observed during antibiotic therapy, the extent of total leukocyte infiltration in the lesion did not increase during thermotherapy. This may favour a rapid transition from inflammation to healing, as indicated by the clinical response to heat treatment, which was characterized by an extraordinarily rapid epithelization and healing process. All patients remained relapse-free within twelve months of follow-up suggesting thermotherapy a future treatment option for BU. ...|$|R
