5000|$|Placa {{was placed}} on an {{administrative}} leave of absence by the Catholic church following an accusation of misconduct. Subsequently, a grand jury published a report accusing him of misconduct in sexually molesting a teenager and for covering up molestation by other priests. No criminal charges were subsequently filed. He was subsequently cleared by a church tribunal and that action was upheld by the Vatican. The Tribunal was to last 6 weeks according to Father David Berberian. It lasted over 2 years with the church delaying, rescheduling, and moving the tribunal dates repeatedly. The <b>decision</b> <b>date</b> by the church was completed after Alan Placa's 65th birthday, enabling him to be [...] "exonerated" [...] and immediately retire, by permission of Bishop Murphy of the Rockville Centre Diocese.

5000|$|A curious case {{of dynamic}} {{inconsistency}} in psychology {{is described by}} [...] In the experiment, subjects {{of the study were}} offered free rentals of movies which were classified into two categories - [...] "lowbrow" [...] (e.g., The Breakfast Club) and [...] "highbrow" [...] (e.g., Schindler's List) - and researchers analyzed patterns of choices made. In the absence of dynamic inconsistency, the choice would be expected to be the same regardless of the delay between the <b>decision</b> <b>date</b> and the consumption date. In practice, however, the outcome was different. When subjects had to choose a movie to watch immediately, the choice was consistently lowbrow {{for the majority of the}} subjects. But when they were asked to pick a movie to be watched at later date, highbrow movies were chosen far more often. Among movies picked four or more days in advance, over 70% were highbrow.|$|E
5000|$|The news {{leading up}} to the <b>decision</b> <b>date</b> {{suggested}} a high likelihood of the regional metropolitan sewerage district regaining control, though the representation issues were not specifically worked out. On April 13, 2012, the study committee released a unanimous decision:"The General Assembly should mandate that the $173.5 million system be transferred to the public body that runs Buncombe’s sewage system by 2013...Or the city and the Buncombe County Metropolitan Sewerage District can first work out a deal." [...] As Representative Moffitt stated, [...] "taking the system from the city would ensure that water customers outside Asheville would never be charged higher rates than city residents." [...] Thereby, the study committee's recommendation continues to uphold the Sullivan Acts. The Asheville City Council seems to be against the decision, though no official statement has been released. Overall, based on the study committee's report, privatization and consolidation of the region's water resources seem to be an end-goal.|$|E

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} of two variants of a dating game that entails picking a grant date ex post, that is, after the board's compensation decision is made: back-dating (picking a date before the board <b>decision</b> <b>date),</b> and forward-dating (waiting after the board <b>decision</b> <b>date</b> to observe the stock price behavior). Consistent with back-dating, we find stock return behavior around the grant date to be positively related to reporting lag. In the promptly reported sample, we find stock return behavior and the pattern of reporting lags consistent with forward-dating. Our calculations show that managers can obtain economically significant benefits by playing the dating game., Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} GNMA prepayment determinants {{as a function}} of interest-rate factors and the pure aging effect. While we find both interest-rate and age factors to be important, these relationships are not constant across different pools. This suggests that prepayment forecasts need to be made on a pool-by-pool basis. The study also documents a lagged relationship between changing interest rates and prepayment experience, suggesting that the prepayment <b>decision</b> <b>date</b> is made many months before the prepayment recording date. ...|$|E

We provide numerical examples with realistic parameter values showing that the presence of stochastic convenience yields has {{a significant impact on the}} value of the project.

40|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} 492, 903 asylum hearings from 336 different hearing locations, rendered by 441 unique judges over a thirty-two year period from 1981 - 2013. We define {{the problem of}} asylum adjudication prediction as a binary classification task, and using the random forest method developed by Breiman [2], we predict twenty-seven years of refugee decisions. Using only data available up to the <b>decision</b> <b>date,</b> our model correctly classifies 82 percent of all refugee cases by 2013. Our empirical analysis suggests that decision makers exhibit a fair degree of autocorrelation in their rulings, and extraneous factors such as, news and the local weather may be impacting the fate of an asylum seeker. Surprisingly, granting asylum is predominantly driven by trend features and judicial characteristics- features that may seem unfair- and roughly one third-driven by case information, news events, and court information...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to price options {{embedded}} in bonds in a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework, the focus being on call and put options with advance notice. The pricing of interest rate derivatives was usually done via trees or finite differences. Trees are not really very efficient as they deform crudely the dynamic of the underlying asset(s), here the short term risk-free interest rate. They can be interpreted as elementary DP procedures with fixed grid sizes. For a long time, finite differences presented poor accuracy because of the discontinuities of the bond’s value that may arise at <b>decision</b> <b>dates.</b> Recently, remedies were given by d’Halluin et al (2001) via techniques related to flux limiters. DP does not suffer from discontinuities that may arise at <b>decision</b> <b>dates</b> and does not require a time discretization. It may also be implemented in discrete-time models. Results show efficiency and robustness. Suggestions to combine DP and finite differences are also formulated...|$|R
