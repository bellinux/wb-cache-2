A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> hydraulic pressure, {{which in turn}} caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E
