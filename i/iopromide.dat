This work reports on the cathodic dehalogenation of the ICM <b>iopromide</b> in a bioelectrochemical system (BES), fed with acetate at the anode and <b>iopromide</b> at the cathode. When the granular graphite cathode potential was decreased from - 500 to - 850 mV vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), the <b>iopromide</b> removal and the iodide release rates increased from 0 to 4. 62 ± 0. 01 mmol m(- 3) TCC d(- 1) and 0 to 13. 4 ± 0. 16 mmol m(- 3) TCC d(- 1) (Total Cathodic Compartment, TCC) respectively. Correspondingly, the power consumption increased from 0. 4 ± 1 to 20. 5 ± 3. 3 W m(- 3) TCC. The Coulombic efficiency of the <b>iopromide</b> dehalogenation at the cathode was less than 1 %, while the Coulombic efficiency of the acetate oxidation at the anode was lower than 50 % at various granular graphite cathode potentials. The results suggest that <b>iopromide</b> could be completely dehalogenated in BESs when the granular graphite cathode potential was controlled at - 800 mV vs SHE or lower. This finding was further confirmed using mass spectrometry to identify the dehalogenated intermediates and products of <b>iopromide</b> in BESs.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{changes in}} urinary {{viscosity}} in the renal tubules following administration of a high-viscosity iso-osmolar contrast agent (iodixanol) to that observed following administration of a less viscous, higher osmolar contrast agent (<b>iopromide)</b> in anesthetized rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 rats were studied. Experiments {{were approved by}} the Berlin, Germany, animal protection administration. A viscometer was developed to measure viscosity in minute samples (7 microL). Urine was collected, viscosity was measured (at 37 degrees C), and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was determined by means of creatinine clearance. Boluses of 1. 5 mL of iodixanol (320 mg iodine per milliliter, iso-osmolar to plasma, high viscosity) or <b>iopromide</b> (370 mg iodine per milliliter, higher osmolality and lower viscosity than iodixanol) were injected into the thoracic aorta. There were five groups (seven rats per group). Groups 1 (iodixanol) and 2 (<b>iopromide)</b> had free access to water prior to the experiment; groups 3 (iodixanol) and 4 (<b>iopromide)</b> received an additional infusion of isotonic saline (4 mL/kg/h). Group 5 was treated as group 1 but received only 0. 75 mL of iodixanol. The observation period was 100 minutes. Statistical comparisons were made by means of nonparametric procedures (Friedman test, Kruskal-Wallis test). RESULTS: Iodixanol increased urine viscosity from 0. 69 to 36. 7 mm(2) /sec; thus, urine became threefold more viscous than native iodixanol solution. The increase in urine viscosity after injection of <b>iopromide</b> was from 0. 73 to 2. 3 mm(2) /sec. While GFR was not significantly affected by <b>iopromide,</b> GFR transiently decreased by 50 % after administration of iodixanol. <b>Iopromide</b> had a diuretic effect twofold {{greater than that of}} iodixanol. Saline infusion blunted the viscosity rise and transient decline in GFR caused by iodixanol, as did reducing the iodixanol dose by 50 %. CONCLUSION: Contrast media, in particular iodixanol, increase urine viscosity (which is equal to tubular fluid viscosity in the collecting ducts); in response to iodixanol, GFR markedly decreases. Saline infusion attenuates this response, thus potentially explaining the protective effects of volume expansion in contrast medium-induced nephropathy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the nephrotoxicity of two contrast media (CM), with different physicochemical characteristics: diatrizoate (ionic high-osmolar), <b>iopromide</b> (nonionic low-osmolar). Intravenous urography was performed in 34 patients: 17 were examined with diatrizoate and 17 with <b>iopromide,</b> randomly assigned. Different parameters of glomerular and tubular function were measured before and at 6, 24, and 48 h after urography. Both contrast media induced a reversible increase of urine enzymes, which was significantly higher after diatrizoate, In particular diatrizoate determined a relevant increase of brush border enzymes gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and of cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), while, after <b>iopromide</b> increases of urinary enzymes were less evident and were significant only for GGT and ALP. In addition, diatrizoate affected other tubular functions (clearances of phosphorus and uric acid) and slightly decreased glomerular function in a few patients. In no case did these glomerular and tubular effects have a clinical relevance. In conclusion, the nonionic low-osmolar contrast medium <b>iopromide</b> appeared less nephrotoxic than diatrizoate.

New non-ionic contrastagents are subdivided into low osmolar agents such as <b>iopromide</b> and iso-osmolaragents such as iodixanol. Regarding different biochemical characteristics, these agentsare different in the allergic reactions and contrast enhancement and final lesion conspicuity. Objectives: This study was carried out to compare allergic adverse effects and contrastenhancement between iodixanol and <b>iopromide.</b> Patients and Methods: One-hundred and twenty patients who were referred for abdominalCT scan to Besat Hospital were included in this study. Patients were randomly dividedinto two groups (A & B). Group A received 100 cc iodixanol (300 mgI/mL) and group B received 100 cc <b>iopromide</b> (300 mgI/ml) by power injector. CT examination was performedusing Helical CT Scanner (Somatom, Siemens, Germany). Sixty seconds after injection,images were obtained and enhancement of port, liver and aorta were determined. Allergicadverse effects were recorded one hour and up to one week after injection. Results: Iodixanol produced a significantly greater enhancement of the hepatic, aortaand portal vein than <b>iopromide</b> (P < 0. 01). Sixty seconds after injection, associated painand heat sensation were less frequent in iodixanol in comparison with <b>iopromide</b> (P = 0. 03).

The influence of various parameters {{on the performance of}} the treatment process has been considered, namely the UV irradiation light intensity, the initial concentrations of <b>iopromide</b> and peroxydisulfate, and the initial solution pH. <b>Iopromide</b> degradation increased with UV light intensity and peroxydisulfate concentration, but decreased with initial pH. Under specific conditions complete removal of <b>iopromide</b> was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation (loss of solution TOC) within 80 min.

Endothelial denudation did not influence the ability of either iodixanol or <b>iopromide</b> to relax the aortic ring preparations. <b>Iopromide</b> was significantly more potent than iodixanol when expressed in terms of iodine concentration (mg I ml− 1), but both agents were equipotent when expressed in terms of molarity (mM).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{present study}} was {{designed}} to test the efficacy of paclitaxel added to the contrast agent <b>iopromide</b> in the prevention of restenosis. BackgroundContrast media adhere to the coronary vessel wall for some seconds after injection. Such a layer of contrast agent could serve as a matrix for antiproliferative drugs. MethodsThirty-four stents were implanted into the left anterior descending and circumflex coronary arteries of 17 pigs, using a 1. 2 : 1. 0 overstretch ratio. The unsupplemented contrast agent iopromide- 370 was used as a control; the treatment groups were treated with 80 ml intracoronary <b>iopromide</b> plus either 100 or 200 μmol/l paclitaxel, or 80 ml intravenous <b>iopromide</b> plus 200 μmol/l paclitaxel. Quantitative angiography and histomorphometry were used to assess comparable baseline parameters between the treatment groups. ResultsA short time incubation (3 min) almost completely inhibited vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, sustained for up to 12 days. Whereas intravenous paclitaxel had no effect, intracoronary application of paclitaxel reduced the diameter stenosis from 55 ± 13 % to 29 ± 18 % and 13 ± 12 %. Late lumen loss dropped from 1. 94 ± 0. 35 mm under the control condition to 1. 19 ± 0. 55 mm with 100 μmol/l paclitaxel and to 0. 82 ± 0. 54 mm with 200 μmol/l paclitaxel. Histomorphometry revealed a corresponding dose-dependent reduction of the neointimal area and restenosis by intracoronary <b>iopromide</b> paclitaxel. Assessment of left ventricular function and myocardial histology revealed no adverse effects of intracoronary paclitaxel application. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that intracoronary application of a taxane dissolved in a contrast medium profoundly inhibits in-stent restenosis.

40|$|The {{degradation}} of iodinated X-ray contrast medium, <b>iopromide,</b> by UV irradiation {{with the assistance}} of combined oxidants of S 2 O 8 2 - and H 2 O 2 has been investigated. The effects of various parameters, including different wavelengths of UV irradiation, UV intensities, initial solution pH levels, dosages of oxidants, dosing sequence, and the presence of non-target organic matters, have been evaluated. The <b>iopromide</b> decay follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The UV at 254 nm exhibits higher decay rate of <b>iopromide</b> than the others (300 and 350 nm) due to stronger photon energy of 254 nm and the relatively higher absorptivity of S 2 O 8 2 -, H 2 O 2 and <b>iopromide</b> nearby this wavelength. Optimum pH level was determined to be around 4. 34. The mechanism is complicated because of the involvement of the scavenging, recombination, self-decomposition and/or stability of the involved oxidant (S 2 O 8 2 - and H 2 O 2) and radicals (SO 4 •- and HO•) as discussed in the paper. <b>Iopromide</b> decay rate is linearly proportional to the [S 2 O 8 2 -], however a nonlinear-optimal rate was observed by varying [H 2 O 2] due to the formation of weaker radicals via overdosing of H 2 O 2. Additionally, the sequential addition of S 2 O 8 2 - to UV/H 2 O 2 or H 2 O 2 to UV/S 2 O 8 2 - was found no better than the UV/S 2 O 8 2 -/H 2 O 2. This is because the quenching of already formed SO 4 •- by newly added H 2 O 2 (or vice versa the quenching of HO• by S 2 O 8 2 -). The simultaneous addition of S 2 O 8 2 - and H 2 O 2, however, will slightly delay the generation rates of SO 4 •- and OH• due to the competition of photons between S 2 O 8 2 - and H 2 O 2, which can reduce both the radical-scavenging reactions and the peak radical concentration in the solution, thus maximizing the utilization of precious radicals. The presence of non-target organics, especially the humic acid, in the UV/S 2 O 8 2 -/H 2 O 2 process will quench the radicals, a pre-treatment is recommended to lessen this problem in real application.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of the low-osmolar CM <b>iopromide</b> and the iso-osmolar CM iodixanol on oxygen consumption (QO 2) in freshly isolated proximal tubular cells (PTC) from kidneys ablated from elderly humans undergoing nephrectomy for renal carcinomas and from normoglycemic or streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Materials PTC were isolated from human kidneys, or kidneys of normoglycemic or streptozotocin-diabetic rats. QO 2 was measured with Clark-type microelectrodes in a gas-tight chamber with and without each CM (10 [*]mg I/mL medium). L-NAME was used to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production caused by nitric oxide synthase. Results Both CM reduced QO 2 in human PTC (about - 35 %) which was prevented by L-NAME. PTC from normoglycemic rats were unaffected by <b>iopromide,</b> whereas iodixanol decreased QO 2 (- 34 %). Both CM decreased QO 2 in PTC from diabetic rats (- 38 % and - 36 %, respectively). L-NAME only prevented the effect of <b>iopromide</b> in the diabetic rat PTC. Conclusions These observations demonstrate that CM can induce NO release from isolated PTC in vitro, which affects QO 2.

We tested the hypothesis that CAD also has an impact on the coronary vasomotor response to radiologic contrast media. Methods and Results—We performed quantitative coronary angiography in 42 patients without angiographic evidence of CAD and 38 patients with CAD in the left coronary artery. Angiographically smooth coronary segments (n 5235) were analyzed for changes on luminal diameters and coronary venous oxygen saturation in response to 3 media: the nonionic dimer iodixanol, the nonionic monomer <b>iopromide,</b> and the ionic agent ioxaglate. In subjects without CAD, we assessed the effects of intracoronary administration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin on such changes. Iodixanol induced coronary vasodilation in subjects without CAD (8. 868. 6 %, P, 0. 001). Patients with CAD exhibited no significant diameter changes in segments $ 20 mm apart from a stenosis (4. 769. 4 %, P 5 NS) and significant constriction in segments, 20 mm from a stenosis (23. 864. 6 %, P, 0. 05). Similar results were obtained with <b>iopromide,</b> but no changes were found with ioxaglate. All contrast media induced transient (, 35 seconds) increases in coronary venous oxygen saturation in all subjects.

The action of iodixanol and <b>iopromide</b> on the vascular wall did not differ and was equal to local flow-dependent vasodilatation induced by a saline bolus (correlation 0 · 95 – 0 · 98). The increase in local luminal area after injection ofIntroduction Endothelial function is commonly tested by assessing diameter changes after application of endothelium-dependent vasoactive substances or flow increase[1]. The resulting local changes of diameter or area are assessed by intra-vascular ultrasound or more often quantitative coronary angiography[2, 3]. Quantitative coronary angi-ography allows the evaluation of several different vascular segments. For quantitative coronary angiogra-phy, however, contrast agents have to be used and these are known to act on the vascular wall by themselves[4 – 7].

While polar organic contaminants are gradually recognized for their impacts on aquatic ecosystems in the Western World, less {{is known about the}} situation in Asia. In developing countries like China, water resources are particularly vulnerable. We investigated the occurrence, elimination, and per capita loads {{of a wide range of}} pharmaceuticals, household chemicals and pesticides in five Beijing WWTPs representative for megacities in China, and compare the efficiency of different treatment processes. Based on initial screening for 268 micropollutants using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 33 compounds were examined in detail. Pollutant concentrations in raw wastewater ranged from 20 mu g L- 1 for caffeine and the contrast agent <b>iopromide.</b> Concentrations in the WWTP effluents were generally < 1 mu g L- 1, except for some pharmaceuticals, <b>iopromide</b> (1. 2 - 18 mu g L- 1), caffeine (0. 025 - 2. 3 mu g L- 1), and the artificial sweetener sucralose (2. 7 - 3. 5 mu g L- 1). Elimination efficiencies varied greatly from < 1 % to close to 100 %, with macrolides, some sulfonamides, metronidazole, <b>iopromide,</b> and 4 -acetamidoantipyrine being the most persistent compounds. Total per capita loads of the investigated micropollutants were lower than in communal wastewater of Europe, amounting to 7. 9 - 12. 2 and 2. 0 - 6. 5 g d(- 1) 1000 inhabitants(- 1) in the influents and effluents, respectively, with an average release of similar to 100 kg d(- 1) by the 11. 4 million people and 2. 3 million m(3) of wastewater treated per day. Since the wastewater effluents are often used for agricultural irrigation, residual organic pollutants pose a threat to food safety, the development of antibacterial resistance, and combined effects of micropollutants in the aquatic environment.

The oxygen tension (PO 2) in the renal cortex and outer renal medulla in 26 rats was studied by use of oxygen microelectrodes before and after injection of x-ray contrast media (CM). The CM, <b>iopromide,</b> ioxaglate and iotrolan were administrated intravenously in iodine equivalent doses (1, 600 mg iodine/kg body wt). Ringer’s solution {{was used as the}} control. In the outer medulla, all three CM induced a decrease in PO 2 : <b>iopromide</b> (N = 6) from 30 ± 3 to 18 ± 4 mm Hg; ioxaglate (N = 7) from 32 ± 6 to 15 ± 4 mm Hg; and iotrolan (N = 6) from 36 ± 3 to 14 ± 4 mm Hg. All these decreases were significant. After the injection of Ringer’s (N = 7) there was an increase from 34 ± 3 to 35 ± 3 mm Hg. In the cortex a slight decrease was noted after injection of CM, but this was significant only after injection of iotrolan.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of an ionic high osmolar {{contrast}} medium (Ioxitalamate), an ionic low osmolar contrast medium (Ioxaglate) and various nonionic low osmolar contrast media (Iopamidol, <b>Iopromide</b> and Iohexol) on thrombus growth in a rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. Thrombus growth {{was determined by the}} accretion of 125 I-labeled fibrinogen onto autologous preformed thrombi in rabbit jugular veins at various time-intervals from 15 min up to 10 h after infusion of the study solution. The ionic low osmolar contrast medium markedly inhibited thrombus growth whereas all nonionic low osmolar contrast media promoted thrombus growth. The ionic high osmolar, contrast medium inhibited thrombus growth, but less than the ionic low osmolar contrast medium. Within the group of nonionic contrast media, the Iopamidol associated promotion of thrombus growth was significantly higher than the <b>Iopromide</b> or Iohexol associated effects. The simultaneous administration of the apparently most potent thrombus growth promoting contrast medium (i. e. Iopamidol) and heparin resulted in complete abolishment of the increase in thrombus growth. These results support the claims of prothrombotic properties of nonionic as compared to ionic contrast media and could explain the clinically encountered thromboembolic complications after the use of nonionic low osmolar contrast medi...|$|E

40|$|Effects of {{contrast}} media and mannitol on renal medullary blood flow and red cell aggregation in the rat kidney. Hemodynamic factors {{may play a}} role in the development of acute renal failure following administration {{of contrast}} media (CM). In this study the effect of intravenous injection of contrast media and mannitol on red blood cell velocity (VRBC) and red blood cell aggregation in renal medullary vessels was studied in 58 rats. Renal medullary blood flow was investigated by a cross-correlation technique and by a visual aggregation score. The CM, namely diatrizoate, <b>iopromide,</b> iohexol, ioxaglate, iotrolan, were given in iodine equivalent doses (1600 mg/kg body wt). Mannitol (950 mOsm/liter) and Ringer's solution were used as controls. The same vessels were studied 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after injections. VRBC decreased significantly after injection of diatrizoate, <b>iopromide,</b> iohexol, iotrolan and mannitol. Ringer's solution and ioxaglate did not significantly alter medullary blood flow, while iotrolan and mannitol caused the largest decreases in VRBC. All CM and mannitol caused both red cell aggregation and cessation of blood flow. The decrease in blood flow and increase in red blood cell aggregation after injection of CM and mannitol may partly explain the occurrence of contrast medium-induced acute renal failure...|$|E
40|$|Liquid chromatography/tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (LC-MS/MS) with electrospray ionization (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) {{was used to}} measure the concentrations of 14 pharmaceuticals, 6 hormones, 2 antibiotics, 3 personal care products (PCPs), and 1 flame retardant in surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents in South Korea. Tris (2 -chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), <b>iopromide,</b> naproxen, carbamazepine, and caffeine were quite frequently observed (> 80 %) in both surface waters and effluents. The analytes of greatest concentration were <b>iopromide,</b> TCEP, sulfamethoxazole, and carbamazepine. However, the primary estrogen hormones, 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol and 17 beta-estradiol, were rarely detected, while estrone was detected in both surface water and wastewater effluent. The elimination of these chemicals during drinking water and wastewater treatment processes at full- and pilot-scale also was investigated. Conventional drinking water treatment methods were relatively inefficient for contaminant removal, while efficient removal (approximate to 99 %) was achieved by granular activated carbon (GAC). In wastewater treatment processes, membrane bioreactors (MBR) showed limited target compound removal, but were effective at eliminating hormones and some pharmaceuticals (e. g., acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and caffeine). Membrane filtration processes using reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration. (NF) showed excellent removal (> 95 %) for all target analytes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A simple, nonhazardous, {{efficient}} and low energy-consuming process is desirable to generate powerful radicals from peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for recalcitrant pollutant removal. In this work, {{the production of}} radical species from PMS induced by a magnetic CuFe 2 O 4 spinel was studied. <b>Iopromide,</b> a recalcitrant model pollutant, was used to investigate the efficiency of this process. CuFe 2 O 4 showed higher activity and 30 times lower Cu 2 + leaching (1. 5 μg L- 1 per 100 mg L- 1) than a well-crystallized CuO at the same dosage. CuFe 2 O 4 maintained its activity and crystallinity during repeated batch experiments. In comparison, the activity of CuO declined significantly, which was ascribed to the deterioration in its degree of crystallinity. The efficiency of the PMS/CuFe 2 O 4 was highest at neutral pH and decreased at acidic and alkaline pHs. Sulfate radical was the primary radical species responsible for the <b>iopromide</b> degradation. On {{the basis of the}} stoichiometry of oxalate degradation in the PMS/CuFe 2 O 4, the radical production yield from PMS was determined to be near 1 mol/mol. The PMS decomposition involved an inner-sphere complexation with the oxide's surface Cu(II) sites. In situ characterization of the oxide surface with ATR-FTIR and Raman during the PMS decomposition suggested that surface Cu(II) -Cu(III) -Cu(II) redox cycle was responsible for the efficient sulfate radical generation from PMS. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|E
