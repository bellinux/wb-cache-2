5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} version of Rome. The game's tutorial section depicts Marius (voiced by John Hopkins) leading the defense of Rome against oncoming Celtic barbarians led by Boudica (Rachel McDowall). Marius hands a small, nondescript sack to a subordinate with the instructions to display <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> elevated position, then helps secure the Roman emperor, Nero (Sebastian Abineri), in a private safe room. At the emperor's behest he begins to tell his story; {{the rest of the}} game is an extended flashback depicting Marius' story up to this point.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Mike Scully and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. Scully got the inspiration for <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> experience in his childhood when he shoplifted. Lawrence Tierney guest starred in the episode as Don Brodka. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|Stowe {{was among}} several authors {{who wrote about}} Florida {{following}} the Civil War. By far, the majority were men who concentrated on hunting prospects, but the women who wrote about the region often used an adolescent narrator who was usually male as a device to describe their encounters with the novelty of what they saw. Stowe wrote simply as herself, something {{that may have been}} allowed because of her celebrity. Gene Burnett, author of Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State writes: Harriet was probably never fully aware of how great had been her influence in advertising Florida to the country, turning <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> obscure down under tip on the map into a beckoning, lush, tropical paradise, to which tens of thousands would flock to help build a state over the following decades. She herself would doubtless have viewed it as a fitting Christian act to help restore a prostrate, defeated brotherland to its feet; Florida's first promoter was merely a Good Samaritan.|$|E

25|$|Herman {{translated}} <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> Arabic translation {{from the}} Greek (jointly with commentaries of Maslamah Ibn Ahmad al-Majriti, {{who worked in}} Córdoba in the 10th century). Western European scholastics became aware of Ptolemy's astronomical views via this translation dedicated to Thierry of Chartres. (This translation {{was for a long}} time believed to be the only surviving link to Ptolemy's original. Later another Arabic translation was found to have been preserved in Istanbul).|$|E
25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{hypothesis}} is as follows: after a lesion, axonal degeneration (via Wallerian degeneration) occurs. The post-synaptic cell consequently becomes deprived of input and becomes more sensitive to neurotransmitters (e.g. creating additional receptors). Subsequently, nearby residual undamaged axons can provide a source of neurotransmitter to the deprived post-synaptic cell. Since the post-synaptic cell is hypersensitive, the neurotransmitters that reach <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> axon of another nerve will successfully provide stimulation. This consequently creates undesired peripheral movement (i.e. synkinesis).|$|E

This is so regardless of the path of the process of interest, and regardless of whether it is an adiabatic or a non-adiabatic process. The reference adiabatic work process may be chosen arbitrarily from amongst the class of all such processes.|$|E

The airport was already defended by a company of Greek Cypriot commandos, a company of ELDYK infantry and a company of Airport paramilitary police, the latter equipped with anti-tank weapons and five M8 Greyhound armoured vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Antarctica {{is almost}} {{completely}} covered by ice, making it uninhabitable by rats. The Arctic has extremely cold winters that rats cannot survive outdoors, {{and the human}} population density is extremely low, {{making it difficult for}} rats to travel from one habitation to another, although they have arrived in many coastal areas by ship. When the occasional rat infestation is found and eliminated, the rats are unable to reinfest <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> adjacent one. Isolated islands are also able to eliminate rat populations because of low human population density and the geographic distance from other rat populations.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{has been}} absorbed into a carrier {{for use as}} a pesticide. Perhaps the most infamous of these is Zyklon B (German > Cyclone B, with the B {{standing}} for Blausäure – prussic acid; also, to distinguish <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> earlier product later known as Zyklon A), it was used in Nazi extermination camps during World War II to kill en masse as part of their Final Solution genocide program. The same product is currently made in the Czech Republic under the trademark “BLUE FUME". Hydrogen cyanide was also the agent employed in judicial execution in some U.S. states, where it was produced during the execution by the action of sulfuric acid on potassium cyanide.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} 1970s, the {{government}} was regarded by Western critics as undemocratic for upholding martial law, for severely repressing any political opposition and for controlling media. The KMT did not allow {{the creation of new}} parties and those that existed did not seriously compete with the KMT. Thus, competitive democratic elections did not exist. From the late 1970s to the 1990s, however, Taiwan went through reforms and social changes that transformed <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> authoritarian state to a democracy. In 1979, a pro-democracy protest known as the Kaohsiung Incident took place in Kaohsiung to celebrate Human Rights Day. Although the protest was rapidly crushed by the authorities, it is today considered as the main event that united Taiwan's opposition.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in {{controversial}} circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied {{what seemed a}} fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try {{was that he did}} not believe anyone could have scored <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.|$|E
