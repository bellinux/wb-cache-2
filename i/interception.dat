5|$|While {{aircraft}} {{were being}} delivered, Bowen, Tizard and Watt pressed the Air Ministry to appoint someone {{to command the}} entire night fighting system, from ensuring aircraft delivery and radar production to the training of pilots and ground crew.

His father raised eyebrows when he questioned whether or not McCoy's team had properly evaluated him for the concussion prior to returning to the game. McCoy stated that he did not remember anything. James Harrison, the Steelers player responsible for the helmet-to-helmet hit on McCoy, was subsequently punished by being suspended for the Steelers' next game against the San Francisco 49ers.|$|E

5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would not lose his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an <b>interception</b> was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second <b>interception</b> could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's Herman Lathers led all {{defenders}} with 12 total tackles, including 2 tackles for loss, both career highs.

5|$|Thanks to the <b>interception</b> {{in the end}} zone, Alabama's offense {{returned}} to the field at its 20-yard line, the regulation starting point after a ball is downed in the end zone.

Zow then completed another first-down pass, this time to Freddy Milons at Alabama 45-yard line. Alexander rushed ahead for a one-yard gain, then Zow threw an <b>interception</b> to Tech defender Ryan Smith, who returned {{the ball to the}} Alabama 36-yard line. After the <b>interception,</b> Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which pushed the Hokies back to their 49-yard line.|$|E
50|$|The 1983 Steelers {{had some}} talent, {{but they also}} had their flaws, and when they turned the ball over and/or were highly penalized {{they were unable to}} make the kinds of plays {{necessary}} to overcome those things.
