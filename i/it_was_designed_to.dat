5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, {{and would have}} studied Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E

Numbered 1027 {{with its}} support wagon 1028, it is a bespoke {{diesel-powered}} vehicle with a crane, inspection platform, mobile workshop, and capacity for a driver and three passengers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> assist with vehicle recovery and track and line repairs.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 {{edition of}} St. Elmo by Hurst & Company is {{sometimes}} marked {{as having been}} drawn from a movie. This is incorrect, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> appeal to theater patrons and copyrighted in January 1910. Another 1910 publication by M.A Donahue includes photographs marked as having been produced by Lawrence Co. of Chicago. It does not indicate that {{it is from the}} Thanhouser production.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its focus}} {{is a real}} world event, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{accurate}} simulation of history. Instead <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> provide balanced and streamlined gameplay.|$|R

5|$|The Centre's main feature, {{the bronze}} {{coloured}} dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that {{was treated with}} copper oxide. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|The M9 Half-track was a {{half-track}} {{produced by}} International Harvester in the United States in World War II for lend-lease supply to Allies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> provide a similar vehicle to the M2 Half Track Car.

5|$|The {{bridge is}} both a {{connector}} and a viewing platform for the park. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also {{designed to be a}} berm noise barrier blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds upward.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> allow a better {{response}} while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|Atlus {{has created}} or hosted media {{dedicated}} to the Persona series. A dedicated magazine originally ran for ten issues between 2011 and 2012, and has been irregularly revived since then. An official talk show released on the official Persona website and Niconico, Persona Stalkers Club, began in February 2014. Hosted by freelance writer Mafia Kajita and actress Tomomi Isomura, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> deepen the connection between Atlus and the Persona fanbase.

5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall. At Acton Burnell the bishop's quarters were well away from the building's main public spaces, and included a latrine. The house was not quite a castle, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> have some defensive capability. The overall form of the structure was of a fortified hall-house, much like the Norman-era hall-keeps. He also built the chapel and great hall in the Bishop's Palace in Wells.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> study the interior {{composition of the}} comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|Development of Xenosaga Episode III began while {{work was}} {{finishing}} on Episode II. While the team {{were open to}} further entries based on the game's commercial performance, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be the last entry in the series. Arai and Yonesaka returned respectively as director and scriptwriter. Takahashi provided the scenario draft and supervised the writing. Episode III released in 2006 in Japan and North America. Episode III was the last game released in the Xenosaga series.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{be carried}} in a coat pocket or kept on a night-stand, and many have survived {{to the present day}} in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also {{produced}} in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> {{replace the}} galleys {{that made up}} the core of the fleets that {{operated}} along the coasts and in the archipelagos of the Baltic Sea. The turuma had a bigger draft, was somewhat slower under oars, but offered superior accommodation for its crew, was more seaworthy and had roughly ten times the number of heavy guns. It could be propelled with either sails or oars and was both smaller and more manoeuvrable than most sailing warships which made it suitable for operations in shallow, confined waters.|$|E
5|$|NigComSat-1, a Nigerian {{satellite}} {{built in}} 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese Long March 3B carrier rocket, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre in China. The spacecraft was operated by NigComSat and the Nigerian Space Agency, NASRDA. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after {{running out of}} power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It {{was based on the}} Chinese DFH-4 satellite bus, and carries a variety of transponders: 4 C-band; 14 Ku-band; 8 Ka-band; and 2 L-band. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.|$|E
