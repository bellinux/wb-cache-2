6000|$|That {{at the end}} of {{the year}} 1780, when, as the Court of Directors affirm, the Company were in the utmost {{distress}} for money, and almost every department in arrear, and when it appears that there was a great scarcity and urgent want of grain at Fort St. George, the said Warren Hastings did accept of a proposal made to him by James Peter Auriol, then Secretary to the Council, to supply the Presidency of Fort St. George with rice and other articles, and did appoint the said Auriol to be the agent for supplying all the other Presidencies with those articles; that the said Warren Hastings declared that the intention of the appointment [...] "was most likely to be fulfilled by a liberal consideration of it," [...] and therefore allowed the said Auriol a commission of fifteen per cent on the whole of his disbursements, thereby rendering it the direct interest of the said Auriol to make his disbursements as great as possible; that the chance of capture by the enemy, or danger of the sea, was to be at the risk of the India Company, and not of the said Auriol; that the said Warren Hastings declared personally to the said Auriol, [...] "that this post was intended as a reward for his long and faithful services." [...] That the President and Council of Bombay did remonstrate against what they called the enormous amount of the charges of the rice with which they wore supplied, which they state to be nine rupees a bag at Calcutta, when they themselves could have contracted for its delivery at Bombay, free of all risk and charges, at five rupees and three sixteenths per bag; and that even at Madras, where the distress and demand was greatest, the supplies of grain by private traders, charged to the Company, were nineteen per cent cheaper than that supplied by the said Auriol, exclusive of the risk of the sea and of capture by the enemy. That it is stated by the Court of Directors, that the agent's commission on a supply of a single year (the said commission being not only charged on the prime cost of the rice, but also on the freight and all other charges) would amount to pounds sterling 26,873, and by the said Auriol himself is admitted to amount to 18,292l. That William Larkins, the Accountant-General at Port William, having been ordered to examine the accounts of the said agent, did report to the Governor-General and Council, that he found them to be correct in the additions and calculations; and that then the said Larkins adds the following declaration: [...] "The agent being upon honor with respect to the sums charged in his accounts for the cost of the articles supplied, I did not think myself authorized to require any voucher of the sums charged for the demurrage of sloops, either as to the time of detention or the rate of the charge, or of those for the articles lost in going down the river; and on that ground I thought myself equally bound to admit the sums acknowledged as received for the sales of <b>goods</b> <b>returned,</b> without requiring vouchers of the rates at which they were sold." [...] That in this transaction the said Warren Hastings has been guilty of a high breach of trust and duty, in the unnecessary expenditure of the Company's money, and in subjecting the Company to a profusion of expense, at all times wholly unjustifiable, but particularly at the time when that expense was incurred. That the said Warren Hastings was guilty of breach of orders, as well as breach of trust, in not advertising generally for proposals; in not contracting indifferently for the supplies with such merchants as might offer to furnish them on the lowest terms; in giving an enormous commission to an agent, and that commission not confined to the prime cost of the articles, but to be computed on the whole of his charges; in accepting of the honor of the said agent as a sufficient voucher for the cost of the articles supplied, and for all charges whatever on which his commission was to be computed; and finally, in giving a lucrative agency for the supply of a distressed and starving province as a reward to a Secretary of State, whose labors in that capacity ought to have been rewarded by an avowed public salary, and not otherwise. That, after the first year of the said agency was expired, the said Warren Hastings did agree, that, for the future, the commission to be drawn by the said agent should be reduced to five per cent, which the Governor-General and Council then declared to be the customary, amount drawn by merchants; but that even in this reduction of the commission the said Warren Hastings was guilty of a deception, and did not in fact reduce the commission from fifteen to five per cent, having immediately after resolved that he, the agent, should be allowed the current interest of Calcutta upon all his drafts on the Treasury from the day of their dates, until they should be completely liquidated; that the legal interest of money in Bengal is twelve per cent per annum, and the current interest from eight to ten per cent.|$|E

However, overly bold receiving was his undoing, as it grew so large and complex a matter to prompt the English government to promote further laws against receiving and related activities, such as the Transportation Act in 1718, also known as [...] "Jonathan Wild Act", and its extension in 1720, which made returning goods for a fee a felony of the same importance and punishment as the crime (theft) related to the <b>goods</b> <b>returned</b> (which meant a capital offence in most cases, with raised potential reward for definitive evidence, from £40 to £140). Eventually, the government decided to directly take action against Wild through lawyers, succeeding in condemning and executing him in 1725.|$|E

John Strode (Governor of Dover Castle) who had a warrant of 21 August 1663 for a grant of a [...] "moiety of what is taken and unaccounted for, and not pardoned by the Act of Indemnity" [...] persisted in the belief that Bridges should be convicted although Lord Ashley pointed out that Strode [...] "may be encouraged by the grant". [...] Bridges married Mary Beale daughter of Bartholomew Beale, of Walton, Shropshire in 1635. His grandson Sir Brook Bridges, 1st Baronet was created a baronet.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{documents}} used in logistics. They are called: invoices, packing lists/slips/sheets (manifests), content lists, pick tickets, arrival acknowledgement forms/reports of many types (e.g. MSDS, damaged <b>goods,</b> <b>returned</b> goods, detailed/summary, etc.), import/export, delivery, {{bill of lading}} (BOL), etc. These documents are usually the contracts between the consignee and the consignor, so they are very important for both parties and any intermediary, like a third party logistics company (3PL) and governments. Document handling within logistics, supply chain management and distribution centers is usually performed manual labor or semi-automatically using bar code scanners, software and tabletop laser printers. There are some manufacturers of high speed document automation systems that will automatically compare the laser printed document to the order and either insert or automatically apply an enclosed wallet/pouch to the shipping container (usually a flexible polybag or corrugated fiberboard/rigid container). See below for external website video links showing these document automation systems.

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{a high level}} of service Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) provide more generous return policies for their products. However, discarding returned parts is neither economical nor environmentally desirable. As a result there is a great need for policies on remanufacturing aftermarket products from returned units. Two of the factors that affect justification of setting up after-market reproduction runs are the flow rate and composition of <b>good</b> <b>returned</b> parts. These factors are stochastic functions of the production rate for the primary product and the reliability of individual subassemblies.
