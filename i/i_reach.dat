He was also given an Honorary Fellowship at his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College. He {{has worked as}} curator on several exhibitions, {{including}} an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. [...] Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch {{had no interest in}} her predecessors, other than those who followed her great grandfather. [...] "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful. [...] I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture – you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> for my revolver.' [...] I think the queen reaches for her mask." [...] His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.|$|E
500|$|Not all the 25men who {{remained}} on Bounty were mutineers; Bligh's launch was overloaded, and some who {{stayed with the}} ship did so under duress. [...] "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> England", Bligh is reported as saying. With regard to Heywood, however, Bligh {{was convinced that the}} young man was as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are {{in a letter to his}} wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood [...] ( [...] a mere boy not yet 16) [...] as [...] "one of the ringleaders", adding: [...] "I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man. Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: [...] "His baseness is beyond all description." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian [...] {{originally}} thought to cast Bligh adrift in Bountys small jolly boat, {{together with his}} clerk John Samuel and the loyalist midshipmen Hayward and Hallett. This boat proved unseaworthy, so Christian ordered the launching of a larger ship's boat, with a capacity of around ten. However, Christian and his allies had overestimated {{the extent of the}} mutiny—at least half on board were determined to leave with Bligh. Thus the ship's largest boat, a [...] launch, was put into the water. During the following hours the loyalists collected their possessions [...] and [...] entered the boat. Among these was Fryer, who with Bligh's approval sought to stay on board—in the hope, he later claimed, that {{he would be able to}} retake the ship—but Christian ordered him into the launch. Soon, the vessel was badly overloaded, with more than 20 persons and others still vying for places. Christian ordered the two carpenter's mates, Norman and McIntosh, and the armourer, Joseph Coleman, to return to the ship, considering their presence essential if he were to navigate Bounty with a reduced crew. Reluctantly they obeyed, beseeching Bligh to remember that they had remained with the ship against their will. Bligh assured them: [...] "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> England".|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> For My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E

2500|$|I now {{consider}} whether the facilities of the [...] institutions are separate but equal, within {{the requirements of}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Are the separate facilities and educational opportunities offered to these Negro plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, [...] "equal" [...] in the constitutional sense, to those available at Claymont High to white children, similarly situated? The answer to this question is often much more difficult than appears, because many of the factors to be compared are just not susceptible of mathematical evaluation, e. g., aesthetic considerations. Moreover, and of real importance, the United States Supreme Court has not decided what should be done if a Negro school being compared with a white school is inferior in some respects and superior in others. It is easy, as some courts do, to talk about the necessity for finding substantial equality. But, under this approach, how is one to deal with a situation where, as here, the mental and physical health services at the Negro school are superior to those offered at [...] the white school while the teacher load at the Negro school is not only substantially heavier than that at the white school, but often exceeds the State announced educationally desirable maximum teacher-pupil ratio. The answer, it seems to me is this: Where the facilities or educational opportunities available to the Negro are, as to any substantial factor, inferior to those available to white children similarly situated, the constitutional principle of [...] "separate but equal" [...] is violated, even though the State may point to other factors as to which the Negro school is superior. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> this conclusion because I do not believe a court can say that the substantial factor as to which the Negro school is inferior will not adversely affect the educational progress of at least some of those concerned. Moreover, evaluating unlike factors is unrealistic. If this be a harsh test, then I answer that a State which divides its citizens should pay the price.|$|E
2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> for my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E
