5000|$|The main {{setting of}} EastEnders is Albert Square, {{where many of}} the {{characters}} reside. Central to the Square is the garden. The garden is home to Arthur Fowler's bench, which was placed there in memory of him. The bench is also known as the 'Bench of Tears', as it is often the place where characters will go and cry. One corner of the square is taken up by The Queen Victoria Public House. There is a B&B and a car lot. The square's design was based on Fassett Square in Dalston, and was given the name Albert Square after Prince Albert. The Queen Victoria, was also given its name due to this. [...] The Queen Victoria public house, known to residents as the Queen Vic or simply 'The Vic', stands south of the square at number 45 Albert Square, where it joins with Bridge Street. East of the pub is a building with 2 flats and west of these in the southwest corner leads off to a walkway through to Turpin Way, on which the Walford Community Centre and Playground are found. To the west of the Queen Vic, across the junction with Bridge Street, is the Beale house, 45 Albert Square. Next to that is 43 Albert Square. In the southwest corner of the square is number 41. Between numbers 41 and 43 is Daisy Lane, a pathway connecting Albert Square to Victoria Square. Daisy Lane was named after the daughter of Series Designer Steven Keogh. [...] On the west edge of The Square there are two houses 18 and 20 Albert Square, which have been knocked through as a single property and then later separated again. It was previously Walford's B&B, 'Kim's Palace'. North of the old B&B is the rear of 55 Victoria Road. A row of five terraced houses line the north edge of Albert Square. The westernmost house is number 31. The property next door is split into two flats. Number 25 is the home of Dot Cotton (June Brown). The easternmost property in the terrace is number 23, which was destroyed in September 2014 by a fire. On the northeast edge of Albert Square is a car lot, south of which is another terrace of three <b>elevated</b> <b>properties.</b> The northernmost house is number 5. A road leaves to the north at the northeast edge of the square, passing by the car lot. The middle house is 3 Albert Square. Most southerly of this terrace is number 1, originally flats with the doctor's surgery on the ground floor, which later becomes a single house.|$|E

Due to their <b>elevated</b> <b>properties,</b> these materials are used for high-performance lightweight constructional components. Applications in tribologically loaded systems often require a defined friction behaviour, which can be gained by an appropriate microstructuring of the surface. Experimental investigations in turning of AA 2124 with 25 % volume proportion of SiC particles have shown that an ultrasonic vibration assistance enables the generation of a microstructured surface in finish cutting without any additive process. Furthermore, an ultrasonic vibration assistance in the radial direction or in the cutting direction respectively leads to stronger compressive residual stresses in the surface layer, which increases the fatigue strength of the components...|$|E

In the past many researchers have proposed <b>elevated</b> temperature mechanical <b>property</b> reduction factors for cold-formed steels, however, large variations exist among them. The LiteSteel Beam (LSB), a hollow flange channel section, is manufactured by a combined cold-forming and electric resistance welding process.

METHODS: At 2, 6, and 12 weeks after birth, complete lipid profiles as well as plasma apolipoproteins levels were assessed in 80 HIV-uninfected newborns, half of whom received NVP and half lamivudine (3 TC), respectively. Newborns were randomly selected from a randomized trial in which NVP or 3 TC had been administered to HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers to try and prevent HIV- 1 transmission from occurring during breast-feeding. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of therapy, the expected physiological decline in HDL-c levels in the newborns was attenuated in infants treated with NVP, compared with levels in those treated with 3 TC. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) levels were higher at all time points in the NVP arm than they were in the 3 TC arm (P=. 02), reaching peak levels at 6 weeks. The difference in HDL-c was no longer significant at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: apoA-I levels and HDL-c were elevated in HIV- 1 -uninfected newborns receiving NVP, compared with those receiving 3 TC.

40|$|Cast nickel base {{superalloys}} are extensively {{used for}} high temperature gas turbine blade applications. The <b>elevated</b> temperature <b>properties</b> in these alloys are optimized through engineered microstructure, {{which is a}} combination of (a) γ-solid solution of Ni with elements such as W,Mo, Cr, Ta, Re etc, (b) γ′ precipitates, and (c) dispersed carbides. Over the years, the demand for high engine efficiency has resulted in the development of new generation superalloys with improved <b>elevated</b> temperature <b>properties,</b> especially creep resistance. These superalloys are highly alloyed with solid-solution strengthening elements and hence, impose greater technological challenges in fabrication. Due to high alloy contents, these alloys are prone to formation of detrimental phases such as the topologically close packed (TCP) phases. These phases may appear in the microstructure during the blade fabrication stages or precipitate out during exposure to high temperature and stress. In addition, the γ′ precipitates can change in morphology, shape and size during applications resulting in deterioration in high temperature mechanical properties, in general. These unfavorable microstructural changes often lead to premature failure in gas turbine engines. While analyzing these failures, the microstructural study provides important information in identifying whether the blades had faulty microstructure to start with or the abnormalities observed have resulted during exposure to service conditions. This in turn can be related to engine operating conditions. In the present paper, this has been demonstrated through analysis of two service failure cases wherein the high pressure turbine blades had failed in flight leading to aircraft accidents...|$|R

The compositions and volume fractions of the equilibrium phases determined by thermodynamic calculation were compared with the experimental results. The addition of transition elements, including Mn, Cr and Ti, increased the volume fraction of the intermetallic phases, which effectively enhanced the high temperature strength of the alloys.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis is an investigation of certain aspects of both the blood pressure (BP) <b>elevating</b> <b>properties</b> and BP lowering properties of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The hypothesis that endothelin (ET) contributes to the exaggerated pressor responsiveness of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) to AVP was tested by comparing the changes of BP, cardiac output (CO), and total peripheral conductance (TPC) to AVP in SHR to those in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) both in the presence and absence of bosentan, a non-selective ET antagonist. Bosentan antagonized the BP responses to exogenous ET- 1 in a competitive fashion. The pressor effects of AVP and Ang II were exaggerated in the SHR compared to WKY. Except for the highest dose of AVP, pre-treatment with bosentan blunted the increases in BP and the decreases in total peripheral conductance (TPC) evoked by AVP in the SHR, {{but not in the}} WKY. In contrast to AVP, bosentan blunted the increases in BP evoked by lower doses of Ang II in both strains, although the effect was more pronounced in the SHR. These results suggest that ET contributes to the hemodynamic effects of AVP in the SHR and to the effects of Ang II in both strains. The findings support the hypothesis that ET contributes to the exaggerated pressor responsiveness of SHR to AVP. Cessation of a 3 hour infusion of AVP (20 ng/kg/min) results in a dramatic and prolonged decrease in BP below pre-infusion basal levels in hypertensive rats, but not in normotensive control rats. This phenomenon has been termed the "withdrawal-induced antihypertensive phenomenon" (WAP). In order to determine the time course of the WAP, and the role of CO and TPC in the WAP, BP was recorded by radiotelemetry and CO was recorded from aonic flowprobes in conscious unrestrained rats before, during, and after a 3 hr i. v. infusion of 20 ng/kg/min of AVP. Baseline mean arterial BP values were lower, and the magnitude of the WAP was less in SHR when BP was recorded with radiotelemetric implants than in another group in which BP was recorded with conventional externalized femoral arterial catheters. Strikingly, absolute BP values recorded both during and after the AVP infusion were similar in the two groups. BP remained decreased for several days in SHR infused with AVP with complete recovery requiring 6 - 7 days. In rats instrumented with aortic flow probes, the fall in pressure following cessation of the AVP infusion was associated with a large decrease in CO below control levels in the SHR. The time-course of the CO responses approximated the time-course of the pressure responses. These results lead to the following conclusions: firstly, telemetry is a superior method for recording BP in hypertensive animals, and the lower magnitude of the WAP was probably related to the lower basal BPs recorded by this method; secondly, the mechanism accounting for the WAP must be of a long duration; thirdly, the WAP is mediated by a fall in CO and not by an increase in TPC. In conclusion, the results of the thesis support the hypothesis that ET contributes to the BP <b>elevating</b> <b>properties</b> of AVP and, consequently, the exaggerated pressor responsiveness of SHR to the peptide, and that the BP lowering properties of AVP are mediated by a fall in CO...|$|R

Recognizing that gas turbine operators extend the service lives of these components beyond warranty coverage, this research should aid in engineering decisions involving the re-use of these A- 286 components. This research also has explored the potential for rehabilitation of A- 286 turbine buckets, which have demonstrated the formation of η-phase.

The joints were created using two solid-state welding techniques; including, {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) and pressure resistance welding (PRW). ODS alloys {{have been shown to}} provide exceptional <b>elevated</b> temperature <b>properties</b> and radiation damage resistance due to the finely dispersed oxides. These oxides, usually on the scale of a few nanometers, pin dislocations and thus improve the alloys’ high temperature strength. Possible applications of ODS alloys include nuclear cladding materials for fuel pellet encapsulation and jet engine turbines. The mechanical strength of the welds and the microstructural evolution caused by welding will be compared using crack growth experiments and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) about the weld zone...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a program}} to develop high temperature/high {{performance}} structural resins for aerospace applications, the chemistry and properties of a novel class of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) were investigated. These IPNs consist of a simple diacetylenic compound (aspartimide) blended with an acetylene terminated arylene ether oligomer. Various compositional blends were prepared and thermally cured to evaluate the effect of crosslink density on resin properties. The cured IPNs exhibited glass transition temperatures ranging from 197 to 254 C depending upon the composition and cure temperature. The solvent resistance, fracture toughness and {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the cured blends were related to the crosslink density. Isothermal aging of neat resin moldings, adhesive and composite specimens showed a postcure effect which resulted in improved <b>elevated</b> temperature <b>properties.</b> The chemistry, physical and mechanical properties of these materials will be discussed...|$|R
