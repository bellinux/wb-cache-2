25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out.</b> Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham when I went out there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of a}} top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
500|$|Mark Kermode {{walked out}} on the film and gave the film a poor review upon its release, but revised {{his view of the}} film over time. In 2016, he remarked, [...] "as a film critic, it taught me that when a film really gets under your skin and really provokes a visceral reaction, {{you have to be very}} careful about {{assessing}} it... I didn't walk out on Blue Velvet because it was a bad film. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> on it because it was a really good film. The point was at the time I wasn't good enough for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Next was Psychosis facing SmackDown! superstar and ECW Original Rey Mysterio, Jr. Mysterio won {{the match}} at the seven-minute mark after {{delivering}} a 619, {{followed by the}} West Coast Pop. The two later revealed that they were disappointed with the way their match panned out. After the contest, the SmackDown! crusaders entered the Hammerstein Ballroom. They consisted of Kurt Angle, JBL and his Cabinet, Carlito and Matt Morgan. The crowd chanted, [...] "You Suck Dick" [...] and [...] "Fuck You SmackDown!" [...] {{as they entered the}} arena. Joel Gertner attempted to interview the invaders, but Angle took the microphone out of his hand and JBL pushed him to the ground. JBL and Angle cut a promo, with the crowd continuing to chant, [...] "You Suck Dick", to which Angle replied [...] with [...] "Your MOTHER taught me how". Angle stated, [...] "The last time I was at an ECW event <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> halfway through because it sucked" [...] (referring to the time Sandman was crucified). The crowd continued to chant, [...] "Shut the Fuck Up", while JBL spoke.|$|E
500|$|Critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4 {{and called it}} [...] "painfully and unremittingly intense" [...] and a [...] "superb example of filmmaking craft." [...] He also stated [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of the theater, there were knots in my stomach from the film's roller-coaster ride of violence." [...] Walter Goodman of The New York Times {{said it was a}} [...] "flaming, flashing, crashing, {{crackling}} blow-'em-up show that keeps you popping from your seat despite your better instincts and the basically conventional scare tactics." [...] Time magazine featured the film on the cover of its , 1986, issue, calling it the [...] "summer's scariest movie". Time reviewer Richard Schickel declared the film [...] "a sequel that exceeds its predecessor in the reach of its appeal while giving Weaver new emotional dimensions to explore." [...] The selection of Aliens for a Time cover was attributed to the successful reception of the film, as well as its novel example of a science fiction action heroine. Echoing Times assessment, Dave Kehr of The Chicago Reader called the film [...] "one sequel that surpasses the original." [...] On the negative side, Gene Siskel described Aliens as [...] "one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses" [...] and that [...] "toward the end, the film resorts to placing a young girl in jeopardy in a pathetic attempt to pander to who knows what audience. Some people have praised the technical excellence of Aliens. Well, the Eiffel Tower is technically impressive, but I wouldn't want to watch it fall apart on people for two hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ben symbolizes {{another kind}} of {{successful}} American Dream for Willy: to catch opportunity, to conquer nature, and to gain a fortune.

[...] "He wowed me into this horrible film, selling it as some {{intellectual}} comment on the sex industry. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> after 45 minutes.

2500|$|In May 1902, the Giants sent catcher Frank Bowerman {{to persuade}} Taylor {{to return to}} the Giants.

Taylor recalled: Frank sat in the grandstand and every time <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> to the pitching mound he kept talking to me with his fingers.

2500|$|Later {{that year}} he mounted {{a show of}} O'Keeffe's works next to some amateurish {{paintings}} on glass by Becky Strand. He did not publish a catalog of the show, which the Strands took as an insult. Paul Strand never forgave Stieglitz. He said [...] "The day I walked into the Photo-Secession 291 [...] in 1907 was a great moment in my life… but the day <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of An American Place in 1932 was not less good. It was fresh air and personal liberation from something that had become, for me at least, second-rate, corrupt and meaningless." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a rare 2002 {{interview}} with the Phoenix New Times, Harris recalled her ambivalence about even bringing the troupe to New York from Chicago. She said, [...] "When I was at Second City, there was a vote about whether we should take our show to Broadway or not. Andrew Duncan and I voted no. I stayed in New York, but only because Richard Rodgers and Alan Jay Lerner came and said, 'We {{want to write a}} musical for you!' Well, I wasn't big on musical theater. I had seen part of South Pacific in Chicago and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out.</b> But it was Richard Rodgers calling!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Uncle Ben: Willy's {{older brother}} {{who became a}} diamond tycoon after a detour to Africa. [...] He is dead, but Willy {{frequently}} speaks to him in his hallucinations of the past. Ben frequently boasts, [...] "when I was seventeen I walked into the jungle, and when I was twenty-one <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out.</b> And by God I was rich." [...] He is Willy's role model, although he is much older and has no real relationship with Willy, preferring to assert his superiority over his younger brother. He represents Willy's idea of the American Dream success story, and is shown coming by the Lomans' house while on business trips to share stories.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Jane Anders in {{the review}} by io9 criticized [...] "the personality-free hero, the {{nonsensical}} plot twists, the CG clutter, the bland romance, the new-age pablum...", concluding that [...] "Shyamalan's true achievement in this film is that he takes a thrilling cult TV series, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and he systematically leeches all the personality and soul out of it — {{in order to create}} something generic enough to serve as a universal spoof of every epic, ever." [...] Anders summarized the experience of watching the film by stating that, [...] "Actually, my exact words when <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of this film were, 'Wow, this makes Dragonball Evolution look like a masterpiece.'" [...] Ain't It Cool News' review questioned why Shyamalan was allowed to write the script, as well as why he was even chosen to direct such a high-profile film after a string of previous flops: [...] "Burdened by [...] never-ending onslaught of expository dialogue awkwardly delivered by actors giving career-worst performances across the board, The Last Airbender is so outrageously bad it's a wonder it ever got before cameras." ...|$|E
5000|$|Welles said {{he would}} not have gone to South America without the studio's {{guarantee}} that he could finish editing The Magnificent Ambersons there. [...] "And they absolutely betrayed me and never gave me a shot at it. You know, all I could do was send wires … But <b>I</b> couldn't <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> on Mr. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply <b>walk</b> away.

2500|$|On 20 November 1944, {{his unit}} was {{released}} from service. Joseph Ratzinger again returned home. After three weeks passed, he was drafted into the German army at Munich and assigned to the infantry barracks {{in the center of}} Traunstein, the city near which his family lived. After basic infantry training, he served at various posts around the city with his unit. They were never sent to the front. In late April or early May, shortly before Germany's surrender, he deserted. Desertions were widespread during the last weeks of the war, although deserters were subject to death if caught. However, diminished morale and equally diminished risk of prosecution from a preoccupied and disorganized German military contributed to the growing wave of soldiers looking toward self-preservation. He left the city of Traunstein and headed for his nearby village. [...] "I used a little-known back road hoping to get through unmolested. But, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of a railroad underpass, two soldiers were standing at their posts, and for a moment the situation was extremely exciting for me. Thank God that they, too, had had their fill of war {{and did not want to}} become murderers." [...] They used the excuse of his arm being in a sling to let him go home.|$|E
2500|$|Birmingham {{remained}} Auden's principal {{home for}} three decades, until {{he left for}} the United States in 1939 (he was noted for going shopping for cigarettes in Harborne in his dressing gown) and he identified with the city throughout his lifetime. Birmingham also featured widely in his work. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>Walked</b> <b>Out</b> One Evening", one of his best-known early poems, moves a ballad constructed {{from a series of}} allusions to folksong and popular culture into the decidedly 20th century context of Bristol Street in Birmingham City Centre. In [...] "Letter to Lord Byron" [...] he rejects the Lake District idyll of William Wordsworth in favour of a decisive if irony-tinged commitment to the contemporary urban landscape of the Midlands, declaring [...] "Clearer the Scafell Pike, my heart has stamped on / The view from Birmingham to Wolverhampton"; before continuing [...] "Tramlines and slagheaps, pieces of machinery / That was, and still is, my ideal scenery". The wider influence of the city on Auden's outlook and work was noted in 1945 by the American critic Edmund Wilson who observed that Auden [...] "in fundamental ways ... doesn't belong in that London literary world – he's more vigorous and more advanced. With his Birmingham background ... he is in some ways more like an American. He is really extremely tough – cares nothing about property or money, popularity or social prestige-does everything on his own and alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler thought {{she looked like a}} Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck {{due to the fact that}} my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E
