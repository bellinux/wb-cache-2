40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of feed additives on the performance, energy digestibility, and body composition of first-cycle laying hens fed two concentrations of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy.</b> The first and second {{experiments were}} 8 wk in duration. The first experiment contained two <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> levels (2, 750 and 2, 850 kcal/kg) with or without the addition of a mannose rich fraction (MRF) from a specific strain of yeast. As expected, no differences in performance parameters including egg production, egg weight, and egg mass were detected, although increased <b>dietary</b> <b>energy,</b> but not MRF resulted in increased total and percentage of hen fat mass as determined by DXA analysis. A similar response to <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> was observed for abdominal fat pad weight, but significance was not achieved (p = 0. 12). Mannose rich fraction treatment increased nitrogen corrected apparent metabolizable energy (AMEn) but the increased <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> did not appear to be stored as increased fat within the hen. The second experiment contained the same two <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> levels (2, 750 and 2, 850 kcal/kg) with or without the addition of an Aspergillus niger derived product created from solid-state fermentation (SSF) containing various enzyme activities. There was a significant SSF by <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> interaction (p = 0. 02) on fat mass of hens in which reduced <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> without SSF resulted in reduced fat mass, but reduced <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> with SSF resulted in increased fat mass.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} impact of trade policy on child malnutrition. Globally, {{interest}} in nutrition has increased significantly and investing in nutrition {{is seen as a}} key development priority to benefit global welfare. The empirical analysis is based on the widely accepted UNICEF (1990) conceptual framework for the causes of child malnutrition. The results reveal that trade openness works to reduce both child stunting and underweight significantly. Taking a closer look at household food security, {{one of the most important}} underlying determinants of child’s nutritional status, we find that, besides national food availability, food access as well as dietary diversity and diet-quality related aspects of food security play a role for child’s nutritional status. In the second part we identify the key determinants of food security, including the agricultural and economic development, as well as {{the impact of}} trade. The results reveal, inter alia, that trade openness and economic growth exert positive and significant impacts on <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> Additional results indicate that besides calorie consumption trade openness also improves dietary diversity and diet quality-related aspects of food security. The last part focuses on child health, which is an important determinant of child’s nutritional status. While much is known about the positive effects of specific behaviors such as care taking and breastfeeding and direct interventions such as vaccination campaigns, much less is known about the indirect effects of specific national-level policies on child health and empirical evidence on the issue is scarce. This study assesses the impact of trade on child health, based on heterogeneous panel cointegration and finds that trade works to reduce the under-five mortality rate significantly in the long-run.

40|$|This paper charts the {{performance}} of the agriculture sector in Malawi for the period 2000 – 2013 (with particular attention paid to the last three to four years of the said period). In the quest to attain this aim the paper empirically focuses on the significance of mapping {{the performance}} of the sector in the form of trends against the baseline sectoral performance targets enlisted in the ASWAP, CAADP Framework and SADC RISDP. The consistent and concerted efforts by the Government of Malawi and development partners to meet the ASWAP, CAADP framework and SADC RISDP targets have resulted in the country making commendable economic growth and poverty alleviation. The country has been able to attain the 6 % agricultural growth target despite the questionable quality of public expenditure. It is also interesting to note that changes in the agriculture sector appear to have had influence on incomes, poverty and malnourishment. The trend analysis led to the following findings; the growth in agricultural GDP and the annual GDP growth of the country surpassed the CAADP target of 6 % annual growth and this culminated to an increase in production (cereal and livestock production) and productivity (land productivity) {{despite the fact that the}} country has not met the irrigation and fertiliser used targets. This increase in production and productivity may be earnestly attributed substantially public invested in the agriculture sector to meet the CAADP 10 % target of the total budget to agriculture. However, this increase in agricultural GDP annual growth has not had a significant bearing on the country’s battle to offset poverty; the country’s GHI is still serious and the proportion of the population below the minimum <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> is still high (23 % on average) whilst the MDG I target stands at 20 %.

The concentrate portion of the ration consisted of dry-rolled corn (45 %), dried distillers? grains (42 %) and a premix (13 %). Diets and feeding levels were consistent with a companion mature cow project. The trial was 17 d long with 11 d for adaptation, 5 d to determine intake and digestion, and a 1 d ruminal fermentation profile. Dry matter intake increased linearly (P 0. 20). Digestion of GE increased linearly from 65 % to 70, 67, and 75 % for treatments 70, 85, 100, and 115 %, respectively (P = 0. 03). Correspondingly, digestible energy intake increased (P < 0. 01) linearly from 9. 6 Mcal/d for 70 % to 15. 6 Mcal/d for 115 %.

40|$|This is {{the final}} outcome of a three-year joint PhD {{programme}} carried out at the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, and at the Friedrich-Schiller University of Jena, Germany, {{within the framework of}} a co-tutelle agreement between the two universities. The first essay (“Vertical price transmission, geographical dispersion and the structure of the Ugandan coffee market”) extends the vertical price transmission analysis through a structural approach, which evaluates whether spatial oligopsony power is prevailing in Ugandan coffee market and in case how strong it is. The first paper tests whether in markets, such as Uganda, where infrastructure quality is poor and transport costs are relevant, geographic dispersion of smallholder farmers allows traders to exploit their market power against farmers with a large impact on market structure and reduction of farmers' welfare. By building upon (Sexton, 1990), the study brings an original contribution to the literature, since (Sexton, 1990) develops just a theoretical model and it is not interested to do any econometric exercise. (Sexton, 1990) employs a single spatial price gap equation instead of a system of well-founded behavioural equations in agricultural markets, which is indeed a major improvement delivered by this essay. Moreover, in this analysis the approach to spatial price gap determination is combined with the oligopsony modelling and SUR technique in order to produce empirically testable hypotheses. Without such transformations the approach by (Sexton, 1990) cannot be employed for any empirical exercise. Indeed, the idea of the role of distance is taken from (Sexton, 1990) and introduced in an original way in a more sophisticated model, which is micro-founded at three levels, i. e. demand and supply of agricultural commodities by traders and farmers as well as conditional demand of inputs by farmers. Since the wholesale-farmgate price spread is net of transport costs, results confirm that geographic dispersion of smallholder farmers plays a significant role on price margin and that there is room for local oligopsony, because traders exploit their market power and overcharge transport and transaction costs to farmers. Indeed, farmers are not able to skip traders in the value chain, because a significant information asymmetry is prevailing in the market. Traders exploit farmers' ignorance because the latter are small and dispersed as well as they lack information about current market prices because of villages remoteness and poor communications with marketplaces (Courtois and Subervie, 2015). Moreover, farmers are not aware of actual transport costs faced by traders, which carry larger quantities of coffee than single smallholder farmers and spread fixed costs over a larger amount of crop. The second essay (“Spatial price transmission and trade policies: new evidence from selected sub-Saharan African countries and crops with high frequency data”) assesses the impact of trade policies on spatial price transmission of maize, rice and wheat in Cameroon, Kenya and Tanzania. This paper improves the existing literature in the field (see, inter alia, Anderson and Nelgen, 2012 a, Anderson and Nelgen, 2012 b and Anderson and Nelgen, 2012 c), because it estimates the impact of tariff and non-tariff trade policies on spatial price transmission in the agricultural markets using monthly data. Employment of monthly data allows assessing more precisely short-lived movements of the analysed series, which could disappear because of aggregation bias at lower yearly frequency, thus providing a better identification of insulation policies. Furthermore, this essay focuses on the impact of both tariff and non-tariff barriers on spatial price transmission by taking advantage of the combination of the FAO-GIEWS (Global Information and early warning system) database and trade policies information from the FAO-FADPA (Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis) with the recent release of the World Bank World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) Database (UNCTAD, 2016) (FAO, 2016) (FAO, 2016 b) (World Bank, 2016). This latest WITS release provides monthly ad-valorem equivalent tariff rates consist of tariff, para-tariff and non-tariff measures. In particular, non-tariff barriers comprises technical measures, such as sanitary or environmental protection measures, as well as others traditionally used as instruments of commercial policy, e. g. quotas, price control, exports restrictions, or contingent trade protective measures, and also other behind-the-border measures, such as competition, trade-related investment measures, government procurement or distribution restrictions (UNCTAD, 2015). The empirical methodologies of this study, like threshold, fractional integration and panel estimation, allow to separately estimate the confounding factors and clean the estimates of the variables of interest from them. In particular, while the confounders cannot be identified, the coefficients of the variables of interest are consistent and they can be properly identified, conditional on the estimate of the confounders. An additional value added of this work is the possibility to separately estimate the impact of trade policies within the two regimes of behaviour of the domestic price series: in the first regime the trend of domestic prices is increasing, in the second one the trend is decreasing. It highlights that trade policies play a role both in case of increasing and decreasing domestic prices, but their relevance is much larger, if prices are increasing. The policy implication is that trade policies were able to insulate the country from the price shocks on the international markets during the food price spike crisis, when it was mostly needed. By presenting high frequency analyses and techniques able to detect non-linearities in the data generating process we thus provide results which are different from the standard literature (Anderson and Nelgen, 2012 b and Anderson and Nelgen, 2012 c). Note however that although the impact of these instruments is proved to be relevant in the short term during the food price spike crisis, these policies could not be regarded as long term solutions. The third essay ("Shocks, price transmission and Food consumption with changes in Price risk aversion) looks seriously at the issue of time variant price risk aversion parameters. This is a fundamental question to address in the investigation of both spatial and vertical price transmission in a risky environment. To this end, the essay assesses the behaviour of farm households, which consume and produce crops at the same time, and answers the following key research questions: i) whether the occurrence of exogenous shocks induces a change of price risk aversion over time and then ii) how the time-varying risk aversion parameter affects production and consumption pattern by the farm households. This research employs the risk aversion parameter introduced by (Bellemare et al., 2013), which takes into account not just the household psychological risk attitudes, but also the market imperfections and availability of institutions which facilitate risk-bearing (Mendola, 2007) (de Janvry et al., 1991). Nevertheless, unlike (Bellemare et al., 2013) the essay develops a microfounded empirical model, where the risk aversion parameter is allowed to change over time and not just across households. This empirical model is estimated within a two-stage structural approach. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that the risk aversion parameter is not constant over time and that households can become more risk averse, if they face adverse market conditions in the previous periods. Furthermore, this paper provides evidence that peasants do not aim just at need satisfaction, but they behave in an optimal way and make sure their food security in the medium term. Indeed, they prefer to increase their income instead of directly consuming the harvested crop, because the reduction of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> derived from the giving up the harvest for sale is more than offset by the rise of food purchasing power due to the larger profits obtained...|$|E

It is aimed {{to be able to}} employ analysis results in real production floors.

Due to existing limitations in predesigned manufacturing lines, cutting depth, feed rate and spindle speed, are chosen to analyze their effects on machine tools <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> All other influencing parameters are presumed constant during research. Evaluating machine tools <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> shows increasing machining factors values reduces <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> in machining operation. Scrutinizing machining factors effect on <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> revealed that, increasing one machining factor when two other factors have constant low or constant high values has different effect on <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> The main contribution of this research is proposing a mathematical model, based on material removal rate and machining time for estimating machine tools <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> In addition, a methodology to find machine <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> profile based on MRR in a particular operation is proposed too. This enables to find critical breakpoints of MRR for <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> in machining operations. Subsidiary effect of increasing Machining factors, on machine <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> is analyzed too. To obtain integrative conclusion regarding the effect of machining factors on <b>energy</b> <b>consumption,</b> their influence should be studied in a production system, for long term.

40|$|Effect of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> {{level on}} female goat kid growth and carcass characteristics: The {{present study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of different <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> levels on performance and carcass characteristics of female goat kids. Graded proportions of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> (8. 5, 9. 5, 10. 5 and 11. 5 MjME/kg) were incorporated in four iso-nitrogenous diets for the experiment. Sixty yearling female goat kids of Nubian ecotype with an average initial weight of 16. 54 kg, were used. These kids were divided randomly into 4 groups A, B, C and D in a complete randomized design. Group A was fed the highest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level (11. 5 MjME/kg) followed by group B (10. 5 MjME/kg), group C (9. 5 MjME/kg) and group D which was offered the lowest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level (8. 5 MjME/kg). The goat kid groups were fed these diets for 105 days. The <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level had a significant effect on body and carcass measurements, where group D which was raised on the lowest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level had the lowest values of body measurements while group A had the highest body measurements. Total gain was 9. 12, 7. 81, 4. 75 and 0. 35 Kg/head for group A, B, C and D respectively, which was highly significant (P< 0. 001). The weekly and daily rate of weight gain and feed conversion ratio were also significantly higher in the goat kid group A that was raised on the highest level of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy.</b> <b>Dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level produced significant effect on carcass characteristics as well as hot and cold dressing percentages. <b>Dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level also produced significant effects on total carcass bone and trim tissues which tended to increase with the decrease of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level. Total carcass fat was significantly decreased as the <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level decreased. The effect of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level was clearly shown in fat distributed throughout the body of the goat kid. Total body, carcass and visceral fat were significantly (P< 0. 01) decreased with the decrease of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level. Generally all non-carcass components weights were significantly affected by the level of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy.</b> These components tended to decrease in weight with the decrease of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level. Yield of wholesale cuts was not significantly affected by the level of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level, except the breast joint which was lower in group D which was raised on the lowest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level. Meat chemical composition was significantly (p< 0. 001) affected by the level of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy.</b> Meat moisture and protein content increased, while fat decreased with the decrease of <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level. Meat quality attributes showed significant effect for water holding capacity and cooking loss, indicating that group A which was raised on the highest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level had superior water holding capacity and lower cooking loss. Meat colour revealed significant (P< 0. 01) effect among the dietary treatments for lightness and redness, indicating that meat from group D which was raised on the lowest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level was darker red in colour than the meat from the other treatment groups. The meat from goats of group A which received the highest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level was the most tender compared with that from the other treatment groups. The <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> levels induced significant (P< 0. 01, P< 0. 05) effects among the tested groups for taste panel scores of flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability. Meat from female goats of group A which was raised on the highest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> was most tender and acceptable than that from the other treatment groups. Exp. II Effect of rehabilitation of underfed female goat kids on growth and carcass characteristics: Seven kids from group D in the first experiment which were raised on the lowest <b>dietary</b> <b>energy</b> level (8. 5 MjME/kg) were used to study the effect of rehabilitation on performance and carcass characteristics of the female goat kids. These kids were found to maintain their initial body weight throughout the feeding period which lasted for 105 days. These goat kids were rehabilitated on the high energy diet (11. 5 MjME/kg) that was offered to group A and were kept until they reached the body weight attained by group A. They took 175 days to reach that weight. Rehabilitation had significant (P< 0. 001) effect on weekly, daily rate of gains and total dry matter intake which were lower in the compensating female goats than the basal group. Dressing percentage increased significantly (P< 0. 05) in the rehabilitated group. However carcass characteristics were not affected by rehabilitation. Carcass fat, bone and muscles were increased in the compensating group. Gut fill was slightly decreased in the rehabilitated group. Rehabilitation did not significantly affect fat distribution throughout the body, but total body, carcass and visceral fat were increased in the rehabilitation group. All non carcass components were not affected by the rehabilitation except the liver which was significantly (P< 0. 05) increased and the udder which was significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased in the rehabilitated group. Meat chemical composition was significantly affected by rehabilitation. Percentages of fat, sacroplasmic and Myofibrillar proteins increased significantly (P< 0. 01) in the meat from the compensating goats. Moisture, ash, non-protein nitrogen percentages and pH values decreased but not significantly so in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group. Meat from the rehabilitated goat group showed superior water hold capacity and less cooking loss value. Meat from goats that experienced rehabilitation was significantly lighter in colour possibly due to increased fatness. However redness values of the meat, though not significant were lower compared with that from normally growing goat kids. Carcass measurements as heart girth and abdomen circumference were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased by rehabilitation, while measurements, as body length and scapular and thigh circumference were not significantly affected. Taste panel scores for meat quality revealed that the rehabilitated goat group had significantly (p< 0. 01) less odour intensity, less tender meat and less meat colour values than the basal group. While juiciness scores were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in the meat from the rehabilitated goat group...|$|R
