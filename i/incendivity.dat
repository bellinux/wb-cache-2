40|$|Goaf Frictional Ignition (GFI) poses {{a serious}} threat to the safety of {{underground}} coal mines, and has caused many underground fires and catastrophic explosions. This paper examined occurrences of GFI incidents and the underlying mechanisms of ignition source and environment. Most of these incidents were attributed to rock on rock frictional ignition. The eventuation of frictional ignition relies on the presence of hot spots with enough incendive ignition energy, which requires a minimum threshold sliding distance and sliding velocity. The <b>incendivity</b> of the environment can be enhanced by the presence of liquid carbon hydrogen, the increase of virgin rock temperature, and the presence of hydrocarbon gases from thermal decomposition product of coal volatile. The paper discussed the newly proposed concerns on the varying <b>incendivity</b> of environment; finally it summarized the GFI engineering controls and discussed their applicability...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines tested {{new designs}} of drag bit cutters with {{sintered}} diamond inserts instead of standard tungsten carbide tips. The bits were tested for orthogonal cutting forces, primary dust generation, and <b>incendivity,</b> {{with a standard}} plumb-bob type conical cutter (600 included tip angle) as the reference. Preliminary wear and impact-failure testing were also done. The results were mixed. Two new designs had forces {{similar to those of}} the reference bit, but one new design had about twice the normal force. This same design had almost twice the specific energy during shallow cutting but generated an equal or slightly lower amount of primary dust than did the reference bit. <b>Incendivity</b> was eliminated for two radial designs. One conical design had ignition only after more than 15 impacts, but the other conical design was incendive. Impact failure occurred, but not so quickly as anticipated. Over 7, 500 impacts on a sandstone face, with a total cutting distance of more than 1, 981. 2 m, only scuffed the leading edge of the sintered diamond cutting face but put hairline cracks in the substrate mounting pad. Additional design and testing are needed to develop an optimum cutter, but prospects look good for this material...|$|E
40|$|The Self-Contained Atmospheric Protective Ensemble (SCAPE) used in {{propellant}} handling at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) {{has recently}} completed {{a series of tests}} to determine its electrostatic properties of the coverall fabric used in the Propellant Handlers Ensemble (PHE). Understanding these electrostatic properties are fundamental to ensuring safe operations when working with flammable rocket propellants such as hydrazine, methyl hydrazine, and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine. These tests include surface resistivity, charge decay, triboelectric charging, and flame <b>incendivity.</b> In this presentation, we will discuss the results of these tests on the current PHE as well as new fabrics and materials being evaluated {{for the next generation of}} PHE...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{conducted}} research {{to determine whether}} the total elapsed delay time for blasting bituminous coal in underground mines could be safely expanded beyond the present 500 -ms limitation without igniting a methane or methane-coal dust atmosphere. The results indicated that the increase of total delay from 500 to 1, 000 ms had no detectable effect on safety relative to <b>incendivity</b> as long as permissible practices were observed in all other aspects. Research was also conducted to evaluate the safety of 18 -in hole spacing for delay blasting in coal relative to misfires. For a variety of permissible explosives, misfires were observed for about 50 pct of the holes at 18 -in spacing. Based on this observation, the Bureau has recommended that the new regulations prohibit hole spacings of less than 24 inches in underground coal mines. Misfires were also observed for 24 -in spacing, but the number of misfires and test shots was too small to sup- port any firm conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Four bit designs, two conical and two radial, {{were tested}} in coal against a 6020 conical {{reference}} bit to obtain data on orthogonal cutting forces and primary respirable dust generation. One conical and one radial design were modified by the Bureau of Mines for these tests. Results were mixed: One radial bit used substantially lower overall cutting forces and specific energy than the other bits and was the only cutter lower on energy and most forces than the standard 6020 bit. How-ever, it generated more specific and total dust than any other bit. The four bits were also tested for <b>incendivity,</b> with a 9020 plumb-bob bit as the reference. The frictional ignition tests were designed to simulate both trimming top rock and cutting such rock during advance on-sump. Results of these tests were also mixed. The radial bits were substantially less incendive than the reference bit and caused no ignitions in either top trimming or sump modes. Only the modified mushroom-tipped conical bit caused ignitions. Bits similar to this modified design {{should not be used}} on drum-type miners in gassy mine areas; in-stead, the other types of bits tested should be used to reduce ignition potential to a minimum...|$|E
40|$|Discussion of key {{electrostatic}} {{issues that}} have arisen {{during the past few}} years at KSC that the Electrostatics Laboratory has studied. The lab has studied in depth the Space Shuttle's Thermal Control System Blankets, the International Space Station Thermal Blanket, the Pan/Tilt Camera Blankets, the Kapton Purge Barrier Curtain, the Aclar Purge Barrier Curtain, the Thrust Vector Controller Blankets, the Tyvek Reaction Control System covers, the AID-PAK and FLU- 9 pyro inflatable devices, the Velostat Solid Rocket Booster mats, and the SCAPE suits. In many cases these materials are insulating meaning that they might be a source of unsafe levels of electrostatic discharge (ESD). For each, the lab provided in-depth testing of each material within its current configuration to ensure that it does not cause an ESD concern that may violate the safety of the astronauts, the workers and equipment for NASA. For example the lab provides unique solutions and testing such as Spark <b>Incendivity</b> Testing that checks whether a material is capable of generating a spark strong enough to ignite a flammable gas. The lab makes recommendations to changes in specifications, procedures, and material if necessary. The lab also consults with a variety of non-safety related ESD issues for the agency...|$|E
40|$|Stemming {{is used in}} {{blasting}} operations to help contain explosive gases as long as possible. Stemming can reduce airblast, improve fragmentation, and reduce the chances of hot explosive gases igniting methane and dust explosions in underground mines. Stemming is required in underground coal mines but is generally not used in underground metal and nonmetal mines. Some underground metal and nonmetal mines are classified as gassy and can require special blasting procedures {{such as the use}} of stemming to minsure the safety of miners. The types and amounts of stemming material that are desirable in underground metal and nonmetal mine blasting to ensure good or improved fragmentation while containing the hot gases are largely unknown. This Bureau of Mines research examined the effectiveness of differing lengths of stemming by measuring stemming ejection times as related to burden movement. With properly stemmed blasts, stemming is contained until some burden movement has occurred. Test blasts at two surface limestone quarries were evaluated using high-speed photography. For the conditions of these tests, a stemming length of at least 26 charge diameters was found to prevent premature stemming ejection. In tests with stemming lengths of 16 charge diameters, the stemming was effective but there was early venting of hot gases through fractures in the rock. Further testing with other rock types, hole diameters, explosive types, and stemming materials as they affect <b>incendivity</b> is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a prototype nonincendive explosive rock-breaker charge that can be fired unconfined in underground bituminous coal mines without the danger of igniting a flammable atmosphere that might be present. At present, unconfined shooting in underground coal mines is prohibited, but there are situations where {{the use of such}} shots would yield an overall improvement in safety. The charge consists of 1 - 1 / 2 lb of permissible water gel explosive {{in the form of a}} short cylinder 7 inches in diameter and 7 / 8 inches high, surrounded by a 1 / 2 -inch-thick layer of damp salt, and encased in latex rubber reinforced with cheese cloth. The latex rubber housing provides a charge package that is strong enough to resist rough handling yet is pliable enough to conform to an irregular stone surface. A charge of this shape was found to be more effective at breaking rock than charges with lined or unlined cavities. <b>Incendivity</b> tests in a gallery have shown that the prototype charge will not ignite a flammable methane-air atmosphere when fired. Rockbreaking tests made with limestone boulders indicate that the charge will satisfactorily break stone slabs weighing 1 to 2 tons, and that two or more charges might be effective for slabs weighing up to 10 tons. In cooperation with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), a test protocol for the certification of these charges as "permissible" for use in flammable atmospheres is being developed...|$|E
40|$|As {{the first}} stage in the {{rulemaking}} process, MSHA prepared requirements for the approval and use of permissible explosives and blasting items in underground coal mines. These draft requirements known as "preproposals " were announced in the Federal Register in mid- 1984. The draft requirements {{on the use of}} explosives were written as a revision to Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 75, Subpart:N. The draft requirements for approval of permissible explosives including sheathed explosives for unconfined applications, approval of water stemming bags, approval of detonators and approval of blasting machines were prepared as Parts 15, 16, 17 and 25 respectively. During the development and preparation of the preproposals, it was determined that field research on delay blasting of coal would be needed before the draft approval and use requirements could be finalized. In order to conduct the field research, an experimental site was acquired by the Bureau of Mines. The Bureau of Mines under a contract, obtained a surface coal mine site in Ohio to conduct field research on the delay blasting of coal. The major objective of the research program was to study total elapsed delay time for blasting bituminous coal and determine if it could be safely expanded beyond the present 500 millisecond limitations without igniting a methane or methane/ coal dust atmosphere. The preliminary results from the work completed to date indicate that the increase of total delay from 500 to 1000 milliseconds has no detectable effect on safety relative to <b>incendivity</b> as long as permissible practices are observed in all other aspects. Further testing and assessment of the data are needed to validate the observations and conclusions reported in this paper and to establish a firm basis for regulatory changes. The research program discussed in this paper is continuing...|$|E
