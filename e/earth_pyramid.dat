50|$|A hoodoo (also {{called a}} tent rock, fairy chimney or <b>earth</b> <b>pyramid)</b> is a tall, thin spire of rock that {{protrudes}} {{from the bottom}} of an arid drainage basin or badland. Hoodoos, which may range from 1.5 to 45 m, typically consist of relatively soft rock topped by harder, less easily eroded stone that protects each column from the elements. They generally form within sedimentary rock and volcanic rock formations.|$|E
50|$|Aside from mystic {{stories and}} legends, the <b>earth</b> <b>pyramid</b> in Kuklica was {{formed as a}} result of natural erosion {{processes}} in the Holocene, during the past 100,000 years. Differences in the erodibility of the volcanic rocks of the area are the main factor for the pillars creation. Thus, soft tuffs rocks on the base are overlaid by solid, sturdy andesites and ignimbrites on the top, which are nearly 30 million years old.|$|E
5000|$|Hoodoos {{are found}} {{mainly in the}} desert in dry, hot areas. In common usage, the {{difference}} between hoodoos and pinnacles (or spires) is that hoodoos have a variable thickness often described as having a [...] "totem pole-shaped body". A spire, on the other hand, has a smoother profile or uniform thickness that tapers from the ground upward. An example of a single spire, as an <b>earth</b> <b>pyramid,</b> is found at Aultderg Burn, near Fochabers, Scotland.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> of Platten (German: Erdpyramiden von Platten or Erdpyramiden bei Oberwielenbach; Piramidi di Plata [...] ) are <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> {{located in}} Platten in the {{municipality}} of Percha, near Bruneck in South Tyrol, Italy.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> of Ritten (German: Erdpyramiden am Ritten; Piramidi di terra del Renon [...] ) are {{a natural}} {{monument}} that {{is located on}} the Ritten, a plateau not far from Bozen in northern Italy.

5000|$|In 1871 {{he died at}} Branitz. Since human {{cremation}} {{was illegal}} at that time for religious reasons, he resorted to an ingenious evasion of traditional burial; he left instructions that his heart be dissolved in sulphuric acid, and that his body should be embedded in caustic soda, caustic potash, and caustic lime. Thus on February 9, 1871, his denatured remains were buried in the Tumulus - an <b>earth</b> <b>pyramid</b> surrounded by a parkland lake at Branitzer Castle.|$|E
50|$|The tented camp on {{the shores}} of the Baltic Sea was erected by two {{companies}} of Hesse-Darmstadt troops in a wood. The troops belonged to those states in the Confederation of the Rhine that were allied to Napoleonic France. Strategically, the camp had the aim of preventing the landing of British troops on Rügen. There was an encampment laid out for 100 men and a dugout, which was covered with straw and branches. In the centre, an oblong space was created, which was laid out with walkways and grass banks and was described as clean. In addition, a large <b>earth</b> <b>pyramid</b> was built, but there is no trace of it today. The purpose of the pyramid is unclear. It may have served as a signal station or lookout. According to local oral tradition, the discipline of these troops was much better than that of English, Bavarian, Berg and French troops who, at that time, were also periodically stationed in the Mönchgut region. Behind the camp, tradesmen supplied provisions to the soldiers from their stalls.|$|E

50|$|The {{main cause}} of the {{formation}} of <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> is the continuous alternation of periods of torrential rain anddrought. These phenomena, in particularly friable terrain, over the years, increasingly erode the ground and form such <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids.</b> Usually the pyramids are formed in terrain very well sheltered from wind so that they cannot be damaged by it.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} name in {{this area}} for these <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> is Lahntürme, i.e. landslide towers. They are rather unusual formations of their kind which originate from morainic rocks of glacial origin. The columns of the pyramids may {{be more or less}} elongated, and the higher they are the thinner they get, ending usually with a stone cover. These <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> are not static, they are constantly evolving, because their life cycle foresees a continuous erosion, or even a final collapse leaving room for new formations.|$|R

40|$|Bregalnica {{is one of}} {{the largest}} rivers (225 km long, 4307 km 2 {{catchment}} area) in the Republic of Macedonia, which drainage surface waters from most of the eastern part of the country. Because of suitable, sensitive natural factors (geology, soils, topography, climate, hidrography, vegetation) and human-related excess deforestation, huge area of Bregalnica catchment is characterized by strong erosion potential. This is especially evi-dent upstream from Kalimanci dam, where most of the tributaries are torrential, and landscape represent real system of gullies, <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids,</b> badlands and landslides formed in soft Pliocene lacustrine sediment rocks. Aside of that are numerous deposition fans in the torrents bottom, as well as large flats of sedimentation. For that reason, in this upper part of Bregalnica catchment (1124. 7 km 2), are recorded sites with high an-nual erosion rates, among the highest in the Republic of Macedonia. In respond of such erosion risk, from the 1960 -ties detailed studies with erosion modeling and mapping for the area are performed, dominantly based on traditional empiric model of prof. S. Gavri-lovic. Having in mind fast transformation in the landscape, previous traditional approach is updated by implementation of suitable GIS tools...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was well}} on in A.D. 1016 that Knut gained his last victory, at Ashdon, in Essex, where the <b>earth</b> <b>pyramids</b> and antique church near by still testify the thankful piety of Knut,--or, at lowest his joy at having won instead of lost and perished, as he was near doing there. And it was still this same year when the noble Edmund Ironside, after forced partition-treaty [...] "in the Isle of Alney," [...] got scandalously murdered, and Knut became indisputable sole King of England, and decisively settled himself to his work of {{governing}} there. In the year before either of which events, while all still hung uncertain for Knut, and even Eric Jarl of Norway had to be summoned in aid of him, in that year 1015, as one might naturally guess and as all Icelandic hints and indications lead us to date the thing, Olaf had decided to give up Vikingism in all its forms; to return to Norway, and try whether he could not assert the place and career that belonged to him there. Jarl Eric had vanished with all his war forces towards England, leaving only a boy, Hakon, as successor, and Svein, his own brother,--a quiet man, who had always avoided war. Olaf landed in Norway without obstacle; but decided to be quiet till he had himself examined and consulted friends.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Captain America's team {{in space}} heads for <b>Earth,</b> using the <b>Pyramid's</b> power. On <b>Earth,</b> Kang {{declares}} {{that he will}} destroy a city each hour until the Avengers surrender. Before he make good his threat, the Master's technological towers erupt {{from the ground and}} attack. Thanks to Jan's calls, across the world others assault Kang's forces, including the Presence, the Atlanteans and the Deviants. With his forces locked in a counter-attack, Kang and the Centurion retreat to Damocles Base. From there, he locates the Avengers' new base and opens fire on it. Facing a no-win situation, the five heroes who had agreed to attack his base take off anyway. Just as Kang is about to triumph, the Pyramid materializes beside Damocles Base, opening fire on it. Captain America tells Triathlon to ready the technology.|$|R
50|$|Jadna is {{sure that}} this set of co-ordinates will lead to their, still unknown, adversary.

The astroship crashed to the ground amid a recreation {{of one of the}} battles of the First World War. Laureline is knocked unconscious. French troops attack the astroship. Jadna goes to the cargo bay and revives all the Valérian clones as well as the original Valérian, puts them in German uniform and sends them out to fight. The real Valérian is exhausted due to loss of the blood he had to give to make all the clones and, while the others go over the top, he heads off in search of someplace to sleep. Jadna goes back to check on Laureline but is communicated with telepathically by the alien creator of all these artificial Earths who invites her to join him.|$|R
