50|$|The SWMM 5.0.001 to 5.1.012 main {{components}} are: rain gages, watersheds, LID controls or BMP {{features such as}} Wet and Dry Ponds, nodes, links, pollutants, landuses, time patterns, curves, time series, controls, transects, aquifers, unit hydrographs, snowmelt and shapes (Table 3). Other related objects are the types of Nodes and the Link Shapes. The purpose of the objects is to simulate the major components of the hydrologic cycle, the hydraulic components of the <b>drainage,</b> <b>sewer</b> or stormwater network and the buildup/washoff functions that allow the simulation of water quality constituents. A watershed simulation starts with a precipitation time history. SWMM 5 has many types of open and closed pipes and channels: dummy, circular, filled circular, rectangular closed, rectangular open, trapezoidal, triangular, parabolic, power function, rectangular triangle, rectangle round, modified baskethandle, horizontal ellipse, vertical ellipse, arch, eggshaped, horseshoe, gothic, catenary, semielliptical, baskethandle, semicircular, irregular, custom and force main.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the Middle Ages, {{and again}} in modern times, the Scheldt and its arms {{required}} constant work: Repair of levees, enhancement of pavement, straightening of the bed, {{as well as the}} digging of ditches to regulate the course of the river, prevent floods and ensure as far as possible a steady water level, on which the mills and tanneries depended. Despite these works, floods were frequent. The absorption of rainwater and household water descending from the upper areas of the city was also a problem. Bouly spoke in 1842, in his History of Cambrai and le Cambrésis, of [...] "fast torrents stormwater formed today by rolling up the Scheldt". In the Middle Ages the [...] "flow of el kayère" [...] (or [...] "flow of the chair"), close to the current Grand-Place, was dug a reservoir for [...] "water courses of the falling waters of the sky", i.e. to control the flow of rainwater.

30|$|Kolkata, {{previously}} {{known as}} Calcutta, is {{the capital of}} the Indian state of West Bengal. Calcutta was the last of the port cities to be founded by the English, and the suburbanization had been started by the British during the last decades of the eighteenth century (Kosambi and Brush 1988). The modern city of Kolkata was developed on land recovered from the wetlands following the Dutch model of cities built along the Rhine River despite geographical challenge similar to those in Kolkata (Rumbach 2014). The city is often mentioned as the city in the swamps (Murphey 1964) and {{has been found to be}} one of the world’s most flood-prone coastal cities (Balica et al. 2012). Though situated away from the Bay of Bengal, the city is considered as a coastal city because of the deltaic setting. This megacity has a tropical climate and is subjected to extreme precipitation during monsoons with an annual rainfall of around 160  cm. It is situated on the bank of the Hooghly River and has an area of 1851  km 2. The region is prone to flooding primarily due to the flat terrain and the drainage outfalls which are tide-dominated. Flooding occurs during excess rainfall on the catchment as well as during high-tidal conditions. The <b>drainage</b> <b>sewer</b> system in the city was designed during the British era and is not capable of handling the current run-off scenario. The sewer system also suffers from siltation and a consequent reduction in conveyance capacities irrespective of the efforts by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) in renovating the drainage pipelines (Sen 2013). The population increase (14.98 million in 2016) (UNDESA 2016), rapid urbanization and the corresponding land-use changes have substantially reduced the flood-resilient efficacy of the region in recent years.|$|E

30|$|The {{vertical}} {{water velocity}} distribution in open channels is considered three-dimensional {{due to the}} presence of large-scale circular secondary currents.

An accurate estimation of the velocity dip position with respect to channel bottom is required for many practical applications including the assessment of sediment transport rates (Einstein 1950) and contamination (Guo and Julien 2008), and the precise definition of hydrodynamic flow conditions in urban <b>drainage</b> <b>sewers</b> (Lee and Julien 2006; Guo et al. 2015).|$|R
50|$|With the {{prevalence}} of motorized mobility, street infrastructure represents the single largest component of capital outlays for building a new neighbourhood. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century most city streets were unpaved, had no <b>drainage</b> <b>sewers,</b> few were lit, and hardly any had signage. Also, the majority were narrow by contemporary standards, frequently without sidewalks. Consequently, they consumed few resources for construction and maintenance. By contrast, current street design standards necessitate a large investment for construction and significant city budget allocations for their maintenance.A 2008 engineering study compared network patterns for the same district and found that the traditional, modified grid network (TND) pattern had about 46% higher costs for road infrastructure compared to the Radburn-type of the existing layout.|$|R

[...] Yet, even an analysis of Proposition 218 in a League of California Cities publication before the November 1996 election made a distinction between storm <b>drainage</b> and <b>sewer</b> systems (and also water systems) in stating: [...] “But, it appears that all fees and charges for water, sanitation, storm <b>drainage,</b> or <b>sewer</b> are included within the scope of the measure.” [...] This analysis was available to the public before the Proposition 218 election, and it came from an organization, the League of California Cities, that opposed Proposition 218.|$|R
50|$|Despite the re-direction {{of sewage}} into brick lined {{channels}} and pipes in the 19th century, the beck remains polluted still. This {{is because of}} the numerous Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) points and other misconnected foul and <b>drainage</b> <b>sewers.</b> The beck is still unsuited to hosting wildlife, but after the Friends of Bradford's Becks set up a regeneration and cleaning programme for the beck in 2013, the waters are cleaner than they have been for a long time. The issue with the lack of wildlife now is that as the beck was culverted, it runs very fast through concrete and stone channels and as such the water flow is too fast to sustain much of the wildlife that would normally inhabit a beck of this size. The Friends of Bradford's Becks are wanting to rectify this by remodelling some of the lower reaches of the beck where it is exposed to daylight and slowing the water flow down by adding in bends.|$|R

My bill simply says stormwater should be treated {{the same way as}} trash, household water and sewer service, because that’s the way it has always been," [...] Hertzberg wrote in the op-ed. However, SB 231 is an end run around Proposition 218 (“Right to Vote on Taxes Act”) in that it attempts to rewrite a Prop. 218 constitutional provision with a mere statute to allow for stormwater to be included under the definition of “sewer,” meaning that it would no longer be subject to a Proposition 218 election. [...] Furthermore, an analysis of Proposition 218 in a League of California Cities publication before the Proposition 218 election in 1996 made a clear distinction between storm <b>drainage</b> and <b>sewer</b> systems (and also water systems) in stating: “But, it appears that all fees and charges for water, sanitation, storm <b>drainage,</b> or <b>sewer</b> are included within the scope of the measure.” ...|$|R
