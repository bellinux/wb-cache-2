5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while we were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six.</b> When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E
500|$|During this {{intercourse}} I {{perceived the}} superiority of Miss Honora Sneyd's capacity ... her sentiments were on all subjects so just and were delivered with such blushing modesty though not without an air of conscious worth as to command attention from every one capable of appreciating female excellence. Her person was graceful her features beautiful and their expression such as to heighten the eloquence of every thing she said. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> and twenty and {{now for the first}} time in my life I saw a woman that equalled the picture of perfection which existed in my imagination.|$|E
500|$|At age five, {{she joined}} a drama group and {{developed}} public speaking skills. At that same time, Lorde was attending Vauxhall School and later Belmont Intermediate School. Her mother {{encouraged her to}} read a range of genres, which Lorde cited as a lyrical influence, [...] "I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She'd give me a mixture of kid and adult books too, there weren't really any books I wasn't allowed to read. I remember reading Feed by M.T. Anderson when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six,</b> and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and Janet Frame really young too." ...|$|E

"I do hope, father, {{that when}} the troop marches again you will take me as cornet. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>six</b> months older than <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and have learned {{a lot in the}} last campaign.

2500|$|... "My {{family owned}} an opera company. The National Charity Company, {{as we were}} called, {{performed}} in temples, opera houses and mayors’ compounds throughout the country. Many people knew my father, grandfather and uncle through their performances, which had become legendary. Since the family ran the company, all of us performed. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> or seven, I often {{played the role of}} a baby. Somebody would say “Cry!” and I’d cry...My father and uncle trained my older cousin, in his teens at the time, to perform the main roles in traditional Cambodian operas." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{would write}} you from Nithsdale, {{and give you}} my {{direction}} there, but I have scarce an opportunity of calling at a post-office once in a fortnight. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>six</b> miles from Dumfries, am scarcely ever in it myself, and, as yet, have little acquaintance in the neighbourhood. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now very busy on my farm, building a dwelling-house; as at present <b>I</b> <b>am</b> almost an evangelical man in Nithsdale, for I have scarce [...] "where to lay my head." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{response}} was not included: {{it came from}} George Orwell, and began:Will you please stop sending me this bloody rubbish. This is {{the second or third}} time I have had it. I am not one of your fashionable pansies like Auden or Spender, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> months in Spain, most of the time fighting, I have a bullet hole in me at present and I am not going to write blah about defending democracy or gallant little anybody...Several other writers also declined to contribute, including Virginia Woolf, Bertrand Russell, E.

2500|$|On 4 March 2015, {{a formal}} {{announcement}} was made, confirming the project, with Ullman {{saying that it}} was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and [...] "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six,</b> standing on the windowsill in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." [...] Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: [...] "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long.

2500|$|... "I {{really enjoyed}} playing tennis, because when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> {{or seven years}} old and winning tournaments it felt good", said Ram. [...] "From when I was 8 or 10 I {{knew it was going}} to be a career for me. [...] It's a tennis life so it wasn't so easy. [...] You have to give up many things. When all my friends were playing outside I had to practice. I didn't go to all the school trips. But I was focused from a very young age. I grew up {{practicing}} at the Jerusalem tennis center. I spent most of my childhood there, practicing five days a week. I never regretted it and I enjoyed every moment. Now I am reaping the rewards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you are my}} cousin!" [...] Stella said, [...] "little Virginia! I {{only saw}} you once before, but I should have known you {{anywhere}} by your eyes. No! of course you don't remember me! You see <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>six</b> years older. <b>I</b> mustn't stop, because, as I dare say you know, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not on speaking terms with my father, but I felt that I must just shake hands with you, {{and tell you that}} I remembered you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Impossible!" [...] {{interrupted}} the other, {{with a slight}} curl of his moustache, [...] "for as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only <b>six</b> feet one, and you <b>are</b> at least <b>six</b> feet four, we can never be on an equal footing." ...|$|R

2500|$|During his youth, {{his mother}} would work several jobs {{in order to support}} the family, often taking odd jobs as a nurse and caterer. She would also attend night school to learn English. His father later {{abandoned}} the family, prompting his maternal grandmother to take care of Abel. This allowed him to become fluent in Amharic in his early years, with this Semitic language acting as his first language. His grandmother would also take him to services at an Ethiopian Orthodox church. About his father, The Weeknd stated [...] "I saw him vaguely when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six,</b> and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wyatt {{was born}} in Bristol. [...] His mother was Honor Wyatt, a {{journalist}} with the BBC, and his father, George Ellidge, was an industrial psychologist. Wyatt had two half-brothers from his parents' previous marriages, Honor Wyatt's son, actor Julian Glover, and George Ellidge's son, press photographer Mark Ellidge. His parents' friends were [...] "quite bohemian", and his upbringing was [...] "unconventional". Wyatt said [...] "It seemed perfectly normal to me. My father didn't join us until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six,</b> and he died ten years later, having retired early with multiple sclerosis, so I was brought up a lot by women." [...] Wyatt attended the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, Canterbury and as a teenager lived with his parents in Lydden near Dover, where he was taught drums by visiting American jazz drummer George Neidorf. It was during this period that Wyatt [...] met and became friends with expatriate Australian musician Daevid Allen, who rented a room in Wyatt's family home.|$|E
2500|$|Kertész {{was born}} in Budapest, Hungary, in 1929, the first child of Margit Muresian and Miklós Kertész. His sister, Vera, was born four years later. Miklós Kertész, born in Szécsény, Hungary into a large Jewish family, was the {{director}} of a leather-works and died of appendicitis in 1938. An energetic, intellectually gifted woman, Margit Muresian Kertész went to work to support her family. Despite strictures against women working professionally in Hungarian society {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, Margit was steadily promoted until she ran the office where she was employed. At an early age Kertész showed a great affinity for music, and began violin lessons. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six</b> and started music," [...] he told a High Fidelity interviewer, [...] "it was 1935 and cruel things were going on in Europe [...] [...] [...] I found my `exile' in music, practicing the piano, the fiddle, and writing little compositions." ...|$|E

"You see, my Lord," [...] Stapylton would say, {{pointing}} to a dark, dingy picture of a gentleman in a rich court dress, [...] "you see, my Lord, {{it is not in}} a very good light, and it certainly is a very dark picture, by Hudson; all Hudson's pictures were dark. But if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>six</b> inches taller, and could hold the light just there, I think your Lordship would be astonished at the resemblance; but it's a dark picture, certainly it is dark; all Hudson's pictures were." ...|$|R

The Bee Gees had written and recorded them in Sydney in late 1966, which included their breakthrough hit [...] "Spicks and Specks". Shortly afterward the group left Australia {{to return to the}} UK. The tracks were intended for a planned album which was not released, so they were sent to Burns who shared the same recording management. Burns provided his own vocals over The Bee Gees' backing tracks. The original versions were eventually issued by Festival Records on The Bee Gees compilation albums, including a 2-CD set Brilliant from Birth (2000).|$|E
2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>six.</b> And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. And when my father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod. [...] An he’s got the sharpest mind I’ve ever known; he’s so hysterically funny. And I wanted to be like him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Suppose I realise now. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> worth <b>six</b> lakhs. <b>I</b> {{had nearly}} two from my poor father. I saved some before and since I {{invested}} in this affair; and could sell out to-morrow with sixty thousand pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{approached}} your room, I {{examined the}} window.

Such an idea <b>was</b> absurd. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> measuring how tall a man {{would need to be}} in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on the central table. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>six</b> feet high, and I could do it with an effort.

6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> bigger," [...] {{he said to}} himself, [...] "I'd thrash him on the spot. Then I'd feel {{easier in}} my mind, and things could go on as they pleased.
