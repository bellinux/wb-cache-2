2500|$|In his memoirs, Morgan {{claimed that}} during his {{publicity}} tour he flew the B-17 between the Buncombe County Courthouse and the City Hall of Asheville, North Carolina, his home town. Morgan wrote that after leaving a local airport {{he decided to}} buzz the town, telling his copilot, Captain Verinis, [...] "I think we'll just drive up over the city and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> goodbye salute." [...] Morgan turned the bomber down Patton Avenue, a main thoroughfare, toward downtown Asheville. When he observed the courthouse and the city hall (two tall buildings that are only about 50ft (20 m) apart) dead ahead, he lowered his left wing in a 60 degree bank and flew between the structures. He wrote that the city hall housed an AAF weather detachment whose commanding officer allegedly complained immediately to the Pentagon, but was advised by a duty officer that [...] "Major Morgan...has been given permission to buzz by General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. I {{will tell}} {{them as much as}} that, for they are in such a state of mind about it that it would be kind to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> consolation." ...|$|E
60|$|I ENTERTAIN a weak {{idea that}} the English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines. I {{acknowledge}} to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more play.|$|E
60|$|They got out {{the oars}} and set to work. Occasionally a puff of wind <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> assistance, {{but it was one}} o'clock before they arrived {{alongside}} the London.|$|R
6000|$|... "I intend to," [...] {{said the}} Colonel, grimly. [...] "Will {{each of you}} fellows take a company, please, and inspect 'em faithfully. 'En état de partir' is their little boast, remember. When you've {{finished}} you can <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pillow-fighting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No great distance; <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{party of}} {{pleasure}} with my officers {{to eat a}} dinner together, to celebrate the honour we had received in being brought into Paris. My officers have worked very hard, and the matter served as a good excuse for <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't you {{transform}} 'em into polliwogs?" [...] asked Scraps, {{turning a}} somersault and then standing on one leg. [...] "You could <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> teeny pond to swim in, and they'd {{be just as}} happy as they are as fishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, how's our detective?" [...] Long Jim asked, with a laugh, as {{he threw}} himself on the ground by the boy's side. [...] "Has he decided to arrest his victims, or will he <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> show of leaving the country?" ...|$|E
60|$|SCHUTZMACHER [rather hurt at so {{moderate}} an estimate] Oh, much oftener than that. You see, {{most people}} get well {{all right if}} they are careful and you <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sensible advice. And the medicine really did them good. Parrish's Chemical Food: phosphates, you know. One tablespoonful to a twelve-ounce bottle of water: nothing better, {{no matter what the}} case is.|$|E
6000|$|L. (after <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time). Mary, I seldom {{ask you to}} read {{anything}} out of books of mine; {{but there is a}} passage about the Law of Help, which I want you to read to the children now, because it is of no use merely to put it in other words for them. You know the place I mean, do not you? ...|$|R
60|$|They always {{passed through}} the Capitol grounds on their way down town, for it <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thrill of delight to pass the clumps of trees. On this evening the grounds were {{specially}} beautiful. A heavy fall of damp snow covered every twig and grass-blade. They walked slowly down the winding path till they reached the open lawn just before the western gate.|$|R
60|$|Is it not {{pleasant}} {{enough to}} hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their persons and characters were too sacred for satire; and the public objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for ridicule? But whether bread or fame be their end, it must be allowed, our author, by and in this poem, has mercifully <b>given</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of both.|$|R
60|$|THE SHERIFF. I fine you {{a dollar}} for {{contempt}} of court, and will collect it myself off {{you as you}} leave the building. And as the boys have been disappointed of their natural sport, I shall <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fun by standing outside the door and taking up a collection for the bereaved mother of the late kid that shewed up Blanco Posnet.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{know nothing}} better, and besides, {{they are really}} patriotic. If the Czar would only treat them a little better, and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more liberty, {{they would be the}} most {{faithful}} of subjects. But when a man can't do at all as he wants to do, and can't open his mouth about it either, he is apt to grow sullen and ugly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did {{you think}} of doing?" [...] said the doctor. Ethel burned to reply, but her sister's hand admonished her to {{remember}} her compact. Richard answered, [...] "We thought of trying to get a room, and going perhaps {{once or twice a week}} to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> teaching. It would be little enough, but it might do something towards civilising them, and making them wish for more." ...|$|E
5000|$|Transcripts of {{telephone}} conversations reveal that by December 1970 Nixon's {{dissatisfaction with the}} success of the bombings prompted him to order that they be stepped up. [...] "They have got {{to go in there and}} I mean really go in," [...] he told Kissinger. [...] "I want them to hit everything. I want them to use the big planes, the small planes, everything they can that will help out there, and let's start <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, you see I got upsot over yonder, and the {{old horse}} went home while I was floundering in a drift, so I tied on the buffalers to tote 'em easy, and come along till I see the {{children}} playin' in the holler. I jest meant to <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> scare, but they run like partridges, and I kep' up the joke to see how Eph would like this sort of company," [...] and Gad haw-hawed again.|$|R
60|$|I {{see when}} men love women They <b>give</b> <b>them</b> but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of their lives, But women when they love give everything; I see that, Guido, now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, {{you know}} a great deal more about them than I do, and my only motive in seeking {{information}} is--well, not a bad one. I might be able to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help in their struggles. It strikes me that Merton is not going quite the right way to work to get on in life, and that his wife is not too happy. Do you think I am right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|They said little, however, {{seeming to}} be too much {{depressed}} to express their disappointment in words, but their haggard looks were fearfully eloquent. Some of those who had wasted their supplies earnestly implored their more prudent comrades to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> a [...] "very little," [...] of the precious element, and two or three were generous enough to give away a few drops of the little that still remained to them.|$|E
6000|$|At {{these words}} Zobeida's anger cooled down, {{and she turned}} to her slaves and said, [...] "You can <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more liberty, but do not leave the hall. Those that will tell us their {{histories}} and their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt; those who refuse--" [...] And she paused, but in a moment the porter, who understood that he had only to relate his story to set himself free from this terrible danger, immediately broke in, ...|$|E
60|$|All {{night long}} the storm raged {{and the snow}} came down as thickly as ever. As a consequence, when it began to grow <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{brighter}} they found that they were completely snowed in. On all sides the spruces were nearly broken down with their weights of whiteness, and {{on the opposite side}} of the rock where the fire was built was a drift of snow eight to ten feet high. This <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more shelter but cut off a good share of the outlook.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{with the}} aid of their parents, the four boys got their trunks and {{suitcases}} packed. They were to leave home for Colby Hall on Wednesday morning, and on Tuesday evening their folks <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> send-off {{in the shape of a}} party given at Dick Rover's residence. At this gathering many of their boy friends were present, as well as a number of girls along with Mary and Martha. All of the young folks had an exceedingly pleasant time, which was kept up until midnight.|$|R
60|$|So Mr. George and Rollo each {{laid down}} two pennies {{on the little}} counter in the window sill, and the man <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> each <b>a</b> <b>little</b> paper ticket, they passed on.|$|R
60|$|So {{the team}} was selected, and Clephane turned out after school next day to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fielding-practice. To his {{surprise}} the fielding was not so outrageous as might have been expected. All the simpler catches were held, {{and one or two}} of the harder as well. Given this form on the day of their appearance in public, and Henfrey might be disappointed when he came to watch and smile sarcastically. A batting fiasco is not one half so ridiculous as maniac fielding.|$|E
60|$|As {{young readers}} {{like to know}} 'how people look', we will take this moment to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sketch of the four sisters, who sat {{knitting}} away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.|$|E
6000|$|So, if {{children}} {{are to be}} called away from their play for any purpose whatever, it is always best to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> notice, if it be only a moment's notice, beforehand. [...] "John, in {{a minute or two}} I shall wish you to go and get some wood. You can be getting your things ready to be left." [...] "Mary, it is almost time for your lesson. You had better put Dolly to sleep and lay her in the cradle." [...] "Boys, in ten minutes it will be time for you to go to school. So do not begin any new whistles, but only finish what you have begun." ...|$|E
25|$|The rufous-tailed scrub robin {{is found}} flitting among dense cover {{but also in}} more open {{positions}} on trees, the tops of bushes and on posts. It is frequently seen on the ground hopping about and flaring and bobbing its tail up and down. When perched it also displays its tail in this way and also sometimes droops its wings before <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> flick forward. It feeds mainly on the ground on insects such as beetles, grasshoppers and the larvae of butterflies and moths, and on earthworms, turning over the leaf litter to find its prey.|$|R
50|$|Han is {{seen only}} in the {{beginning}} of Fast & Furious. He along with Letty Ortiz, Toretto, Tego Leo, Rico Santos, and Cara, are hijacking a fuel tanker in the Dominican Republic. Han and Cara hijack the first two tankers while Leo and Santos hijack the other two tankers, not before the truck driver <b>gives</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> problem after seeing Letty on top of the tanker and notices that the hijacking is going on. After the hijacking is done, Toretto disbands the crew after suspecting that the police are closing in on Toretto and his gang.|$|R

6000|$|... 'That is true,' added he; 'but {{you do not}} {{understand}} me right; I do not buy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat there, and sometimes I row down the river to Woolwich and buy there; then I go to single farm-houses on the Kentish side, where I am known, and buy fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships, as they direct me, sometimes one, sometimes the other. I seldom come on shore here, and I came now only to call on my wife and hear how my family do, and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money, which I received last night.' ...|$|E
60|$|Oh yes, for {{promoting}} {{the interests of}} the blind. It's a long name. If I could I would write it out for you and let you take it home and study it, but I don't know how to spell it. And Mr. Carnegie is down in Virginia somewhere. Well, anyway, the object of that association which has been recently organized, five months ago, in fact, {{is in the hands of}} very, very energetic, intelligent, and capable people, and they will push it to success very surely, and all the more surely if you will <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of your assistance out of your pockets.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] added he; [...] "but {{you do not}} {{understand}} me right. I do not buy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich, and buy fresh meat there, and sometimes I row down the river to Woolwich,[170] and buy there; then I go to single farmhouses on the Kentish side, where I am known, and buy fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships as they direct me, sometimes one, sometimes the other.

6000|$|... "Oh, will you, Ozma?" [...] cried Dorothy, {{clasping}} her chubby {{little hands}} eagerly. [...] "Will you bring them {{here with the}} Magic Belt, and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> farm in the Munchkin Country, or the Winkie Country--or some other place?" ...|$|R
500|$|The MGB-314 {{replied in}} a coded {{response}} {{obtained from a}} German trawler boarded during the Vågsøy raid. A few bursts were fired from a shore battery and both Campbeltown and MGB-314 replied: [...] "Ship being fired upon by friendly forces". [...] The deception <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time before every German gun in the bay opened fire. At 01:28, with the convoy [...] from the dock gates, Beattie ordered the German flag lowered and the White Ensign raised. The intensity of the German fire seemed to increase. The guard ship opened fire and was quickly silenced when the ships in the convoy responded, shooting into her as they passed.|$|R
6000|$|I dined at Lord John's {{yesterday}} (where Meyerbeer was, {{and said}} to me after dinner: [...] "Ah, mon ami illustre! que c'est noble de vous entendre parler d'haute voix morale, à la table d'un ministre!" [...] for I <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of truth about Sunday that was like bringing a Sebastopol battery among the polite company), I say, after this long parenthesis, I dined at Lord John's, and found great interest {{and talk about the}} play, and about what everybody who had been here had said of it. And I was confirmed in my decision that the thing for you was the invitation to the papers. Hence I write to tell you what I have done.|$|R
