25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the development of this area of linguistics, Ignace Gelb coined the term <b>grammatology</b> for this discipline; later some scholars suggested calling it graphology to match phonology, but that name is traditionally used for a pseudo-science.

25|$|The {{antagonism}} of abjad versus alphabet, {{as it was}} {{formulated by}} Daniels, has been rejected by other scholars because abjad is also used as a term {{not only for the}} Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical <b>grammatology,</b> also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to for instance the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking something important to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonemic or even phonological point of view, rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Searle gave a {{brief reply}} to Derrida in The Construction of Social Reality. He called Derrida's {{conclusion}} [...] "preposterous" [...] {{and stated that}} [...] "Derrida, as far as I can tell, {{does not have an}} argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts..." [...] Searle's reference here is not to anything forwarded in the debate, but to a mistranslation of the phrase [...] "il n'y a pas de hors-texte" [...] ("there is no outside-text") which appears in Derrida's Of <b>Grammatology</b> (1967).|$|E

5000|$|The {{linguist}} Ignace Gelb {{coined the}} term [...] "grammatology" [...] in 1952 {{to refer to the}} scientific study of writing systems or scripts. <b>Grammatology</b> can examine the typology of scripts, the analysis of the structural properties of scripts, and the relationship between written and spoken language.

50|$|The {{scholars}} most immediately {{associated with}} <b>grammatology,</b> {{understood as the}} history and theory of writing, include Eric Havelock (The Muse Learns to Write), Walter J. Ong (Orality and Literacy), Jack Goody (Domestication of the Savage Mind), not to mention Marshall McLuhan (The Gutenberg Galaxy). <b>Grammatology</b> brings to any topic {{a consideration of the}} contribution of technology and the material and social apparatus of language. A more theoretical treatment of the approach may be seen in the works of Friedrich Kittler (Discourse Networks: 1800/1900) and Avital Ronell (The Telephone Book).|$|E

50|$|In Internet Invention, Ulmer draws {{heavily on}} a number of theorists who are {{considered}} postmodern or poststructuralist. Specifically, Jacques Derrida’s work is referenced throughout the book, and Derrida plays a central role in Ulmer’s own Mystory, as it takes shape throughout the book. In some senses, Internet Invention is at least in part an attempt to apply several Derridean ideas to the field of communication and technology. To this extent, the book is a successor to one of Ulmer’s earlier works, Applied <b>Grammatology,</b> his 1985 book that attempts to frame a practical pedagogy based largely on Derrida’s Of <b>Grammatology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Trace (trace) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} concepts in Derridian deconstruction. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida used this word in two of his early books, namely Writing and Difference and Of <b>Grammatology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 the deconstructionist philosopher Jacques Derrida {{borrowed}} the term, but {{put it to}} different use, in his book Of <b>Grammatology.</b> Derrida aimed to show that writing {{is not simply a}} reproduction of speech, but that the way in which thoughts are recorded in writing, strongly affects the nature of knowledge. Deconstruction from a grammatological perspective places the history of philosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, in the context of writing as such. In this perspective metaphysics is understood as a category or classification system relative to the invention of alphabetic writing and its institutionalization in School. Plato's Academy, and Aristotle's Lyceum, are {{as much a part of}} the invention of literacy as is the introduction of the vowel to create the Classical Greek alphabet. Gregory Ulmer took up this trajectory, from historical to philosophical <b>grammatology,</b> to add applied <b>grammatology</b> (Applied Grammatology: Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys, Johns Hopkins, 1985). Ulmer coined the term [...] "electracy" [...] to call attention to the fact that digital technologies and their elaboration in new media forms are part of an apparatus that is to these inventions what literacy is to alphabetic and print technologies. <b>Grammatology</b> studies the invention of an apparatus across the spectrum of its manifestations—technology, institutional practices, and identity behaviors. Marc Wilhelm Küster combines Derrida's approach with Gelbs's study of writing to build a more inclusive view of the interaction between writing and our ways of viewing the world.|$|E
5000|$|In Of <b>Grammatology,</b> Derrida {{states that}} <b>grammatology</b> {{is not a}} [...] "science of man" [...] because it is {{concerned}} with the question of [...] "the name of man." [...] This leads Derrida into a consideration of the work of André Leroi-Gourhan, and in particular his concepts of [...] "program," [...] "exteriorisation," [...] and [...] "liberation of memory." [...] Derrida writes: [...] "Leroi-Gourhan no longer describes the unity of man and the human adventure thus by the simple possibility of the graphie in general; rather as a stage or an articulation in the history of life—of what I have called différance—as the history of the grammè. Derrida thus explicitly refers the term différance to life, and in particular to life as the history of inscription and retention, whether this is genetic or technological (from writing to [...] "electronic card indexes"). And thus <b>grammatology</b> is not a science of man because it deconstructs any anthropocentrism, {{in the sense that the}} inscription in question falls on both sides of the divide human/non-human.|$|E
50|$|Although {{presented}} {{at a conference}} intended to popularize structuralism, the lecture is widely cited {{as the starting point}} for post-structuralism in the United States. Along with Derrida's longer text Of <b>Grammatology,</b> it is also programmatic for the process of deconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Writing and Difference (L'écriture et la différence) {{is a book}} by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, {{collecting}} some of {{the early}} lectures and essays that established his international fame. It was published in 1967 alongside Of <b>Grammatology</b> and Speech and Phenomena.|$|E
5000|$|French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) in {{his book}} Of <b>Grammatology</b> {{responds}} in depth to what he believes is Saussure's logocentric argument. Derrida deconstructs the apparent inner, phonological system of language, stating in Chapter 2, Linguistics and <b>Grammatology,</b> that in fact and for reasons of essence Saussure's representative determination is [...] "...an ideal explicitly directing a functioning which...is never completely phonetic". The idea that writing might function other than phonetically and also as more than merely a representative delineation of speech allows an absolute concept of logos to end in what Derrida describes as infinitist metaphysics. The difference in presence can never actually be reduced, as was the logocentric project; instead, the chain of signification becomes the trace of presence-absence.|$|E
50|$|Derrida's {{interests}} crossed disciplinary boundaries, and {{his knowledge}} of {{a wide array of}} diverse material was reflected in the three collections of work published in 1967: Speech and Phenomena, Of <b>Grammatology</b> (initially submitted as a Doctorat de spécialité thesis under Maurice de Gandillac), and Writing and Difference.|$|E
50|$|Jacques Derrida wrote several {{critical}} {{studies of}} Husserl {{early in his}} academic career. These included his dissertation, The Problem of Genesis in Husserls Philosophy, and also his introduction to The Origin of Geometry. Derrida continued to make reference to Husserl in works such as Of <b>Grammatology.</b>|$|E
50|$|Heidegger and Husserl's {{influence}} was felt, firstly, in the existential-phenomenology of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Even Simon de Beauvoir's feminism borrowed extensively from this current. She used phenomenological conceptualizations of consciousness, time and memory to conceptualize Woman. Later, most famously, Jacques Derrida deconstructed Husserl in Of <b>Grammatology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Derrida was {{familiar}} with the work of Marshall McLuhan, and since his early 1967 writings (Of <b>Grammatology,</b> Speech and Phenomena), he speaks of language as a [...] "medium," [...] of phonetic writing as [...] "the medium of the great metaphysical, scientific, technical, and economic adventure of the West." ...|$|E
5000|$|The French philosopher Jacques Derrida {{discusses}} Leroi-Gourhan in Of <b>Grammatology</b> (Baltimore & London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997, corrected edition), {{in particular}} the concepts of [...] "exteriorisation", [...] "program", and [...] "liberation of memory." [...] This discussion was particularly important {{in the formulation of}} Derrida's neologism, différance.|$|E
50|$|Derrida {{published}} {{a number of}} works directly relevant {{to the concept of}} deconstruction, Of <b>Grammatology</b> was the book that introduced the idea of Deconstruction. Derrida went on to write many other books showing deconstruction in action or defining it more completely. Those other books include Différance, Speech and Phenomena, and Writing and Difference.|$|E
50|$|Of <b>Grammatology</b> is one {{of three}} books which Derrida {{published}} in 1967, and which served to establish his reputation. The other two were La voix et le phénomène, translated as Speech and Phenomena, and L'écriture et la différance, translated as Writing and Difference. It has been called a foundational text for deconstructive criticism.|$|E
5000|$|Derrida {{insisted that}} the written word has its own value, and is likely not [...] "the simple 'supplement to the spoken word.'" [...] In Of <b>Grammatology</b> he uses this method of {{analysis}} to critique the views that Rousseau expressed in Essay on the Origin of Languages. Derrida argued that Rousseau's views were contradictory and often undermined his arguments.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{the author}} of several books: Illogic of Sense: The Gregory Ulmer Remix; Applied Grammatology: Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys; Teletheory: <b>Grammatology</b> in the Age of Video; Heuretics: The Logic of Invention; Internet Invention: From Literacy to Electracy; and Electronic Monuments[...] He has also {{published}} numerous articles and maintains a personal website and blog, Heuretics.|$|E
5000|$|Many of Ulmer's {{breakthrough}} theories {{grow out}} of his home-spun [...] "puncepts" [...] like textshop, choragraphy, applied <b>grammatology,</b> mystory, heuretics, and post(e)-pedagogy. His explorations into what {{he refers to as}} an [...] "anticipatory consciousness" [...] designed to utilize the force of intuition as a way to invent emergent forms of knowledge, are methodologically remixed by Ulmerian disciples all over the world.|$|E
