Because she is a [...] "man-woman," [...] scholars have debated over Middleton and Dekker's use of this construct. The contradictory ideals Moll exposes throughout the play challenge her reputation and whether her ill-repute is deserved or not. Moll's male attire upholds her [...] "female" [...] modesty by literally covering her body. Her male attitude creates an identity of immorality regarding women having a male libido. Yet, she is chaste and not interested in pursuing relations with men (which {{is not to say}} that she is asexual necessarily). Her negative reputation is seemingly not deserved but is upheld throughout the play.|$|R
