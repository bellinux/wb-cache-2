5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
25|$|The <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> ∂Ω/∂k of {{capillary}} waves – {{dominated by}} surface tension effects – {{is greater than}} the phase velocity Ω/k. This is opposite to the situation of surface gravity waves (with surface tension negligible compared to the effects of gravity) where the phase velocity exceeds the <b>group</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Considering {{that the}} {{coupling}} among the heavy-hole exciton, light-hole exciton and the cavity photon can form bipolaritons in a quantum semiconductor microcavity, we calculate the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of the cavity polaritons at different incident angles using the coupling model of three harmonic oscillators.

40|$|Much {{experimental}} evidence of superluminal phenomena {{has been available}} by electromagnetic wave propagation experiments, with the results showing that the phase time do describe the barrier traversal time. Based on the extrapolated phase time approach and numerical methods, we show that the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of modified Bessel beams can be superluminal, and obtain the following results: 1) the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> increase {{with the increase of}} propagation distance, which is similar to the evanescent plane-wave cases, but in detail, there has some differences between them; 2) for large wave numbers, the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> fall off as the wave numbers increase, which is similar to the evanescent plane-wave cases; 3) for small wave numbers, the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> increase with the increase of wave numbers, this is different from the evanescent plane-wave cases...|$|R
25|$|A wave {{undergoes}} dispersion when {{either the}} phase velocity or the <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> {{depends on the}} wave frequency.|$|E
25|$|Another {{apparent}} contradiction lies in {{the fact}} that the <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> in anomalously dispersive media is higher than the speed of light. This was investigated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1907, 1914) and Léon Brillouin (1914). They came to the conclusion that in such cases the signal velocity is not equal to the <b>group</b> <b>velocity,</b> but to the front velocity which is never faster than the speed of light. Similarly, it is also argued that the apparent superluminal effects discovered by Günter Nimtz can be explained by a thorough consideration of the velocities involved.|$|E
25|$|When k is {{multiplied by}} the reduced Planck's constant, it equals the {{electron}}'s crystal momentum. Related to this, the <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> of an electron can be calculated based on how the energy of a Bloch state varies with k; for more details see crystal momentum.|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of the arbitrarily polarized {{pulse of the}} weak probe field through the resonant medium of Lambda-type three-level atoms with degenerate levels adiabatically driven by the coherent coupling field is considered. It is shown that such pulse is decomposed in the medium into two orthogonally polarized dark-state polaritons propagating with different <b>group</b> <b>velocities.</b> The expressions for the polarizations and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of these two polaritons are obtained. The dependence of these polarizations and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> on {{the values of the}} angular momenta of resonant levels, on the polarization of the coupling field and on the initial atomic state is studied.

40|$|We {{report on}} an interferometry-based {{measurement}} of the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of optical Bessel beams, providing confirmation of their superluminal character in the non-diffractive region. The measurements were performed in free space with a continuous wave laser and femtosecond pulses for phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> respectively. The Bessel beams were produced using a conical mirror. Comment: 3 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
50|$|In {{so-called}} dispersive media the dispersion relation can be {{a complicated}} function of wavevector, and the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> are not the same. For example, for several types of waves exhibited by atomic vibrations (phonons) in GaAs, the dispersion relations are shown in the figure for various directions of wavevector k. In the general case, the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> may have different directions.|$|R
25|$|In a {{dispersive}} medium, {{the speed}} of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the dispersion relation. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the phase velocity, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the <b>group</b> <b>velocity.</b> The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see optical dispersion for a description.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> dispersion, whether {{negative}} or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fibres, since if dispersion is too high, {{a group of}} pulses representing information will each spread in time and merge, {{making it impossible to}} extract the signal.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} various {{reports in the}} popular press of {{experiments}} on faster-than-light transmission in optics — most often {{in the context of}} a kind of quantum tunnelling phenomenon. Usually, such reports deal with a phase velocity or <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> faster than the vacuum velocity of light. However, as stated above, a superluminal phase velocity cannot be used for faster-than-light transmission of information.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the system}} noise {{is not a}} {{function}} of altitude, the phase of the observed waves at each altitude can be preserved, and therefore the accuracy in the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> won’t be seriously impacted. By contrast, the nature background noise at each altitude could be rather random, which can significantly disturb the phase at each altitude. Consequently, the associated random errors contributed by the nature background noise would severely affect the accuracy of phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities.</b> In conclusion, when the system noises is under a Gaussian distribution, and the nature background noise level is relatively low, the Fourier analysis is capable to correctly derive the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of pronounced atmospheric and/or ionospheric waves.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the simultaneous propagation of slow- and fast-light optical pulses in a four-wave mixing scheme using warm potassium vapor. We show {{that when the}} system is tuned such that the input probe pulses exhibit slow-light <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> and the generated pulses propagate with negative <b>group</b> <b>velocities,</b> the information velocity in the medium is nonetheless constrained to propagate at, or less than, c. These results demonstrate that the transfer and copying of information on optical pulses to those with negative <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> obeys information causality, {{in a manner that}} is reminiscent of a classical version of the no-cloning theorem. Additionally, these results support the fundamental concept that points of non-analyticity on optical pulses correspond to carriers of new information. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{combination}} of pulse-front slant, k-vector tilt, and crystal birefringence often permits exact matching of both phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> in three wave mixing in birefringent crystals. This makes possible more efficient mixing of short light pulses, and it permits efficient mixing of chirped or broad bandwidth light. We analyze this process and present examples. Differences in the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of the three interacting waves in a nonlinear crystal often limits the effective interaction length. For example, in mixing very short pulses, temporal walk off can stretch the pulses in time unless the crystal is very short. Efficient mixing with such short crystals requires high irradiances, but the irradiances are limited by higher order nonlinear effects such as intensity-dependent refractive index and two-photon absorption. Improved matching of the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> can alleviate this problem, allowing longer crystal and lower irradiances. Similarly, for high energy pulses, practical limits on crystal apertures mandate temporally stretching the pulses to reduce irradiances. For the resulting chirped pulses, temporal walk off restricts the chirp range unless the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> are well matched. In addition to perfectly matching the <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of all three waves, it is sometimes useful to match two velocities, such as the signal and idler in parametric amplification, permitting broadband parametric amplification, or to arrange the velocities of two inputs to bracket the generated sum frequency pulse, giving pulse compression under suitable circumstances...|$|R
25|$|The <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> {{of a wave}} (e.g., a light beam) {{may also}} exceed c in some circumstances. In such cases, which {{typically}} {{at the same time}} involve rapid attenuation of the intensity, the maximum of the envelope of a pulse may travel with a velocity above c. However, even this situation does not imply the propagation of signals with a velocity above c, even though one may be tempted to associate pulse maxima with signals. The latter association {{has been shown to be}} misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information on the pulse does not come faster than c without this effect. However, <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> can exceed c in some parts of a Gaussian beam in vacuum (without attenuation). The diffraction causes that the peak of pulse propagates faster, while overall power does not.|$|E
25|$|Now we {{let this}} pulse {{propagate}} through a fibre with , {{it will be}} affected by <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> dispersion. For this sign of D, the dispersion is anomalous, so that the higher frequency components will propagate a little bit faster than the lower frequencies, thus arriving before {{at the end of the}} fiber. The overall signal we get is a wider chirped pulse, shown in the upper right of the picture.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no axis of symmetry, there are two optical axes or binormals which are defined as {{directions}} along which light may propagate without birefringence, i.e., directions along which the wavelength is independent of polarization. For this reason, birefringent materials with three distinct refractive indices are called biaxial. Additionally, there are two distinct axes known as optical ray axes or biradials along which the <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> of the light is independent of polarization.|$|E

A single pump laser is employed and a homogeneous magnetic field is utilized to avoid cancellation effects through the nonlinear Zeeman effect. We suggest a feasible preparational procedure for the atomic initial state to achieve matched <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> for both signal fields. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new upper-mantle tomographic model derived solely from hum seismic data. Phase correlograms between station pairs are {{computed}} to extract phase-coherent signals. Correlograms are then stacked using the time-frequency phase-weighted stack method to build-up empirical Green's functions. <b>Group</b> <b>velocities</b> and uncertainties are {{measured in the}} wide period band of 30 - 250 s, following a resampling approach. Less data are required to extract reliable <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> at short periods than at long periods, and 2 yr of data are necessary to measure reliable <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> for the entire period band. <b>Group</b> <b>velocities</b> are first regionalized and then inverted versus depth using a simulated annealing method in which the number and shape of splines that describes the S-wave velocity model are variable.

40|$|ABSTRACT:	 Fundamental mode Rayleigh {{wave phase}} and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> between 15 and 50 seconds are {{measured}} along different paths {{in the northeastern}} United States (NEUS). Interstation paths are selected that lie mainly in the Precambrian Grenville province or the Appalachian orogenic belt. Although {{the differences between the}} two paths are not significant under consideration of measurement errors, separate inversions yield velocity models that are consis-tent with previous travel-time studies. The Appalachians appear to have a slightly thicker crust with higher velocities in the lower crust relative to the Grenville province. Also, the phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> in the NEUS appear to lie between those of the Canadian Shield and the central United States. Phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> between 15 and 40 seconds are also measured across the M. I. T. short-period seismic network in southeastern New England for two large events using frequency-wavenumber analysis. Beamforming indicates that the sporter period Rayleigh waves (T 1. 15 sec) can arrive as much as 15 degrees off-azimuth. The Rayleigh wave phase and <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> in this region suggest relatively high shear velocities in the mid to lower crust...|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, when wires {{are added}} symmetrically between the split rings, a {{passband}} occurs within the previously forbidden {{band of the}} split ring dispersion curves. That this passband occurs within a previously forbidden region indicates that the negative εeff for this region has combined with the negative μeff to allow propagation, which fits with theoretical predictions. Mathematically, the dispersion relation leads to a band with negative <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> everywhere, and a bandwidth that is independent of the plasma frequency, within the stated conditions.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{velocity}} {{that must be}} exceeded is the phase velocity of light rather than the <b>group</b> <b>velocity</b> of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, {{and in that case}} one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with no minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith–Purcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).|$|E

In the case of minimal Purcell effect in a classical cavity with small F = Q/Vmode, only the first term of equation 1 is considered, {{and the only way}} to increase modulation frequency is to increase photon density P0 by increasing the pumping power. However, thermal effects practically limit the modulation frequency to around 20GHz, making this approach is inefficient.|$|E

40|$|A {{light beam}} {{normally}} incident upon an uniformly moving dielectric medium is in general subject to bendings {{due to a}} transverse Fresnel-Fizeau light drag effect.

40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>velocities</b> of long-period Rayleigh and Love {{waves are}} measured, by band-pass {{filtering}} and group-delay time methods, to study regional differences {{in a deep}} island arc structure. The measurements are made, over a period range 20 to 80 sec, for propagation paths across the Japan Sea. At longer periods, the observed <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of Rayleigh and Love waves are lower {{by as much as}} 0. 1 km/sec than those for normal oceanic paths. It is found that the ARC- 1 model, which was previously introduced to explain the low <b>group</b> <b>velocities</b> of long-period surface waves travelling across the Philippine Sea, can also explain these low <b>group</b> <b>velocities.</b> The major feature of this model is a reduction of mantle shear-velocity by 0. 3 to 0. 4 km/sec, or 8 %, over a depth range 30 to 60 km as compared with that for normal oceanic models. This low mantle velocity and the high heat flow which was previously reported for this region suggest common causes such as high temperature and partial melting. The velocity contrast found here can be explained in terms of a 500 ℃ temperature excess coupled with a 4 % partial melting. |長周期表面波の群速度をもちいて,弧状列島の縁海である日本海のマントル構造を調べた. 日本北部及び千島列島の 5 つの地震についてソウルにおける長周期地震計の記録から,バンド・パス・フィルターとグループ・ディレイ・タイム法を利用して周期 20 秒から 80 秒までの群速度を求めた. 日本海を横切る表面波の群速度は標準的な海のものにくらべ長周期のところでレイレー波ラブ波ともに 0. 1 km/secほど遅い. この遅い群速度は以前にフィリッピン海を横切る表面波の遅い群速度を説明するためにもちいたARC- 1 モデルで同じように良く説明される. このモデルの重要な特徴は標準的な海のモデルにくらべてマントルの横波の速度が深さ 30 ～ 60 kmにわたって 0. 3 ～ 0. 4 km/secまたは 8 %ほど遅くなっていることである. この浅い所における低速度層の存在と日本海での高熱流量とを考えあわせると. 日本海の下のマントル内では他の地域にくらべて温度が高く,またそれによって部分溶融が生じていると考えられる. この考えにしたがうと 8 %の横波の速度差は 4 %程度の部分溶融をともなった 500 ℃の温度差で説明される...|$|R
