5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E

5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall {{because of their}} proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, {{as opposed to the}} westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E
5|$|As {{characters}} gain experience points their mutant superpowers {{and unique}} abilities can be upgraded. Items found during gameplay {{can also be}} equipped to further enhance a character's abilities. Characters can combine attacks to create a combo, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> or more players punch or kick a single enemy at the same time. The character's special abilities {{can also be used}} in the same manner to create a Super Combo which inflicts massive damage on enemies. Each character has several mutant powers that players can assign to controller buttons. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Boycott's {{eight seasons}} of {{captaincy}} were among Yorkshire's least successful. The club {{failed to win}} any competitions and ranked low in the Championship table, in contrast to their one-time dominance of English cricket. The {{beginning of the end}} of his captaincy came after BBC Radio Leeds interviews <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> Yorkshire committee members and former players, Don Brennan and Mel Ryan, said that a change in leadership was needed. Boycott himself did not suffer a loss of form to mirror that of his county; in his first year as captain, he scored 2,503runs at an average of 100.12, included a century in his first match as captain. His success was cited by Trueman as evidence that his selfish nature was harming Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> players compete {{against each other}} in separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne enjoyed {{another game}} {{at home on}} February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new {{strategy}} for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation {{and went on to}} win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34points, and also surpassed the 1,000point mark.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he woke up, the Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare {{and based on}} the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two,</b> three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.|$|E
5|$|Hamming {{set himself}} {{the task of}} solving this problem, which he {{realised}} would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E

5|$|Kami, Perempuan premiered in 1943 in Jakarta. It {{received}} multiple {{performances that}} year, some in Jakarta, some {{in other parts}} of Java. In 1950 Pane included Kami, Perempuan in his book Djinak-Djinak Merpati dengan Tjerita2 Sandiwara Lain, a collection of his stage plays. For this publication Pane removed a scene <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> neighbours came to visit the family, which included further conversation. Pane considered this scene to be anti-climactic, whereas without it the play's title became more appropriate. Another, smaller, change to the play was the removal of the names of Japan's enemies during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as phasing, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was also very interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>two</b> plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E

Microtransactions are also featured, allowing players to purchase in-game upgrades with real-life currency.|$|E
