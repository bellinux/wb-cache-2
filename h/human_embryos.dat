5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and the dreams of the crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken the Engineer. He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and the Engineer decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her {{that he would like to}} help her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises to take her to the Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the mutagen to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at the Engineer temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E
25|$|On August 2, 2007, {{after much}} {{independent}} investigation, {{it was revealed}} that discredited South Korean scientist Hwang Woo-Suk unknowingly produced the first <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> resulting from parthenogenesis. Initially, Hwang claimed he and his team had extracted stem cells from cloned <b>human</b> <b>embryos,</b> a result later found to be fabricated. Further examination of the chromosomes of these cells show indicators of parthenogenesis in those extracted stem cells, similar to those found in the mice created by Tokyo scientists in 2004. Although Hwang deceived the world about being the first to create artificially cloned <b>human</b> <b>embryos,</b> he did contribute a major breakthrough to stem cell research by creating <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> using parthenogenesis. The truth was discovered in 2007, long after the embryos were created by him and his team in February 2004. This made Hwang the first, unknowingly, to successfully perform the process of parthenogenesis to create a human embryon and, ultimately, a human parthenogenetic stem cell line.|$|E
25|$|Canadian law {{prohibits the}} following: cloning humans, cloning stem cells, growing <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> for {{research}} purposes, and buying or selling of embryos, sperm, eggs or other human reproductive material. It also bans making changes to human DNA that would pass {{from one generation}} to the next, including use of animal DNA in humans. Surrogate mothers are legally allowed, as is donation of sperm or eggs for reproductive purposes. <b>Human</b> <b>embryos</b> and stem cells are also permitted to be donated for research.|$|E
40|$|The <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> – a {{right to}} life? A {{preliminary}} theological-ethical evaluation It is known that the <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> is currently (during in-vitro impregnation/conception) qualitatively and genetically selected, after which unwanted embryos are destroyed. Stem cell research, which holds exceptional medical promise (and is medically exceptionally promising), however, also leads to the inevitable destruction of the <b>human</b> <b>embryo.</b> This article attempts to determine what {{the status of the}} <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> is according to the Word of God. The specific question that is posed is whether life starts before or after conception. The answer to this question will determine how the <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> ought to be handled/treated...|$|R
50|$|In a short paper, {{researchers}} {{inspired by}} scale relativity proposed a log-periodic {{law for the}} development of the <b>human</b> <b>embryo,</b> which fits pretty well with the steps of the <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> development.|$|R
50|$|The <b>human</b> <b>embryo,</b> {{according}} to Catholics, {{is also a}} sign of contradiction. According to Catholic belief, the <b>human</b> <b>embryo</b> is already a human being, {{as much as the}} human fetus and the newborn child. And for Christians, a human being is made in the image and likeness of God. The fact that these beliefs are highly contested by many quarters makes the <b>human</b> <b>embryo,</b> in the Catholic view, a sign of contradiction.|$|R
25|$|Although Republicans {{have voted}} for {{increases}} in government funding of scientific research, some members actively oppose the federal funding of {{embryonic stem cell research}} beyond the original lines because it involves the destruction of <b>human</b> <b>embryos.</b>|$|E

25|$|In April 2015, Chinese {{scientists}} reported {{results of}} an attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> using CRISPR to correct a mutation that causes beta thalassemia, a lethal heritable disorder. The study had previously been rejected by both Nature and Science in part because of ethical concerns. The experiments resulted in changing only some genes, and had off-target effects on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in reproductive medicine. In April 2016 Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> using CRISPR - this time to alter the CCR5 gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.|$|E

25|$|Policy {{regulations}} for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos {{were to be}} destroyed after seven days.|$|E
25|$|A robotic {{interstellar}} mission carrying some {{number of}} frozen early stage <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> is another theoretical possibility.

25|$|An {{endogenous}} retrovirus (ERV) is a retrovirus whose genome has been permanently {{incorporated into the}} germ-line genome of some organism and that is therefore copied with each reproduction of that organism. It is estimated that about 9 percent {{of the human genome}} have their origin in ERVs. In 2015 it was shown that proteins from an ERV are actively expressed in 3-day-old <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> and appear {{to play a role in}} embryonal development and protect embryos from infection by other viruses.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} are {{undifferentiated}} cells of an embryo. These cells are deemed to have a pluripotent potential {{because they have the}} ability to give rise to all of the tissues found in an adult organism. This ability allows stem cells to create any cell type, which could then be transplanted to replace damaged or destroyed cells. Controversy surrounds human ESC work due to the destruction of viable <b>human</b> <b>embryos.</b> Leading scientists to seek an alternative method of obtaining stem cells, SCNT is one such method.|$|E

25|$|Prior to this, {{thousands}} of women who were infertile, had adoption as the only path to parenthood. This {{set the stage to}} allow open and candid discussion of embryo donation and transfer. This breakthrough has given way to the donation of <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which impacted the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.|$|E
25|$|Embryonic stem (ES) {{cells are}} {{the cells of}} the inner cell mass of a {{blastocyst}}, an early-stage embryo. <b>Human</b> <b>embryos</b> reach the blastocyst stage 4–5 days post fertilization, at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ES cells are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the placenta.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{morphological}} similarities {{present in}} embryos of different species during development, {{it was once}} assumed that organisms re-enact their evolutionary history as an embryo. It was thought that <b>human</b> <b>embryos</b> passed through an amphibian then a reptilian stage before completing their development as mammals. Such a reenactment, often called recapitulation theory, is not supported by scientific evidence. What does occur, however, {{is that the first}} stages of development are similar in broad groups of organisms. At very early stages, for instance, all vertebrates appear extremely similar, but do not exactly resemble any ancestral species. As development continues, specific features emerge from this basic pattern.|$|E
