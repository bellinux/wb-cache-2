5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
