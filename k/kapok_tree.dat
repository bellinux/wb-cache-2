25|$|This plaza has {{a number}} of {{important}} features. The largest and best known is the La Pila fountain. This was constructed in 1562 in Moorish style, made of brick {{in the form of a}} diamond. The structure is attributed to Dominican brother Rodrigo de León. It measures fifty two meters in circumference and twelve meters in height. It has eight arches and a cylindrical tower which occasionally functioned as a watchtower. Another important feature is the La Pochota <b>kapok</b> <b>tree.</b> According to tradition, the Spanish town was founded around this tree. The last feature is a clock tower which was constructed in the 1950s. The town’s main structures are centered on this plaza, including the municipal palace and the former home of Liberal governor Angel Albino Corzo, for whom the town is partially named. One side of the plaza is taken by the “portales” a series of arches initially built in the 18th century, which contain a number of businesses. Unlike many towns, the main church does not face this plaza. It is set back from it about a block.|$|E
25|$|Commerce, {{transportation}} and services employ about eighteen percent. There are about 140 people dedicated to commerce, {{most of which}} is small grocery stores. Supermarkets and other similar stores are located in neighboring San Luis Potosí in Río Verde and San Ciro. Tourism is {{a small percentage of}} the economy, mostly based on the mission church at Concá and some resort hotels opened in recent years. During the colonial period, there were several haciendas in the municipality. One of these was San Nicolás de Concá, which still has abundant vegetation, a large fresh water spring and hiking trails. The main house has been converted into a hotel, conserving part of the original structure made of adobe, with rustic stairs, wooden roof beams and gardens. The San Nicolas Conca hotel is owned by an American by the name of Sharpton. The hacienda was originally dedicated to sugar cane and dates from the 18th century. It has fifty rooms and a 1000-year-old <b>kapok</b> <b>tree</b> which grows at a fresh water spring, called the Árbol Milenario or Millennium Tree. Its trunk has the second largest diameter in Mexico after the Tule tree in Oaxaca, requiring twenty two children linking hands to surround it. From its roots flows one of the fresh water springs of the community.|$|E
500|$|For a tree {{seedling}} to {{grow into}} an adult tree it needs light and space. If seeds only fell straight to the ground, competition among the concentrated saplings and {{the shade of the}} parent would likely prevent it from flourishing. Many seeds such as birch are small and have papery wings to aid dispersal by the wind. Ash trees and maples have larger seeds with blade shaped wings which spiral down to the ground when released. The <b>kapok</b> <b>tree</b> has cottony threads to catch the breeze.|$|E

2500|$|After the conquest, {{the town}} was refounded {{with the name of}} Villa Real de Chiapa by a large <b>kapok</b> <b>tree</b> called La Pochota as the first European city in Chiapas. However, the hot climate of the area did not entice many Spanish to stay. Most instead went to the {{northeast}} into the cooler mountains to found another city, today San Cristobal. The mountain city would be founded as Chiapa de los Españoles, while Villa Real de Chiapa would become known Chiapa de los Indios, left to the indigenous and monks there to evangelize them. Despite this, the city would remain {{one of the most important}} for the first 200 years of colonization. [...] While it was an encomienda at first, it became a dependency of the Spanish Crown in 1552, changing its name to Pueblo de la Real Corona de Chiapa de Indios. The developers of the area were Dominican friars, who followed the ideals of Bartolomé de las Casas in neighboring San Cristobal. They worked to protect the indigenous against the abuses of the Spanish colonizers, allowing them to gain the trust of the local people and convert them to Christianity. They also taught the local indigenous crafts such as European pottery methods, fireworks making and rope making. The Dominicans also built many of the landmarks of the town such as the La Pila fountain. This protection and the very high percentage of indigenous population in the colonial period allowed for many indigenous names to survive to the present day. Along with surnames such as Grajales, Castellanos, Marino Hernández, there is Nandayapa, Tawa, Nuriulú, Nampulá and Nangusé among others.|$|E
