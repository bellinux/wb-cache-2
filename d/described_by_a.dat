5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

5|$|Bipartite verbal {{compounds}} such {{as these}} are not peculiar to any language in particular. They are in fact very common, and may even occur in every language, albeit with varying frequency. English {{has a number of}} complex predicates, include go sightseeing, have breakfast and take (a) bath. The event described by go sightseeing is unable to be described using a single verb sightsee; inflections like sightsaw and sightseen are ungrammatical. An event like take (a) bath, however, may be <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single verb bathe, but it arguably has a slightly different meaning. Take (a) bath, in any case, is far more common.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper from}} 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that {{some aspects of}} matrix models and M-theory are <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> noncommutative quantum field theory, {{a special kind of}} {{physical}} theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property. This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.|$|E

5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of an atom by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called an atom. If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such an atom is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} Iximche were first <b>described</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Guatemalan {{historian}} {{in the late}} 17th century. They were visited various times by scholars during the 19th century, who published plans and descriptions. Serious investigations of the site started in the 1940s and continued sporadically until the early 1970s. In 1980, during the Guatemalan Civil War, a meeting {{took place at the}} ruins between guerillas and Maya leaders that resulted in the guerillas stating that they would defend indigenous rights. A ritual was carried out at the site in 1989 in order to reestablish the ruins as a sacred place for Maya ceremonies. United States President George W. Bush visited the site in 2007, and in the same year Iximche was the venue for the III Continental Summit of Indigenous Peoples and Nationalities of Abya Yala.|$|E
