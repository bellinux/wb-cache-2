Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 54 - 72). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The pteromalid ectoparasitoid Muscidifurax zaraptor was studied in an attempt to understand <b>the</b> behavior and <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> <b>cues</b> related to <b>the</b> recognition of its host, Musca domestica Linnaeus, the common house fly. Section I of this study involved the development of an ethogram in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of this parasitoid's behavior. Significant differences were found among several of the various treatments. Section II involved the determination of whether chemical and/or physical cues were involved in eliciting host recognition behavior. Concerning this, both chemical and physical factors were important. The chemical factors were water soluble and were only removed from the host pupae by soaking in water. This water extract had no activity if applied to a flat surface. When applied to glass beads of approximate size and shape of the host, this extract elicited much exploration of the glass beads. Glass beads to which no extract was applied showed no activity. Section III involves {{the character}}ization of these cues. By testing various physical and chemical properties of the extract, the active component of the extract was determined to be a large molecular weight protein. Electrophoresis found several bands or groups of bands present. The major bands or groups of bands that were distinguished were approximately 31, 34 - 38, 45, 50, 80, 97, 115, and 200 kilodaltons in size...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{binocular}} cues {{of motion}} in depth: the interocular velocity difference (IOVD) and changing disparity over time (CDOT). Psychophysical {{evidence for the}} contribution to perceiving motion in depth has been accumulated for both of <b>the</b> two <b>cues,</b> using techniques to isolate each cue. However, no study estimated seriously how reliably each <b>cue</b> is <b>isolated</b> in <b>the</b> techniques. In this study, we apply a model of motion in depth to estimate how each type of stimuli isolates each of IOVD and CDOT <b>cues.</b> <b>The</b> model consists of the motion energy and the disparity energy detectors as subunits and adds their outputs to built the IOVD and CDOT detectors. Simulations show that some, {{but not all of}} stimuli used in the literature are appropriate for <b>isolating</b> <b>cues.</b> <b>The</b> temporally uncorrelated randomdot stereogram <b>isolates</b> CDOT <b>cue</b> and <b>the</b> binocularly uncorrelated randomdot kinematogram isolates IOVD cues. However, temporally anticorreated version of randomdot stereogram has influence of reverse motion components of IOVD and binocularly anticorreated version of randomdot kinematogram has influence of reverse motion components of CDOT. Gratings with opposite orientation between the eyes are also good for isolation of IOVD. We performed psychophysical experiments to examine the plausibility of the model prediction...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that individualized head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurements {{are needed to}} adequately capture all of the 3 D spatial hearing cues. However, many perceptual {{studies have shown that}} localization accuracy in the lateral dimension is only minimally decreased by the use of non-individualized head-related transfer functions. This evidence supports the idea that the individualized components of an HRTF could be isolated from those that are more general in nature. In the present study we decomposed the HRTF at each location into average, lateral and intraconic spectral components, along with an ITD in an effort to <b>isolate</b> <b>the</b> sound localization <b>cues</b> that are responsible for the inter-individual differences in localization performance. HRTFs for a given listener were then reconstructed systematically with components that were both individualized and non-individualized in nature, and the effect of each modification was analyzed via a virtual localization test where brief 250 -ms noise bursts were rendered with the modified HRTFs. Results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>cues</b> important for individualization of HRTFs are contained almost exclusively in the intraconic portion of the HRTF spectra and localization is only minimally affected by introducing non-individualized <b>cues</b> into <b>the</b> other HRTF components. These results provide new insights into what specific inter-individual differences in head-related acoustical features are most relevant to sound localization, and provide a framework for how future human-machine interfaces might be more effectively generalized and/or individualized...|$|R
40|$|Experience and {{experiments}} on human color constancy (i. e., Arend & Reeves, 1986; Craven & Foster, 1992) {{tell us that}} we are capable of judging the illumination. However, when asked to make a match of the illuminant´s color and brightness, human observers seem to be quite poor (Granzier, Brenner, & Smeets, 2009 a). Here we investigate whether human observers use (rather than match) daylight for estimating ecologically important dimensions: time of year, time of day, and outdoor temperature. In the first three experiments we had our observers evaluate calibrated color images of an outdoor urban scene acquired throughout a year. Although some observers could estimate the month and the temperature, overall they were quite poor at judging the time of day. In particular, observers were not able to discriminate between morning and afternoon pictures even when they were allowed to compare multiple images captured on the same day (Experiment 3). However, observers could distinguish between midday and sunset and sunrise daylight. Classification analysis showed that, given a perfect knowledge of its variation, an ideal observer could have performed the task over chance only considering the average chromatic variation in the picture. Instead, our observers reported using shadows to detect the position of the sun in order to estimate the time of day. However, this information is highly unreliable without knowledge of the orientation of the scene. In Experiment 4 we used an LED chamber in order to present our observers with lights whose chromaticity and illuminance varied along the daylight locus, thus <b>isolating</b> <b>the</b> light <b>cues</b> from <b>the</b> sun position <b>cue.</b> We conclude that discriminating the slight variations in chromaticity and brightness, which potentially distinguish morning and afternoon illuminations, lies beyond the ability of human observers...|$|R

Here, we adapt a cueing task to measure spatial <b>cueing</b> effects on <b>the</b> decisions of honeybees and compare their behavior to that of humans and monkeys in a similarly structured two-alternative forced-choice perceptual task. Unlike <b>the</b> typical <b>cueing</b> paradigm in which the stimulus strength remains unchanged within a block of trials, for the monkey and human studies we randomized the contrast of the signal to simulate more real world conditions in which the organism is uncertain about the strength of the signal. A Bayesian ideal observer that weights sensory evidence from cued and uncued locations based on <b>the</b> <b>cue</b> validity to maximize overall performance is used as a benchmark of comparison against the three animals and other suboptimal models: probability matching, ignore <b>the</b> <b>cue,</b> always follow <b>the</b> <b>cue,</b> and an additive bias/single decision threshold model. We find that <b>the</b> <b>cueing</b> effect is pervasive across all three species but is smaller in size than that shown by the Bayesian ideal observer. Humans show a larger cueing effect than monkeys and bees show the smallest effect. <b>The</b> <b>cueing</b> effect and overall performance of the honeybees allows rejection of the models in which the bees are ignoring <b>the</b> <b>cue,</b> following <b>the</b> <b>cue</b> and disregarding stimuli to be discriminated, or adopting a probability matching strategy. Stimulus strength uncertainty also reduces the theoretically predicted variation in cueing effect with stimulus strength of an optimal Bayesian observer and diminishes the size of <b>the</b> <b>cueing</b> effect when stimulus strength is low. A more biologically plausible model that includes an additive bias to the sensory response from <b>the</b> <b>cued</b> location, although not mathematically equivalent to the optimal observer for the case stimulus strength uncertainty, can approximate the benefits of the more computationally complex optimal Bayesian model.
