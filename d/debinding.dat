50|$|Another low {{temperature}} application of vacuum furnaces is <b>debinding,</b> {{a process for}} the removal of binders. Heat is applied under a vacuum in a sealed chamber, melting or vaporizing the binder from the aggregate. The binder is evacuated by the pumping system and collected or purged downstream. The material with a higher melting point is left behind in a purified state and can be further processed.|$|E
5000|$|Metal {{injection}} moulding (MIM). Here the powder, normally very fine (<25microns) and spherical, {{is mixed with}} plastic or wax binder to near the maximum solid loading, typically around 65vol%, and injection moulded to form a [...] "green" [...] part of complex geometry. This part is then heated or otherwise treated to remove the binder (<b>debinding)</b> to give a [...] "brown" [...] part. This part is then sintered, and shrinks by ~18% to give a complex and 97-99% dense finished part. Invented in the 1970s, production has increased since 2000 with an estimated global volume in 2014 of 12,000t worth €1265millions.|$|E
50|$|Several metal {{consolidation}} {{techniques are}} used to produce the final product. Metal injection moulding (MIM) otherwise known as powder injection moulding is a well-established and cost-effective method of fabricating small-to-moderate size metal components in large quantities. It {{is derived from the}} method plastic injection moulding, whereby mixing of a metal powder with a polymer binder forms the feedstock, which is then injected into a mould, after which the binder is removed via heat treatment under vacuum before final sintering. With titanium however, the binders used in MIM results in the introduction of carbon into the matrix due to insufficient binder removal prior to sintering and/or deleterious reactions between the decomposing binder, the <b>debinding</b> atmosphere, and the metal phase. This results in titanium parts with mechanical properties unsuited for critical aerospace applications, but suitable for parts where tensile and impact properties are less important. Recently, work has been carried out to reduce the binder to < 8% volume fraction, resulting in the complete removal of the binder from the moulded component during heat treatment.|$|E
5000|$|The process steps involve {{combining}} metal powders with polymers such as wax and polypropylene binders {{to produce}} the [...] "feedstock" [...] mix that is injected as a liquid into a mold using plastic injection molding machines. The molded or [...] "green part" [...] is cooled and ejected from the mold. Next, {{a portion of the}} binder material is removed using solvent, thermal furnaces, catalytic process, or a combination of methods. The resulting, fragile and porous (40 volume percent [...] "air") part, is in a condition called the [...] "brown" [...] stage. To improve handling often the <b>debinding</b> and sintering are combined into a single process. Sintering heats the powder to temperatures near the melting point in a protective atmosphere furnace to densify the particles using capillary forces in a process called Sintering. MIM parts are often sintered at temperatures nearly high enough to induce partial melting in a process termed liquid phase sintering. For example, a stainless steel might be heated to 1350 to 1400 degrees Celsius). Diffusion rates are high leading to high shrinkage and densification. If performed in vacuum, it is common to reach 96-99% solid density. The end-product metal has comparable mechanical and physical properties with annealed parts made using classic metalworking methods. Post sintering heat treatments for MIM are the same as with other fabrication routes, and with high density the MIM component is compatible with the metal conditioning treatments such as plating, passivating, annealing, carburizing, nitriding, and precipitation hardening.|$|E
5000|$|Metal {{injection}} molding [...] (MIM) is a metalworking {{process by which}} finely-powdered metal is mixed with a measured amount of binder material to comprise a [...] "feedstock" [...] capable of being handled by plastic processing equipment through {{a process known as}} {{injection molding}}. The molding process allows dilated (oversized due to binder) complex parts to be shaped in a single step and in high volume. After molding, the powder-binder mixture is subjected to steps that remove the binder (<b>debinding)</b> and sinter densify the powders. End products are small components used in various industries and applications. The nature of MIM feedstock flow is defined by a physics called rheology. [...] Current equipment capability requires processing to stay limited to products that can be molded using typical volumes of 100 grams or less per [...] "shot" [...] into the mold. Rheology does allow this [...] "shot" [...] to be distributed into multiple cavities, thus becoming cost-effective for small, intricate, high-volume products which would otherwise be quite expensive to produce by alternate or classic methods. The variety of metals capable of implementation within MIM feedstock are broad, but mostly stainless steels, as common in powder metallurgy; they contain the same alloying constituents found in industry standards. However, oxygen is often a difficulty and is often not specified, but can be a problem for corrosion resistance. Subsequent conditioning operations are performed on the molded shape, where the binder material is removed and the metal particles are diffusion bonded and densified into the desired state with typically 15% shrinkage in each dimension.|$|E

Experimental results of the quickest and higher percentage of FOG derivatives leach out from green part is being analysed. The green part will undergo two different solvent <b>debinding</b> (Heptane and Hexane) with three different solvent temperature. <b>Debinding</b> times was set for 10 hours and every 1, 3, 6 and 10 hours the green part will undergo weight measurement for monitoring the weight loss percentage of green part. It seems that both solvent indicates good diffusion and dilution for extracting the FOG derivatives out from the green part in producing brown part where no sign of part crack or swelling during and after solvent <b>debinding.</b> Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) for element detection and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis also being perform which indicates the good pores build up. Results found that the best solvent for removing FOG derivatives is hexane with 60 oC being the choice of solvent temperature...|$|E
40|$|Metal Injection Molding (MIM) is a {{cost-effective}} technique for producing small, complex, precision parts in high volumes. MIM {{consists of four}} main processing steps: mixing, injection molding, <b>debinding</b> and sintering. In the mixing step, the powder titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) medical grade is mixed with a binder system based on palm stearin to form a homogeneous feedstock. The rheological studies of the feedstock have been determined properly in order to success during injection into injection molding machine. After molding, the binder holds the particles in place. The binder systems then have to be removed completely through <b>debinding</b> step. Any contamination of the binder systems will affect the final properties of the parts. During <b>debinding</b> step, solvent extraction <b>debinding</b> {{has been used to}} remove partly of the binder systems. The debound part is then sintered at high temperature under control atmosphere furnace. The properties of the sintered craniofacial implants then was measured and compared. The sintered craniofacial implants also then were determined in term of in-vitro cytotoxicity study using mouse fibroblast lines L- 929. The results show that the sintered craniofacial implants of titanium alloy produced by MIM fullfill the in-vitro cytotoxicity test.
