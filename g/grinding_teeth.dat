25|$|In the mid-Eocene, about 47 {{million years}} ago, Epihippus, a genus which {{continued}} the evolutionary trend of increasingly efficient <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth,</b> evolved from Orohippus. Epihippus had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well-formed crests. A late species of Epihippus, {{sometimes referred to}} as Duchesnehippus intermedius, had teeth similar to Oligocene equids, although slightly less developed. Whether Duchesnehippus was a subgenus of Epihippus or a distinct genus is disputed. Epihippus was only 2 feet tall.|$|E
500|$|Stegosaurus {{and related}} genera were herbivores. However, their teeth and jaws are very {{different}} from those of other herbivorous ornithischian dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth</b> common to its fellow ornithischians, Stegosaurus (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements. Their teeth were [...] "not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding", and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of gastroliths—the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested—to aid the grinding process, so how exactly Stegosaurus obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains [...] "poorly understood".|$|E
2500|$|At birth, {{elephants}} have a {{total of}} 28 molar plate-like <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth</b> not including the tusks. [...] These are organized into four sets of seven successively larger teeth which the elephant will slowly wear through during its lifetime of chewing rough plant material. [...] Only four teeth are used for chewing at a given time, and as each tooth wears out, another tooth moves forward {{to take its place}} in a process similar to a conveyor belt. [...] The last and largest of these teeth usually becomes exposed when the animal is around 40 years of age, and will often last for an additional 20 years. When the last of these teeth has fallen out, regardless of the elephant's age, the animal will {{no longer be able to}} chew food and will die of starvation.|$|E

[...] That {{the source of the}} effect produced was really moral I have no doubt. An utterly, hopelessly depraved nature was expressed in physical terms, that taken each separately had nothing positively startling. You imagined him clammily cold to the touch, like a snake. The slightest reproof, the most mild and justifiable remonstrance, would be met by a resentful glare and an evil shrinking of his thin dry upper lip, a snarl of hate to which he generally added the agreeable sound of <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} that the {{structure}} of the <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth</b> is very complicated, the harder and the softer parts being, as it were, interlaced with one another. The result of this is that, as the tooth wears, the crown presents a peculiar pattern, the nature of which is not very easily deciphered at first; but which it is important we should understand clearly. Each grinding tooth of the upper jaw has an outer wall so shaped that, on the worn crown, it exhibits the form of two crescents, one in front and one behind, with their concave sides turned outwards. From the inner side of the front crescent, a crescentic front ridge passes inwards and backwards, and its inner face enlarges into a strong longitudinal fold or pillar. From the front part of the hinder crescent, a back ridge takes a like direction, and also has its pillar.|$|E
60|$|The {{succession}} of forms {{which he has}} brought together carries us from the top {{to the bottom of}} the Tertiaries. Firstly, there is the true horse. Next we have the American Pliocene form of the horse (Pliohippus); in the conformation of its limbs it presents some very slight deviations from the ordinary horse, and the crowns of the <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth</b> are shorter. Then comes the Protohippus, which represents the European Hipparion, having one large digit and two small ones on each foot, and the general characters of the fore-arm and leg to which I have referred. But it is more valuable than the European Hipparion for the reason that it is devoid of some of the peculiarities of that form--peculiarities which tend to show that the European Hipparion is rather a member of a collateral branch, than a form in the direct line of succession. Next, in the backward order in time, is the Miohippus, which corresponds pretty nearly with the Anchitherium of Europe. It presents three complete toes--one large median and two smaller lateral ones; and there is a rudiment of that digit, which answers to the little finger of the human hand.|$|E

6000|$|You find one: {{and in a}} moment, what a change! The deep has {{suddenly}} become shallow; the blue white, from the gleam of the white coral at the bottom. But the coral is not all white, only indeed a little of it; for as you look down through the clear water, you find that the coral is starred with innumerable live flowers, blue, crimson, grey, every conceivable hue; and {{that these are the}} coral polypes, each with its ring of arms thrust out of its cell, who are building up their common habitations of lime. If you want to understand, by a rough but correct description, what a coral polype is: all who have been to the sea-side know, or at least have heard of, sea-anemones. [...] Now coral polypes are sea-anemones, which make each a shell of lime, growing with its growth. As for their shapes, the variety of them, the beauty of them, no tongue can describe them. If you want to see them, go to the Coral Rooms of the British or Liverpool Museums, and judge for yourselves. Only remember that you must re-clothe each of those exquisite forms with a coating of live jelly of some delicate hue, and put back into every one of the thousand cells its living flower; and into the beds, or rather banks, of the salt-water flower garden, the gaudiest of shell-less sea-anemones, such as we have on our coasts, rooted in the cracks, and live shells and sea-slugs, as gaudy as they, crawling about, with fifty other forms of fantastic and exuberant life. You must not overlook, too, the fish, especially the parrot-fish, some of them of the gaudiest colours, who spend their lives in browsing on the live coral, with strong clipping and <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth,</b> just as a cow browses the grass, keeping the animal matter, and throwing away the lime {{in the form of an}} impalpable white mud, which fills up the interstices in the coral beds.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were still}} more serious {{circumstances}} when exasperation at the flippant tone about him carried him beyond the ordinary bounds of that polite time. A guest at table asked contemptuously {{what was the}} use of a nation like the French having reason, if they did not use it. [...] "They mock the other nations of the earth, and yet are the most credulous of all." [...] ROUSSEAU: [...] "I forgive them for their credulity, but not for condemning those who are credulous in some other way." [...] Some one said that in matters of religion everybody was right, but that everybody should remain in that in which he had been born. ROUSSEAU, with warmth: [...] "Not so, by God, if it is a bad one, for then it can do nothing but harm." [...] Then some one contended that religion always did some good, as a kind of rein to the common people who had no other morality. All the rest cried out at this in indignant remonstrance, one shrewd person remarking that the common people had much livelier fear of being hanged than of being damned. The conversation was broken off for a moment by the hostess calling out, [...] "After all, one must nourish the tattered affair we call our body, so ring and let them bring us the joint." [...] This done, the servants dismissed, and the door shut, the discussion was resumed with such vehemence by Duclos and Saint Lambert, that, says the lady who tells us the story, [...] "I feared they were bent on destroying all religion, and I prayed for some mercy to be shown at any rate to natural religion." [...] There was not a whit more sympathy for that than for the rest. Rousseau declared himself paullo infirmior, and clung to the morality of the gospel as the natural morality which in old times constituted the whole and only creed. [...] "But what is a God," [...] cried one impetuous disputant, [...] "who gets angry and is appeased again?" [...] Rousseau began to murmur between <b>grinding</b> <b>teeth,</b> and a tide of pleasantries set in at his expense, to which came this: [...] "If it is a piece of cowardice to suffer ill to be spoken of one's friend behind his back, 'tis a crime to suffer ill to be spoken of one's God, who is present; and for my part, sirs, I believe in God." [...] "I admit," [...] said the atheistic champion, [...] "that it is a fine thing to see this God bending his brow to earth and watching with admiration the conduct of a Cato. But this notion is, like many others, very useful in some great heads, such as Trajan, Marcus Aurelius, Socrates, where it can only produce heroism, but it is the germ of all madnesses." [...] ROUSSEAU: [...] "Sirs, I leave the room if you say another word more," [...] and he was rising to fulfil his threat, when the entry of a new-comer stopped the discussion.[224] ...|$|E
