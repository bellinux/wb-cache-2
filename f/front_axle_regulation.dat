50|$|In general, Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has over a Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is better gross axle weight ratings.|$|R
50|$|The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{reduces the}} turn {{radius of the}} tractor. The <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam turns with the wheels to give an {{effective}} turn angle of 65°. The tractor turns tighter and faster so it spends less time turning and more time working. The SuperSteer <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> also increases the wheelbase, {{with the weight of}} the front ballast resting directly on the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> beam. Traction is enhanced in certain conditions without need for extra ballast.|$|R
5000|$|The first Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> {{was used}} in 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> were closed knuckle, with king pins and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> started out with 23 spline axle shafts {{and then went to}} 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|R
50|$|As {{a running}} change, four-wheel drive 1990 models {{produced}} after November 1989 were produced with Dana 35 <b>front</b> <b>axles,</b> replacing the previous Dana 28 <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fatigue failure {{has become}} a major concern in the {{automobile}} and aircraft industry, heavy machinery etc. Failures by fatigue are especially dangerous because they are unpredictable; giving no prior notification of the imminent failure they occur suddenly. <b>Front</b> <b>axle</b> of tractor {{is one of the major}} and very important components that undergo severe load conditions and it fails unexpectedly causes unrecoverable losses. The objective of this study is to analyze the existing design of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> of the tractor for service load conditions and redesign to its functional requirements and to increase its life expectations. Finite element simulation is carried out for the existing <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> using ANSYS. The critical location of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has to be identified and redesigned to ensure the safety. The existing geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified to the optimum size which suits for functional requirements with increased life and minimum cost. In this analysis, the geometry of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is modified and a new design is proposed. The life expectancy of the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> was predicted for the dynamic load using ANSYS fatigue design module...|$|R

50|$|A two speed {{transfer}} case also engaged the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> M39s and M809s used one which engaged the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> automatically if {{the rear wheels}} turned faster than the front, as when the rear wheels spun. The M939s had an improved type, which always engaged the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the low range, in the high range the driver could engage and disengage it with an air control.|$|R

50|$|Historically, this {{designation}} {{was used}} {{regardless of whether}} the entire engine was behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> line. In recent times, the manufactures of some cars have added to the designation with the term front-mid which describes a car where the engine is in front of the passenger compartment but behind the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> Most pre-World War II front engine cars would qualify as front-mid engine, using the front-mid designation, or on the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. After {{preliminary}} design of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is finished, {{finite element analysis}} module of CATIA {{is used to calculate}} the distribution of stress field and displacement field of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> in the working conditions of vertical static loading, emergency braking as well as side slipping of bus, and then the conclusion will be reached to provide theory basis for <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> design of the whole project. Preface Most of city buses are two or three steps, the height of its floor is 600 mm～ 700 mm, for this kinds of buses, the common <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can meet the challenge. With the development of urban transportation and the growth in the living standard, two or three steps buses have inconvenient problem for particular group and waste times to get up and down the bus. A city needs one step buses {{to meet the needs of}} all kinds of people. To achieve this requirement, the bus floor height should be lower. The bus floor height is about 360 mm～ 400 mm. To lower floor height means the space under the axle is to be decreased, as shown in fig. 1. To resolve this problem, the key is to design large fall low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> and full-scale finite element analysis of the <b>front</b> <b>axle.</b> The paper analyzes the load conditions of vertical static of low floor <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> emergenc...|$|R

50|$|The Massif is also {{fitted with}} manual-locking {{free-wheeling}} hubs on the <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> which prevent {{the rotation of}} <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> components, supposedly to reduce wear. An optional limited slip rear differential was also available to improve off-road ability by reducing the chance of getting cross-axled.|$|R
