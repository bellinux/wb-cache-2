25|$|In the 2003 election, Charest {{had promised}} to allow the cities that had been {{forcibly}} merged by the Parti Québécois government to hold referendums which would allow to demerge and return to their previous situation.

In office however, Charest retreated from his promise. Municipalitites were allowed to hold <b>demerger</b> referendums, if at least 10 per cent of the electorate signed a petition calling for them, and only if more than 35 per cent participated in the voting process. In some former municipalities, such as Saint Laurent on the Island of Montreal, the turnout of the vote was of 75.2 per cent in favour of a <b>demerger,</b> but it was invalidated because the voter turnout was just 28.6 per cent.|$|E

The <b>demerger</b> took place on January 1, 2006, leaving 15 municipalities on the island, including Montreal. De-merged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services.

2500|$|The <b>demerger</b> process also {{resulted}} in the restructuring of the existing megacities, with both these and the demerged cities handing over massive powers over taxation and local services to the new [...] "agglomeration councils". The makeup of these councils {{was based on the}} population of the municipalities involved, with the mayors having the right to unilaterally appoint all of the individuals who would represent their cities on the council. The resulting structure was seen by many to be less democratic than the one which had preceded it, as demerged municipalities were denied an effective voice, and the city councils of the major cities were substantially weakened by the power of the mayors to go over the heads of opposition councillors and exercise power through their appointees to the agglomeration body.|$|E
