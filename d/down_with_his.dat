5|$|At the Post's home, Hal Dunton sits <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> love {{interest}} Sue Post, cautiously {{checking to see}} if they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with the father as he takes the daughter away by car. The father refuses and Hal is knocked down before the father and daughter depart to a boarding school. The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|Fusō and Yamashiro {{were the}} only two Japanese battleships at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the southernmost action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and both were lost {{in the early hours of}} 25 October 1944 to torpedoes and naval gunfire. Some eyewitnesses later claimed that Fusō broke in half, and that both halves {{remained}} afloat and burning for an hour, but historian Anthony Tully has made the case that she simply sank after forty minutes of flooding. Six battleships and eight cruisers were lying in wait for Yamashiro; she did not survive the encounter, and Vice-Admiral Shōji Nishimura went <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ship. Only ten crewmembers from each ship survived.|$|E
5|$|Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, DSO and Bar (4 April 1900– 1 March 1942) was {{a senior}} officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, {{including}} service in both world wars. At the helm of HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander.

5|$|As the Mysterons {{start to}} fire on Cloudbase, Dr Fawn is killed. Posing as his assistant, Mysteron {{intermediary}} Captain Black reports that Scarlet is dead with {{no possibility of}} recovery, his retro-metabolic ability being too weak to heal such extensive injuries. The Mysteron assault intensifies, resulting {{in the deaths of}} Magenta and the remaining Angels, until only White, Blue and Lieutenant Green are left alive in the Control Room. As the stricken Cloudbase loses altitude, Green is killed by another explosion, which also cripples Blue and leaves him unable to save himself. White resolves to go <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> command, and is seen standing to attention and saluting in a spiralling freeze frame shot, accompanied by the sounds of Cloudbase crashing to Earth.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cú Chulainn had rescued Derbforgaill, a Scandinavian princess, from being sacrificed to the Fomorians. She {{falls in love}} with him, and she and her handmaid come to Ireland in search of him {{in the form of a}} pair of swans. Cú Chulainn, not {{realising}} who she is, shoots her <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> sling, and then saves her life by sucking the stone from her side. Having tasted her blood, he cannot marry her, and gives her to his foster-son Lugaid Riab nDerg. Lugaid goes on to become High King of Ireland, but the Lia Fáil (stone of destiny), fails to cry out when he stands on it, so Cú Chulainn splits it in two with his sword. When Derbforgaill is mutilated by the women of Ulster out of jealousy for her sexual desirability and dies of her wounds, Lugaid dies of grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges them by demolishing the house the women are inside, killing 150 of them.|$|E
5|$|For {{his service}} to the Indian nation, the {{president}} of India awarded Manekshaw a Padma Vibhushan in 1972 and conferred upon him the rank of field marshal, a first, on 3 January 1973. He {{became one of the}} only two army generals of independent India to be awarded this rank; the other being Kodandera Madappa Cariappa who was awarded the rank in 1986. Manekshaw retired from active service a fortnight later on 15 January 1973 after a career of nearly four decades; he settled <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife Silloo in Coonoor, the civilian town next to Wellington Cantonment where he had served as commandant of the Defence Services Staff College, at an earlier time in his career. Popular with Gurkha soldiers, Nepal fêted Manekshaw as an honorary general of the Nepalese Army in 1972. A flyover bridge in Ahmedabad's Shivranjeeni area was named after him in 2008 by Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat at that time.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow pursued Leipzig, {{and quickly}} caught up, opening fire by 14:40. After {{about twenty minutes}} of firing, Leipzig was hit; she turned to port to open the range, before turning to {{starboard}} {{in order to bring}} her full broadside into action. In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing Glasgow to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. Leipzig was battered severely by Cornwall and Kent and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In the course of the engagement, Leipzig hit Cornwall eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on the stricken cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. Leipzig finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun going <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> ship. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.|$|E

Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land.

5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head <b>down</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

They find the city under dictatorial rule by 'Madame La Presidente' Grasiento, and learn that the town contains no Condor Transglobal offices. The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, {{and that he has}} not been in Paris recently.

5|$|While racing for {{position}} on lap 23, Sainz forced Jolyon Palmer {{off the track}} in turn two and was later handed a ten-second time penalty for the incident. Four laps later, Pascal Wehrlein tried to overtake Felipe Nasr for 16th, but was unsuccessful and in turn lost a position to Kvyat. His teammate Ricciardo overtook Kevin Magnussen for eighth on lap 29, but lost the position again and was in turn passed by Romain Grosjean. As Nico Rosberg started to lap backmarkers on lap 31, the gap to second-placed Hamilton started to come <b>down,</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds to {{a little more than}} seven seconds by lap 36. Meanwhile, Verstappen was forced to retire due to power unit failure on lap 34, while running in sixth place. As Hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem, his gap to Rosberg started to increase again, staying at 13 seconds by lap 41. Wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on the same lap, but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute, resulting in him moving into last place on the road.|$|E

25|$|In Byzantine sources, {{the adversary}} of Gello is often St. Sisinnius or Sisoe, whose defeat of her is his most renowned deed.
