5000|$|Neuromarketing is a {{reasonably}} {{new field of}} enquiry. Prior research, which often relied on participants' self-reported responses shed much light on basic decision processes and motivations. However, neuromarketing, which investigates observed behaviours, provides more detailed insights into the complexity of consumer behavior and {{can also be used}} to validate extant research. At times, people are simply unaware of why they behave in certain ways or are unable to articulate the motivation behind their actions. Neuroscience has proved to be particularly valuable in understanding the emotional aspects of behaviour. [...] Theories that underpin neuromarketing were first explored by marketing professor Gerald Zaltman in the 1990s. Zaltman and his associates were employed by organizations, such as Coca Cola ltd, to instigate brain scans and observe neural activity of consumers (Kelly, 2002). Psychoanalysis techniques such as fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imagining), eye tracking, <b>electrodermal</b> <b>response</b> measures and other neuro-technologies are used to uncover an individual's underlying emotions and social interactions as represented in the scans (Fisher, Chin and Kiltzman, 2011). Zaltman theorised a technique called ZMET; this involved using visual representations to help uncover underlying and deep thoughts within a person (Kelly, 2002). With the use of ZMET, Zaltman aimed to make powerful, emotionally completing advertising. Brain activity was recorded while participants viewed the ad, ultimately to explore and discover non-conscious thoughts of consumers. His research methods enhanced psychological research used in marketing tools (Kelly, 2002).|$|E

40|$|The {{habituation}} {{to intense}} acoustic stimuli and {{the acquisition of}} differentially conditioned fear were assessed in 53 clinically anxious and 30 non-anxious control children and young adolescents. Anxious children tended to show larger <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses</b> during habituation, but {{did not differ in}} blink startle latency or magnitude. After acquisition training, non-anxious children rated the CS + as more fear provoking and arousing than the CS- whereas the ratings of anxious children did not differ.

During extinction training, anxious children displayed larger blink magnitude facilitation during CS + and a trend towards larger <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses,</b> a tendency not seen in nonanxious children.

40|$|An {{effort was}} made to corroborate earlier reports that the central nervous system rostral to a {{functionally}} complete transection of the human spinal cord remains responsive to noxious stimulation of sites below the level of the transection. Nine patients were studied who had sustained a functionally complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord between T 5 and T 11 spinal segments. Noxious electrocutaneous stimulation or intense pressure was applied to a lower extremity while electrodermal activity was recorded concurrently from contralateral palmar sites which were shown to be under normal suprasegmental control. While <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses</b> were occasionally recorded in the post-stimulus intervals, there was no tendency for these responses to exceed the number or amplitude of responses recorded during stimulus-free control periods. These results were interpreted as suggesting that the few responses observed during the post-stimulus intervals were not evoked by stimulation of the lower extremities and were instead representative of spontaneous electrodermal activity or were related to uncontrolled auditory or visual stimuli accompanying lower extremity stimulation. Additional results highlighted the importance of controlling accessory auditory and visual cues occurring in conjunction with lower extremity stimuli. In some patients with a transection above the sympathetic outflow to the lower extremities, it was shown that <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses</b> from the plantar aspect of each foot could be elicited reliably by lower extremity stimuli.

40|$|In {{differential}} fear conditioning, {{the instruction}} that the conditional stimulus (CS) {{will no longer}} be followed by the unconditional stimulus (US; instructed extinction) reduces differential physiological responding (expectancy learning) but leaves differential CS valence evaluations (evaluative learning) intact. This dissociation suggests that expectancy, but not evaluative learning, responds to contingency instructions. Alternatively, as instructed extinction removes the threat of receiving the US, this dissociation could be caused by a drop in participants 2 ̆ 7 arousal levels which could render the physiological indices of fear learning less sensitive. To test this alternative explanation, we examined the impact of an instructed reversal manipulation on electrodermal responding and CS valence evaluations. After instructed reversal, <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses</b> to CS+ decreased and <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses</b> to CS- increased, in the instruction, but not in the control group. In addition, there was some evidence for an instruction dependent change in CS valence, however, this finding seems limited to changes in CS+ valence and possible explanations for this finding are discussed. Overall, the study confirms that the dissociation detected in instructed extinction studies is unlikely to be caused by a drop in the participants 2 ̆ 7 arousal levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Reported and observed symptoms, <b>electrodermal</b> <b>response,</b> heart rate, skin temperature, surface electromyogram, respiratory rate, contrast sensitivity, and the Brown-Peterson cognitive test were used and compared between cases and controls and between test substances (glue, body wash solution, dryer sheet) and control substances (unscented shampoo and clean air). Subjects with chemical sensitivities (cases) took longer to adapt to baseline protocols than did controls. After adaptation, despite small study numbers, cases displayed statistically significant responses (all measures, p < 0. 02) in tonic <b>electrodermal</b> <b>response</b> to test substances compared with controls and compared with the control substance. Symptoms were also higher in cases than in controls for the body wash solution (p = 0. 05) and dryer sheets (p = 0. 02). Test–retest showed good agreement for both symptoms and tonic electrodermal responses (McNemar’s test, p = 0. 32 and p = 0. 33, respectively). Outside of skin conductance, other measures had no consistent patterns between test and control substances and between cases and controls.

Twelve swimmers (nine males, mean age 15. 5 years) conducted a 45 min physically-fatiguing protocol where they swam from 70 % to 100 % of their maximal aerobic speed. We tested motor imagery ability immediately before and after fatigue state. Participants randomly imagined performing a swim turn using internal and external visual imagery.

A differential conditioning paradigm was employed. Hedonically different odors were compared on ease of fear acquisition. Conditioned stimuli (CSs) were Dimethyl Sulfide (unpleasant) and peach (pleasant). The unconditioned stimulus (US) was an electrical shock.

Twenty-four participants were presented with three groups of standardized emotional pictures (unpleasant, neutral and pleasant) from the International Affective Picture System. Facial temperature was recorded at the nose tip, an important region of interest for facial thermal variations, and compared to <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses,</b> a robust index of emotional arousal. Both types of responses were also compared to subjective ratings of pictures. An emotional arousal effect was found on the amplitude and latency of thermal responses and on the amplitude and frequency of <b>electrodermal</b> <b>responses.</b> The participants showed greater thermal and dermal responses to emotional than to neutral pictures with no difference between pleasant and unpleasant ones. Thermal responses correlated and the dermal ones tended to correlate with subjective ratings. Finally, in the emotional conditions compared to the neutral one, the frequency of simultaneous thermal and dermal responses increased while both thermal or dermal isolated responses decreased. Overall, this study brings convergent arguments to consider fITI as a promising method reflecting the arousal dimension of emotional stimulation and, consequently, as a credible alternative to the classical recording of electrodermal activity.
