5|$|The 1955 {{portrait}} {{was popular}} with the public and liked by the Queen but criticised for its romantic treatment and for prioritising Elizabeth's role as the monarch over insights into her <b>inner</b> <b>life.</b> The 1969 portrait continued the theme of emphasising the royal role by placing Elizabeth against a featureless background that symbolised her sole responsibility as monarch. It was un{{popular with the}} public.|$|E
5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his <b>inner</b> <b>life,</b> rather than anything that could be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{describing}} Fuller's movements {{after her}} time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but {{found it difficult to}} realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.|$|E

25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own <b>inner</b> <b>life</b> as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our <b>inner</b> <b>life,</b> we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
25|$|Maeterlinck's plays were tremendously {{popular with}} the avant-garde in the Paris of the 1890s.

Debussy had seen a production of Maeterlinck's first play La princesse Maleine and, in 1891, he applied for permission to set it but Maeterlinck had already promised it to Vincent d'Indy.|$|E

25|$|Though {{at least}} one {{biography}} of Virginia Woolf appeared in her lifetime, the first authoritative study of her life was published in 1972 by her nephew Quentin Bell.

Julia Briggs's Virginia Woolf: An <b>Inner</b> <b>Life</b> (2005) focuses on Woolf's writing, including her novels and her commentary on the creative process, to illuminate her life.|$|E

25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati.
