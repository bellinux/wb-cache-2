25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for the servant to {{be brought into the}} city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

25|$|In 2015–16 season, Palermo {{started their}} season without Dybala after the youngster moved to Juventus; the Rosanero {{therefore}} relied on senior striker Alberto Gilardino {{to play as}} a partner of Vázquez. On 10 November 2015, coach Giuseppe Iachini was sacked due to disappointing results {{in the beginning of}} the season; he was replaced by Davide Ballardini. Ballardini only lasted for 7 matches with Palermo before fired by Zamparini after spectacularly falling out with Palermo's players. Palermo captain Stefano Sorrentino reported that during 1–0 victory against Hellas Verona, the coach did not speak to Palermo players neither before nor after the match. Fabio Viviani became Palermo's caretaker manager in a 0–4 defeat against Genoa. Rosanero hired Guillermo Barros Schelotto as a new manager. Schelotto, however, did not have the necessary paperwork to be registered as Palermo coach, so his position was taken by Primavera youth team coach Giovanni Bosi during a 4–1 win over Udinese. Schelotto was registered as a team manager during that match. Giovanni Tedesco named as Palermo's sixth coach of the season while Schelotto <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for the paperwork. On 10 February 2016, following Schelotto's resignation after UEFA refusal to hand him a valid European coaching authorization, Palermo announced to have promoted Primavera youth coach Giovanni Bosi as new head coach, with Tedesco as his technical collaborator. Five days later, Bosi was sacked, and Iachini was re-appointed as manager. On 10 March, Iachini was sacked once again, as Walter Novellino was appointed as his replacement. Novellino was then sacked on 11 April. Davide Ballardini was rehired a day later for the ninth managerial change that season. On 15 May, Palermo escaped relegation on the last day of the league with the necessary win over Hellas Verona 3–2, securing 16th place.|$|E

Despite these changes, the copyright date on the film remains 2003.

2500|$|On 5 January, as {{countries}} jockeyed to make large donations, Jan Egeland said, [...] "I'd {{rather see}} competitive compassion than no compassion", adding {{that too many}} countries were making pledges without any guarantee that the funds would arrive. Following the earthquake the previous year in Iran in Bam which killed 26,000 people, Iranian officials claimed to have received just US$17.5 million of the US$1 billion originally pledged. In mid-March 2005, the Asian Development Bank reported that the provision of over US$4 billion in aid promised by governments was behind schedule. Sri Lanka criticised the nations and organisations that clamoured to pledge donations, [...] "Not a penny had come through yet. We are doing the relief work with our government money.

He referred to what he saw as the hypocrisy of Obama praising human rights after meeting with Egyptian and Saudi leaders who have suppressed those same rights. He stated that the Muslim world <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for Obama's words to [...] "translate" [...] into real policy. Al Jazeera bureau chief Abderrahim Foukara made similar remarks, saying, [...] "he talked about Palestinians killing Israelis, but he didn't talk a lot about Israelis killing Palestinians, especially {{in the context of the}} latest Israeli war on Gaza." [...] Foukara also said, [...] "he's come to us with his message of peace, but there are U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and there are civilians being killed there by American forces." ...|$|E

60|$|For {{months after}} leaving Fiorsen, {{she had felt}} nothing but relief. Only of late had she begun to see her new {{position}}, as it was--that of a woman married yet not married, whose awakened senses have never been gratified, whose spirit <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> for unfoldment in love, who, however disillusioned, is--even if in secret from herself--more and more surely seeking a real mate, with every hour that ripens her heart and beauty. To-night--gazing at her face, reflected, intent and mournful, in the mirror--she saw that position more clearly, in all its aridity, {{than she had ever}} seen it. What was the use of being pretty? No longer use to anyone! Not yet twenty-six, and in a nunnery! With a shiver, but not of cold, she drew her wrapper close. This time last year she had at least been in the main current of life, not a mere derelict. And yet--better far be like this than go back to him whom memory painted always standing over her sleeping baby, with his arms stretched out and his fingers crooked like claws.|$|E
6000|$|The papers {{had made}} him more of the last than of the first, but not as still appears to him with greater reason. At moments his deliverances seemed to stir people of {{different}} minds to fury in two continents, so far as they were English-speaking, and on the coasts of the seven seas; {{and some of these}} came back at him with such violent personalities as it is his satisfaction to remember that he never indulged in his attacks upon their theories of criticism and fiction. His opinions were always impersonal; and now as their manner rather than their make has been slightly tempered, it may surprise the belated reader to learn that it was the belief of one English critic that their author had [...] "placed himself beyond the pale of decency" [...] by them. It ought to be less surprising that, since these dreadful words were written of him, more than one magnanimous Englishman has penitently expressed to the author the feeling that he was not so far wrong in his overboldly hazarded convictions. The penitence of his countrymen <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> expression, but it may come to that when they have recurred to the evidences of his offence in their present shape.|$|E
