40|$|New Public Management (“NPM”) is {{a reform}} {{movement}} {{with the intent}} of increasing efficiency in the public sector. NPM reforms have had a great impact on organization of the public sectors in the EU Member States during the last 25 years. There has been considerable research done from a political science and economics point of view into the subject. The concept of public services in EU law is closely related to the legal concept of services of general economic interest (“SGEI”) which is mentioned in the treaties. The 2003 Altmark ruling and the 2009 BUPA ruling have shaped the way Member States finance SGEI. This thesis sets out to research the relationship between New Public Management and public services in a Union law context in the form of SGEI. One of the underlying questions is whether NPM ideas have affected the legal concept of SGEI. This thesis reviews the literature on the origins of, ideological background on and policy suggestions of the NPM movement. In turning to the law this thesis focuses on the treatment of public services in EU law, the legal basis of SGEI as well as the pre-Altmark case law regarding the application of Article 106 (2) TFEU. In turning to the financing of SGEI the thesis reviews the Altmark and BUPA cases as well as other relevant and more recent cases. By using the information obtained from a review of literature on NPM this thesis analysis the relationship between NPM and SGEI. The main findings are that marketization reforms undertaken in EU Member States, such as privatization and liberalization, especially in such areas as health care, have opened up previously more “guarded” national competence areas to the scope of Union competition law. This situation has forced the courts to increasingly deal with concepts of non-market values in competition law and a specific area of law is beginning to form. The <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> through liberalization has also lead to a shift in from the use of Article 102 to the use of Article 107 when challenging state supported undertakings. Additionally, some of the criticism aimed at NPM regarding its compatibility with so called public service values, can be noticed in the legal debate, albeit within a legal context. Arguably NPM has had a great impact on shaping the environment in which EU law operates...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} structure, composition, properties, functions and dynamics of economic systems. The research output results from joining advances in the scientific disciplines of systems theory, complex networks, Input-Output analysis and economic activity classification systems. The relevance of this research primarily lies in the insight and overview that arose from bridging these disciplines. The central theme in this research is the complex network of economic sectors in which the transactions between sectors determine the dynamic structure of an economic network. A sector network is an abstract aggregate of sectors. When observed in more detail, the network structure of an economic system becomes visible between sub-sectors and their constituent parts (revealing organisations and individuals at most detailed level). In this thesis, this hierarchy is also referred to as a holarchy. Sectors can be analysed from various perspectives such as activities (functions), products (services and/or goods), organisations (enterprises), occupations (crafts of individuals) and production means (tools). For instance, financing is an activity, a loan is a product, a bank is an organisation and a banker is an occupation. Sector names such as finance sector or banking sector are commonly used which illustrates the difficulties in establishing a set of non-ambiguous sector names and definitions. In daily practice the above mentioned perspectives tend to be mixed up and (overlapping) thematic aggregates are defined as sectors (e. g. creative sector, technology sector), complicating the production of statistical compilations. This mixed perspective approach ignores classification principles such as completeness, summability, exclusiveness and categorising from one perspective, based on the criterion of homogeneity. The perspective of activities or functions emphasised in this thesis, is also expressed in the design of a novel sector model and sector network model. The functional analysis of sector related activities (sourced from the UN economic activity classification system (ISIC) and a set of standards and models specific to the telecom related sector) shows that only 3 % of the inventoried functions of a sector was found unique on average. This finding is in line with propositions from system theory. Prominently included in this thesis are the representation of economic systems as complex networks and the accompanying analysis of German and Dutch Input-Output data. This analysis of the monetary flows in the German and Dutch economic networks shows a full-mesh structure at sector level, thus each sector can directly share produced (unique) value with every other sector. Supported by findings from literature review, a contemporary sector network appears to consist of twenty complementary economic sectors. When descending the hierarchy below the sector level, the link density decreases, thus not all sub-sectors are directly connected. Observations from the analysis of the Input-Output data (1987 - 2007) show an increasing network clustering coefficient and a decreasing value of the interaction ratio of the sector network over time. Furthermore organisation fragmentation is observed from Dutch statistics about the composition of enterprises (2001 - 2012). Possibly these indicators directly relate to the increasing scale of outsour-cing activities and the governmental policy of privatisation and the <b>dismantling</b> <b>of</b> <b>monopolies</b> in order to stimulate competition. This observation and interpretation show that network analysis generates interesting questions and hypotheses, which could enrich economic science. The above mentioned economic phenomena and the recent economic crises, raise the question if the sector network can be safely exposed to market forces. This thesis pleads for a more intensive orchestration of the sector network as a whole and the functioning of our vital sectors in particular.

This paper analyzes the impact of privatization on the performance of SOEs in Benin by comparing theoretical assumptions with empirical investigation.

His acquittal by Ujung Pandang District Court in 1999 sparked protests and claims that Attorney General Andi Ghalib, a former deputy governor of South Sulawesi, had intervened on Nurdin's behalf. Nurdin had previously funded Ghalib's failed bid to become South Sulawesi governor. Gagoek Soebagyanto, the prosecutor who initiated charges against Nurdin and wanted to have him detained pending trial, was dismissed by Ghalib, while another prosecutor {{involved in the case}} was transferred to Irian Jaya (now Papua) province. In March 1999, the new prosecutors handling the case told the court that Nurdin should be freed. They claimed there was a legal basis for the criminal act of misusing SWKP funds as collateral for bank credit without the permission of the owners. Judges were criticized for refusing to allow testimony from a key witness, a bank official. In addition to acquitting Nurdin, the panel of judges also ordered the release of confiscated evidence, including his luxury home and a deposit of Rp 8 billion in the name of Puskud Hasanuddin. Judges said that although the four indictments concerned irregularities in clove purchases, irregularities in the release of clove farmers' funds, irregularities in working capital and irregularities in funding, all payments had been settled.

Most <b>of</b> the material is kept at an intermediate level to serve as a bridge between the intermediate level training and the graduate level focus of the book. However, some sections, identified with a *, are at an advanced level. The Chapter begins with the simple economics <b>of</b> Cournot <b>monopoly,</b> adding the quality dimension, the assessment of the welfare loss <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> in the face of rent seeking behavior, and the dynamics of pricing and inventory when demand is subject to unpredictable fluctuations. Turning to price discrimination, the distinction between first-, second-, and third-degree price discrimination is introduced. The incomplete information theory of second-degree price discrimination is worked out, first for two and then for a continuum of customer types. Next, it is shown how the frequently observed intertemporal price discrimination gives rise to a time consistency problem (“durable goods monopoly”), and how the basic theory of third-degree price discrimination needs to be modified accordingly. The Chapter closes with the noncooperative bargaining theory <b>of</b> bilateral <b>monopoly</b> and suggests a further marriage <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> and bargaining theories.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{efficiency}} losses <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> by analyzing a model where a firm's total costs of production decrease with the manager's effort to control costs. We consider two separate cases {{with regard to}} ownership and control: (1) {{the owner of the}} firm manages the firm himself; and (2) the owner hires a manager to operate the firm. We demonstrate that even in the case where the owner manages the firm, the level of effort exerted by the owner-manager <b>of</b> a <b>monopoly</b> is not first-best. Interestingly, the productive inefficiency <b>of</b> <b>monopoly</b> in this case may be caused by too much rather than too little effort.
