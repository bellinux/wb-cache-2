St. Patrick's was founded in 1873 under the {{sponsorship}} of the Sisters of Providence. It is the only LevelII trauma center in the region, the largest medical facility in Western Montana, and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s. The hospital has 195 acute-care beds, and admitted over 9,700 patients in 2003. The name was changed from [...] "St. Patrick Hospital" [...] to [...] "St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center" [...] in 2000 to reflect an increasing involvement with national medical research and education. The Community Medical Center and its adjacent medical facilities are located near Fort Missoula and {{is part of a}} modern complex that includes a nursing home, the Missoula Crippled Children's Center, and private offices. It was founded in 1922 as Thornton Hospital by doctors Will Thornton and Charles Thornton and has been at its current location since 1972. Although originally a locally owned, not-for profit hospital, it is now owned by a large corporation headquartered in Nashville, TN, and is a <b>for-profit</b> <b>entity.</b> [...] It is the only hospital in Western Montana with a separate Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The center is partnered with Seattle Children's Hospital. The nearest LevelI trauma center to Missoula is Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, Hughes {{launched}} the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Miami, Florida (currently located in Chevy Chase, Maryland) with the expressed goal of basic biomedical research, including trying to understand, in Hughes' words, the [...] "genesis of life itself," [...] {{due to his}} lifelong interest in science and technology. Hughes' first will, which he signed in 1925 {{at the age of}} 19, stipulated that a portion of his estate should be used to create a medical institute bearing his name. When a major battle with the IRS loomed ahead, Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a <b>for-profit</b> <b>entity</b> of a fully tax-exempt charity. Hughes' internist, Verne Mason, who treated Hughes after his 1946 aircraft crash, was chairman of the institute's medical advisory committee. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute's new board of trustees sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2billion, allowing the institute to grow dramatically.|$|E

They are both given limited funds, so will therefore have to aim to meet their goals with the funds provided.|$|R

50|$|A {{charitable}} <b>for-profit</b> <b>entity</b> however {{differs from}} {{this as the}} organisation will aim for a profit whilst still providing similar services as a charity. The <b>for-profit</b> <b>entity</b> may also be directed by a sole proprietor, while a non-profit organization needs a board of directors.

5000|$|Both the {{non-profit}} sector and for-profit sector build affordable housing, although missions, operations and financial and technical abilities differ. The core {{difference between a}} for-profit and a non-profit organization is that <b>for-profit</b> <b>entities</b> operate to produce returns to owners or shareholders, whereas non-profits either reinvest profits into the organization and/or donate money to serve their mission. [...] This inherent difference of organizational objective dictates the operational strategy of their projects; for-profits are likely to create affordable housing that maximizes profits, where non-profits aim to serve the most vulnerable populations. Examples of strategies that <b>for-profit</b> <b>entities</b> use to maximize profits include locating their projects in neighborhoods with strong rental markets, mixing market-rate units into their buildings to increase operating income, and developing an exit strategy to maximize sale proceeds from their building. Conversely, non-profits {{are more likely to}} develop in distressed neighborhoods, dedicate all of their units to low-income tenants and operate projects for the long-term in order to fulfill the mission of affordability.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{spread of}} Benefit Corporations {{formally}} challenges {{the assumption that}} for-profit companies are strictly profit maximizing entities. Businesses can now incorporate under charitable business purposes that were once restricted to 501 (c) (3) non-profit organizations. While incorporating under a charitable purpose is no longer restricted to only non-profit entities, Benefit Corporations {{are not able to}} receive the same income tax exemption under the Internal Revenue Code. While <b>for-profit</b> <b>entities</b> do receive some tax benefits for their charitable behavior, such as the charitable donation deduction, the current tax structure does not provide an equal amount of tax benefits for charitable behavior when performed by a Benefit Corporation as it does for a 501 (c) (3). This Note argues that the Internal Revenue Code’s entity classification for non-profits and forprofits does not accommodate the mixed-purpose structure of the Benefit Corporation. This Note will explore the Internal Revenue Code’s treatment of non-profit 501 (c) (3) s and charitable behavior by <b>for-profit</b> <b>entities</b> and posits that the Internal Revenue Code attempts to treat the charitable behavior of an entity favorably more than it attempts to treat an entity as a whole favorably. Because charitable behavior is not considered a trade or business under the Internal Revenue Code, Benefit Corporations will now be regularly engaging in charitable behavior, the expense of which will not be categorized as either a charitable deduction or as ordinary and necessary business expenses. This Note suggests that a possible way to give Benefit Corporations the same tax treatment for its charitable behavior as non-profits engaging in the same behavior is to create a “Benefit Expense” deduction akin to the ordinary and necessary business expense deduction currently available to <b>for-profit</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R
