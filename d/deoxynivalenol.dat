5000|$|Vomitoxin, {{also known}} as <b>deoxynivalenol</b> (DON), is a type B trichothecene, an epoxy-sesquiterpenoid. This {{mycotoxin}} occurs predominantly in grains such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, and corn, and less often in rice, sorghum, and triticale. The occurrence of <b>deoxynivalenol</b> is associated primarily with Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) and F. culmorum, {{both of which are}} important plant pathogens which cause fusarium head blight in wheat and gibberella or fusarium ear blight in corn. A direct relationship between the incidence of fusarium head blight and contamination of wheat with <b>deoxynivalenol</b> has been established. The incidence of fusarium head blight is strongly associated with moisture at the time of flowering (anthesis), and the timing of rainfall, rather than the amount, is the most critical factor. However, increased amount of moisture towards harvest time has been associated with lower amount of vomitoxin in wheat grain due to leaching of toxins. Furthermore, <b>deoxynivalenol</b> contents are significantly affected by the susceptibility of cultivars towards Fusarium species, previous crop, tillage practices, and fungicide use. [...] It occurs abundantly in grains in Norway due to heavy rainfall.|$|E

50|$|Several Fusarium species produce toxic {{substances}} of considerable concern to livestock and poultry producers, namely <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and zearalenone.

50|$|When {{it comes}} to animal and human food, type A trichothecenes (e.g. T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol) are of special {{interest}} {{because they are more}} toxic than the other foodborne trichothecenes i.e. type B group (e.g. <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> nivalenol, 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol). However, <b>deoxynivalenol</b> is of concern as it is the most prevalent trichothecene in Europe. The major effects of trichothecenes - related to their concentration in the commodity - are reduced feed uptake, vomiting and immuno-suppression.A relatively few countries, primarily in the European Union, have recommended maximum limits for these mycotoxins in food and animal feed. However, trichothecenes are often tested for elsewhere, in order to prevent them from entering the food chain and to prevent losses in animal production.|$|E

50|$|Gibberella zeae, {{also known}} {{by the name of}} its anamorph Fusarium graminearum, is a plant {{pathogen}} which causes fusarium head blight, a devastating disease on wheat and barley. The pathogen is responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year. Infection causes shifts in the amino acid composition of wheat, resulting in shriveled kernels and contaminating the remaining grain with mycotoxins, mainly <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> which inhibits protein biosynthesis; and zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin. These toxins cause vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects in livestock, and are harmful to humans through contaminated food. Despite great efforts to find resistance genes against F. graminearum, no completely resistant variety is currently available. Research on the biology of F. graminearum is directed towards gaining insight into more details about the infection process and reveal weak spots in the life cycle of this pathogen to develop fungicides that can protect wheat from scab infection.|$|E
50|$|Outbreaks {{of barley}} scab (also known as {{fusarium}} head blight) usually occur {{when there are}} high moisture conditions during the flowering stages of barley development. The infected crops become bleached in color, shrunken, and discolored and will grow pink spore masses on the barley heads. The disease {{has the potential to}} destroy a crop within weeks. The shrunken kernels can become so light that the wind can blow them away {{from the rest of the}} crop. In addition, barley scab produces toxins that severely reduce the value of the harvested barley. This toxin, <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> also known as vomitoxin because of its tendency to induce vomiting at high levels, will pass through the brewing process into the beer. When the beer is opened the toxin will cause the liquid to overflow from the bottle or can. Because this is not commercially desirable, barley producers receive severe price discounts when vomitoxin is present.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the vast}} {{infection}} throughout the host, the plant's growth is stunted and will show incomplete grain fill. As well as infecting the xylem and pith of the host, F. pseudograminearum produces mycotoxins once it has fully been established. Mycotoxins are toxins produced by fungi that are harmful to animals and human if consumed. F. pseudograminearum produces the trichothecene mycotoxin <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> or DON, which spreads throughout the plant stem and builds up in the tissue. The production of DON can produce the formation of whiteheads, which are heads of grain that died prematurely. It is known that F. pseudograminearum does not infect {{the heads of the}} wheat, but the formation of the [...] "whiteheads" [...] is a secondary symptom of the buildup of the mycotoxin DON. The transport dysfunction occurring in the xylem and the buildup of DON will ultimately lead to death of the infected wheat plants.|$|E

The most compelling evidence is the presence of T-2 and DAS in the yellow powder. Both toxins are infrequently found in nature and rarely occur together.

40|$|Introduction: Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB), {{is the most}} {{destructive}} disease of wheat, producing the mycotoxin <b>deoxynivalenol,</b> a protein synthesis inhibitor, which is harmful to humans and livestock. dsRNAmycoviruses-infected-isolates of Fusariumgraminearum, showed changes in morphological and pathogenicity phenotypes including reduced virulence towards wheat and decreased production of trichothecene mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol: DON). Materials and methods: Previous studies indicated that over expression of yeast acetyl transferase gene (ScAYT 1) encoding a 3 -O trichothecene acetyl transferase that converts <b>deoxynivalenol</b> to a less toxic acetylated form, leads to suppression of the <b>deoxynivalenol</b> sensitivity in pdr 5 yeast mutants. To identify whether ScAYT 1 over-expression in transgenic tobacco plants can deal with mycotoxin (<b>deoxynivalenol)</b> in fungal extract and studying the effect of dsRNA contamination on detoxification and resistance level, we have treated T 1 AYT 1 transgenic tobacco seedlings with complete extraction of normal F. graminearum isolate carrying dsRNA metabolites.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the performance of two predictive models for <b>deoxynivalenol</b> contamination of wheat at harvest in the Netherlands, including the use of weather forecast data and external model validation. Data were collected in a different year and from different wheat fields than data used for model development. The two models were run for six preset scenarios, varying in the period for which weather forecast data were used, from zero-day (historical data only) to a 13 -day period around wheat flowering. Model predictions using forecast weather data were compared to those using historical data. Furthermore, model predictions using historical weather data were evaluated against observed <b>deoxynivalenol</b> contamination of the wheat fields. Results showed that the use of weather forecast data rather than observed data only slightly influenced model predictions. The percent of correct model predictions, given a threshold of 1, 250 µg/kg (legal limit in European Union), was about 95 % for the two models. However, only three samples had a <b>deoxynivalenol</b> concentration above this threshold, and the models were not able to predict these samples correctly. It was concluded that two- week weather forecast data can reliable be used in descriptive models for <b>deoxynivalenol</b> contamination of wheat, resulting in more timely model predictions.
