METHODS. We randomized 186 subjects to receive either AIDS education alone (the control group) or AIDS education, an HIV antibody test, and the test results (the intervention group). These subjects were then followed up 8 weeks later. RESULTS. At follow-up, mean {{number of sexual partners}} decreased, but not differently between groups. However, compared with controls, HIV antibody test intervention subjects, all of whom tested negative, questioned their most recent sexual partner more about HIV antibody status (P less than 0. 01), worried more about getting AIDS (P less than 0. 03), and tended to use a condom more often with their last sexual partner (P = 0. 05) : 40 % of intervention subjects vs 20 % of controls used condoms, avoided <b>genital</b> <b>intercourse,</b> or knew their last partner had a negative HIV antibody test (P less than 0. 005).

These data were used for a psychometric analysis of the SAI. In terms of reliability, internal consistency estimates were in the. 92 -. 96 range, and 4 -month test-retest reliabili-ties ranged from. 74 to. 90. An evaluation of validity revealed both strengths and limitations of the SAI.

It provides the analyses of the previous researches covering the topics “foul language”, “obscene language” and “swearing”. Swearing is a language taboo that conveys the negative energy a speaker wants to get rid of by the means of shifting it on the recipient. It is not always the recipient who is the addressee of the swearing, since language taboo includes the usage of an address-free swearing, the latter one belonging to the parenthetic words which are language incrustations and which do not carry semantic meaning. But in the language there are also other obscene words with the semantically-lowered connotation. The article reveals the differences in the usage of swear language by different nations, it also provides the comparison of the Ukrainian, Russian and German swearing. It is pointed out that Russian obscene language is more connected to the rude names of <b>genitals,</b> sexual <b>intercourse</b> and sexual deviations, but it is less connected to the physiological ejections. The article studies the influence of the Russian culture on other nations’ cultures, including the Ukrainian one. In the Ukrainian and German languages, contrary to the Russian language, obscene words are mainly connected to the physiological ejections (scatological humour).

This descriptive study conducted in Yiling District, Yichang, China, surveyed male knowledge of sexual physiology and RH to assess levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). A total of 3933 men, aged 18 - 59 years (mean, 40. 3 years), were recruited by cluster random sampling. They completed a questionnaire {{in the presence of}} an interviewer, with items related to subject characteristics, RH knowledge, and subjective symptoms of the reproductive system. Physical examination and reproductive system disease diagnosis were performed. Participants' occupations were predominantly skilled labor (80. 5 %). Nearly four-fifths (78. 5 %) respondents had at least one reproductive disease. Over half of respondents were aware of and declared a positive attitude about sexual physiology and safe sex, and 70 % of them selected to visit a doctor when they had a reproductive disorder. However, only 41. 9 % believed human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome could be transmitted through breastfeeding, and 64. 6 % incorrectly thought they could avoid contracting STDs by cleaning their <b>genitals</b> after <b>intercourse.</b> In addition, 45 % discriminated against and were unwilling to be friends with infected persons. Nearly 45 % of those with a reproductive system disorder refused to discuss it with friends or family members.

Would this relationship be found in China? METHOD: Three levels of CSA (non-genital, <b>genital,</b> and <b>intercourse)</b> were assessed by self-report in two groups of Han Chinese women: 1970 clinically ascertained with recurrent MD and 2597 matched controls. Diagnostic and other risk factor information was assessed at personal interview. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression and regression coefficients by linear or Poisson regression. RESULTS: Any form of CSA was significantly associated with recurrent MD [OR 3. 26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 95 - 5. 45]. This association strengthened with increasing CSA severity: non-genital (OR 2. 47, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 5. 23), genital (OR 2. 77, 95 % CI 1. 32 - 5. 83) and intercourse (OR 13. 35, 95 % CI 1. 83 - 97. 42). The association between any form of CSA and MD remained significant after accounting for parental history of depression, childhood emotional neglect (CEN), childhood physical abuse (CPA) and parent-child relationship. Among the depressed women, those with CSA had an earlier age of onset, longer depressive episodes and an increased risk for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; OR 1. 92, 95 % CI 1. 39 - 2. 66) and dysthymia (OR 2. 16, 95 % CI 1. 52 - 3. 09). CONCLUSIONS: In Chinese women CSA is strongly associated with MD and this association increases with greater severity of CSA.

40|$|Abstract Despite {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of genital pain in healthy young adult women, limited research has addressed <b>genital</b> pain during <b>intercourse</b> using contemporary models of multidimensional sexual function. The objectives {{of this study}} were threefold: (1) to identify differences in sexual functioning in women who experience genital pain compared to pain free women; (2) to identify predictors of sexual functioning in women with and without genital pain; and (3) to identify predictors of sexual satisfaction in women with and without genital pain. Sexually active female undergraduates (n = 651) were administered the Female Sexual Function Index and the Derogatis Sexual Functioning Inventory. We evaluated the sexual factors that impact the sexual function of women with any pain (including high and low pain groups) versus women with no history of pain. Women with genital pain reported greater rates of sexual dysfunction as compared to painfree women; however, sexual functioning in the high versus low pain groups was distinguished primarily by vaginal lubrication. Women in the high pain group showed negative correlations between domains of sexual satisfaction and genital pain frequency and intensity that were not found in the low pain group. For pain-free women, intercourse played a strong role in sexual satisfaction, whereas non-intercourse sexual behavior was central to sexual satisfaction in women who reported pain. The evaluation of levels of genital pain may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the impairment of sexual function, sexual behavior, and sexual satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{lifetime}} {{prevalence of}} women suffering from provoked vestibulodynia (PVD) {{is estimated to}} be approximately 15 %. The etiology of PVD is not yet clear. Recent studies approach PVD as a chronic multifactorial sexual pain disorder. PVD is associated with pain syndromes, genital infections, and mental disorders, which are common diseases in family practice. PVD, however, is not included in the International Classification of Primary Care. Hence, the vulvovaginal symptoms, which could be suggestive of PVD, are likely to be missed. Aim: To explore the relationship between specific vulvovaginal symptoms that could be suggestive of PVD (<b>genital</b> pain, painful <b>intercourse,</b> other symptoms/complaints related to the vagina/vulva), and related diseases such as pain syndromes, psychological symptom diagnoses, and genital infections in family practice. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all episodes from 1995 to 2008 in 784 women between 15 and 49 years were used to determine the posterior probability of a selected diagnosis in the presence of specific vulvovaginal symptoms suggestive of PVD expressed in an odds ratio. Selected comorbidities were pain syndromes (muscle pain, general weakness, irritable bowel syndrome [IBS]), psychological symptom diagnoses (anxiety, depression, insomnia), vulvovaginal candidiasis, and sexual and physical abuse. Results: Women with symptoms suggestive of PVD were 4 to 7 {{times more likely to be}} diagnosed with vulvovaginal candidiasis and 2 to 4 times more likely to be diagnosed with IBS. Some symptoms suggestive of PVD were 1 to 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with complaints of muscle pain, general weakness, insomnia, depressive disorder, and feeling anxious. Conclusion: Data from daily family practice showed a clear relationship between symptoms suggestive of PVD and the diagnoses of vulvovaginal candidiasis and IBS in premenopausal women. Possibly, family doctors make a diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis or IBS based only on clinical manifestations in many women in whom a diagnosis of PVD would be more appropriate.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{childhood sexual abuse}} (CSA) is high among Western {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM), and CSA is associated with certain socio-demographic variables and with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. Little is known about CSA among Chinese MSM; therefore, we explored the prevalence and frequency of non-contact (e. g., sexual invitations, exhibitionism) and contact (e. g., <b>intercourse,</b> <b>genital</b> contact) forms of CSA in an Internet-based sample of MSM in China. We also examined the associations between the participants' socio-demographic characteristics and HIV status, and their histories of CSA. We surveyed MSM from 30 Chinese provinces in 2014 - 2015; 1, 030 (mean age = 25. 15 years, SD = 6. 32) and 1, 020 (mean age = 25. 05 years, SD = 5. 95) respondents were eligible for inclusion in the non-contact and contact CSA groups, respectively. Prevalence of non-contact and contact CSA was 36. 2 % and 29. 8 %, respectively; 20. 4 % and 15. 0 % had experienced non-contact and contact CSA ≥ 3 times, respectively. Most respondents were young adults, well educated, single, had never "come out," and self-identified as gay or bisexual men. Univariate analyses showed that respondents who had experienced contact CSA were more likely to be HIV-positive than those who had never experienced contact CSA. Multivariate analyses showed that non-contact CSA was associated with less education, being in a relationship with a woman or a man, and having "come out. " Contact CSA was associated with less education, higher income, and being in a relationship with a man. Respondents who had experienced non-contact CSA ≥ 3 times were more likely to be less educated, "out," and to be in a relationship with a woman or a man. Respondents who had experienced contact CSA ≥ 3 times were more likely to be less educated and to be in a relationship with a man.

Rothman stated in a 1973 interview that:I'm very tired of the whole tradition in western art in which women are always presented nude and men aren't. I'm not going to dress women and undress men - {{that would be a}} form of tortured vengeance. But I certainly am going to undress men, and the result is probably a more healthy environment, because one group of people presenting another in a vulnerable, weaker, more servile position is always distorted.Film director and historian Fred Olen Ray later claimed that the best movies made by Dimension were the in-house productions from Rothman and Swartz. Rothman:I didn't always get to choose the subjects of the film, but I did have control over the attitude toward and the treatment of the subjects. In this respect, I didn't feel compromised or constrained. Of course there were certain audience expectations that had to be satisfied, in particular for nudity and violence. Since I was making exploitation films with unknown casts, I had to show more nudity than they could ordinarily see in major studio films, but less than in the soft porn that was then in release. Furthermore, I had to show up to the limit of what was allowed in an R-rated film (i.e., no pubic hair, no <b>genitals,</b> no simulated <b>intercourse),</b> which looks quite tame by today's standards, but wasn't at the time. Because of these scenes I also had to cast very attractive people, which meant that sometimes I couldn't cast the best actors, which I considered a very serious constraint then, and which continues to disturb me even now 2010.Rothman says she was influenced by the work of Jean Cocteau and Georges Franju.|$|R
