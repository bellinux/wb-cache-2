2500|$|The [...] Cosworth-tuned {{engine is}} heavily {{modified}} from the stock 2.3 litre Duratec. The cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>block,</b> crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons are upgraded by Cosworth. Cosworth also integrates an advanced dry-sump {{with an extra}} internal scavenge pump to distribute the oil. While a dry-sump system requires more oil (more weight), a dry-sump will keep the engine lubricated under hard cornering unlike a wet-sump system. Cosworth also radicalizes the cam shafts and upgrades the exhaust system. This may cause the engine to run a little more [...] "rough" [...] at low RPMs, but it drastically increases performance. The inlet system is also replaced with an advanced, custom roller-barrel system. This increases airflow at full throttle compared to a butterfly inlet, boosting performance. The engine also has a custom chip designed by Cosworth for a further increase in performance.|$|E
50|$|In a {{counterweight}} rigging {{system the}} <b>head</b> <b>block</b> sheave is grooved {{for both the}} steel cable lift lines and an operating line, with the groove for the operating line provided at {{the middle of the}} multi-grooved sheave, between the lift lines. Counterweight head blocks mount atop or at the underside of the <b>head</b> <b>block</b> beam, depending on the beam's vertical position.|$|E
50|$|In a {{conventional}} counterweight system the operating and lift lines terminate {{at the top}} of the arbor after passing over the <b>head</b> <b>block.</b> In a double-purchase system, however, after passing over the <b>head</b> <b>block</b> the operating and lift lines pass through another block, which is mounted to the top of the arbor, before rising back up and terminating below the <b>head</b> <b>block.</b> In addition, the opposite end of a double-purchase operating line terminates at the fly gallery, off-stage wall, or stage deck, instead of the underside of the arbor, after passing through a block mounted at the underside of the arbor. The additional blocks result in the arbor moving at half the rate of the lift and operating lines.|$|E
50|$|In under-hung {{counterweight}} {{systems that}} use upright <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> {{the series of}} loft blocks immediately following the <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> are typically multi-line loft blocks instead of single-line to account for built-in vertical misalignment between <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> and loft blocks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>blocks</b> are {{overhead}} multi-line blocks {{used for}} the lift lines and operating lines. <b>Head</b> <b>blocks</b> support and redirect all the lift lines from loft blocks to sand bags (of a hemp set), counterweight arbor (of a counterweight set) or hoist (of an automated line set).|$|R

When running horizontally, between loft blocks and <b>head</b> <b>block,</b> lift lines typically follow a transverse path (from side to side) across the stage.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: All trauma {{patients}} with a cervical spinal column injury or with a mechanism of injury {{with the potential to}} cause cervical spinal injury should be immobilised until a spinal injury is excluded. Immobilisation of the entire patient with a rigid cervical collar, backboard, <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> with tape or straps is recommended by the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. However there is insufficient evidence to support these guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects on the range of motion of the addition of a rigid collar to <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> strapped on a backboard. METHOD: The active range of motion of the cervical spine was determined by computerised digital dual inclinometry, in 10 healthy volunteers with a rigid collar, <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> strapped on a padded spine board and a combination of both. Maximal opening of the mouth with all types of immobiliser in place was also measured. RESULTS: The addition of a rigid collar to <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> strapped on a spine board did not result in extra immobilisation of the cervical spine. Opening of the mouth was significantly reduced in {{patients with}} a rigid collar. CONCLUSION: Based on this proof of principle study and other previous evidence of adverse effects of rigid collars, the addition of a rigid collar to <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> is considered unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Therefore the use of this combination of cervical spine immobilisers must be reconsidered...|$|R

50|$|A dead-haul drum hoist {{uses the}} single drum to support all the lift lines {{running from the}} <b>head</b> <b>block</b> of a line set. The lift lines neatly wrap and unwrap in a {{side-by-side}} arrangement on the drum as it is spun by the motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{diameter}} of a <b>head</b> <b>block</b> sheave used for galvanized aircraft cable is typically at least 48 times the {{diameter of}} the cable. For example, 12 in head blocks are typically used with 0.25 in GAC, but 16 in blocks may be used to facilitate flying heavier line sets (e.g., electrics).|$|E
50|$|As a lift line coils and uncoils {{from the}} drum of a drum hoist, its fleet angle (angle {{of a line}} between drum and sheave) changes. Excessive fleet angles (e.g., greater than 1.5-2.0°) cause {{unpredictable}} line behavior and can damage lines, blocks, and drums. As a result, fleet angles limit how close a dead-haul drum hoist can be mounted to the <b>head</b> <b>block</b> (usually about 10 feet).|$|E

40|$|The use of {{cervical}} collar, <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> {{and tape}} on a stable surface (such {{as a long}} spine board or hospital trolley) has long been accepted as the standard of care for patients with potentially unstable spinal injury. There is, however, scant evidence that supports their use, and there are significant potential risks associated with their use, including aspiration of vomit, difficult airway access, pressure sores and rise in intracranial pressure. 1 The majority of studies relating to the clinical effectiveness of rigid collars and <b>head</b> <b>blocks</b> {{as a means of}} immobilisation have utilised healthy volunteers, and measure gross movement of head in relation to the shoulders.

50|$|The {{top of the}} arbor is {{permanently}} {{suspended by}} several wire rope lift lines, made of galvanized steel aircraft cable (GAC). The lift lines run {{from the top of}} the arbor up to the top of the fly tower, around the <b>head</b> <b>block,</b> across the stage to evenly spaced loft blocks, then down, terminating at the batten, a load-bearing pipe that spans much of the width of the stage.|$|E
50|$|Fifth wheels were {{originally}} {{not a complete}} circle and were hand forged. When mass production of buggy parts {{began in the early}} 19th century, fifth wheels were among the first products to be made. There were a number of patents awarded for fifth-wheel design. Edward and Charles Everett, Quincy, Illinois patented a type of fifth wheel in 1850, followed by Gutches' metallic <b>head</b> <b>block</b> and fifth wheel in 1870 and Wilcox fifth wheel in 1905.|$|E
50|$|Building codes {{generally}} {{require that}} fly system beam design meets the L/360 rule: beams shall not deflect {{by more than}} {{the length of a}} span divided by 360. For example, a 30 ft <b>head</b> <b>block</b> beam should not deflect more than 1 in under the system design's maximum loading condition. Beam design using the L/360 rule typically results in beams with a yield-strength significantly higher than the maximum loading condition, effectively providing a factor of safety.|$|E

50|$|A Loft {{block is}} an {{overhead}} block that supports a single lift line. A loft block supports and redirects a lift {{line from the}} batten to the <b>head</b> <b>block</b> of a line set. Under-hung loft blocks typically mount to loft block beams (fly loft roof beams). Upright loft blocks typically mount to loft block wells (grid-level structural channels). A spot block is a readily movable loft block for mounting anywhere on the grid deck for spot rigging.|$|E
50|$|A moving drum hoist, or {{traveling}} drum hoist, is {{a variation}} on the traditional drum hoist. Moving drum hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between drum and block by shifting the drum along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per drum revolution is equal to the pitch of the drum's helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving drum hoists can combine drum and <b>head</b> <b>block</b> into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|E
50|$|Valves {{are most}} {{commonly}} actuated overhead, in a OHV configuration. An {{example of one}} of the best known and most popular designs is the Honda GX range, dating from the early 1980s. The sidevalve arrangement still persists, owing to its simplicity for both manufacture and basic maintenance. A few engines, such as the Honda GC series, now use overhead cam valvegear, driven by a timing belt. This engine also uses an unusual monobloc design where the cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>block,</b> and half the crankcase share the same casting, termed 'uniblock' by Honda.|$|E

50|$|In 1985, {{the engine}} was {{significantly}} reworked, output was up to 114 hp (84 kW) at 4,800 rpm and 140 lb·ft (190 N·m) at 3,600 rpm. Many parts from the newer 22R-E are not compatible with those from the older pre-1985 engine. Non-compatible parts include the cylinder <b>head,</b> <b>block,</b> pistons {{and many of the}} associated parts such as the timing chain and cover, and water and oil pumps (although the oil pump internals are the same).These changes also affected the 22R, therefore one can consider the 85-95 22R-E as a fuel injected version of the 85-90 22R with only minor differences, if any.|$|E
50|$|Manual hoists, or hand winches, are {{typically}} {{composed of a}} drum, gear box, and crank (operating handle). A worm gear is commonly used to provide mechanical advantage as the crank is turned, which coils a single line around a smooth or helically-grooved drum. The drum line {{is connected to the}} lift lines with a clew, triangular plate with holes used for line terminations. From the clew, the lift lines run over a <b>head</b> <b>block</b> and loft blocks down to a batten. The clew may be wire-guided to limit lateral play. Drill-operable hand winches permit the handle to be removed so that an electric drill may operate the hoist.|$|E

At this point, embalmers commonly perform basic tests for signs of death, noting things such as clouded-over corneas, lividity, and rigor mortis, or by simply attempting to palpate a pulse in the carotid or radial artery. In modern times, people awakening on the preparation table is largely the province of horror fiction and urban legend.|$|E
