5|$|Tintin and I (2003), a {{documentary}} by Danish director Anders Høgsbro Østergaard based on Numa Sadoul's 1971 interview with Hergé, includes restored {{portions of the}} interview that Hergé had heavily edited and rewritten in Sadoul's book. With full access to the audio recordings, the filmmaker explored the personal <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> author had while he was creating Tintin in Tibet and how they drove him to create what is now regarded as his most personal adventure.|$|E
5|$|Among the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mint Bureau {{had to face}} in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at {{branches of}} the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E

50|$|Upstream dam {{operations}} {{also cause}} {{changes in the}} water level, which is another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is trying to take action towards. <b>The</b> biggest <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mussel currently faces {{right now is that}} there is only one known reproducing population. This means that a severe rainstorm that caused flooding, a pollution spill, or the outbreak of an upstream dam could easily wipe out the entire population and cause this mussel species to become extinct.|$|R

In Justman and Herb Solow's 1996 book Inside Star Trek, they stated that following a discussion between Roddenberry, Solow and Bernie Weitzman in which they discussed her contract, they decided to terminate it because of Whitney's limited appearances and the financial <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series was having. The decision was attributed elsewhere in David Alexander's 1995 authorized biography of Gene Roddenberry, Star Trek Creator, which said that during the first batch of episodes, casting director Joseph D'Agosta reviewed the contracts for the main actors due to rising costs.|$|E
5|$|When the {{national}} service scheme was ended following {{the election of}} the Whitlam Government in late 1972, the 3rd Division lost a large number of personnel. At this time, the division's artillery assets included two artillery field regiments, a medium regiment, and a divisional locating battery, and although on paper the division was a large, combined arms formation, in reality many of its units were hollow and inadequately equipped, and in the decades following this the division, and indeed the CMF in general, underwent a period of uncertainty as the government attempted to solve the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> organisation faced, the most pressing of which was the question of its role and strategic relevance, as well as those concerning conditions of service, centralisation of training and access to equipment.|$|E

25|$|The storyline {{was widely}} applauded {{for the way}} it handled the plot and the {{following}} <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scriptwriters explored, from antiretroviral drugs, safe sex and prejudice.

The Court did not explain whether or in what circumstances these other formats would be legally effective.|$|E
25|$|Ivory Coast is {{a country}} of western sub-Saharan Africa.

25|$|Public opinion. A 2008 {{survey of}} Kenyan public opinion {{reported}} that water supply {{is not considered}} as {{a high priority for}} government action. Only about 5% of respondents said that water supply was among the ten most important <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government should address, even though 60% think that the government is handling the issue badly. The survey also monitored instances of corruption in the sub-sector: 15% of urban and 11% of rural respondents reported that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift or do a favour to government officials to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E

25|$|The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an {{intergovernmental}} organization that regulates international trade. The WTO officially commenced on 1 January 1995 under the Marrakesh Agreement, signed by 123 nations on 15 April 1994, replacing the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which commenced in 1948. It {{is the largest}} international economic organization in the world. The WTO deals with regulation of trade in goods, services and intellectual property between participating countries by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and a dispute resolution process aimed at enforcing participants' adherence to WTO agreements, which are signed by representatives of member governments and ratified by their parliaments. Most of the <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> WTO focuses on derive from previous trade negotiations, especially from the Uruguay Round (1986–1994).|$|E
25|$|The Afrobarometer Survey 2008 {{collected}} {{information about}} Tanzanians' {{opinions about the}} water sector. The disparity in access to safe and clean water between rural and urban areas {{is illustrated by the}} responses: 51% of urban residents were satisfied with government efforts to deliver water and sanitation services, compared to 39% in rural areas. Accordingly, the water sector is considered as a higher priority for government action by rural Tanzanians. 44% of respondents in rural areas cited water supply as one of the three most pressing <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government should address (for 16% it {{is the single most important}} problem). In urban areas water supply came third behind economic and health concerns in 25% of responses. Issues of corruption in the water sector were also examined by the Survey: 4% of respondents admitted that they had to pay a bribe, give a gift, or do a favor to government officials in order to get water or sanitation services in the past year.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, AMD {{released}} a new processor line dubbed Phenom II, a refresh {{of the original}} Phenom built using the 45nm process. AMD's new platform, codenamed “Dragon”, utilized the new Phenom II processor, and an ATI R770 GPU from the R700 GPU family, {{as well as a}} 790 GX/FX chipset from the AMD 700 chipset series. The Phenom II came in dual-core, triple-core and quad-core variants, all using the same die, with cores disabled for the triple-core and dual-core versions. The Phenom II resolved <b>issues</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original Phenom had, including a low clock speed, a small L3 cache and a Cool'n'Quiet bug that decreased performance. The Phenom II cost less but was not performance-competitive with Intel's mid-to-high-range Core 2 Quads. The Phenom II also enhanced its predecessor's memory controller, allowing it to use DDR3 in a new native socket AM3, while maintaining backwards compatibility with AM2+, the socket used for the Phenom, and allowing the use of the DDR2 memory that was used with the platform.|$|E
