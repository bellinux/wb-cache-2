2500|$|A {{new model}} was developed, more compact and lighter, with armour for {{the engine and}} the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment.</b> [...] It was {{composed}} of six metal plates rotating around the core chassis, and had some level of steering control, allowing for a turning radius of 100 meters. Speed however was extremely low, at 1km/h. The new model was tried by the Artillery Arm on 17 August 1916 at Souain-Perthes-lès-Hurlus, until complete abandonment of the project.|$|E
50|$|The second {{occurred}} on 15 November 2003. Sprinters 7003, 7004 & 7005 {{were on the}} 15:49 service to Ballaratwhen 7003 being the lead unit struck a vehicle stuck on the tracks between Ballan and Gordon. Over 60 people were injured with 7003 rolling on to its side and finishing in a ditch while 7004 & 7005 derailed. 7003 sustained significant damage to its <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> and side, 7005 to its <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> after striking 7003 as it jackknifed and 7004 sustained only minor damage. The Ballarat line was closed for three days for the clean up.|$|E
50|$|The Wright StreetCar is an {{articulated}} bus developed by Wrightbus and Volvo Buses for FirstGroup. It {{consists of an}} adapted Volvo B7LA chassis, featuring a separate <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> at the front, resembling to some extent similar designs in continental Europe.|$|E

50|$|The {{driver of}} the 7:40, Isaac McQuillan, was charged with {{manslaughter}} in April 1945 {{for the death of}} a passenger: Samuel Wilson. During the hearing, two passengers testified that they were in the <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b> One of the witnesses said there were six passengers in the <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|R
50|$|Carriages {{converted}} {{kept their}} existing codes, but with D, M or T appended indicating <b>Driver's</b> <b>compartment,</b> Motor car (with <b>drivers</b> <b>compartment)</b> or Trailer. However, in 1921 {{the system was}} regarded as too complex, and coding was simplified with all motored and driving carriages becoming second class, and all trailers becoming first class.|$|R
5000|$|A long {{wheelbase}} 4-door Pullman limousine (with two additional rear-facing seats {{separated from the}} <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> by a power divider window, of which 304 were built), and a 6-door limousine (with two forward-facing jump-seats at the middle two doors and a rear bench-seat).|$|E
5000|$|The 2013 {{regulations}} {{had some}} major changes. All vehicles {{had to be}} designed with four wheels, and the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> had to comply with new demands on safety. All teams had to rethink the design of their cars, Nuna7 was built as an asymmetric vehicle ...|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} moved to the centre of the vehicle to make room for an open-topped lightly {{armoured}} fighting compartment at the Rear housing the gun and crew. Late models had a slightly redesigned <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> and front superstructure offering more room to the radio operator and driver.|$|E

5000|$|The Mack MC/MR series, {{also known}} as the [...] "Cruise-Hauler", is a cabover truck first {{introduced}} in 1978. It is of a distinct [...] "set back front axle" [...] design (first seen on the Mack FM), with the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> mounted ahead of the front axle and with a large, flat, divided windscreen covering almost half of the truck's frontal aspect. The chassis were very common for fire apparatus.|$|E

50|$|The {{hull of the}} FCM 1A {{was very}} elongated, in order to cross wide trenches. It {{was more or less}} compartmentalised into four sections, that however were not {{separated}} by bulkheads: a relatively short <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> at the front, a fighting compartment with a turret at its top, a larger munitions room and finally a large engine compartment at the rear. The last was enlarged at both sides over the tracks, to create room for long rectangular fuel tanks. The front of the hull followed the profile of the tall climbing faces of the tracks and therefore gradually curved upwards, ending in a high, vertical, nose plate. The glacis plate behind it was oriented almost horizontally and connected at its rear to the vertical top front plate of the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment.</b> As the turret ring was larger than the width of the hull, it partly rested on rounded lateral extensions. The turret was a truncated cone with a roof sloping down to the front, so that in side view its profile was wedge-shaped.|$|E

50|$|In July 2017, {{asbestos}} {{was found}} in the circuit breaker panels, which is inside the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment,</b> of the C and K sets. This caused all C and K sets to be taken out of service for inspection. As a result, S sets were used to replace C/K sets on services that were scheduled as C/K. As of 21 July 2017, some C/K sets are returning to service, but many are still being replaced by S sets.|$|E

50|$|The <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> and the {{fighting}} compartments were not separated. As {{well as the}} turret armament, which consisted of an Ordnance QF 2 pounder gun and a coaxial Vickers machine gun, there were two small turrets {{either side of the}} <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment,</b> each with a Vickers machine-gun. Both of these smaller turrets were permanently manned, which gave the tank a total crew of 6 (Commander, gunner, loader, driver and two machine-gunners).|$|R
50|$|The <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> was {{separated}} from the rear load space by a single sheet bulkhead, and additional roof-fixed netting.|$|R
50|$|Some mass {{casualty}} buses are specially {{adapted to}} for CBRN incidents {{and can be}} used for quarantine or isolation of contaminated patients. These vehicles may have additional features such as a sealed bulkhead to separate the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> from the patient compartment. The equivalent functionality of the ambulance buses may also be built into other vehicles such as lorries, trains or other large mass transit vehicles. These mass evacuation buses are well suited to being used for quarantine and containment.|$|E
5000|$|... 1991: TC/2000 Rear Engine {{introduced}} to attract West Coast customers. As a running change, front bodywork TC/2000 Front Engine is redesigned with a flip-up access panel. This allows for better access and serviceability for drivers and mechanics; {{it requires the}} headlight bar and front bumper to be moved forward several inches. On front-engine models, the grille is redesigned for better cooling; 4 chrome bars replace the 4 slots (rear-engine versions use a blank version of the 1988-1990 bodywork). Inside, a redesigned engine cover takes up less space in the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When {{redesigning}} {{the interior}} of the E-Series for 1992, Ford chose to modernize the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> of the vehicle. Sharing its controls and components with the Ford F-Series and Aerostar, the E-Series/Club Wagon was notable for being the first full-size van equipped with a driver's side airbag as standard equipment (on all models except the Econoline 350). While the front engine cover still dominated the space between the front seats, part of the redesign freed up additional passenger room. The instrument panel featured a small LCD digital odometer.|$|E

50|$|Each power car {{was fitted}} with a <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> to enable the train to be {{controlled}} from either end. The driving controls were electric; brake controls were electro-pneumatic and enabled coupled multiple units {{to be controlled by}} one driver. A safety device {{in the form of a}} dead man's foot pedal was also fitted in the driver's cabin. A guard's compartment was located adjacent to the <b>driver's</b> <b>compartment</b> in the end of the power cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{centrally}} positioned {{engine compartment}} is {{separated by a}} bulkhead from the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> in front of it. The external silencer {{is on the left}} of the vehicle under an armoured covering. All vehicles in the series were powered by a Delahaye Type 135 6-cylinder 3.556 litre engine developing [...] at 2800 rpm, giving a maximum speed of 35 km/h and an average speed of about 20 km/h. The wading capacity is 60 centimetres, a trench of 130 centimetres can be crossed, an incline of 50% climbed. There is a fuel supply of 114 litres, allowing for a range of 137 kilometres. There are five forward drives and one rear drive.|$|E
50|$|Seat belts are {{an obvious}} example of webbings used in auto safety {{but there are}} myriad other uses. Nylon and {{polyester}} webbing are used {{a great deal in}} auto racing safety for a large variety of items. Racing harnesses restraining the driver have used nylon webbing for years, but since the death of Dale Earnhardt polyester webbing is becoming more popular due to its increased strength, and lower rate of elongation under load. The nylon commercial type 9 webbing generally used in racing harnesses stretches approximately 20 to 30 percent of its initial length at 2500 lb (11.1 kN) while polyester only stretches 5 to 15 percent. Window nets to prevent objects from entering the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> are constructed of polypropylene webbing, as are helmet nets used to reduce side loads to the head in Sprint cars. The HANS device uses webbing tethers to attach the helmet to the collar, and the Hutchens device is made almost entirely of webbing.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Automotive News awarded Lear a Premier Automotive Suppliers' Contribution to Excellence (PACE) Award for innovation, {{technological}} advancement and business performance for its Solid State Smart Junction Box (S3JB), noting Lear's [...] "S3JB junction box has 1) integrated solid state fuse technology to eliminate relays, 2) {{created a new}} package that no longer has to be accessible from the <b>driver</b> <b>compartment</b> which decreases nuisance calls and lowers electrical device warranty returns, 3) created and installed a smart software logic with detailed diagnostics to permit a 'fail safe operation,' and 4) designed a single state board design with patented thermal aspects that permits multiple system and device connections and various configurations to ease manufacturing processes." [...] Lear acquired automotive and specialty fabrics company Guilford Mills for $257 million in May 2012. In addition to automotive fabric applications, Guilford produces fabrics for markets including water filtration, window covering, performance apparel, medical and other industrial applications.|$|E
