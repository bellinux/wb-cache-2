25|$|Tensions between Bradburn and {{the colonists}} escalated. Bradburn {{strongly}} supported the Mexican law forbidding slavery. In August 1831 he gave asylum to {{three men who}} had escaped slavery in Louisiana. The owner retained local lawyer William Barret Travis to represent him <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the slaves returned. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter, ostensibly from a friend, warning that 100 armed men would come from Louisiana to reclaim the slaves. When Bradburn realized that the letter was a hoax, he arrested William B. Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection to separate the territory from Mexico. Conviction on this charge would lead to Travis's execution. Unfamiliar with Mexican law, the settlers were outraged that Bradburn could arrest the man without a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most assumed they were still covered by the United States Bill of Rights.|$|E

The first of the British broadsides did major damage to South Carolina, leading Joyner to call his officers together to discuss whether to fight or to continue the flight. The decision was to continue the latter. By 1700hrs Quebec and Diomede came up alongside South Carolina, with Astrea behind in support, together with Hope and Constance. The British were soon in position to fire six broadsides, five from the Diomede and the other from the Quebec, all aimed at South Carolinas masts, sails and rigging, which within two hours were in tatters.|$|E

Botswana {{tried in vain to}} get back into contention for promotion but after a tied match against Germany, all hopes were dashed and the best they could hope for was a third-place finish.

25|$|Andy Smith died {{shortly after}} the end of the 1925 season. His death was {{unexpected}} and traumatic for the team and the whole university. His replacement was his assistant coach Nibs Price. Price was first hired as a freshman coach in 1918. He recruited the dominant 1919 freshmen team that would become the core of the Wonder Team for the next three years. In their first season without Smith, Cal had its first losing season since 1897. But by 1928, the team that was undefeated with six shutouts was invited to the Rose Bowl to play against Georgia Tech. While this team is considered to be one of the greats in Cal history, it is also remembered for what happened during its game at the Rose Bowl. It has become the most famous (or infamous) moment in Rose Bowl history. In the second quarter, California's defense forced a Georgia Tech fumble on their own 30-yard line, and the loose ball was scooped up by California center Roy Riegels. He began to run towards the Georgia Tech end zone for a score, but then, <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around the Tech players, he inexplicably turned around and headed in the other direction. Riegels advanced all the way to the Golden Bears' one-yard line before teammate Benny Lom was able to stop him, whereupon he was immediately tackled by what seemed like the entire Georgia Tech team. California elected to punt on the next play; the punt was blocked for a safety, giving the Yellow Jackets a 2â€“0 lead and what turned out to be the decisive points. The 1929 team beat PCC champion USC. Two years later was Nibs last season of coaching football. In 1926 when he became the head coach, Nibs was already the coach of the Golden Bears basketball team. He remained the basketball coach for another 13 years and led the team to the final four in 1946.|$|E

At that time, Wearing was based at the BBC English Regions Drama Department at BBC Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making [...] "regional drama", and had established his reputation by producing Alan Bleasdale's Boys from the Blackstuff in 1982. Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for BBC Two, with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons. A change of executives meant that the project did not reach production, however, Wearing persisted <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it commissioned.

500|$|Meanwhile, back on Earth, {{with their}} members running low on energon and slowly being {{captured}} by Skywatch, tension is high amongst the Autobots. After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force information out of Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots strike out on their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of Blurr and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is stopped by Hot Rod. He also fails <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Hot Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|E

Mary and Eleanor were co-heiresses to huge Bohun estates, and disputes over the settlement of these continued until late into the next century, when most of their descendants had been killed in the Wars of the Roses, perhaps encouraging the continued assertion of Bohun ancestry.

2500|$|Despite {{his great}} wealth and high position, Thomas {{could not come}} to terms with his brother's {{appointment}} as Protector; and in his struggle with Somerset, he tried to ingratiate himself with the king, who was just a little boy. He sought the 9-year-old Edward to write a letter on his behalf in support of his marriage to the dowager queen, Catherine Parr. The letter was obviously dictated by Thomas for Edward's signature and only enraged Somerset. He began to visit Edward frequently, secretly giving him an extravagant allowance of coins, so that Edward might be satisfied in feeling more grown-up and more king-like, giving gifts to his servants, teachers, and friends. Even though he lived in sumptuous splendor, and wanting for nothing, no provisions had been made for Edward's pocket money and he became accustomed to these regular payments and began to ask Thomas freely for his allowance. Thomas continued his manipulation of the king. [...] <b>In</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a bill through Parliament making him Edward's personal Governor, Thomas requested Edward's royal signature on the bill. [...] But Edward was uncertain, and reluctant to go behind the back of the Protector, Somerset, and of the regency council, and he would not sign it. [...] Thomas persistently pressured Edward, until Edward felt threatened. But Thomas did not give up. He tried to persuade Edward that he did not need a Protector, getting Edward to admit that it might be better for Somerset to die. [...] It is not known what the king meant by this, but it was probably uttered innocently. Thomas intended that the king's royal signature and personal support would destabilize Somerset's position as Protector, and {{as a member of the}} regency council. In his frustration and inability to gain any significant influence over the king, Thomas began to think in terms of open rebellion. [...] Although he was a boy, King Edward did not seem completely naÃ¯ve regarding any of this. [...] For, it is recorded that Edward referred to William Parr, his step-mother's brother, as [...] "mine honest uncle," [...] indicating unspoken scorn for both of his Seymour uncles..|$|E
2500|$|The second Conclave of 1555 {{opened on}} May 15, {{with the same}} {{cardinals}} as in April, but {{with the addition of}} eight late arrivals. [...] The leading candidate seemed to be Cardinal Carafa, the Inquisitor, but he was told to his face by the Imperial Ambassador that the Emperor Charles V did not want him as Pope. [...] The Imperial faction was favoring Cardinals Carpi, Morone, and Pole. Pole also seemed to have French support, but there was an influential group, led by Carafa, Carpi, and Alvarez (all professional Inquisitors), who openly questioned the orthodoxy of Pole and of Morone. The French Ambassador, Jean d' Avanson, informed King Henri that his favorite candidate, Cardinal d'Este, was being opposed vigorously by the Imperial faction, and that he could not win, thanks to a [...] "virtual veto" [...] (that is, the withholding of votes for a candidate by {{more than one-third of the}} voters); the Emperor even expressed fears that d'Este might try to bribe himself into the papacy. D'Avanson also had to break the news that Cardinal du Bellay, out of personal ambition, had broken ranks and would support Cardinal Carafa. In the voting, the Imperial candidate, Cardinal Carpi, seemed to be moving forward, until the French faction and the cardinals created by Julius III (of which there were fifteen at the Conclave) combined to put him out of the running. Once it was clear that nobody in the French faction was going to succeed, Cardinal Farnese and Cardinal d'Este decided to throw their support to Cardinal Carafa. The Imperial faction was so frightened at what Pope Carafa might do <b>in</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Naples out of the hands of the Emperor that they sent Cardinals Corner and Ricci to Alessandro Farnese to beg him to abandon Carafa and accept their votes for himself. But Farnese was not so foolish as to believe that he could be successful without the endorsement either of the Emperor or of the King of Franceâ€”and he had neither. [...] He did not respond to the offer. The supporters of Carafa finally numbered more than the two-thirds needed for election, but the Imperialists (who were caucusing in the Hall of the Secret Consistory) refused to come to the Chapel and carry out the electoral process. It was Farnese who, using both blandishments and threats, managed to get the Imperialists to give in and assemble with the rest of the cardinals in the Cappella Paolina. [...] On the afternoon of May 23, the Feast of the Ascension, the seventy-eight year old Cardinal Gian Pietro Carafa of Naples was elected pope by acclamation. He chose the name Paul IV.|$|E
