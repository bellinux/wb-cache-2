[...] "I have an iPhone and I had to switch to AT So, that's wonderful. Well, I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> AT bill, right here in a box," [...] she says {{at the start of}} the video. The rest of the video, set to the distinctive music used in American iPhone television commercials, shows her opening the box and flipping through the pages in fast motion.

However, at the age of 108 he briefly started smoking again, encouraged by gifts of cigars {{from as far away as}} London. Breuning retained a sharp memory.

Couric claimed that she remembered her first library card, but the words were all from Zaslow's column. it was determined that a producer had actually written the piece. What made the plagiarism especially striking was the personal flavor of the video – which was subsequently removed from the cbsnews.com website after the situation came to light – that began, [...] "I still remember when I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> library card, browsing through the stacks for my favorite books." ...|$|E

Good-bye going ethereal at will. ... Much later, I had the good fortune to write the Ilithiad for 2nd edition, as well as three supporting adventures. Because I had to delve so deeply into psionics, including suggesting the use of alternate rules (again, for game balance!), I came away with an even stronger appreciation for the possibilities psionics could offer a D&D game." ...|$|R

60|$|Our {{readers were}} almost the only counterchecks {{to the current}} of vulgarity and baseness which ran through {{the talk of the}} older boys, and I wish to {{acknowledge}} my deep obligation to Professor McGuffey, whoever he may have been, for the dignity and literary grace of his selections. From the pages of his readers I learned to know and love the poems of Scott, Byron, Southey, Wordsworth and a long line of the English masters.

5000|$|On October 22, 2015 Brendon Urie {{released}} a statement through the band's Facebook page on {{the background of the}} album: When I was a little kid and I heard a song I liked on TV, I would jump up and run to the piano to try and figure it out by ear. When I was 10 or 11, I built myself a drum kit in the garage made out of empty laundry detergent buckets, old lawn chairs, paint cans, and old trash cans. Around that time, <b>my</b> parents <b>got</b> me <b>my</b> <b>first</b> guitar. A baby acoustic. I jumped between all of these instruments constantly to satisfy the ideas I heard in my head. At this young age, I realized that music would play a huge part in my life. I had no idea.'Death of a Bachelor' is in honor of those times I spent alone as a kid. Allowing music to consume me. Playing everything myself just to get the idea right and out of my head. It's a beginning to a new era. And an homage to how it all began.This album is me. Running to the piano. Building a drum kit. Strumming a guitar.Some things never change.|$|R

A kind of cold shudder ran through me, which I couldn't account for at the time. I know, now, that I must have <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> suspicion, at that moment, of a new light (and horrid light) having suddenly fallen on the case, in the mind of Sergeant Cuff--purely and entirely in consequence of what he had seen in Miss Rachel, and heard from Miss Rachel, at that first interview between them.|$|E
60|$|Far southward lay a long, black mountain, {{covered with}} patches of shining snow. I could follow the zigzag {{line of the}} Grand Canyon {{splitting}} the desert plateau, and saw it disappear in the haze round {{the end of the}} mountain. From this I <b>got</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> clear impression of the topography of the country surrounding our objective point. Buckskin mountain ran its blunt end eastward to the Canyon--in fact, formed a hundred miles of the north rim. As it was nine thousand feet high it still held the snow, which had occasioned our lengthy desert ride to get back of the mountain. I could see the long slopes rising out of the desert to meet the timber.|$|E
5000|$|Born into a music-infused {{environment}} ("When I was {{two years}} old, I used to lie underneath our grand piano with our dog while he was practicing or composing"), Brent quickly displayed an interest in, and affinity for, his father's calling, and the wholehearted support afforded his youthful explorations - [...] "I was playing on cardboard boxes when I was three years old; he <b>got</b> me <b>my</b> <b>first</b> drum set when I was six" [...] - reaped early dividends for both father and son, as recalled in an interview recorded shortly after Dr. Fischer's death in January 2012:I got interested in electric bass when I was 14 and he got me an instrument. And at that point, he saw my abilities developing very rapidly, and it just turned out very well, actually. He decided that he liked {{the sound of the}} electric bass - because of its pitch and its sustain - better than the upright bass that he'd been using in his Latin jazz group at the time. And that bass player, who was a very fine bassist, but was also getting busy with other projects, had to leave the group. So it was just perfect timing that my abilities had come far enough at that point so he felt comfortable putting me in the band. So, I made <b>my</b> <b>first</b> CD with Clare Fischer in 1980,sic and here we are, 32 years later, still making CDs.|$|R

Burke, in an interview with Popjustice, elaborated on her experience of working with RedOne. She said,I've got to say, Red was the one who basically <b>got</b> <b>my</b> personality out <b>first.</b> Then everything else slipped into place like a puzzle. Red really started it off for me. He had song already ready for me, right? And then I walked in, and he met me, and he was like, [...] "scrap every song we've just prepared for you, we're going to start from scratch, because you're not the person I thought you would be.' So then he wrote song according to my personality.|$|R
