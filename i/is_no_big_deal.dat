5000|$|... 1993: Billion dollar lossesIBM misreads two {{significant}} {{trends in the}} computer industry: personal computers and client-server computing: {{and as a result}} is poorly positioned in the marketplace. The misreads hit the bottom line hard: IBM loses more than $8 billion in 1993, its third straight year of billion dollar losses. Since 1991, the company has lost $16 billion, and many feel IBM is no longer a viable player in the industry.1993: Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.Gerstner arrives as IBM's chairman and CEO on April 1, 1993. For {{the first time since the}} arrival of Thomas J. Watson, Sr., in 1914, IBM has a leader pulled from outside its ranks. Gerstner had been chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco for four years, and had previously spent 11 years as a top executive at American Express. 1993: IBM Scalable POWERparallel systemIBM introduces the Scalable POWERparallel System, the first in a family of microprocessor-based supercomputers using RISC System/6000 technology. IBM pioneers the breakthrough scalable parallel system technology of joining smaller, mass-produced computer processors rather than relying on one larger, custom-designed processor. Complex queries could then be broken down into a series of smaller jobs than are run concurrently ("in parallel") to speed their completion.1994: TurnaroundIBM reports a profit for the year, its first since 1990. Over the next few years the company successfully charts a new business course, one that focuses less on its traditional strengths in hardware, and more on services, software, and its ability to craft technology solutions.1994: IBM RAMAC Array Storage FamilyThe IBM RAMAC Array Family is announced. With features like highly parallel processing, multi-level cache, RAID 5 and redundant components, RAMAC represents a major advance in information storage technology. Consisting of the RAMAC Array Direct Access Storage Device (DASD) and the RAMAC Array Subsystem, the products become one of IBM's most successful storage product launches ever, with almost 2,000 systems shipped to customers in its first three months of availability.1994: Speech recognitionIBM releases the IBM Personal Dictation System (IPDS), the first wave of speech recognition products for the personal computer. It is later renamed VoiceType, and its capabilities are expanded to include control of computer applications and desktops simply by talking to them, without touching a keyboard.

Nicknamed [...] "Blue Gene," [...] the new supercomputers perform 500 times faster than other powerful supercomputers and can simulate folding complex proteins.2000: Quantum mirage nanotechnologyIBM scientists discover a way to transport information on the atomic scale that uses electrons instead of conventional wiring. This new phenomenon, called the Quantum mirage effect, enables data transfer within future nanoscale electronic circuits too small to use wires. The quantum mirage technique is a unique way of sending information through solid forms and could do away with wiring that connects nanocircuit components.2000: IBM ASCI White - Fastest supercomputerIBM delivers the world's most powerful computer to the US Department of Energy, powerful enough to process an Internet transaction for every person on Earth in less than a minute. IBM built the supercomputer to accurately test the safety and effectiveness of the nation's aging nuclear weapons stockpile. This computer is 1,000 times more powerful than Deep Blue, the supercomputer that beat Garry Kasparov in chess in 1997.2000: Flexible transistorsIBM created flexible transistors, combining organic and inorganic materials as a medium for semiconductors. This technology enables things like an [...] "electronic newspaper", so lightweight and inexpensive that leaving one behind on the airplane or in a hotel lobby <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal.</b> By eliminating the limitations of etching computer circuits in silicon, flexible transistors make it possible to create a new generation of inexpensive computer displays that can be embedded into curved plastic or other materials.2000: Sydney OlympicsAfter a successful engagement at the 2000 Olympic games in Sydney, IBM ends its 40-year technology partnership with the International Olympic Committee.2001: Holocaust controversyA controversial book, IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance Between Nazi Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation by Edwin Black, accuses IBM of having knowingly assisted Nazi authorities in the perpetuation of the Holocaust through the provision of tabulating products and services. Several lawsuits are filed against IBM by Holocaust victims seeking restitution for their suffering and losses. All lawsuits related to this issue were eventually dropped without recovery.2001: Carbon nanotube transistorsIBM researchers build the world's first transistors out of carbon nanotubes - tiny cylinders of carbon atoms that are 500 times smaller than silicon-based transistors and 1,000 times stronger than steel. The breakthrough is an important step in finding materials that can be used to build computer chips when silicon-based chips can’t be made any smaller.2001: Low power initiativeIBM launches its low-power initiative to improve the energy efficiency of IT and accelerates the development of ultra-low power components and power-efficient servers, storage systems, personal computers and ThinkPad notebook computers.2001: Greater density & chip speedsIBM is first to mass-produce computer hard disk drives using a revolutionary new type of magnetic coating - [...] "pixie dust" [...] - that eventually quadruples data density of current hard disk drive products. IBM also unveils [...] "strained silicon," [...] a breakthrough that alters silicon to boost chip speeds by up to 35 percent.2002: The Hard disk drive business is sold to Hitachi2003: Blue Gene/LThe BLUE GENE team unveils a proto-type of its Blue Gene/L computer roughly the size of a standard dishwasher that ranks as the 73rd most powerful supercomputer in the world.

After describing in Section I the practice that has given rise to the controversy, I examine in Section II one feature of the controversy that, I believe, has not yet been addressed in detail: The target of criticism is not really what Justices of the Supreme Court have done, but rather what they might do.

40|$|The longstanding {{debate over}} the {{benefits}} and detriments of mandatory arbitration in the consumer context has often focused on the wrong issue. Although we have now argued for almost twenty years over whether {{it is appropriate to}} require consumers to arbitrate rather than litigate claims against providers of products and services, too often commentators have asked whether consumers win or lose when they bring claims in arbitration, rather than whether consumers’ claims are suppressed or eliminated altogether as a result of companies’ use of mandatory arbitration clauses. The United States Supreme Court’s recent decision in AT 2 ̆ 6 T Mobility v. Concepcion brings this claim suppression issue to the forefront by allowing companies to use arbitration clauses to insulate themselves from exposure to plaintiffs’ class actions. While some urge that the elimination of consumer class actions <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal,</b> in that consumer arbitration offers a more effective way for consumers to resolve their claims than do class actions, this Article suggests this analysis is deeply flawed. Although some 2 ̆ 7 procedurally easy 2 ̆ 7 claims may effectively be resolved through individual arbitration (in actuality they are far more frequently resolved through complaints to customer service or through credit card chargebacks), 2 ̆ 7 procedurally difficult 2 ̆ 7 claims cannot typically be resolved on an individual basis. 2 ̆ 7 Procedurally difficult 2 ̆ 7 claims are those in which the consumer does not realize she has potentially been injured; the consumer does not realize that an injury she has suffered may be legally cognizable; the consumer’s claim is difficult and expensive to present, relative to the anticipated recovery; or the consumer seeks injunctive or other group relief. Claims for discrimination or fraud or regarding tainted food may often be procedurally difficult. While recognizing that, in theory, government agencies could protect consumers with procedurally difficult claims, the Article finds that in the United States such agencies are not sufficiently well-funded to protect many consumers. Thus, the Article concludes that Congress and/or administrative agencies such as the Consumer Finance Protection Board need to step in to protect consumers with procedurally difficult claims and assure they receive the legal protection they have been promised by our substantive laws...|$|E

The President, worried about {{the effect on the}} coming elections of any unsavory revelations by the burglars, ordered H. R.

This action, constituting obstruction of justice, transformed the small problem into a large one. As time went on, new illegal actions and the accidental revelation of unrelated misdeeds made the problem larger and larger. 3 SEEKING A NEW NBS DIRECTOR The resignation of Lewis Branscomb as Director of NBS after less than three years in that office surprised and puzzled the technical community both inside the Bureau and beyond. The bright future envisioned by the NBS staff suddenly became cloudy and uncertain. The eloquent voice and restless personality, so promising in terms of leadership within the Bureau and so visible in the Nation's scientific establishmen...|$|R

The criteria used were based on the several cultural traits recognized as well as clothing values. The clothing values are basically the meaning or the types of associations a consumer form with the selective clothes. Clothing is a very integral part of one’s life. There is a small poem by William Allen Butler, called "Nothing to Wear"; It goes like this: Dresses for breakfasts, and dinners, and balls; Dresses to sit in, and stand in, and walk in; Dresses to dance in, and flirt in, and talk in; Dresses in which to do nothing at all; Dresses for Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. This is a very precise but accurate description of the use and importance of clothing in one’s life. Naturally for every second of every day one need some kind of clothes to wear. There are millions of different people around the world with million different preferences and choices. So the question is what does the consumer really need, and why does one purchase what they do? The simplest answer is that the consumers buy things what they are accustomed to and what they feel comfortable with. This level of comfort is derived by some inherent in built guides that make the consumer go in a particular direction every time the go clothes shopping. Someone once said everyone loves what they shop but hate everything in their wardrobe. Female clothes shopping behavior according to many is very annoying and cumbersome, but somehow the results seem the same for every time. It is possible for a person to have too many black shirts, and a thousand and one reasons given for why they have a 100 black shirts, it was on sale, that’s all there was left, the store didn’t have any other variety. True in some instances these are excuses. The reasons are the latent motives in one’s mind. One might think that black makes them look smarter, or maybe it makes them look more serious and hence treated with higher care and respect, or because it is the signature color of the sports team one follows or maybe even because it is the favorite color of a loved one. These are some motives that are defined by the surroundings one lives in and hence are the product of the dominant culture around. The study aims at understanding what are the cultural factors that affect the selection criteria of casual clothes among women. It is a cross cultural study that will compare and contrast the selection behavior of Norwegian consumers with Pakistani consumers. Historical studies have proved that consumers do not behave in the same way cross culturally. The culture defines the consumption patterns. For example in a western country purchase and use of shorts <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal.</b> However in Arab countries its considered disrespect and indecent to wear shorts in public. The popular cultural studies like Hofstede’s dimensions the Globe study have aimed at understanding the differences among national cultures. Of course national culture is not a representation of individual behavior but the individual behavior is shaped by the dominant national culture.

40|$|Public {{opinion on}} {{responses}} to terrorism {{is more complex}} than many people claim, according to Andrew Lynch THE RESULTS from the AgePoll on Australian attitudes towards terrorism show a nation prepared to sacrifice a range of civil liberties in order to decrease the likelihood of such attacks occurring. But the picture is more sophisticated than one simply of public support for placing rights on the chopping block. To be clear at the outset, the overall message from the poll is far from surprising. With each year since September 11, it has become very apparent that terrorist attacks on Western liberal democracies are seen by everyone as more likely to occur {{than they were in the}} immediately preceding years. A desire to strengthen national security has been an expected and logical response to that realisation. It may be - and the trend has certainly been this way - that increased security comes at the expense of some liberties we had taken for granted. There have been very few Australians indeed who have suggested that no attempts should be made to prevent a terrorist attack from occurring and most have acknowledged that some balance will have to be struck against their freedoms. It is a terrible and deliberate misrepresentation to say that civil libertarians do not recognise that some sacrifices may be necessary. Instead, like most members of the public who participated in the AgePoll, the concerns of civil rights advocates are how we should best achieve a balance so as to protect ourselves but without surrendering so much of our way of life that the terrorists have, in effect, won. So it is not unexpected, in light of recent events, that so many people thought more security cameras in public places was a good idea. Video footage of terrorist activities in London has obviously played a hugely important role in the success of police investigations into those crimes. Most of us feel that the diminishment of our privacy through use of cameras <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal.</b> First, we have nothing to hide; second, we’re in a public place anyway; and third, security cameras are already pretty prevalent in most cities. It was interesting that, excepting deportation of terrorist suspects, the increased security measures which received strongest support were those which present the possibility to affect all members of the community. In addition to a willingness to live with greater monitoring by security cameras, a majority of those surveyed were prepared to carry a national identity card and tolerate random bag checks. At least, in giving up freedoms, most people started with those which they themselves presently enjoy. But while those trade-offs seemed to cause few qualms, other options met with more opposition. Despite the opinion of the attorney-general, Philip Ruddock, that all other rights should yield to that of the right to life, there are some things which many members of the Australian public feel are not worth surrendering as collateral in the ‘war on terror’. Clear majorities were against the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects without charge and granting the police a licence to ‘shoot to kill’ suspects on the streets. This is not to suggest that the balancing process between security and rights is always straightforward. Some measures which attracted majority favour are difficult to square with our traditional value that a person should not be punished unless guilty of a crime. Specifically, the deportation or detention for three months of people on the basis of a suspicion rather than evidence heard and assessed by an independent court would be a significant step in reducing liberty in the name of security. The support recorded for those measures will concern sections of the community for whom those methods are a diminishment of what defines our society. In losing that part of ourselves, we give the terrorists a victory. But even when we disagree with the majority’s preference on those more controversial questions, we might take some comfort from the clear use of balancing to try and achieve the two ends of safety and freedom. The time limit on such detention without review is a further indicator that the public is not prepared to stop at nothing in feeling safer. Mr Ruddock’s stark choice seems not to resonate with them. In summary, the poll results expose the sophistry of those who say the alternatives are between life or liberty for what it is. We need to ensure national security but clearly most Australians feel that this is not an absolute. It must be balanced against what we are willing to sacrifice - both in how we live and what kind of people we are. Acknowledging the complexity of this question is vital if we are to engage in a proper public debate of how we are to combat the threat of terrorism.
