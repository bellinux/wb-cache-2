[...] He continued, [...] "When I say things, I think people believe me so much that they take it a different way — it's, like, not rap anymore at that point. I say some great things about him in the book I have coming out [...] — that's wasn't a cheap plug," [...] he laughed. [...] "He's gonna be embarrassed, I said some really great things about him and people's perception of him.

The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects. That's who I am. You can see my soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup. [...] just me {{on the beach and}} in the sun, and I brought one bathing suit 'cause I was there for myself.

500|$|The inquest {{concluded}} in October 2010. Earland, the Exeter and Greater Devon Coroner, recorded a narrative verdict {{and came up}} with several recommendations. Among the recommendations were that Ten Tors participants should undergo more than two training expeditions prior to the main event, that the team managers attain recognised qualifications and that the Health and Safety Executive ensure that independent schools adhere to the same safety standards as state schools. She {{went on to say that}} [...] "It would be a tragedy if [...] was to stop but the public need to be satisfied it is as safe as it reasonably can be, bearing in mind <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> says, a challenge, not a survival exercise."

500|$|At Harvard, Lin {{was uncomfortable}} with the {{attention}} on his ethnicity as opposed to his performance. He regularly heard bigoted jeers at games such as [...] "Wonton soup", [...] "Sweet and sour pork", [...] "Open your eyes!", [...] "Go back to China", [...] "Orchestra {{is on the other}} side of campus," [...] or pseudo-Chinese gibberish. Lin said this occurred at most if not all Ivy League gyms, but he did not react to it. [...] "I expect it, I'm used to it, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is," [...] said Lin. The heckling came mostly from opposing fans and not as much from players. According to Harvard teammate Oliver McNally, a fellow Ivy League player once called Lin the ethnic slur chink. In January 2010, Harvard played against Santa Clara University at the Leavey Center, just 15 miles from his hometown of Palo Alto, California. Playing to a capacity crowd that included droves of Asian Americans wanting to see his homecoming, his teammates told him, [...] "It was like Hong Kong." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by her divorce from Bush lead singer, Gavin Rossdale; Stefani wrote several songs during these recording sessions to start [...] "a new chapter in her life".

Billboard stated that the lyrics [...] "Are you sure you wanna love me? / I know that it's a lot to handle me / But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is / It's all part of my broken history" [...] were [...] "ultra personal". In his description of the track, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday stated that [...] "'Asking 4 It' strikes at the heart of pop radio" [...] while Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media described [...] "Asking 4 It" [...] as [...] "the album's sole feature atop an unconvincing beat." [...] Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter felt that the album's [...] "sound cools down a little", but that the track [...] "is still easy to dance to".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Carey described going under-cover as the stalker role: [...] "Well, {{we had a lot}} of people outside. I'm walking up to the Plaza , and when I was dressed as Mariah Carey, there were a lot of people just standing there taking pictures, and the street was closed down, and it was a whole rigmarole. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. So, basically, I went into costume as the stalker, and I told my bodyguard, 'I don't want you to walk with me.' So, a friend of mine was there, and I was like, 'Let's walk together.'" [...] After reports continued to speculate regarding the video's subject, Ratner explained that the main inspiration behind the video was the 1983 film, The King of Comedy. On July 10, 2009, Carey announced through her Twitter account that the video would premiere on the talent competition program, America's Got Talent, which was hosted by Cannon. The full version premiered two days later on 106 & Park. Carey was present at the show and discussed the making of the video.|$|E
500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song.

[...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit.

500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
