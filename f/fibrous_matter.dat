2500|$|Inspired by {{the work}} of Italian {{psychiatrist}} Amarro Fiamberti, Freeman at some point conceived of approaching the frontal lobes through the eye sockets instead of through drilled holes in the skull.

This new [...] "transorbital" [...] lobotomy involved lifting the upper eyelid and placing the point of a thin surgical instrument (often called an orbitoclast or leucotome, although quite different from the wire loop leucotome described above) under the eyelid and against the top of the eyesocket. A mallet was used to drive the orbitoclast through the thin layer of bone and into the brain along the plane of the bridge of the nose, around fifteen degrees toward the interhemispherical fissure. The orbitoclast was malleted five centimeters (2in) into the frontal lobe, and then pivoted forty degrees at the orbit perforation so the tip cut toward {{the opposite side of the}} head (toward the nose). The instrument was returned to the neutral position and sent a further two centimeters (in) into the brain, before being pivoted around twenty-eight degrees each side, to cut outwards and again inwards.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the applicability of an HY-differential mobility analyzer with an optical particle counter (HY-DMA/OPC), named as KOFAM, for counting <b>fibrous</b> <b>matters</b> in real time. Fibers separated from particles by the HY-DMA were counted with an OPC. To assess the KOFAM performance, the proposed method and the conventional gold standard phase contrast microscopy (PCM) method were compared in terms of variables such as recovery, relative difference, coefficient of determination, and conformity. The optimal sheath-to-aerosol (outlet) flow ratio of the internal flow in the HY-DMA {{was determined to be}} 1. 6 : 1. In terms of recovery of the HY-DMA, the highest recovery was obtained at a voltage of 500 V regardless of which type of asbestos was tested. The recovery rate for serpentine was 45. 5 % and that for amphibole was 34. 9 %. The coefficients of determination of serpentine (R 2 = 0. 89) and amphibole (R 2 = 0. 87) were highly correlated. With respect to the coefficient of variation (CV), the KOFAM demonstrated superior performance over the M 7400 AD and F- 1 methods and showed almost no difference from the PCM method (KOFAM: 22. 5 %, M 7400 AD: 32. 4 %, F- 1 : 88. 8 %, and PCM: 21. 9 %). There was no statistically significant difference between concentration measurements of the KOFAM and PCM analyses. Accordingly, it was concluded that the KOFAM {{can be used as a}} superior alternative to conventional fiber measurement methods.

So far, there has been no report using molecular techniques to study the gut microbiota of the white rhinoceros. We used barcoded pyrosequencing to characterize 105, 651 sequences of 16 S rRNA genes obtained from fecal samples from five white rhinoceroses. Results showed that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla in the samples, which were comprised largely of unclassified bacteria. The microbiota of one animal treated with drug therapy differed from those in other healthy animals, and was dominated by Aerococcus -related bacteria. The core microbiota in the healthy rhinoceros were dominated by phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, represented by the Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Rikenellaceae and Prevotellaceae families.

Illu-mina sequencing of goat rumen samples yielded 101, 356, 610 nucleotides that were assem-bled into 256, 868 reads with an average read length of 394 nucleotides. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated that the predominant phyla were distinct at differ-ent growth stages. The phyla Firmicutes and Synergistetes were predominant in samples taken from 80 to 100 -day-old goats, but Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes became the most abundant phyla in samples from 110 -day-old animals. There was a remarkable variation in the microbial populations with age; Firmicutes and Synergistetes decreased after weaning, but Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria increased from 80 to 110 day of age. These findings suggested that colonization of the rumen by microorganisms is related to their function in the rumen digestive system.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of preserving the environment in out developing world, activity involving the extraction {{of natural resources and}} the disposal of waster continues to increase. Such operations need to be conducted in a carefully-controlled manner, protecting both the natural environment and the communities who live in the vicinity. Drawing expertise from 19 countries around the world, this book discusses the engineered disposal of waste in landfills as well as how to manage land contaminated by waste disposal and fluid flows. It provides an integrated view of the latest research and practice in waste disposal as well as environmental management. (CRC Press) Over the past 25 years large quantities of vegetative matter (particularly gardening waste) have been deposited in engineered landfills. The fibrous nature of this type of waste initially creates a form of 'soil reinforcement' within the refuse mass. With time the fibres will degrade and the reinforcing effect will be lost and this could have a serious effect on the stability of refuse slopes. Laboratory tests have been conducted to investigate the effect of pore water composition on the strength properties of <b>fibrous</b> vegetable <b>matter</b> and individual vegetable fibres. This preliminary assessment of whether the stability of 'as-constructed' landfill slopes is likely to be affected significantly by decomposition of vegetable matter within the refuse was conducted using a 'typical' vegetable fibre...|$|R

40|$|The {{monotremes}} and marsupials {{have developed}} {{an impressive array of}} divergent feeding and nutritive systems. The extant monotreme species are largely invertebrate feeders and they differ from other mammals by having an elaborate electroreception system, which is particularly well developed in the platypus, for the detection of prey. Another characteristic that is unusual is the lack of a gastric stomach. Marsupials include both carnivores and herbivores, with some opportunist "carnivores" also consuming significant plant materials to classify as omnivores. The extant carnivores tend to be small (< 20 kg), with larger species being extinct. The smallest species are primarily insectivorous and as size increases the proportion of vertebrates in the diet increases. The marsupial herbivores range from large grazing animals such as kangaroos and wombats to tiny nectar feeding possums. Koalas and the rat-kangaroos have also evolved to be dietary specialists feeding on eucalypt leaves and subterranean fungi, respectively. Microbial fermentation of <b>fibrous</b> plant <b>matter</b> takes place in an enlarged forestomach (macropods) or in the lower gastrointestinal tract. The microbes that inhabit the gut are not well understood and have only been studied in a few marsupial species.

Also, the concept that more fireproofing is better, was defeated by industry tests of Thermo-lag 330-1 (which is not a <b>fibrous</b> insulation).

The removal of 1 or 2 feet of the upper moss and soil put the bottom of the ditch into a mixture of ground ice and muck, much of which was almost clear ice. This {{material}} thawed when the water was turned in, and as a result a large part of the bottom of the ditch has settled at least 2 feet and the ditch has widened in many places to 15 or 20 feet or more. As the upper bank thawed, material was thrown against the lower bank to protect it and to keep the water from getting under it. Practically all the upper ditch and at least three-fourths of the lower ditch is built in frozen ground of this character. These sections have been difficult and expensive to maintain and caused considerable interruption in the delivery of water during 1909 and 1910. Where the lower ditch is built around the steep gulches that carry the eastern tributaries of the Pinnell the northerly slopes of the gulches are covered with muck, but the southerly slopes are made up of a more solid clay and of decomposed mica schist. Along the upper ditch lava bowlders are present in the muck from the surface to bedrock, and at a few places the material encountered was composed of angular fragments of lava with only a little soil between them. Above and below Snow Gulch, the lowest tributary of Pinnell River which the ditch crosses, are short pieces of rockwork. The rock is much shattered and could have been loosened with picks if it had not been frozen. Much difficulty was experienced in making the rockwork water tight on account of the lack of good sod, as the surface covering is commonly decayed moss or peat containing much <b>fibrous</b> <b>matter</b> and little earthly material, and will float even though saturated with water, so that it is necessary to weight it down with rocks when it is used on the bottom of the ditch.|$|E

However, too high dry matter content often gives rise to severe inhibition of the yeast metabolism, due to the increased levels of toxic compounds. The aim of the present work was to increase the fibrous content in SSF of steam pretreated spruce to 10 % by adapting the yeast to the inhibitory substrate and by using a fed-batch process. Both batch and fed-batch approaches were evaluated. The fed-batch experiments were started with a batch fermentation containing 6 % dry <b>matter.</b> <b>Fibrous</b> slurry from the pretreatment was then added four times during the first 24 h giving a final dry matter content corresponding to 10 %. The yeast used in the fermentation was produced aerobically on the hemicellulose hydrolysate obtained from the pretreatment. SSF batch and fed-batch experiments with a cell mass concentration of 2, 3 and 5 g/L were carried out. When adapted yeast was used, the available hexoses were completely converted within 72 h and the final ethanol concentrations reached 40 - 44 g/L. No major differences in performance between batch and fed-batch were seen, but the ethanol productivity during the first 24 h was higher in the fed-batch SSF experiments, particularly during the experiments with a cell mass concentration of 2 and 3 g/L.

The intrinsic tensile properties of stone groundwood fibers, as well as the fiber orientation factor and the interfacial shear strength of the current composites were determine...|$|E

These fibers have been suspected to be the cause of increased incidences of lung cancer and other lung diseases in these areas. However, the mechanisms of the cellular response and defense following exposure to these microscopic fibers have not been characterized. We continue to study these mechanisms to be able to propose preventive strategies in large populations. The objective of the present study was to determine comparatively biological responses of mesothelial Met- 5 A and monocyte-macrophage J 774 cells following exposure to two types of fluoro-edenite fibers having low and high iron content (labeled 19 and 27, respectively) obtained from Biancavilla (Sicily, Italy). The reference fiber was a non-iron fibrous tremolite from Val di Susa (Piemonte, Italy). The cells were treated with 5, 50, and 100 μg of <b>fibrous</b> <b>matter</b> per 1 ml for 72 hr. We identified several key mechanisms by which cells responded and counteracted the injury induced by these fibers. The fibers caused induction of the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70), stimulated formation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{giant panda}} genome codes for all {{necessary}} enzymes {{associated with a}} carnivorous digestive system but lacks genes for enzymes needed to digest cellulose, the principal component of their bamboo diet. It has been posited that this iconic species must therefore possess microbial symbionts capable of metabolizing cellulose, but these symbionts have remained undetected. Here we examined 5, 522 prokaryotic ribosomal RNA gene sequences in wild and captive giant panda fecal samples. We found lower species richness of the panda microbiome than of mammalian microbiomes for herbivores and nonherbivorous carnivores. We detected 13 operational taxonomic units closely related to Clostridium groups I and XIVa, both of which contain taxa known to digest cellulose. Seven of these 13 operational taxonomic units were unique to pandas compared with other mammals. Metagenomic analysis using ∼ 37 -Mbp contig sequences from gut microbes recovered putative genes coding two cellulose-digesting enzymes and one hemicellulose-digesting enzyme, cellulase, β-glucosidase, and xylan 1, 4 -β-xylosidase, in Clostridium group I. Comparing glycoside hydrolase profiles of pandas with those of herbivores and omnivores, we found a moderate abundance of oligosaccharide-degrading enzymes for pandas (36 %), close to that for humans (37 %), and the lowest abundance of cellulases and endohemicellulases (2 %), which may reflect low digestibility of cellulose and hemicellulose in the panda's unique bamboo diet. The presence of putative cellulose-digesting microbes, in combination with adaptations related to feeding, physiology, and morphology, show that giant pandas have evolved a number of traits to overcome the anatomical and physiological challenge of digesting a diet high in <b>fibrous</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|E
30|$|While we {{followed}} the principle of this mild method as reported {{a long time ago}} (Anderlini 1887 a, b), the subsequent processing was carried out using currently available techniques. About 1  g of shredded cocoons were placed in a screw-capped bottle, with 50  mL water containing 0.06  % sodium azide (for preventing bacterial growth), heated to either 50 or 60  °C in a temperature-controlled silicon oil bath, either with or without stirring, and maintained at the prescribed temperatures for 4  weeks. The changes with time were monitored by collecting 10 -mL aliquots after 1, 2 or 3  weeks, respectively, followed by the addition of equivalent volumes of fresh water. At week 4, only the solid <b>fibrous</b> <b>matter</b> was removed (fibroin), while leaving the powdery precipitate deposited spontaneously on the bottom. This initial (“primary”) precipitate is assumed to contain sericin fractions that are insoluble due to higher molecular masses and/or structural effects. The supernatant solution, together with the primary precipitate, were placed in dialysis tubing (MMCO 3.5  kDa) and dialyzed under stirring for 3  days at 50  °C, with six water exchanges. The solution was then centrifuged at a RCF of 1000 g for 20 – 30  min in an Eppendorf centrifuge (Model 5810 R) to separate the primary precipitate, which was subsequently freeze-dried to obtain a dry product. The supernatant phase was also freeze-dried leading to a powder (the “secondary” precipitate). This powder, together with the primary precipitate, was regraded as the total BMSS, and the sum of their weights represented about 8  % of the initial cocoon weight. The solid BMSS products were stored at room temperature prior to other use.|$|E
