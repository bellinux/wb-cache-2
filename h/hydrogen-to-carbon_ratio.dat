40|$|The {{impact of}} oxygen ion {{transport}} at the electrolyte-electrode interface of a micro-solid oxide fuel cell using different fuels is investigated. Model validation is performed {{to verify the}} results versus the reported values. Furthermore, as the <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> decreases, the diffusivity of the oxygen ion increases. This increase in diffusivity is observed {{because the number of}} hydrogen atoms available as the reacting species increases in fuels with lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios. The oxygen ion conductivity and output power density decrease as the <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> of the fuels decreases. The reason behind this impact is the formation of a gas-induced ion barrier at the electrode-electrolyte interface by the CO 2 molecules formed during the reaction at the interface, thus blocking the flow of oxygen ions. As the oxygen ions become blocked, the output current contribution from the reaction also decreases and thereby affects the overall performance of the micro-solid oxide fuel cell. The experimental verification confirms this because of a significant decrease in the output power density. Furthermore, as per the application in portable devices, the appropriate choice of fuel can be chosen so that the micro-solid oxide fuel cell operates at the maximum power density.

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in a refinery consist of Y zeolite, a silica-alumina matrix and a binder. In this study, spent FCC catalysts were prepared by cracking sour imported heavy gas oil (SIHGO) in a microactivity test unit. The total amount of coke and the <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> (H/C) in the coke for spent FCC catalysts contaminated with metals were determined using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Total H/C ratios of the coke on FCC catalysts {{were found to be}} in the range of 0. 4 to 1, indicating the majority of the coke consists of polyaromatic species. H/C ratio decreased with increasing coke contents on the catalysts. This ratio was found to be higher for the catalyst with high metal concentration compared to the catalyst with relatively low metal concentration. The high H/C ratio for highly contaminated FCC catalyst was attributed to the formation of hydrogen rich coke by hydrogenation reactions catalyzed by the contaminant metals on the catalyst. After hydrogen pre-treatment both coke amount and H/C ratio decreased significantly. This was due to the decrease in the hydrogenation activities of the contaminant-metals in their reduced forms...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of first-principles calculations, we present exotic {{geometrical}} and electronic properties in hydrogenated graphyne, a 2 D material of sp-sp 2 hybrid carbon networks. Hydrogen atoms adsorbed onto sp-bonded carbon atoms can form both sp 2 -and sp 3 - hybridized bonds and can exist in three different geometries: in-plane, out-of-plane, and oblique-plane; this is {{in sharp contrast to}} hydrogenated graphene, which has only one hydrogenation geometry. The band gaps of hydrogenated graphyne can vary by ∼ 3 eV as the geometry changes. We also find that change in the hydrogen concentration allows a large band-gap tuning of ∼ 5 eV. Unlike hydrogenated graphene, in which H atoms show a tendency to cluster, H atoms tend to be dispersed in graphyne, making band-gap tuning feasible. These exotic properties in hydrogenated graphyne indicate that the band gap of hydrogenated graphyne can be tailored for new device applications. Furthermore, the composite of fully hydrogenated graphyne is C 1 H 1. 75, which has a <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> greater than that of graphane (C 1 H 1).

Such properties are currently being exploited {{for a wide range}} of engineering applications including magnetic hard disks, gears, sliding and roller bearings, scratch resistant glasses, biomedical implants, etc. Systematic studies on carbon-based materials in our laboratory have led to the development of a new class of amorphous DLC films that provide extremely low friction and wear coefficients of 0. 001 to 0. 005 and 10 {sup - 11 } to 10 {sup - 10 } mm{sup 3 } /N. m, respectively, when tested in inert-gas or high-vacuum environments. These films were produced in highly hydrogenated gas discharge plasmas by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process at room temperature. The carbon source gases used in the deposition of these films included methane, acetylene, and ethylene. Tribological studies in our laboratory have established a very close correlation between the composition of the plasmas and the friction and wear coefficients of the resultant DLC films. Specifically, the friction and wear coefficients of DLC films grown in plasmas with higher <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratios</b> were much lower than films derived from source gases with lower <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratios.</b> Fundamental tribological and surface analytical studies have led us to conclude that hydrogen (within the film, as well as on the sliding surfaces) is extremely important for the superlubricity and wearless sliding behavior of these films.

The film was grown on steel and sapphire substrates in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition system that uses using a hydrogen-rich plasma.

These fuels {{not only}} reduce reliance on conventional petroleum-based fuels as the primary propulsion source, but also offer promise for environmental sustainability. While these alternative fuels meet the aviation fuels standards and their overall properties resemble those of the conventional fuel, {{they are expected to}} demonstrate different exhaust emissions characteristics because of the inherent variations in their chemical composition resulting from the variations involved in the processing of these fuels. This paper presents the results of back-to-back comparison of emissions characterization tests that were performed using three alternative aviation fuels in a GE CF- 700 - 2 D- 2 engine core. The fuels used were an unblended synthetic kerosene fuel with aromatics (SKA), an unblended Fischer Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (SPK) and a semi-synthetic 50 - 50 blend of Jet A- 1 and hydroprocessed SPK.

40|$|The {{structural}} transformations {{that occur}} in diamondlike carbon coatings with increasing hydrogen content have been investigated by Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and electron-energy-loss spectroscopy. Friction tests were performed with uncoated steel balls against coated substrates at contact stresses of 1 GPa in ambient air (relative humidity = 30 - 40 %), dry air (relative humidity < 1 %), and dry nitrogen (< 1 %). The lowest friction coefficient (f < 0. 02) was obtained for the most hydrogenated sample in dry nitrogen, where {{the formation of a}} third-body layer was observed on the steel surface. Raman spectra obtained from the counterfaces after sliding in humid and dry air revealed a remarkable increase and narrowing of the ''D'' and ''G'' peaks with decreasing humidity.

40|$|A 4 -cylinder Ford 2701 C test {{engine was}} used in this study to explore the impact of ethanol {{fumigation}} on gaseous and particle emission concentrations. The fumigation technique delivered vaporised ethanol into the intake manifold of the engine, using an injector, a pump and pressure regulator, a heat exchanger for vaporising ethanol and a separate fuel tank and lines. Gaseous (Nitric oxide (NO), Carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC)) and particulate emissions (particle mass (PM 2. 5) and particle number) testing was conducted at intermediate speed (1700 rpm) using 4 load settings with ethanol substitution percentages ranging from 10 - 40 % (by energy). With ethanol fumigation, NO and PM 2. 5 emissions were reduced, whereas CO and HC emissions increased considerably and particle number emissions increased at most test settings. It was found that ethanol fumigation reduced the excess air factor for the engine and this led to increased emissions of CO and HC, but decreased emissions of NO. PM 2. 5 emissions were reduced with ethanol fumigation, as ethanol has a very low “sooting” tendency. This is due to the higher <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> of this fuel, and also because ethanol does not contain aromatics, both of which are known soot precursors. The use of a diesel oxidation catalyst (as an after-treatment device) is recommended to achieve a reduction in the four pollutants that are currently regulated for compression ignition engines. The increase in particle number emissions with ethanol fumigation was due to the formation of volatile (organic) particles; consequently, using a diesel oxidation catalyst will also assist in reducing particle number emissions...|$|E

Large volumes of off-balance ores are an additional source of production raw materials, however, {{there is still a}} problem of their treatment by effective complex methods. This work shows a possibility of using liquid hydrocarbons as the reducers during thermochemical preparation of brown iron concentrates of the Lisakovsky field to metallurgical conversion and studies the features and main regularities of a roasting process of Lisakovsky gravitymagnetic concentrate in the presence of liquid hydrocarbons. The initial concentrate was treated by solution of a liquid hydrocarbon reducer (oil: phenyl hydride: water), which was subjected to heat treatment with the subsequent magnetic dressing. Research by the X-ray phase analysis of reducing products has shown that the main phases of magnetic fraction of a roasted product are presented by magnetite in a small amount hematite and quartz. Generally, only relative intensity of peaks is changed. The thermodynamic analysis of interaction between the hydrocarbons, which are a part of oil, and iron oxides was carried out. This analysis allowed us to suppose a reducing mechanism for the brown iron ores by liquid reducers. The data obtained by the thermodynamic analysis are confirmed by experimental results. It is proved that with increasing <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> the probability of proceeding reactions of interaction between oxide of iron (III) and liquid hydrocarbon increases. The differential and thermal analysis allowed us to study a heat treatment process of the Lisakovsky gravity-magnetic concentrate, which is pre-treated by oil solutions, as well as to show a possibility for proceeding the process of interaction between liquid hydrocarbon and ferriferous products of Lisakovsky gravity-magnetic concentrate.

40|$|The volatilities of {{different}} chemical species in ambient aerosols are important but remain poorly characterized. The coupling of a recently developed rapid temperature-stepping thermodenuder (TD, operated {{in the range}} 54 – 230 &deg;C) with a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) during field studies in two polluted megacities has enabled the first direct characterization of chemically-resolved urban particle volatility. Measurements in Riverside, CA and Mexico City are generally consistent and show ambient nitrate as having the highest volatility of any AMS aerosol species while sulfate showed the lowest volatility. Total organic aerosol (OA) showed volatility intermediate between nitrate and sulfate, with an evaporation rate of 0. 6 % K&minus; 1 near ambient temperature, although OA dominates the residual species at the highest temperatures. Different types of OA were characterized with marker ions, diurnal cycles, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) and show significant differences in volatility. Reduced hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA, a surrogate for primary OA, POA), oxygenated OA (OOA, a surrogate for secondary OA, SOA), and biomass-burning OA (BBOA) separated with PMF were all determined to be semi-volatile. The most aged OOA- 1 and its dominant ion, CO 2 +, consistently exhibited the lowest volatility, with HOA, BBOA, and associated ions for each among the highest. The similar or higher volatility of HOA/POA compared to OOA/SOA contradicts the current representations of OA volatility in most atmospheric models and {{has important implications for}} aerosol growth and lifetime. Our results strongly imply that all OA types should be considered semivolatile in models. The study in Riverside identified organosulfur species (e. g.

40|$|The US Department of Energy has {{formulated}} various sets {{of gasoline}} fuels, called fuels for advanced combustion engines (FACE), which are consistent in composition and properties. The analysis of heating and evaporation of FACE A gasoline fuel (paraffin-rich) is studied by replacing the 66 components with 19 components to represent this fuel. The {{reduction in the}} number of components is based on merging components from the same chemical groups and having the same chemical formula, which have very close thermophysical properties; the components with the highest initial compositions are chosen to be the representative components. Modelling of heating and evaporation of FACE A gasoline fuel and various surrogates is carried out based on the effective thermal conductivity/effective diffusivity model (ETC/ED). The model takes into account the effect of finite liquid thermal conductivity, finite liquid mass diffusivity and recirculation inside the droplets due to their non-zero velocities relative to the ambient air. Four surrogates of FACE A found in the literature are used in the analysis. These surrogates include the five component surrogate chosen for its ability to match the ignition delay time of the FACE A gasoline fuel (Surr 1), the primary reference fuel surrogate (PRF 84) that matches the research octane number (RON) of FACE A, the one that matches <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> (H/C), RON, density and distillation curve with FACE A (Surr 2), and the one that matches the RON based on mole fraction linear blending (Surr 3). It is shown that these surrogates cannot predict adequately the time evolution of surface temperatures and radii of FACE A droplets. New „physical‟ surrogates with 8, 7 and 6 components (Surr 4, Surr 5, and Surr 6) are introduced to match the evaporation characteristics of FACE A. It is found that Surr 5 (7 components surrogate) can predict droplet lifetime and time evolution of surface temperature of a FACE A droplet with errors of up to 5 % and 0. 25 %, respectively. Also, the results show that the H/C, molecular weight and RON of the new surrogates are reasonably close to those of FACE A.

40|$|We {{performed}} a systematic intercomparison {{study of the}} chemistry and yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) generated from OH oxidation of {{a common set of}} gas-phase precursors in a Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM) continuous flow reactor and several environmental chambers. In the flow reactor, SOA precursors were oxidized using OH concentrations ranging from 2. 0 × 10 8 to 2. 2 × 10 10 molec cm − 3 over exposure times of 100 s. In the environmental chambers, precursors were oxidized using OH concentrations ranging from 2 × 10 6 to 2 × 10 7 molec cm − 3 over exposure times of several hours. The OH concentration in the chamber experiments is close to that found in the atmosphere, but the integrated OH exposure in the flow reactor can simulate atmospheric exposure times of multiple days compared to chamber exposure times of only a day or so. In most cases, for a specific SOA type the most-oxidized chamber SOA and the least-oxidized flow reactor SOA have similar mass spectra, oxygen-to-carbon and <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratios,</b> and carbon oxidation states at integrated OH exposures between approximately 1 × 10 11 and 2 × 10 11 molec cm − 3 s, or about 1 – 2 days of equivalent atmospheric oxidation. This observation suggests that in the range of available OH exposure overlap for the flow reactor and chambers, SOA elemental composition as measured by an aerosol mass spectrometer is similar whether the precursor is exposed to low OH concentrations over long exposure times or high OH concentrations over short exposure times. This similarity in turn suggests that both in the flow reactor and in chambers, SOA chemical composition at low OH exposure is governed primarily by gas-phase OH oxidation of the precursors rather than heterogeneous oxidation of the condensed particles. In general, SOA yields measured in the flow reactor are lower than measured in chambers for the range of equivalent OH exposures that can be measured in both the flow reactor and chambers. The influence of sulfate seed particles on isoprene SOA yield measurements was examined in the flow reactor. The studies show that seed particles increase the yield of SOA produced in flow reactors by a factor of 3 to 5 and may also account in part for higher SOA yields obtained in the chambers, where seed particles are routinely used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Laboratory chamber data {{serve as}} the basis for {{constraining}} models of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) for-mation. Current models fall into three categories: empiri-cal two-product (Odum), product-specific, and volatility ba-sis set. The product-specific and volatility basis set models are applied here to represent laboratory data on the ozonol-ysis of α-pinene under dry, dark, and low-NOx conditions in the presence of ammonium sulfate seed aerosol. Us-ing five major identified products, the model is fit to the chamber data. From the optimal fitting, SOA oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) and <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> (H/C) <b>ratios</b> are mod-eled. The discrepancy between measured H/C ratios and those based on the oxidation products used in the model fit-ting suggests the potential importance of particle-phase re-actions. Data fitting is also carried out using the volatility basis set, wherein oxidation products are parsed into volatil-ity bins. The product-specific model is most likely hindered by lack of explicit inclusion of particle-phase accretion com-pounds. While prospects for identification of the majority of SOA products for major volatile organic compounds (VOCs) classes remain promising, for the near future empirical prod-uct or volatility basis set models remain the approaches of choice. ...|$|R

FACE I {{is a low}} octane number gasoline fuel with research octane number (RON) of approximately 70. The detailed hydrocarbon analysis (DHA) of FACE I shows that it contains 33 components. This large number of components cannot be handled in fuel spray simulation where thousands of droplets are directly injected in combustion chamber. These droplets are to be heated, broken-up, collided and evaporated simultaneously. Heating and evaporation of single droplet FACE I fuel was investigated.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increasingly}} popular climate change debate worldwide, maritime transport is under pressure to create sustainable solutions for a cleaner future. One of these solutions is using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as ship fuel. LNG has a higher <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> compared with oil-based fuels, which results in lower specific CO 2 emissions (kg CO 2 /kg fuel). Other benefits of LNG are the total elimination of SOx emissions and particulate matter, and 85 - 90 % reductions in NOx emissions. DNV has estimated a net global warming benefit of 15 % {{with the use of}} LNG. However there is still a need to map the greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle of LNG. This thesis is a Screening Life Cycle Assessment of LNG as fuel, with the main objective to carry out a life cycle analysis of the process &# 147;Bunkering of LNG&# 148;. Screening is a simplified LCA which aims at identifying the important parts of a life cycle, or so-called hotspots. Bunkering of LNG and the bunkering facility have been chosen as the hotspots in this analysis for their uniqueness. The processes related to bunkering have not been analysed at this level of detail in published literature. The LCA software GaBi Educational has been used to implement the bunkering model and analyse the life cycle inventory results. Processes related to energy use, manufacturing and direct emissions were included in the GaBi model. The CML 2001 method was used to assess the Global Warming Potential (GWP). This is the main characterisation factor of the environmental issue climate change, which was in focus in this analysis. The impact assessment showed that emissions related to manufacturing are the greatest contributors to the GWP, with a total GWP of 75 917 [kg CO 2 -Equiv]. Energy use contributes the least, with only 0, 36 &# 137; of the total impact, which is considered negligible. Direct emissions stand for 7 777 [kg CO 2 -Equiv] and is the only area of the bunkering life cycle where emissions can be considerably reduced. In fact, all direct emissions can be omitted by the use of BOG recovery strategies, such as vapour return. The conclusion drawn is that the emissions associated with bunkering of LNG is perhaps not the main issue. A more pressing issue at the moment is the low fuelling possibilities for LNG. If LNG is to become the fuel of the future, fuelling must be made more accessible and available. </p...|$|E

The model {{is based upon the}} assumption of partial equilibrium in the post-flame zone while the fuel oxidation in the main reaction zone is allowed for by using a global oxidation rate equation. NO formation is assumed to be entirely via the Zeldovitch mechanism and to start in the post-flame zone. The utility of the model is judged through comparison between theoretical results and experimental data. On the experimental side, a simple burner system, supporting a one-dimensional premixed flame was designed and built. All fuels selected for investigation were pure hydrocarbons representing the main hydrocarbon types usually found in practical fuels; namely paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics. The <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> <b>ratio</b> ranged from 1 to 2. 67 and the carbon number from 3 to 12. The experiments were performed at 1, 2 and 3 atm pressure levels and 140 °C inlet temperature, while the equivalence ratio was in the range 0. 6 to 0. 9. Flames were sampled for most stable species by a water- cooled stainless steel sampling probe. The experimental results show that the fuel structure signifi- cantly affects CO time-histories in the investigated flames mainly through influencing its generation rather than its burnout. CO burnout is shown to be mainly controlled by radical recombination processes, and the experimentally derived CO global oxidation rate equations are found not to be universally applicable. The results also show that the fuel structure influences prompt NOx formation within, and very near, the main reaction zone but that it does not influence post-equilibrium NOx formation if account is taken of differences in the flame temperatures. N 02 is found to constitute a large percentage of total NOx measured especially at lower temperature and equivalence ratios. Comparison between experimental and theoretical results show that the prescribed kinetic model can satisfactorily predict CO levels for different fuels and under different conditions if the fuel oxidation global rate equation is correctly defined for different fuels. On the other hand, agreement between predicted and measured NO profiles has been obtained at atmospheric pressure only. At high pressure, the predicted levels were much smaller than those measured experimentally, and this disagreement is attributed to the fact that proper account is not taken of the NO and N 02 formation kinetics in the main reaction zone...|$|E
40|$|The water-gas shift (WGS) {{is one of}} {{the major}} steps for H 2 prodn. from gaseous, liq. and solid hydrocarbons. It is used to produce {{hydrogen}} for ammonia synthesis, to adjust the <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> monoxide <b>ratio</b> of synthesis gas, to detoxify gases. The WGS reactor is widely used as a part of fuel processors which produce hydrogen-rich stream from hydrocarbon-based fuels in a multi-step process. The WGS unit is placed downstream the fuel reformer in order to increase overall efficiency of hydrogen prodn. and to lower CO content in reformate. Fuel processors stand for considerable option for fuelling PEM fuel cells for both portable and stationary applications. Micro-structured reactors are used with benefits of process miniaturization, intensification and higher heat and mass transfer rates compared with conventional reactors. Micro-structured reactor systems are essential for processes where potential for considerable heat transfer exists as well as for kinetic studies of highly exothermic reactions at near-isothermal conditions. Modeling and simulation of a microchannel reactor for the WGS reaction is presented. The math. models concern a single reaction channel with porous layer of catalyst deposited on the metallic wall of the microstructure unit. Simplified one-phase and more sophisticated two-phase models, with sep. mass and energy balances for gas and solid phase at different levels of complexity, were developed. The models were implemented into gPROMS process modeling software. The models were used for an estn. of parameters in a kinetic expression using exptl. data obtained with a new WGS catalyst. The simulations provide detailed information about the compn. and temp. distribution in gas phase and solid catalyst inside the channel...|$|R
40|$|Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and {{oxidized}} primary organic aerosol (OPOA) {{were produced}} in laboratory experiments from the oxidation of fourteen precursors representing atmospherically relevant biogenic and anthropogenic sources. The SOA and OPOA particles were generated via controlled exposure of precursors to OH radicals and/or O 3 in a Potential Aerosol Mass (PAM) flow reactor over timescales equivalent to 1 – 20 days of atmospheric aging. Aerosol mass spectra of SOA and OPOA were measured with an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). The fraction of AMS signal at m/z = 43 and m/z = 44 (f 43, f 44), the <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> (H/C) <b>ratio,</b> and the oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) {{ratio of the}} SOA and OPOA were obtained, which are commonly used to characterize the level of oxidation of oxygenated organic aerosol (OOA). The results show that PAM-generated SOA and OPOA can reproduce and extend the observed f 44 – f 43 composition beyond that of ambient OOA as measured by an AMS. Van Krevelen diagrams showing H/C ratio {{as a function of}} O/C ratio suggest an oxidation mechanism involving formation of carboxylic acids concurrent with fragmentation of carbon-carbon bonds. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of PAM-generated SOA and OPOA was measured as a function of OH exposure and characterized as a function of O/C ratio. CCN activity of the SOA and OPOA, which was characterized {{in the form of the}} hygroscopicity parameter κ org, ranged from 8. 4 × 10 − 4 to 0. 28 over measured O/C ratios ranging from 0. 05 to 1. 42. This range of κ org and O/C ratio is significantly wider than has been previously obtained. To first order, the κ org -to-O/C relationship is well represented by a linear function of the form κ org = (0. 18 ± 0. 04) ×O/C + 0. 03, suggesting that a simple, semi-empirical parameterization of OOA hygroscopicity and oxidation level can be defined for use in chemistry and climate models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEnergy {{production}} from renewable feedstocks that would simultaneously solve ecological {{problems related to}} waste disposals would be very attractive. The present work is aimed at showing that atmospheric pressure thermal cracking of waste cooking oil in presence of steam would be a potential option, particularly when the operating conditions direct the process either towards steam cracking or towards steam reforming {{in order to produce}} specific target bio-energy vectors: hydrogen, synthesis gas, or gaseous fuel. A commercial crude waste cooking oil (VEG) was selected as feed material. Using a bench-scale continuous flow tubular stainless steel reactor, experiments were conducted to study the final product distribution as function of temperature, residence time of the feed material, extent of dilution, addition of a cracking initiator, and addition of a surface catalytic effect inhibitor. Several operating conditions of the VEG thermal cracking in presence of steam were identified to meet the above mentioned objectives. Particularly, when operating steam reforming at 800 °C with a very low steam-to-carbon ratio (less than 1), VEG was totally converted into synthesis gas in a <b>hydrogen-to-carbon</b> monoxide molar <b>ratio</b> close to 2 (favorable for low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch catalysis), with additionally hydrogen and light hydrocarbons (methane, ethylene, propylene) production reaching respectively 40 and 27 mol%. Further investigations (conducted with the same equipment) confirmed the occurrence of strong reactor wall effects that {{led to the formation of}} coke deposits with catalytic activity during the VEG steam cracking and steam reforming...|$|R
