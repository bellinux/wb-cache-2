5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the smaller end of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of <b>drivers</b> <b>in</b> a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
