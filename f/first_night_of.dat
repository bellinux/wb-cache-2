5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> the battle, the {{garrison}} at Malakand North {{had not seen}} much action despite being in the more exposed position, and {{had spent much of}} the night firing flares and manoeuvring artillery units.

Subsequently, he was eventually ordered to collect his forces and stores from Malakand North, and transfer them into the southern camp.|$|E

His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.|$|E

5|$|After Arias' {{death in}} 1988, Endara became a leading {{opponent}} of the Manuel Noriega military dictatorship, heading the opposition coalition in the 1989 presidential election. Though his coalition was judged by international observers as having defeated pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque, the results were annulled by the government, and Endara and his running mates were attacked in the streets by the paramilitary Dignity Battalions. The assaults received widespread coverage in international media, helping to build support within the U.S. for military action against Noriega. Seven months later, the United States invaded Panama, and swore in Endara as the new president on the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> the invasion on a U.S. military base.|$|E

On the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of}} the march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E

5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> The Seagull, at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as {{the play}} was booed by the audience, {{stinging}} Chekhov into renouncing the theatre. But the play so impressed the theatre director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko that he convinced his colleague Konstantin Stanislavski to direct a new production for the innovative Moscow Art Theatre in 1898. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting. The Art Theatre commissioned more plays from Chekhov and the following year staged Uncle Vanya, which Chekhov had completed in 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
5|$|The week-long holiday of Passover in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives, travelling, and on the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> Passover, the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during Passover. This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes Passover food in Israel today.|$|E

5|$|A {{possible}} {{legend of}} Prince Vladimir was recorded by Branislav Nušić in the 19th {{century in the}} city of Korçë, southeastern Albania, close to Macedonia. Ruins on top of a hill above Korçë were said to be remains of the court of a Latin (Catholic) king, whose kingdom neighbored the state of an Orthodox emperor. The king asked the hand of the emperor's daughter, who agreed to become his wife only if he built an Orthodox church. He did so, and she married him, but on the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> marriage she killed him. She then became a nun, and the king's body was taken somewhere—he was not buried near his court. Macedonian Slavs inhabiting Saint Achillius Island in the Small Prespa Lake in Greece told of an emperor named Mirče. He lived on their island, where he was killed by a cousin of his out of jealousy, and his body was taken via Ohrid to Albania.|$|E

5|$|Józef {{received}} a milder sentence: five years' exile in Siberia, first at Kirensk on the Lena River, then at Tunka. While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski {{was held for}} several weeks at a prison in Irkutsk. There he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt: {{after one of the}} inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance; Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident. For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment. He had to spend the <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.|$|E
5|$|Meluha is a near perfect empire, created {{many centuries}} earlier by Lord Ram, {{one of the}} {{greatest}} kings that ever lived. However, the once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe crisis as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis who have joined forces with the Nagas, a cursed race with physical deformities. The present king of Meluha, Daksha, sends his emissaries to North India in Tibet, to invite the tribes that live there to Meluha. One of those invited are the Gunas, whose chief Shiva is a brave warrior and protector. Shiva accepts the proposal and moves to Meluha with his tribe. They reach the city of Srinagar and are received there by Ayurvati, the Chief of Medicine of the Meluhans. Shiva and his tribe are impressed with the Meluhan way of life. On their <b>first</b> <b>night</b> <b>of</b> stay at Srinagar, the Gunas wake up amid high fever and sweating. The Meluhans, under Ayurvati's orders, carry on the healing process. However, Ayurvati finds out that Shiva is the only one devoid of these symptoms and that his throat has turned blue. The Meluhans announce Shiva as the Neelkanth, their fabled saviour.|$|E
5|$|On 2 March, a 15-second {{television}} ad aired during Saturday Night Live (SNL) depicting an animated, stylized {{version of}} the band's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets.
