40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{phenomenon}} of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Terrorist</b> <b>Fighters</b> from Europe and sheds light on the position of institutional Islam towards this security threat. The article first looks at how the new trends characterizing the profile and recruitment process of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Terrorist</b> <b>Fighters</b> represent new challenges for counterterrorism, before considering the position of selected Muslim institutions in Europe. The analysis considers two case studies, namely France and Great Britain. Two organizations are used as examples for institutional Islam: the Union of Islamic Organization (UOIF) in France and the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). The research results reveal a communication centered on the objective of distinguishing Islam from Daesh and a predominant focus on domestic issues such as counterterrorism legislation and general social cohesion...|$|R
40|$|Lying {{behind the}} recent Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 is the {{phenomenon}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> which has sparked international and national attention. The 2015 Act deals with many facets of counter terrorism legislation, but its two principal measures are singled out for analysis and critique in this paper. Thus, Part I of the Act seeks to interdict <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> by preventing suspects from travelling and dealing decisively with those already in the UK who pose a risk. Part V of the Act implements the second, broader aspect, of legislative policy, reflecting the UN emphasis on ‘Countering Violent Extremism’, through the statutory elaboration and enforcement of the ‘Prevent’ element of the long-established Countering International Terrorism strategy, which aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting violent extremism. These measures are explained in their policy contexts and set against criteria of effectiveness, personal freedom, and accountability...|$|R

40|$|Thousands of <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> {{poured into}} the Middle East from almost every country across the globe. Radicalized by professionally edited videos and {{propaganda}} disseminated through the Internet, {{people from all walks}} of life were captivated by the Islamic State 2 ̆ 7 s rhetoric, and nations were struggling to figure out how to stop them. One solution came in the form of a United Nations Security Council Resolution- Resolution 2178 (2014). This resolution is directed specifically at <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> and calls upon all Member States to act with haste to address this new phenomenon. Critics were quick to call into question the language of Resolution 2178, however, with some claiming that it had the potential to give credibility to disastrous human rights violations by oppressive governments. This note examines those critiques and suggests that the actual problems of Resolution 2178 lie not in its potential for abuse but in the failure of states to implement its dictates-stemming from a lack of both political will and capability. As a potential solution, this note suggests that states should focus their efforts on one specific directive of Resolution 2178, countering and preventing violent extremism...|$|R

40|$|From Al-Qaeda to Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), {{and now the}} Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the {{so-called}} Islamic State (IS), hijra (Arabic for emigration), has been exploited by these groups to justify their call ­for Muslims {{all over the world}} to emigrate to Dār al-Islām or abode of Islam. Historically and in the Islamic context, hijra refers to the earlier generation of Muslims who left Mecca for Abyssinia as well as Prophet Muhammad’s emigration to Medina. This paper focuses on the notion of hijra as interpreted by ISIS to draw Muslims to Iraq and Syria to strengthen its rank and file. It argues that the modern jihadists’ interpretation of hijra is a misrepresentation of the two earlier emigrations. More importantly, it fails to satisfy the Maqāṣid Ash-Sharīʿah or the objectives of Sharīʿah law. This paper will make a critical analysis of the concept of hijra from the perspective of Maqāṣid Ash-Sharīʿah, and offer an ideological rebuttal strategy to counter ISIS’s call for hijra. It will also attempt to address the ideological flaws in the call which <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> (or FTF) are unaware of...|$|R
40|$|Indonesia, as {{signatory}} and co-sponsor of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2170, {{has committed}} to suppressing the flow of <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> (FTFs), along with financing and other support, for Islamist extremist groups operating in Iraq and Syria – in particular the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham (ISIS). Varying levels of support for ISIS have been observed in Indonesia, including displays of ISIS paraphernalia, support rallies, swearing of allegiance to the caliphate and an uncertain number of individuals travelling to the region to fight. Recognising the risk posed by support for ISIS and returning FTFs, the Indonesian government announced a 2 ̆ 7 ban 2 ̆ 7 on the terrorist organisation in 2014. However, doubt remains {{with regard to the}} legal and practical enforcement of the 2 ̆ 7 ban 2 ̆ 7 by Indonesian police and actions they are able to take against ISIS 2 ̆ 7 s Indonesian supporters. While there have been calls for the government to enact a new law or revise existing laws to specifically address ISIS and its supporters in Indonesia, it is uncertain if or when such a law could be finalised and passed. Accordingly, this article examines the legal position as it exists under current Indonesian law with respect to preventing and punishing supporters of ISIS...|$|R
40|$|Volume XXV of the Italian Yearbook of International Law {{opens with}} pieces {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} Professor Conforti and Professor Ferrari Bravo, two founding members of the Board of Editors of the IYIL who passed away in early 2016. There follows a Focus section devoted to a number of international and European legal issues raised by the ongoing migratory crisis. It discusses inter alia the fight against migrant smuggling under UN Security Council resolution 2240 (2015), amendment proposals to the 1951 Refugees Convention, the implications for international responsibility of the EU’s hotspot approach to managing migration, and the protection of EU citizens victims of human trafficking in Europe. The section on Notes and Comments contains a variety of timely contributions, including on the regime governing wrecks of State-owned ships, on the legal framework to counter <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters,</b> and on the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The section on Practice of International Courts and Tribunals offers an analytical overview of the 2015 activities of the ICJ, the ITLOS and other law of the sea jurisdictions, international and mixed criminal courts and tribunals, the WTO, and ICSID.

40|$|Western democracies are {{currently}} facing a terrorist threat which comes mainly {{from their own}} Salafist-jihadi supporting citizens. In evaluating the threat there is at present a particular focus on nationals who have travelled abroad to support ISIS, or similar groups, and may return (often referred to as "foreign terrorist fighters"), especially given that ISIS-held territory {{is likely to continue}} to shrink in 2017 and beyond. Exploration of measures to combat this threat is ongoing in a number of democracies, and in the United Kingdom led to the introduction in 2015 of temporary exclusion orders (TEOs), under the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. The thinking behind TEOs bears some conceptual resemblance to that behind measures introduced in the United Kingdom and other democracies to strip dual national suspects of citizenship, and even—in terms of seeking to place TEO-subjects outside the United Kingdom’s ECHR jurisdictional responsibility—to that underlying the creation of CIA "dark sites". The orders represent the latest manifestation of liberty-invading non-trial-based executive measures introduced post- 9 / 11 in the United Kingdom; therefore, as would be expected, they are in tension with domestic and international human rights law. This article will argue that the basis put to Parliament by the government for creating a reconciliation between such law and reliance on the orders is flawed, which may partly explain the marked reluctance to deploy them in practice, {{even in the face of}} the currently increased threat from returnee <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters.</b> It will therefore consider the relevance, if any, of TEOs to that threat and their role in the global struggle against terrorism. It will question why, against the backdrop of the current, increasing ISIS-linked threat, the United Kingdom has saddled itself with another counterterrorism power that appears to sit on the books and perform no clear role, another power owing more to counter-terror rhetoric than to enhancing security...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} Indonesia’s state {{responses to}} terrorism {{and provides a}} critical analysis of the major legislative instruments for prosecuting and eradicating the crime of terrorism – most notably, Law No. 15 of 2003 the ‘ATL’ – enacted {{in the aftermath of}} coordinated bomb attacks which killed hundreds of civilians, both local residents and foreign tourists, on the island of Bali in October, 2002. In providing context to the enactment of the law, the thesis takes account of the complex socio-political factors existing during the early part of Indonesia’s transition from authoritarian regime to democracy – a period known as reformasi – which contributed indirectly to a major resurgence of jihadist terrorism. The thesis also gives attention to tracing the historical trajectory of Islamist groups which have perpetrated religiously inspired violence in Indonesia for almost two centuries – and which have continued to operate in various forms since 2002 – adapting their strategies to evade infiltration by police. While pre-reformasi governmental responses, both colonial and post independence, were primarily military in nature, the thesis shows that two major events, the fall of Soeharto and the Bali bombing of 2002, provided a catalyst for a complete transformation of Indonesian state responses to terrorism. This transformation included the enactment of specific antiterrorism legislation and the subsequent creation of dedicated counter-terrorism bodies such as Densus 88 and the National Counter-terrorism Agency. It also opened Indonesia’s foreign policy and allowed unprecedented levels of cooperation and funding from international allies in counter-terrorism. This transformation led to a criminal law-based approach to terrorism, as distinct from a military insurgency approach, which has led to the prosecution, arrest and execution of hundreds of terrorist suspects and has garnered much international praise for Indonesian authorities due to their ostensible successes in counter-terrorism. However, closer examination of the provisions of Indonesia’s legislation and its application by police, prosecutors and the courts indicates a number of serious flaws. The ‘definition’ of terrorism contained in Indonesia’s ATL is out of step with international norms and its politically-influenced application has led to illogical and inconsistent prosecutorial and sentencing outcomes. Calls to revise terrorism laws to close loopholes and address new developments such as the rise of ISIS have gone unheeded, leaving enforcement authorities in a compromised position. The thesis accounts for the latest phase of terrorist activity in Indonesia, the growth of support for ISIS from 2014, and the legal position relating to <b>Foreign</b> <b>Terrorist</b> <b>Fighters</b> and Indonesia’s commitments under international law and concludes with a number of recommendations to enhance Indonesia’s counter-terrorism regime...|$|R
40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of Western females travelling to Syria and Iraq in support of ISIS. Introduction Although often assumed to be passive agents, women have played significant roles {{in a number of}} contemporary terrorist organizations. Violent extremist groups across the political and ideological spectrum have utilised female forces for a range of activities including logistics, recruitment, political safeguarding, operations, suicide bombing and combat. However, the recent unprecedented surge in female recruits to the terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIS) has brought this phenomenon into sharp focus. For many there remain misperceptions and misunderstandings concerning the role women play within these violent networks, often paired with engendered responses to the radicalisation of women. By analysing how terrorist organisations choose to utilise women, we are able to better understand the decision-making processes of terrorists and the inner-workings of the organization itself. The number of Western foreign fighters and migrants to ISIS is estimated to be up to 4, 000, with over 550 women within this figure. This unprecedented number of Western male <b>foreign</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>fighters</b> is paralleled by an equally unprecedented number of women traveling to support ISIS. Questions are now being posed as to how and why females are being recruited en masse, what role they play for ISIS, and what tools will best work to counter this new threat. Yet very little work has been done to not only answer these questions but to build sustainable preventative measures. This report attempts to shed light on these questions as the second publication within ISD’s Women and Extremism (WaE) programme. The first WaE report, Becoming Mulan? Female Western Migrants to ISIS, addressed some of the reasons for Western females traveling to ISIS-territory and exposed key elements of the reality for females upon arrival ISIS-controlled territory. This report aims to expand upon previous research by giving depth to understanding who is being radicalized, why these women decide to depart for Syria and how we can better stop these processes. There are three primary sections to this report. The first maps the primary push and pull factors which prime women and lead them down a path of violent radicalisation to the point at which they decide they must make hijra (migrate) to join ISIS. These factors disprove the one-dimensional label for these women, who are often referred to simply as ‘jihadi brides’. The second section of this report gives indepth profiles of 7 English-speaking females who have successfully journeyed to join ISIS and are now resident in the so-called Islamic State. These profiles show the diversity among female recruits and expose everything from their driving motivations, worldviews and subsequent roles under ISIS control. The final section of this report looks at counter-extremism work in the space of prevention and de-radicalisation, showing how various Western governments are operating within this space and analysing where better infrastructure is needed to address the topic of gender within processes of radicalisation...|$|R
