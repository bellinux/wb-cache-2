5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the <b>Educational</b> <b>Testing</b> Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS hired and trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Placement {{program has}} offered {{students}} the opportunity to pursue college-level courses while in high school. Along with the <b>Educational</b> <b>Testing</b> Service, the College Board administered the first AP Statistics exam in May 1997. The course was first taught to students in the 1996-1997 academic year. Prior to that, the only mathematics courses offered in the AP program included AP Calculus AB and BC. Students who didn't have a strong background in college-level math, however, found the AP Calculus program inaccessible and sometimes declined to take a math course in their senior year. Since the number of students required to take statistics in college is almost as large as the number of students required to take calculus, the College Board decided to add an introductory statistics course to the AP program. Since the prerequisites for such a program doesn't require mathematical concepts beyond those typically taught in a second-year algebra course, the AP program's math offerings became accessible to a much wider audience of high school students. The AP Statistics program addressed a practical need as well, since the number of students enrolling in majors that use statistics has grown. A total of 7,667 students took the exam during the first administration, which is the highest number of students to take an AP exam in its first year. Since then, the number of students taking the exam rapidly grew to 98,033 in 2007, {{making it one of the}} 10 largest AP exams.|$|E

One of the major goals of education that emerged from the evaluation of education during the 1980 s and 1990 s was the development of higher-level thinking skills for students at all levels of education. This study investigated {{the extent to which the}} major seven general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> for grades 4 and 6 measure each of the higher-level thinking skills. Bloom's Taxonomy was used to define the thinking skills because of its acceptance in the field of education, the empirical support in the literature of its communicability, and the general support in the literature on its cumulative hierarchy. The seven general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> selected were the major instruments used throughout the United States to assess student attainment of educational goals. Content analysis methodology was used to determine the level of thinking required for each test item on the seven general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests.</b> Frequencies and percentages of test items for each level of Bloom's Taxonomy by general <b>educational</b> progress <b>test</b> were calculated. An analysis of the findings of the study provided the basis for three conclusions. First, general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> do not measure higher-level thinking skills. Second, general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> do not reflect the increased complexity of students' cognitive development. Third, the mathematics subtest, concept/application, measures more high-level thinking than the other subtests. Because the general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> focused on lower-level thinking, educators should not allow general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> to drive the curriculum and instructional program taught in the classroom. Results from general <b>educational</b> progress <b>tests</b> should form only part of the picture when evaluating student achievement and curricular goals. Other means need to be developed to assess higher-level thinking skills...|$|R

Cotton's admission was contingent on earning a qualifying score on the SAT, which he had not received in two attempts. On his third try, he scored 900, which surpassed the NCAA minimum of 700 for incoming freshman, but the NCAA invalidated his score. Cotton had been diagnosed with a learning disability, auditory learning, in which he comprehended better by listening than by seeing. The <b>Educational</b> <b>Testing</b> Service (ETS), which publishes and oversees the SAT, confirmed the diagnosis, and allowed him to take the test with extra time and larger font text. The NCAA, however, had stricter criteria than the ETS, and disagreed that he was entitled to take the non-standard test. Cotton denied any wrongdoing, and felt he was being targeted by the NCAA. Earlier, the NCAA had investigated a Ford sport-utility vehicle driven by Cotton, which they suspected was provided to him as an incentive to sign with UCLA. However, the NCAA absolved him of violating his amateur status based on documents provided by his parents.|$|E
25|$|The SAT rose in {{prominence}} after World War II due {{to several}} factors. Machine-based scoring of multiple-choice tests taken by pencil {{had made it}} possible to rapidly process the exams. The G.I. Bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education. The formation of the <b>Educational</b> <b>Testing</b> Service (ETS) also {{played a significant role in}} the expansion of the SAT beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the College Board at the time. The ETS was formed in 1947 by the College Board, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and the American Council on Education, to consolidate respectively the operations of the SAT, the GRE, and the achievement tests developed by Ben Wood for use with Conant's scholarship exams. The new organization was to be philosophically grounded in the concepts of open-minded, scientific research in testing with no doctrine to sell and with an eye toward public service. The ETS was chartered after the death of Brigham, who had opposed the creation of such an entity. Brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing. It has been argued that the interest of the ETS in expanding the SAT in order to support its operations aligned with the desire of public college and university faculties to have smaller, diversified, and more academic student bodies as a means to increase research activities. In 1951, about 80,000 SATs were taken; in 1961, about 800,000; and by 1971, about 1.5 million SATs were being taken each year.|$|E
