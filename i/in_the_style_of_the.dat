Despite the fact that the McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were better on the Canadian set up.|$|E
5|$|Even {{following}} the conversion to cylindrical smokeboxes, {{it was still}} possible to distinguish some non-streamliners from ex-streamliners. On the former (Nos. 46230-46234 and 46249-46252, but not 46253-46257) the running plates veered downwards {{at right angles to}} connect with the buffer beam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Princess Royal Class. The ex-streamliners did not have any such connection, except No.46242 City of Glasgow which was rebuilt in 1952 following a serious collision.|$|E

A difference in soil types over {{the length of}} the vineyard is often reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> wines, which can be either more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Morey-Saint-Denis wine or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Chambolle-Musigny wine, meaning lighter and more elegant.|$|R
5000|$|Tom Lehrer {{recorded}} {{a set of}} variations on the song on his live album An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer, demonstrating his theory that [...] "folk songs are so atrocious because they were written by the people." [...] He plays <b>the</b> first verse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Cole Porter, <b>the</b> second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> [...] "Mozart or one of that crowd", <b>the</b> third <b>in</b> a disjointed jazz sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Thelonious Monk, and <b>the</b> final verse <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|R

5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated objects were a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, {{which suggests that the}} Heilongjiang hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|E
5|$|After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm {{became the}} first duke of Urach. A passionate {{artillery}} officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls. From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin {{the beauty of the}} castle.|$|E

5|$|An artist from Pennsylvania recreated {{the upper}} outside panels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carousels {{of the period}} {{around the time of}} World War I. The carvings on the panels were {{provided}} by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; the mirrors were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery panels were initially some discovered Dentzel company panels, and these were used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style panels were built in the museum's shops.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built {{as far away}} as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from {{as far away as}} Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|During the {{turbulent}} {{era of the}} Civil Wars and the incorporation of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr, Perth and Leith, and 20 smaller forts were built as far apart as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. The universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. After the Restoration in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in Classicism.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{first took}} place in a {{storeroom}} in the industrial district of Shanghai. Having difficulties scouting a cotton factory suitable for shooting, set designers decided to recreate one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. They spent weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory, a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen (played in the film by Simon Yam) during the Sino-Japanese War. It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.|$|E
5|$|Maitland's 1st Foot Guards, who had {{defeated}} the Chasseurs of the Guard, {{were thought to}} have {{defeated the}} Grenadiers, although they had only faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard. They were nevertheless awarded the title of Grenadier Guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Grenadiers. Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts. The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the Imperial Guard lancers.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 2015, {{following}} years {{of criticism from}} the fans over {{the design of the}} 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older, circular variants. A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against Sunderland.|$|E

UTV Ignition Entertainment's business development director Shane Bettenhausen refused to answer these rumors, but noted fans asked more often about Mai's absence. None of them {{made it into the}} game which caused discontent within gamers. In an official press releases by Atlus regarding The King of Fighters XIII, it was stated that K's return was because of popular demand. His return along with his two teammates, Maxima and Kula, as well as Mai, has been met with praise by video game publications.|$|E
5|$|Progress on {{the section}} from Paddington to Queen's Park was slowed by {{the start of}} World War I, so the line was not {{finished}} until early 1915. As at Paddington, the three below-ground stations were built to use escalators. Maida Vale and Kilburn Park were provided with buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Leslie Green stations but without the upper storey, which was no longer required for housing lift gear. Warwick Avenue was accessed from a subway under the street. The LNWR rebuilt Queen's Park station with additional platforms for the Bakerloo Tube's and its own electric services and constructed two train sheds for rolling stock, one each side of the station.|$|E
5|$|Seven more towers {{were built}} between 1637 and 1638. These were {{much smaller than}} the Wignacourt towers, as they were built as watchtowers and a {{communication}} link to warn the Order's base in the Grand Harbour of an attack. In 1647, Saint Agatha's Tower was built in Mellieħa. This was a large tower intended as a strongpoint, and was built <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wignacourt towers. Two more towers were built at Dwejra and Xlendi on Gozo in 1650 and 1652. The ten towers built between 1637 and 1652 are collectively known as the Lascaris towers after the Grand Master who built them, and nine of them survive to this day.|$|E

5|$|Sinification of the Yue and Dian tribes {{was brought}} about by a {{combination}} of Han imperial military power, regular Han Chinese settlement and an influx of Han Chinese refugees. The military invasions and an influx Han Chinese immigrants created a culture that merged Han Chinese traditions with indigenous elements. Archaeological digs in the area reveal the extent of Han Chinese influence. Han dynasty tombs in Guangzhou, Guangdong show that the native tools and ceramics were gradually replaced by those modeled after Chinese styles by the Western Han. Excavations from the period have uncovered bronze mirrors, stoves, wells, incense burners, tripods, and lanterns manufactured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Han.|$|E
5|$|The Italian Constitution {{does not}} make {{provision}} for a Vice-President.

Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001; a tricolour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidential standard, it is emblazoned with the Cypher of Honour of the President of the Republic.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors {{to the design of}} George Washington University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E
