500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance that you should be laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ecclesiastes {{has had a}} deep {{influence}} on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, and was quoted by Abraham Lincoln addressing Congress in 1862. American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: [...] "f all I have ever seen or learned, that book {{seems to me the}} noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth—and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Napoleonic war epic Scuola d'eroi (1914), Menichelli had a cameo as {{a drummer}} girl. Legend {{has it that}} her {{performance}} struck Giovanni Pastrone, the director of Cabiria, who cut a frame from the film reel and ordered that the unknown actress be brought to Itala Films of Turin. However, reviews of her last films at Cines [...] suggest that Menichelli was well {{on her way to}} film stardom before her move to Itala Films. Menichelli had graduated to starring roles in feature films, and her performances were generally positively reviewed, earning her favourable comparisons with Lyda Borelli and Francesca Bertini, the two most famous Italian film actresses of the time. One reviewer noted Menichelli's, [...] "uncommon talent," [...] in Alla Deriva (1915). Commenting on La casa di nessuno (1915), another reviewer remarked, [...] "The public like Menichelli, and that's enough. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I like her too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{reference}} to the numerical [...] "12th Man" [...] term occurred at the 1922 Dixie Classic, featuring Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A). During the game, A coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. [...] Coach Bible remembered that E. King Gill, an individual who had tried out for the squad but who [...] "lacked the experience and ability {{to play for the}} varsity" [...] had made the trip {{as a member of the}} school's Corps of Cadets and was sitting with his friends in the stands. [...] Bible sent for Gill and asked for him to suit up and be ready if needed. Gill later said, [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play was noted.|$|E

It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as [...] "eat, drink and be merry," [...] "nothing new under the sun," [...] "a time to be born and a time to die," [...] and [...] "vanity of vanities; all is vanity." [...] Abraham Lincoln quoted Ecclesiastes 1:4 in his address to the reconvening Congress on December 1, 1862, during the darkest hours of the American Civil War: [...] "'One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.'...Our strife pertains to ourselves—to the passing generations of men; and it can without convulsion be hushed forever {{with the passing of}} one generation."

2500|$|The {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic.
