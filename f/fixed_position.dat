5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a <b>fixed</b> <b>position</b> – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a <b>fixed</b> <b>position</b> promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes {{in the basement and}} instead placed the camera in a <b>fixed</b> <b>position.</b> In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare. Gun armament consisted of two M2 Browning machine guns, one mounted in a <b>fixed</b> <b>position</b> firing forwards through the propeller using synchronizer gear, while the other was in a flexible position in the observer's cockpit for rear defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure oxidizer turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a <b>fixed</b> <b>position</b> by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a <b>fixed</b> <b>position,</b> Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a wound to the head, and Dennis by a severe wound to the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E

5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in <b>fixed</b> <b>position</b> on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Ban Pa Dong {{was fought}} between 31 January and 6 June 1961 in Ban Pa Dong, the Kingdom of Laos.

Although the Hmong made the tactical error of defending a <b>fixed</b> <b>position,</b> their eventual {{escape from the}} communist invaders left their fledgling L'Armee Clandestine intact and able to wage war for the Royal Lao Government. However, they abandoned four howitzers and two mortars to the victorious Vietnamese communists.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether transactions where the buyer (or seller) always moves {{first and the}} seller (or buyer) always moves second in the exchange give higher payoffs than transactions {{in which it is}} randomly determined who moves first. We examine the effect of two treatment variables: partners versus strangers, and <b>fixed</b> versus changing <b>positions.</b> We find that both with fixed and with changing positions, second movers take advantage of their position by exploiting the first mover. But with <b>fixed</b> <b>positions,</b> exploitation occurs significantly less, while reciprocal exchanges happen more often. However, <b>fixed</b> <b>positions</b> result in very unevenly distributed payoffs. ...|$|R
