5|$|He {{played in}} only one match against England at Lord's, where <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> after scoring one run. Despite {{dropping}} England captain Michael Vaughan from the bowling of Anil Kumble, he eventually stumped Vaughan down the legside and took another catch. He played another match in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy against Kenya, taking three catches as India persisted with Dravid's wicket-keeping {{for the majority of}} the English tour. Karthik was not required to bat as India only lost four wickets in their innings. He was subsequently replaced in the ODI team by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who took over the gloves from Dravid on a full-time basis; Karthik did not play another ODI until April 2006.|$|E
5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; as soon as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, but by the time <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that they made it the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E

25|$|Members of Moro's escort, {{who were}} not in service {{on the day of}} the kidnap, {{declared}} in September 1978 that Moro was a habitual person, and that every day <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> from his house exactly at 09:00 AM.

25|$|The hard hitting {{ability and}} match winning {{performances}} in the Zimbabwe series gained {{him a lot of}} attraction to include him to the Twenty20 International series against Sri Lanka in July 2015.

25|$|Tendulkar was {{dismissed}} seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that {{he struggles to}} cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings. Tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career. In a five-ODI series against Pakistan, he was caught by Kamran Akmal off the bowling of Umar Gul for 99 in the second match at Mohali, and in the fourth match of that series, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from Gul on to his stumps.|$|E
