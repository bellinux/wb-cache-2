It is endemic to the reed beds in and around Lac Alaotra, in {{northeast}} Madagascar. It is about 40 cm long, with a similar length tail, and is a brownish-gray colour. It is the only bamboo lemur to live in and feed on papyrus reeds, and other reeds and grasses, and some authorities argue that it should be regarded as a subspecies of the eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus). The population of this lemur has been declining because of habitat destruction and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|R

50|$|Endemic species {{include a}} number of birds, {{reptiles}} and mammals including the Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur alaotrensis) and {{a number of}} shrews, tenrecs, and rodents. The subhumid forests were formerly home to the island's distinct megafauna, including giant lemurs, some of them larger than modern gorillas, the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae), and giant tortoises.|$|R
5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last {{less than three weeks}} each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, as well as the high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|R
50|$|The fertile plain {{surrounding}} Lake Alaotra is Madagascar's {{most important}} rice-producing region. The hills surrounding the lake were formerly forested, but have mostly been cleared for farmland in past decades. Severe erosion on these vulnerable hill slopes has caused considerable sedimentation of the lake, which is fast disappearing; {{the lake is}} now only 60 cm deep during the dry season. Pressure to create more rice fields has also led locals to burn the reedbeds surrounding the lake. These reedbeds provide the sole habitat of the endemic Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis). The Alaotra <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> is now limited to only 220 km2 of remaining reedbeds, and in recent years, its population rapidly declined by 60%, from about 7,500 individuals in 1994 to 3,000 in 2001, mostly from habitat loss, but also from hunting by local villagers.|$|R

50|$|Bamboo lemurs prefer damp forests where bamboo grows. Although {{they can}} be active {{any time of the}} day, they are often active just after dawn.

50|$|The eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus), {{also known}} as the gray bamboo lemur and the gray <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> is a small lemur endemic to Madagascar, with three known subspecies.

50|$|The eastern lesser bamboo lemur (Hapalemur griseus griseus), {{also known}} as the gray bamboo lemur, eastern gray bamboo <b>lemur,</b> or gray <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur,</b> was the {{original}} species described in 1795 by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link. It is grey in colour, sometimes with a red patch on its head. It averages 284 mm in length with a tail of 37 mm. Based on data from more than one hundred transect surveys which took place between 2004 and 2009, the population is estimated to be declining. There is an estimated 818 individuals in Ranomafana National Park and the decline in numbers is due to hunting and habitat loss.

It has greyish brown fur and white ear tufts, and has a head-body length of around one and a half feet, or forty to fifty centimeters. They have {{relatively}} long tails and long back legs for leaping vertically amongst the trees of their forest habitat [...] It feeds almost exclusively on the bamboo species of Cathariostachys madagascariensis, preferring the shoots but also eating the pith and leaves. It is unknown how their metabolism deals with the cyanide found in the shoots. The typical daily dose would be enough to kill humans. Greater bamboo lemurs occasionally consume fungi, flowers, and fruit. Its only confirmed predator is the fossa, but raptors are also suspected. Its current range is restricted to southeastern Madagascar, although fossils indicate its former range extended across bigger areas of the island, including as far north as Ankarana. Some notable parts of the current range are the Ranomafana and Andringitra National Parks.|$|R
40|$|Although {{monitoring}} is {{an essential}} tool for biodiversity conservation, monitoring programmes are often poorly designed and thus unlikely to produce results that are meaningful for management. Monitoring is especially challenging when dealing with rare and elusive species in areas where conservation resources are particularly limited. In such cases, monitoring techniques aimed at estimating occupancy represent an attractive alternative to traditional methods concerned with estimating population size, as the collection of detection/non-detection data is in general less costly and easier to implement. In this study, we evaluated the use of occupancy as a state variable for the monitoring of the Alaotran <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> Hapalemur alaotrensis, a Critically Endangered primate exclusively inhabiting the dense marshes around Lake Alaotra in Madagascar. We used a likelihood-based modelling approach that explicitly accounts for detectability. This showed that the probability of detection of H. alaotrensis was extremely low and depended on site characteristics that can vary in space and time, confirming the need to account for imperfect detection when monitoring this species. We used our models to explore factors affecting the probability of occupancy and detection to identify management implications, and also developed recommendations for the ongoing monitoring of this species.

40|$|The Alaotran <b>gentle</b> <b>lemur</b> Hapalemur alaotrensis is a Critically Endangered lemur, which {{exclusively}} inhabits {{the marshes}} around Lac Alaotra in northeast Madagascar. In the past decades {{the population of}} H. alaotrensis has experienced a dramatic decline due to poaching, habitat destruction and degradation. Surveys {{have been carried out}} periodically to follow the status of the population. Here we present the results of a survey carried out between May and June 2008 in the southwestern part of the marshes around Alaotra and discuss the key findings derived from the analysis of the data collected. Our study indicates that the probability of detecting the species in an area where it is present is very low and depends on factors that vary in space and time. These results stress the need to account for imperfect detection when monitoring this species, an issue especially relevant when reporting population trends. Our analyses also show that habitat fragmentation is a key determinant of habitat suitability for H. alaotrensis, with fragmented areas of marsh showing low suitability. Finally, our observations and analysis suggest that the protection provided by the local community to H. alaotrensis in Andreba is contributing to the conservation of this Critically Endangered species. This highlights the need to continue working on engaging the local communities in the conservation of the marshes at Lac Alaotra as a critical element to secure the future of H. alaotrensis...|$|R
