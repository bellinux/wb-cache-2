25|$|The {{calculator}} {{was successful}} and {{was followed by}} several improved models. The MITS 1440 calculator was featured in the July 1973 issues of Radio-Electronics. It had a 14-digit <b>display,</b> <b>memory,</b> and square root function. The kit sold for $200 and the assembled version was $250. MITS later developed a programmer unit that would connect to the 816 or 1440 calculator and allow programs of up to 256 steps.|$|E
25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video <b>display</b> <b>memory.</b> As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or video memory space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.|$|E
2500|$|Modes 0 to 6 (the 'ASCII' modes) could {{display colours}} from a logical palette of sixteen: the eight basic colours at the {{vertices}} of the RGB colour cube and eight flashing colours made by alternating the basic colour with its inverse. [...] The palette could be freely reprogrammed without touching <b>display</b> <b>memory.</b> Modes 3 and 6 were special text-only modes that used less RAM {{by reducing the}} number of text rows and inserting blank scan lines below each row. Mode 6 was the smallest, allocating 8 KB as video memory. Modes 0 to 6 could show diacritics and other user defined characters. All modes except 7 supported bitmapped graphics, but graphics commands such as DRAW and PLOT had no effect in the text-only modes.|$|E

40|$|The {{dielectric}} susceptibility of {{the molecular}} liquid sorbitol below its calorimetric glass transition <b>displays</b> <b>memory</b> strikingly {{similar to that}} of a variety of glassy materials. During a temporary stop in cooling, the susceptibility changes with time, and upon reheating the susceptibility retraces these changes. To investigate the out-of-equilibrium state of the liquid as it <b>displays</b> this <b>memory,</b> the heating stage of this cycle is interrupted and the subsequent aging characterized. At temperatures above that of the original cooling stop, the liquid enters a state on heating with an effective age that is proportional to the duration of the stop, while at lower temperatures no effective age can be assigned and subtler behavior emerges. These results, which reveal differences with <b>memory</b> <b>displayed</b> by spin glasses, are discussed {{in the context of the}} liquid's energy landscape. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures.
