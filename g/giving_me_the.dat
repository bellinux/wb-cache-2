500|$|For me, in my {{mind the}} {{accomplishment}} is just that much sweeter. In terms of my ethnicity, always feeling like an outsider, always feeling different ... for me it's about saying, 'Thank you Lord, for <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> faith to believe in myself when other people had written me off.' I've gone through enough of my life worrying {{about that kind of}} thing. I want to encourage anyone else out there who feels like maybe they can't overcome an obstacle, I feel like I'm living proof ... never lose your faith. I'm seriously a grateful individual right now.|$|E
500|$|García Márquez {{received}} the Nobel Prize in Literature on 8 December 1982 [...] "for his novels and short stories, {{in which the}} fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts". [...] His acceptance speech was entitled [...] "The Solitude of Latin America". García Márquez was the first Colombian and fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature. After becoming a Nobel laureate, García Márquez stated to a correspondent: [...] "I have the impression that in <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> prize, they have taken into account {{the literature of the}} sub-continent and have awarded me as a way of awarding all of this literature".|$|E
500|$|The refrain (0:25) {{begins in}} the newly tonicized {{relative}} major G, which suggests III. Providing a backdrop to the Electro-Theremin is a cello and string bass playing a bowed tremolo triplet, a feature that was an exceedingly rare effect in pop music. The Fender bass is steady at one note per beat while tom drums and tambourine provide a backbeat. This time, the rhythm is stable, and is split into four 4-bar sections which gradually build its vocals. The first section consists of only the couplet [...] "I'm picking up good vibrations/she's <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> excitation" [...] sung by Mike Love in his bass register; the second repeats the lines and adds an [...] "ooo bop bop" [...] figure, sung in multiple-part harmony; the third time also adds a [...] "good, good, good, good vibrations" [...] in yet a higher harmony. This type of polyphony (counterpoint) is also rare in contemporary popular styles. [...] Each repeat of the vocal lines also transposes up by a whole step, ascending from G to A and then B. It then returns to the verse, thus making a perfect cadence back into E minor. [...] The verse and chorus then repeat without any changes to the patterns of its instrumentation and harmony. This is unusual, in that normally, a song's arrangement adds something once it reaches the second verse.|$|E

2500|$|From {{an early}} age, José showed a {{precocious}} intellect. He learned the alphabet {{from his mother}} at 3, and could read and write at age 5. Upon enrolling at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, {{on the advice of}} his brother, Paciano and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as [...] "José Protasio Rizal". Of this, he later wrote: [...] "My family never paid much attention , but now I had to use it, thus <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> appearance of an illegitimate child!" [...] This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests Mariano Gomez, Jose Burgos and Jacinto Zamora (popularly known as Gomburza) who had been accused and executed for treason.|$|E

Matlock with 858 men organized and by night I would have had 1000. [...] I am proud to be relieved of the command and also proud of the success I have had over here in raising troops.

2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and when I looked up Harbahjan was right in my face <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference.

[...] He stated the win would put Techeetah's personnel in a positive state of mind {{and that they would}} return for the following the season as a stronger force in the series. Rosenqvist revealed that Bird was his main rival over the race weekend and that his focus was to secure third place in the Drivers' Championship. Nevertheless, he was delighted to finish in the top three driver's standings in his maiden Formula E season, [...] "I think it speaks volumes about the kind of effort we have made as a team. Big, warm thanks to Mahindra Racing for putting their trust in me and for <b>giving</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> tools to achieve this.” Third-place finisher López spoke of his pleasure finishing in the position following his first race retirement, [...] "I could tell straightaway what a difference the team had made to the car since my last race and it was frustrating our qualifying group meant we were unable to show this. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the race and of course the whole season, as well as working with the DS Virgin Racing team.” ...|$|E
