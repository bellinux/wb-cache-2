40|$|Industry Structure Lubricants 2 ̆ 7 {{base oil}} {{production}} is virtually controlled by five, vertically integrated, multi-national companies. Their market shares are {{large enough to}} permit strong influence over the entire industry and to render competition ineffective. It {{will be difficult for}} new firms to enter the lubricant 2 ̆ 7 s industry and compete successfully with these entrenched firms. The lubricants market is large. The market is dominated by petroleum based, mineral oil products. Projected market growth is minimal, and worldwide supply is ample. Growing environmental awareness and the prospect of stringent regulations regarding petroleum products use have spurred renewed interest in the manufacture of vegetable oil based lubricants. Product performance will likely be more critical to success than competitive price. Markets that offer significant potential include those where state regulations mandate biodegradable lubricant use or in industries that seek avoid costly remedial clean ups. Environmental Threats or Opportunities There is no universally accepted definition for environmentally acceptable lubricants, but the American Society for Testing Materials has formed a subcommittee to establish standards. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that our nation 2 ̆ 7 s remaining water quality problems are largely attributable to pollution from nonpoint sources. The EPA is stepping up efforts to reclassify nonpoint sources as point sources to subject former nonpoint sources to regulation liability. Public perception of ground water contaminants has been the catalyst to stimulate reclassification. Hence, in many applications a readily biodegradable and nontoxic lubricant is preferable to current options especially where the product is introduced into nature. Lacking federal government mandated change, any firm producing an environmentally superior lubricant faces several realities. First, the product must perform as well as or better than existing lubricants. Second, success may be most easily achieved by marketing products in states that have already regulated lubricants. And finally, because the global market for environmentally friendly products is still heating up, the odds for a 2 ̆ 2 green 2 ̆ 2 product 2 ̆ 7 s success are very good. The <b>Drip</b> <b>Oil</b> Market If 100 percent of petroleum based <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> was displaced by soyoil, 1. 68 to 2. 36 million bushels of soybeans would be consumed to produce <b>drip</b> <b>oil.</b> A more realistic forecast by one of the big five lubricant firms is sales of 2. 5 million gallons for all biodegradable lubricants by 1995. National introduction of biodegradable lubricants is feasible for one of the industry 2 ̆ 7 s dominant firms, but for smaller firms, niche markets and regional introduction would be more manageable and enhance the chances for success. <b>Drip</b> <b>oil</b> is marketed as both a private branded <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> and a nationally branded lubricant used for <b>drip</b> <b>oil.</b> Consumers look for anti-wear additives, lubricity and viscosity additives and quality for the price. The <b>drip</b> <b>oil</b> market is composed of more buyers who purchase small quantities of product and fewer buyers who purchase large quantities of product. Therefore, profits will not be garnered by 2 ̆ 2 product turn 2 ̆ 2 generated by high volume, low priced sales, but by offering consumers enhanced product value through distribution, packaging and product performance. Firms who can deliver the above three criteria will find consumers willing to pay a premium price for their products...|$|R

25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured gas plants {{were in existence}} in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former town gas plants are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured gas plants (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or <b>drip</b> <b>oils,</b> as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{lubrication}} {{schedule was}} faithfully and conscientiously adhered to, the lubrication quality {{could be very}} good. Large marine engines and stationary engines to power whole factories were likeliest to get such top-quality care. But locomotives, rail cars, agricultural implements, and automobiles were less certain of good care, and lubrication quality without constant lubing tended to be intermittent, from mediocre to bad. Attempts to improve on the simple oil hole concept included putting a small reservoir of oil above the hole, which slowly <b>dripped</b> <b>oil</b> into it.

50|$|Drag {{reducing}} agents can be broadly classified {{under the}} following four categories - Polymers, Solid-particle suspensions, Biological additives, and Surfactants. These agents are made out of high molecular weight polymers or micellar systems. The polymers help with drag reduction by decreasing turbulence in the <b>oil</b> <b>lines.</b> This allows for oil to be pumped through at lower pressures, saving energy and money. Although these drag reducing agents are mostly used in <b>oil</b> <b>lines,</b> there is research being done to see how helpful polymers could be in reducing drag in veins and arteries.|$|R

5000|$|The first Motorwagen {{used the}} Benz 954 cc single-cylinder {{four-stroke}} engine with trembler coil ignition. This new engine produced [...] at 250 rpm in the Patent-Motorwagen, although later tests by the University of Mannheim {{showed it to}} be capable of [...] at 400 rpm. It was an extremely light engine for the time, weighing about 100 kg. Although its open crankcase and <b>drip</b> <b>oiling</b> system would be alien to a modern mechanic, its use of a pushrod-operated poppet valve for exhaust would be quite familiar. A large horizontal flywheel stabilized the single-cylinder engine's power output. An evaporative carburettor was controlled by a sleeve valve to regulate power and engine speed. The first model of the Motorwagen had not been built with a carburetor, rather a basin of fuel soaked fibers that supplied fuel to the cylinder by evaporation.|$|R
