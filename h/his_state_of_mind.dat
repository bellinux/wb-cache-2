The prosecuting counsel, Allan Green, arguing that Nilsen was sane, in full control of his actions and had killed with premeditation; the defence counsel, Ivan Lawrence, arguing that Nilsen {{suffered}} from diminished responsibility, rendering him incapable of forming the actual intention to commit murder, and should therefore be convicted of manslaughter as opposed to murder.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1918 Mannock {{was sent}} to England on leave. He {{travelled}} to Birmingham to visit his mother. The visit {{was not an easy}} one as she had become an alcoholic. On this visit family friends reported on <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Mannock broke down on one occasion and seemed full of nervous tension. This was possibly due to combat fatigue. Commander Caldwell noted Mannock never took time off unless it was officially scheduled leave and he never reported sick, but saw not signs that Mannock was about to crack-up. Mannock also did not want a command and preferred to remain on operations with 74 Squadron. As a senior flight commander Mannock never showed weakness in front of his men.|$|E

25|$|Sanity is a rebuttable {{presumption}} and {{the burden of}} proof is on the party denying it; the standard of proof is on a balance of probabilities, that is to say that mental incapacity is more likely than not. If this burden is successfully discharged, the party relying upon it is entitled to succeed. In Lord Denning's judgement in Bratty v Attorney-General for Northern Ireland 1963 AC 386, whenever the defendant makes an issue of <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> the prosecution can adduce evidence of insanity. However, this will normally only arise to negate the defence case when automatism or diminished responsibility is in issue. In practical terms, the defence {{will be more likely to}} raise the issue of mental incapacity to negate or minimise criminal liability. In R v Clarke 1972 1 All E R 219 a defendant charged with a shoplifting claimed she had no mens rea because she had absent-mindedly walked out of the shop without paying because she suffered from depression. When the prosecution attempted to adduce evidence that this constituted insanity within the Rules, she changed her plea to guilty, but on appeal the Court ruled that she had been merely denying mens rea rather than raising a defence under the Rules and her conviction was quashed. The general rule was stated that the Rules apply only to cases in which the defect of reason is substantial.|$|E
25|$|Charles Louis made {{a number}} of {{administrative}} and financial reforms that were popular. Between 1824 and 1829, some measures were taken relating to duties; to a certain freedom of trade; tax cuts, at the Land Registry. He gave especial encouragement to education and medicine, favoring the establishment of schools. These reforms were implemented thanks to the initiative of his Minister Mansi during the duke's absence. Charles disappointed his subjects who had hoped for a return to the constitution of 1805 and the hopes of Liberals in his duchy shifted to his only son and heir. He tried to copy in Lucca things he saw made abroad regardless if the conditions in the duchy were favorable. His love for traveling created many difficulties in governing and he often signed decrees according to <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> at the moment without any real knowledge of the issues. The actual power rested in his minister Mansi. It was said that while Charles Louis was the Duke, Mansi was king. Aware that Lucca was headed to be annexed by Tuscany, Mansi aligned his policies with those of Florence, which was resented by Charles Louis. However his weakness and his restless character did not allow Charles to escape the oppressive relations of protection and control exerted upon Lucca by the courts of Austria, Tuscany and Modena. He was viewed with suspicion by both Louis Philippe of France and Metternich.|$|E

Politically, Ochs described himself as a [...] "left social democrat" [...] who became an [...] "early revolutionary" [...] after the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to a police riot, which had a profound effect on <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Spy Who Loved Me {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1961, and was the {{shortest}} manuscript Fleming had produced for a novel, being only 113 pages long. Fleming found the book the easiest for him to write, and apologised to his editor at Jonathan Cape for the ease. The Spy Who Loved Me {{has been described by}} Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett as Fleming's [...] "most sleazy and violent story ever", which may have been indicative of <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over {{a span of}} approximately three weeks from September to October 2008. Recording sessions took place at Glenwood Studios in Burbank, California and at Avex Recording Studio in Honolulu, Hawaii. [...] As implied by its title, 808s & Heartbreak prominently features the Roland TR-808 drum machine. Drawing inspiration from 1980s synthpop and electropop performers such as Phil Collins, Gary Numan, TJ Swan and Boy George, West felt that the 808 is a resourceful instrument {{that can be used}} to evoke emotion; the concept was introduced to him by Jon Brion. West utilized the sounds created by the 808 and manipulated its pitch to produce a distorted, electronic sound, an effect he referred to as [...] "heartbreak". He felt the characteristic of the sound was representative of <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> According to West, the fact that Hawaii's area code was [...] "808" [...] was coincidental, as he had already developed the album's title before being informed. The realization inspired him to pursue his direction with the album, however. In terms of musical direction, West's intentions, according to Mike Dean, were to go against the typical sound of hip hop beat, instead evoking the presence of tribal drums. Overall, West maintained a [...] "minimal but functional" [...] approach towards the album's studio production.|$|E

500|$|In the anime {{adaptation}} of Rurouni Kenshin, Watsuki's designs were {{combined with the}} voice talents of voice actress Mayo Suzukaze. She said that she started feeling like Kenshin after years of work as his voice, but says that providing the voice for his character {{was one of her}} best experiences. In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters considered following suit, with Mona Marshall considered a finalist to voice Kenshin. Richard Hayworth was eventually selected for the role, giving Kenshin's character a more masculine voice in the English adaptation. Marshall was also selected to voice the younger Kenshin during flashback scenes. Clark Cheng, Media Blasters dub script writer, said that localizing Kenshin's unusual speech was a difficult process. His use of de gozaru and oro were not only character trademarks that indicated <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> but important elements to the story. However, neither is directly translatable into English, and in the end the company chose to replace de gozaru with [...] "that I did," [...] "that I am," [...] or [...] "that I do." [...] Kenshin's signature oro was replaced with [...] "huah" [...] to simulate a [...] "funny sound" [...] that had no real meaning. Daryl Surat of Otaku USA said that the grammar in Kenshin's dialogue in the Media Blasters dub and subtitles resemble the grammar in the dialogue of Yoda, a character in Star Wars.|$|E

2500|$|Russell had {{admitted}} to that during his appeal, {{but he and}} his lawyers argued that the entrapment defense should focus entirely on what the federal operatives did and not <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> They asked the Court to overrule two previous cases that had established this [...] "subjective" [...] test in favor of the [...] "objective" [...] one they advocated. It declined to do so. But Justice William Rehnquist pondered the possibility that what has become known as [...] "outrageous government conduct" [...] might force a judicial hand in an entrapment case regardless of any specific rights that had been or not been violated. While he backed away from it in a later opinion, his words have become a rallying point for advocates of the objective entrapment standard.|$|E
2500|$|About THH himself {{we have a}} more {{complete}} record. As a young apprentice to a physician, {{he was taken to}} watch a post-mortem dissection. Afterwards he sank into a 'deep lethargy' and though he ascribed this to dissection poisoning, Cyril Bibby [...] and others have suggested that emotional shock precipitated a clinical depression. The next episode we know of in his life was on the third voyage of HMS Rattlesnake in 1848. This voyage was mostly to New Guinea and the NE Australian coast, including the Great Barrier Reef, which is a kind of wonderland for any zoologist, especially a young man hoping to make his career. The story is clear from the diary Huxley kept: p112 'little interest in the Barrier Reef'; p116 'two entries in seven weeks'; p117 '3 months passed and no journal' p124 'the black months of struggle and depression'. For him to pass up such a golden opportunity speaks of <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

Gurlitt's cousin, Uta Werner, filed a claim of inheritance on the artwork. Werner's lawyer, Wolfgang Seybold, argued that Gurlitt's relatives were the righful heirs. Seybold supported his argument with the opinion of psychiatrist and lawyer Helmut Hausner, who stated that Gurlitt suffered from schizoid personality disorder, delusions, and dementia when he wrote the will bequeathing his collection to the museum. It is possible that a number of artworks will be returned to Gurlitt's estate, as he would have been considered the rightful owner unless the heirs of previous owners could prove that he obtained them through unlawful means. German authorities estimate that around 590 pieces need further investigation to determine whether they were confiscated under the Nazi regime, and a further 380 have been definitively identified as confiscated by the Nazis as [...] "degenerate art".|$|E
2500|$|Policewoman [...] Annie Norris (Gretchen Mol) — A uniformed policewoman with an {{undergraduate}} psychology education from Fordham University who has aspirations {{of making the}} detective squad, Norris constantly struggles against sexist attitudes {{about the role of}} a woman in police work.

After Sam's seemingly crazy prophecy results in him saving her life, Annie is less willing to simply dismiss his incredible stories. Annie fervently wishes to become a detective, like her comrades in the 125th; she is promoted to detective in the finale. Her BBC counterpart is WPC Annie Cartwright (Liz White).|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City {{staged a}} reconceived version, sung in Russian {{for the first}} time there. [...] Director Dmitri Tcherniakov and {{conductor}} Gianandrea Noseda removed most of the melodies contributed by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov, although they retained the composers' orchestrations. [...] They added many fragments by Borodin that Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov had omitted, basing their work on many decades of musicological research. [...] They rearranged the order in which some of the material appeared, in some cases taking account of notes left by Borodin. [...] The overall conception made the opera more of a psychological drama about Prince Igor and <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> given the deep depression he went into following his soldiers' loss to the Polovtsians. [...] The entire opera was reordered: after the prologue, in which the solar eclipse was taken as a bad omen, Act 1 presented a dream sequence dealing [...] with the relation of Igor and his son with the Polovtsian general and his daughter in the Polovtsian camp. The second act largely dealt with the antics of Prince Galitsky in Putivyl and ended with the destruction of the city. [...] The third act ended with Prince Igor coming out of his depression to begin the rebuilding of the destroyed city. This production starred Russian bass Ildar Abdrazakov in the title role with Ukrainian sopano Oksana Dyka as Yaroslavna. [...] The performances in New York included a worldwide HD broadcast.|$|E
