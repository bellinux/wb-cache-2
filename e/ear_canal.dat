5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> The tragus protrudes and partially obscures the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is called the concha. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Earwax {{is partly}} {{composed}} of sebum produced by glands in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> These secretions are viscous {{and have a}} high lipid content, which provides good lubrication.|$|E
5|$|The {{outer ear}} is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and the outer layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E

5000|$|...Letterer-Siwe is {{characterized}} by skin lesions, ear drainage, lymphadenopathy, osteolytic lesions, and hepatosplenomegaly. The skin lesions are scaly and may involve the scalp, <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> and abdomen.|$|R
5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on a summer day.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for any possible repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges {{on the inner}} surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and may be seen {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
50|$|Custom molded {{ear plugs}} are unique for each person, {{since they are}} cast from each user's own <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> Therefore, they provide a {{personalized}} fit for each individual.|$|R
50|$|Recurrent {{otitis media}} is common, and many {{patients}} required {{the placement of}} PE tubes. Small <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> are also fairly common, {{but not as much}} as in 18q-.|$|R
50|$|Unprotected {{exposure}} of <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> to {{cold water and}} wind after treatment can lead to regrowth of bone {{and the need for}} repeated operations on the same ear.|$|R
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. Otitis externa is an inflammation of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
5|$|The human ear {{consists}} of three parts—the outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> of the outer ear is separated from the air-filled tympanic cavity {{of the middle ear}} by the eardrum. The middle ear contains the three small bones—the ossicles—involved in the transmission of sound, and is connected to the throat at the nasopharynx, via the pharyngeal opening of the Eustachian tube. The inner ear contains the otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—and the semicircular canals belonging to the vestibular system, as well as the cochlea of the auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} {{hearing loss}} include an <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or holes in the eardrum. Conductive hearing loss may also result from middle ear inflammation causing fluid build-up in the normally air-filled space, such as by otitis media. Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E
25|$|Ear {{infections are}} common in dogs, {{particularly}} breeds with hanging ears, such as Beagles, and dogs with narrow <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> such as Cocker Spaniels. Other predisposing factors include allergies, ear parasites, and hypothyroidism.|$|R
5000|$|The {{superior}} vestibular nucleus, {{one of four}} vestibular nuclei, {{is located}} within the pons. The vestibular nuclei process information from the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> regarding the orientation and acceleration of the head. The remaining nuclei are located within the medulla.|$|R
50|$|Lyric {{was sold}} in 2010 to Sonova, {{the parent company of}} Phonak, a hearing aid (daily wear) manufacturer. Phonak {{launched}} {{a new version of the}} Lyric (Lyric 2) in 2012 that is smaller in order to fit more <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Ledward (Benjamin Rigby) is {{a member}} of the {{security}} unit aboard the Covenant. He {{is a member}} of the expedition tracking the signal leading to the crashed Engineer ship on the surface of the Engineer homeworld. Shortly after disembarking from the lander, Ledward is assigned by Lope to escort Karine Oram as she takes samples from the local ecosystem. Ledward excuses himself from his duties momentarily to smoke and urinate, during which time, he disturbs a mutated floral pod, causing airborne mutagen to enter his <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> His health immediately deteriorates and he is assisted to the lander by Karine. Inside the lander's medical bay, Faris locks Ledward and Karine in the room, where the first Neomorph bursts out of his spine, killing him.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of otitis externa in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
50|$|Combing of fur removes foxtails {{along with}} burrs and other detritus, but {{potentially}} {{the most dangerous}} foxtails are found in areas easily missed: the axillae, between the toes, and in nostrils and <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> Occasionally they can even lodge in the conjunctiva under the eyelid.|$|R
50|$|Dogs {{also have}} {{numerous}} apocrine glands in their external <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> In this location they {{are referred to}} as ceruminous glands. The <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> also have numerous sebaceous glands. Together these two sets of glands produce natural ear wax, or cerumen. Micro-organisms live naturally in this material and give the ears a characteristic slightly yeasty odor even when healthy. When infected, the ears can give off a strong disagreeable smell. It is not uncommon for a vet to sniff a dog's ears to try to detect any potential problem with bacterial or fungal infection. Some owners do this routinely if they have a dog susceptible to ear infections or if they have a breed with heavy, floppy ears which can hide early signs of inflammation.|$|R
40|$|By {{using an}} {{experimental}} setup yielding the acoustical Two-Port properties of earplugs. the attenuation of three fundamentally {{different types of}} earplugs is predicted. The setup used is based on molds of the <b>ear</b> <b>canals</b> of a real person, and the Two-Port of each earplug is numerically coupled to an acoustical model of the ear. The predicted attenuation is compared to the subjective attenuation (REAT) measured on the same person. For one type of earplug the results are modified {{to compensate for the}} lack of resilience in the artificial <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> The results of repeated measurements are encouraging. Not only does the objective method yield attenuation data similar to the REAT, it also seems to reflect some of the variations given by subjective measurements...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level with the eyes.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes are {{not readily}} prone to {{infestation}} with fleas. Species like Spilopsyllus cuniculi are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like Archaeopsylla erinacei are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include Pulex irritans, Ctenocephalides canis and Paraceras melis. Ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and I.hexagonus {{are not uncommon}} in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The louse Trichodectes vulpis specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The mite Sarcoptes scabiei {{is the most important}} cause of mange in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting {{from the base of the}} tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the epizootic phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include Demodex folliculorum, Notoderes, Otodectes cynotis (which is frequently found in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal),</b> Linguatula serrata (which infects the nasal passages) and ringworms.|$|E
25|$|Even without {{exposure}} to water, {{the use of}} objects such as cotton swabs or other small objects to clear the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is enough to cause breaks in the skin, and allow the condition to develop. Once {{the skin of the}} <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> is inflamed, external otitis can be drastically enhanced by either scratching the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> with an object, or by allowing water to remain in the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> for any prolonged length of time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{auditory}} {{system of}} a land mammal typically works via the transfer of sound waves through the <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b> <b>Ear</b> <b>canals</b> in seals, sea lions, and walruses {{are similar to those}} of land mammals and may function the same way. In whales and dolphins, it is not entirely clear how sound is propagated to the ear, but some studies strongly suggest that sound is channeled to the ear by tissues in the area of the lower jaw. One group of whales, the Odontocetes (toothed whales), use echolocation to determine the position of objects such as prey. The toothed whales are also unusual in that the ears are separated from the skull and placed well apart, which assists them with localizing sounds, an important element for echolocation.|$|R
25|$|A running gag in {{the film}} Hot Shots! and its sequel is Lloyd Bridges's character, Thomas 'Tug' Bensen, {{featuring}} various prosthetics that replace parts he had lost in earlier battles. These prosthetics include; ceramic eyes, asbestos skin, a magnetic skull plate, aluminum siding facial bones, and stainless steel <b>ear</b> <b>canals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specialized sweat glands, {{including}} the ceruminous glands, mammary glands, ciliary glands of the eyelids, and sweat glands {{of the nasal}} vestibulum, are modified apocrine glands. Ceruminous glands are near the <b>ear</b> <b>canals,</b> and produce cerumen (earwax) that mixes with the oil secreted from sebaceous glands. Mammary glands use apocrine secretion to produce milk.|$|R
25|$|Generic or custom-fitting <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> plugs {{are made}} from {{silicone}} rubber, elastomer, or foam. Custom in-ear headphones use castings of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> to create custom-molded plugs that provide added comfort and noise isolation.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{solutions}} for the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination. When the <b>ear</b> <b>canal</b> skin is inflamed from the acute otitis externa, the use of dilute acetic acid may be painful.|$|E
25|$|Otitis externa, {{also called}} swimmer's ear, is {{inflammation}} of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal.</b> It often presents with ear pain, swelling of the <b>ear</b> <b>canal,</b> and occasionally decreased hearing.
