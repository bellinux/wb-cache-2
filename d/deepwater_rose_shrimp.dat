40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of mesh configuration from diamond to square mesh on the size selectivity for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Parapenaeus longirostris and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus captured off the Portuguese south coast were evaluated. The results were analysed taking into account between-haul variation in selectivity, and indicate a significant increase in L- 50 for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> with an increase in mesh size or {{with the use of a}} square mesh cod end, while for Norway lobster only mesh configuration was found to affect this parameter. Two other important external variables were identified; the trawling depth and the cod end catch, which influence between-haul variation, by increasing the selection range for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> and Norway lobster, respectively. The results obtained suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 mm would be advisable for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> in order to respect the minimum landing size of 24 mm carapace length presently established for this species. Moreover, trawling for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> should be avoided at depths above 200 m, in order to avoid catches consisting almost exclusively of juveniles. Such an increase in mesh size would have a minor impact in terms of losses of individuals above the minimum landing size for Norway lobster and would contribute to reducing the amount of discards in this fishery.

40|$|A {{classification}} {{of the fishing}} activities based on the trips landing profiles was carried out using a method of non-hierarchical clustering, Partition Around Medoids. Two Portuguese fleets were investigated, the bottom-trawl and the purse-seine fleets, operating off the Portuguese continental coast in the period 2003 - 2005. In the bottom trawl group, two fleet components were analysed, one targeting finfish and the other directed at crustaceans. Finfish trawl trips produced three groups in 2003 and 2004, one directed at horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), a second one targeting octopus and squids and a third one directed at a mixture of species. In 2005 {{a new group of}} trips was detected targeting blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). In the case of the crustacean trawl trips, in 2004 - 2005, two trip types were identified, one group targeting <b>deepwater</b> <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Parapenaeus longirostris) and another directed at Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). In 2003, two groups were also detected, one directed at <b>deepwater</b> <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> and the other at a mixture of the two main crustacean species. The crustacean trips’ grouping reflects the interannual variation of the abundance of these two species. The analysis of the purse-seine trips produced four fishing activities that remained consistent over the period. Around 72 % of the trips were classified as targeting sardine (Sardina pilchardus). The other clusters were directed towards horse mackerel, Spanish mackerel (Scomber colias) and a mixture of small pelagic species...|$|E

Although circadian bias in the catch rates for this fishery has been reported, no conclusive study had been carried out until now. Catch per unit effort oscillated with {{the time of the}} day. Total catches, both in numbers and weight considerably higher in daytime than at night, suggesting that the 24 -hour light cycle strongly influences catchability of <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp,</b> shows a clear shift in abundance from daytime to night hours, with catches decreasing sharply at dusk and, then increasing significantly at dawn. Overall, the most captured fish species: european hake, Merluccius merluccius; monkfish, Lophius budegassa; european conger, Conger conger; and great forkbeard, Phycis blennoides; present the same trend, although less marked. The exceptions are: silver scabbardfish, Lepidopus caudatus; blue Whiting, Micromesistius poutassou; tongue sole, Symphurus nigrescens; atlantic mackarel Scomber scombrus and silver cod, Gadiculus argenteus; whose catches were higher in the night hours.

Modeling the zero and nonzero values by two joint processes, as we propose in this work, allows to obtain great flexibility and easily handling of complex likelihood functions, avoiding inaccurate statistical inferences due to misclassification of the high proportion of exact zeros in the model. Bayesian model estimation is obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, suitably specifying the complex likelihood function of the zero-inflated density data.

Carapace length (CL) of the female and male deep-water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> in Terrasini ranged from 9 to 32 mm and 13 to 26 mm, respectively, whereas in Porticello the length ranged from 8 to 31 mm and 13 to 26 mm, respectively. The Von Bertalanffy Growth Function parameters for Terrasini females and males were CL ∞ = 38. 5 mm, K = 0. 65 year− 1 and CL ∞ = 32. 5 mm, K = 0. 85 year− 1, respectively. For Porticello females and males, the parameters were CL ∞ = 40 mm, K = 0. 60 year− 1 and CL ∞ = 30 mm, K = 0. 76 year− 1, respectively.

40|$|Discarding in {{fisheries}} {{is believed}} to be a waste of natural resources, as it is the part of the total catch brought on board but then returned to the sea dead or alive for any reason. This study aims to advance knowledge of the discards associated with the deep water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> fisheries in the south-central Mediterranean Sea. We address this issue by examining the data collected within the module of commercial catch monitoring (Campbiol) of European data collection framework (DCF) between January 2009 and December 2013. Multivariate data analysis and the generalized additive model (GAMs) were used to assess the spatio-temporal composition of the discard and factors influencing its distribution. Overall, discard represented 32. 9 ± 15. 4 % of the total catch. Multiple analysis of variance highlighted the significant effect on discard assemblage only for the factor of depth (p-value < 0. 05). In general, bony fish were the most discarded organisms (23. 5 ± 14. 4 %). Cartilaginous fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates represented approximately 13 % of the total catch. The fraction of discard in the catch presented significant variation regarding the years, depth and fishing ground. Our results showed that most of the discards in the deep water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> (DPS) fisheries are due to species that have a minimum legal size (Hake, DPS, Trachurus spp.), and are consequently subjected to the discard ban (art. 15 of the reg.

40|$|By-catch and {{discards}} are {{a common}} problem to all fisheries. Recent studies of the Portuguese crustacean-trawl fishery show that discards average 70 % of the total catch. This situation poses a threat {{not only to the}} management of target and commercial fish by-catch species stocks, but also in terms of the ecosystem impact of the discarded species whose survival is generally low. Previous attempts to address this problem by using oblique separator mesh panels associated with square-mesh windows, or square-mesh windows alone, provided encouraging results, but these are unlikely to have commercial applicability at present. Therefore, we tested the efficiency of a modified Nordmore grid in excluding some of the most captured non-commercial by-catch species, such as the blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, and the boarfish, Capros aper, evaluating simultaneously the losses of the crustacean target species (<b>rose</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Parapenaeus longirostris, Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and red shrimp, Aristeus antennatus) and commercially valuable fish by-catch. A total of 41 valid hauls were carried out during 2001, and 15 in 2002 on board the R/V "Noruega". Results from both years varied considerably, with higher by-catch exclusion rates, in weight, registered in the second survey (73 - 74 and 48 - 63 % for blue whiting and boarfish, respectively). The corresponding percentage reduction for target species was 8 - 15 % for the Norway lobster, 4 - 9 % for <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> and 7 - 10 % for red shrimp. The level of exclusion of the non-commercial by-catch is encouraging, although short-term loss of Norway lobster, where the escapees comprised larger individuals, raises some concern with regards to fishers' acceptance of mandatory use of grids.

The influence of several environmental variables (sea surface temperature, wind-mixing index and NAO index) and fishing effort indices (number of days at sea per month and mean engine power of the trawl fleet) were investigated. The time series were analysed by means of min ⁄ max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA) and dynamic factor analysis (DFA). The abundance of P. longirostris showed a clear increasing trend, significantly correlated with the fishing effort index (number of days at sea per month), the sea surface temperature and the wind-mixing index. The temporal variations in the stock of P. longirostris, which has a preference for warm waters, were positively correlated {{with the rise of}} the sea surface temperature and the decrease of wind circulation.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} fishing {{activity}} and landings of the trawl and creel fisheries for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus (L.)) off the Portuguese coast, and evaluates the financial viability of two vessels typical of each fleet. Crustacean trawlers {{are part of}} an industrial fleet that, besides Nephrops, targets deep water shrimps. Creels are used by a multi-gear, multi-target artisanal fleet, fishing only in areas unavailable to trawlers and, when catching Nephrops, set specifically to target this species. Trawlers have in recent years contributed with 85 % of the landings in weight, but only 74 % in value (2005 - 2009 average). Despite smaller landings, the Nephrops creel fishery provides individuals of larger size and in better condition, thereby obtaining higher unit prices. Economic viability was also higher for the creel vessel, with trawling being only viable if major costs (such as labor and fuel) are covered by the revenue from other target species (e. g., the <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp).</b> At present, Nephrops populations on the South and SW coast are subject to intense fishing and to a recovery plan. The possibility of reallocation of some of the fishing effort directed at Nephrops from trawlers to creels is discussed in terms of the conservation of the resource and economic return...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the DESEAS Project, funded by the EC, was to gather {{preliminary}} data on the abundance and maximum depth distribution of the <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus in the Mediterranean Sea. An exploratory survey was therefore designed with that goal in mind and conducted on the R/V García del Cid, sampling the maximum depths in three specific areas in the central and western Mediterranean, one off Ibiza (Balearic Islands), one off Calabria (western Ionian Sea), and one off the southern Peloponnesian Peninsula (Gulf of Kalamata, eastern Ionian Sea). The depths sampled ranged from 600 to 4000 m, with specimens of A. antennatus being collected down to 3300 m. There were three distinct boundaries marking the abundance of this species: 1500 m, relatively low abundance (< 100 ind km- 2). The known population structure of this shrimp species, with increasing proportions of males and juveniles with depth, was also recorded in the deep-sea regions {{in other areas of}} the Mediterranean. No evidence of any differences in gonad development or in the presence of spermatophores carried by females was found in any of the three sampling areas. Lastly, a tendency for the relative proportion of juveniles to increase with depth was also observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{demersal}} trawl fishery of {{the north}} Tunisian coast primarily targets the deep-water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Parapenaeus longirostris, and secondarily a variety of demersal fish species. These fishes include hake (Merluccius merluccius), common pandora (Pagellus erythrinus), red mullet (Mullus barbatus), surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), bogue (Boops boops), picarel (Spicara smaris) and spotted flounder (Citharus linguatula). A bioeconomic model {{was used to test}} management measures through scenarios that ran over eleven years to estimate the viability of the fishery according to biological and economic results. The most beneficial scenario was the combination of several management measures including a temporal closure of two months, the replacement of the 40 mm diamond mesh codend with 40 mm square mesh, the removal of both the biological recovery tax and of fuel subsidies, and an 83 % reduction in fishing capacity. This results in an annual private profit higher by 9. 3 M TND (Tunisian Dinar) (6. 9 M USD) that of 2008, and an economic rent that was higher by 13. 3 M TND (9. 9 M USD) than {{by the end of the}} projected period. Shrimp and fish biomasses have doubled compared with 2008, and trawling damages would be reduced to the equivalent of a five- fold reduction in fishing effort. This study shows that the objectives of improving demersal ecosystems and improving individual and collective wealth can be achieved through the synergistic effects of various regulatory measures...|$|R
40|$|Trawling for {{crustaceans}} {{takes place on}} the south coast of Portugal at depths between 200 and 800 m. Large amounts of discards are released back to sea, reaching the bottom in the general area where trawling occurs. The objective of this work was to study the time taken for decomposition of the discards, to identify the most important scavenging species involved, and to evaluate {{the impact on the}} species targeted by the fishery. We conducted a series of 22 trials, using traps baited with samples of the discards. The time of immersion varied between 1 and 40 h. The amount of tissue removed from the discards was evaluated on a qualitative scale of 1 – 3, and quantitatively. The species caught in the traps were identified. Considerable consumption of the bait had occurred after 5 h of immersion. After 24 h of immersion only fish bones were left; past 40 h, consumption was complete. The conger eel (Conger conger) was the most common fish species present in the traps. Two species, the amphipod Scopelocheirus hopei and the isopod Natatolana (Cirolana) borealis, were identified as most important for the recycling of organic matter in the system. The stomach contents of a sample of species caught in trawls were analysed for the presence of small scavengers. Preliminary results show that S. hopei and N. (C.) borealis are part of the diet of some of the target species of this fishery, such as the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and the <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Parapenaeus longirostris. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} megabenthic communities in the Blanes canyon and adjacent open margin (Northwestern Mediterranean) were studied. The aim {{was to assess the}} effect of the canyon and commercial fishing intensity on the community {{composition and}} structure of benthic megafauna by (i) describing the megabenthic community composition, (ii) quantifying faunal abundance and biomass and (iii) describing community structure with MDS analyses and biodiversity indices. The results are compared between three sites (canyon head, canyon wall and open margin) located between 435 m and 700 m. Samples were collected using a commercial bottom trawl between April 2003 and March 2004. These sites are exploited by the local fishing fleet that targets the <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus. A total of 131 megabenthic species were identified from the three sites, with fishes and decapod crustaceans being the most speciose, most abundant and of higher biomass. The species richness, abundance and biomass of non-crustacean invertebrates were low. There {{were no significant differences in}} total abundance and biomass between the three sites. However, community structure analysis suggests that the open margin community is significantly different from the canyon head and canyon wall, with a lower species richness, lower diversity and lower evenness. The open margin community also reflects a higher degree of disturbance compared to the two canyon habitats. The results indicate that there is a canyon effect on the community structure of benthic megafauna, but this may be modulated by differing fishing pressure, which adds an additional factor to margin heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Over-fishing {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex and argued issue among the human impacts {{affecting}} the marine environment. The development of integrated policies for fish stock conservation and its responsible use are essential. Nowadays, genomics is considered an ultimate tool to define stock boundaries and population structure as it expands the focus on the entire organism’s genetic makeup and its interaction with the environment. An example of effort and capitalization on genomics is shown by the Italian RITMARE Flagship Project, which aims to create a genomic mapping for stocks of two commercially important species, the red mullet (Mullus barbatus L.) and the deep-water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Parapenaeus longirostris Lucas, 1847), through the use of 2 b-RAD technology, based on sequencing the uniform fragments produced by type IIB restriction endonucleases. A sampling design covering 8 Geographical Sub-Areas was defined on the basis of nursery areas, abundance and importance in local fishery and it was completed during the MEDITS 2013 survey. After the extraction of high quality genomic DNA from 7 individuals for each species, the 2 b-RAD protocol was tested for the first time. Thereafter, a high-throughput sequencing of libraries was accomplished through Illumina® platform and the software STACKS was used to analyze the sequences. Several millions of high quality reads per individual were obtained and approximately from 1. 0 to 2. 0 x 10 e 3 candidate SNP markers were identified. These preliminary results confirm the successful application of 2 b-RAD technology on both non model species and, above all, its effective extendibility to larger number of individuals and population samples, necessary to assess stock boundaries and stock units in the Italian seas...|$|R
40|$|The deep-water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Parapenaeus longirostris (Lucas, 1846) and the Southern pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis (Pérez Farfante, 1967) have {{traditionally}} been the target species for the shrimper Spanish fleet operating in the Mauritanian fishing ground. In spite of their commercial interest, {{there is a general}} lack of knowledge about biological aspects referring to stock identification, growth, reproduction, alimentation, length structure, and natural mortality of these species. However, population and biological information is needed for stock assessment and management measures aiming a proper exploitation pattern and conservation of the exploited species. The first difficulty encountered for assessment refers to the accurate identification of biological stocks, which are currently assessed on a national basis whereas many of them are supposed to be transboundary. The scarcity of available biological information about the species in the area makes that stocks of P. longirostris and F. notialis, evaluated into the framework of the CECAF Working Group of Demersal Resources (North) have to be defined arbitrarily for assessment purposes, within the geographical limits of the countries where they are exploited. Therefore, one stock of P. longirostris and one stock of F. notialis are considered in Guinea-Bissau, without any biological base. As a consequence, many attempted assessments have to be rejected because of poor data and/or the uncertainty of the stock identity. This work aims is to collect and analyzing the available information about different population and biological aspects of P. longirostris and F. notialis, the main target shrimp species in Mauritanian waters. This will contribute to a better knowledge of the biology of the species for assessment and management purposes...|$|R
40|$|The deep-water <b>rose</b> <b>shrimp</b> Parapenaeus longirostris is a {{demersal}} decapod crustacean that is commercially {{exploited by}} trawl fleets. The present work compares its population dynamics, biology and condition in two locations (southern and north-western Mallorca in the Balearic Islands, western Mediterranean, {{separated by a}} distance of 120 km) with different environmental conditions and explores {{the relationships between the}} species and certain environmental factors. Six multidisciplinary bimonthly surveys were carried out during 2003 and 2004 in these two locations (between 150 and 750 m depth) in order to collect data on the demersal species with bottom trawl, the hydrography (temperature and salinity) with CTD casts, and trophic resources (zooplankton in the water column and suprabenthos with Bongo net and Macer-GIROQ sledge respectively) and sediments with a Shipeck dredge. The trawl fleets from both locations were monitored by monthly on board sampling and daily landings obtained from sales bills. Additional data was obtained from other trawl surveys. Temporal differences were detected both annually, with a decreasing trend over the last years in species abundance, and seasonally, in the biological indexes analysed. Bathymetric differences were also found in abundance, mean length, sex-ratio and condition of females. There were clear differences between the two locations studied, with higher abundance, condition and mean length and a lower length at first maturity for females in the north-western location. Trophic conditions could act as a link between geo-physical and biological changes. These short spatio-temporal differences could be due to the higher productivity found at this location, with higher density of preferred prey for the studied species together with adequate seafloor topography, sediment composition and hydrographical characteristics...|$|R
