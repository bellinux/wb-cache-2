40|$|<b>Juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> are {{regarded}} as hamartomatous polyps and occur in sporadic and familial syndromic settings. There is increased risk of gastrointestinal neoplasia in patients with juvenile polyposis syndrome, but the molecular mechanisms are not known. We therefore studied 78 colorectal juvenile polyposis from 12 patients with <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> syndrome and 34 sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> for epithelial dysplasia and genetic changes associated with colorectal neoplasia. Dysplasia occurred in 31 % of syndromic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> but not in sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> (P < 0. 0001). Topographic control of proliferation and expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 21 (WAFI/CIP 1) seen in native colorectal epithelium was lost in 79 % of dysplastic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> and in 8 % of nondysplastic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> (P < 0. 000001).

40|$|Background & Aims: Gastrointestinal <b>{{juvenile}}</b> <b>polyps</b> {{may occur}} in juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) or sporadically. JPS is an autosomal-dominant condition {{caused by a}} germline defect in SMAD 4 or BMPR 1 A in 50 % to 60 % of cases, and is characterized by multiple <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps,</b> predominantly in the colorectum. JPS has {{an increased risk of}} gastrointestinal malignancy but sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> do not. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression is increased in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Inhibition of COX- 2 leads to regression of colorectal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis patients and inhibits gastrointestinal tumorigenesis. To investigate the role of COX- 2 in <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps,</b> we compared the expression of COX- 2 in <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> from a well-defined group of juvenile polyposis patients and sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps.</b> Methods: COX- 2 expression was assessed in 24 genetically well-defined JPS patients and 26 patients with sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> using tissue microarray analysis. Two additional markers, Hu-antigen R, a stabilizer of messenger RNA, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein 13, a transcription factor, both associated with increased COX- 2 expression, also were investigated. Results: Increased COX- 2 expression in JPS patients was noted compared with patients with sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> (P <. 001). Also, JPS patients with a BMPR 1 A germline defect had higher COX- 2 expression than did JPS patients in whom no germline mutation was detected. High COX- 2 levels correlated with increased cytoplasmic Hu-antigen R expression in JPS polyps (P =. 022), but not in sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps.</b> Conclusions: <b>juvenile</b> polyposis and sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> show distinctive expression profiles of COX- 2 that may have clinical implication...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> are {{distinct}} hamartomatous malformations of the gastrointestinal tract {{that may occur}} in the heritable juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) or sporadically. Histologically, <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> are characterized by a marked increase of the stromal cell compartment, but an epithelial phenotype has also been reported. JPS has {{an increased risk of}} colorectal cancer but sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> do not. In 50 % to 60 % of patients with JPS, a germline mutation of the transforming growth factor-beta/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway genes SMAD 4 or BMPR 1 A is found. This study compares the histologic phenotype of <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> with a SMAD 4 or BMPR 1 A germline mutation and sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps.</b> Methods: Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained slides of 65 JPS polyps and 25 sporadic <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> were reviewed for histologic features and dysplasia. Systematic random crypt and stroma counts were obtained by count stereology, and a crypt-stroma ratio was determined. All polyps were subsequently categorized as type A (crypt-stroma ratio = 1. 00), the latter referring to the epithelial phenotype. Cell cycle activity was assessed using immunohistochemistry of the proliferation marker Ki 67, and mutation analysis was carried out for KRAS and APC to determine the involvement of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Results: <b>Juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> with a SMAD 4 germline mutation were predominantly type B, whereas type A was more common among <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> with a BMPR 1 A germline mutation. However, this distinction could not be ascribed to differences in cell cycle activity. Dysplasia was equally common in JPS polyps with either a SMAD 4 or BMPR 1 A germline mutation, in which the involvement of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence does not seem to play a distinct role.

40|$|Cowden {{syndrome}} (CS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} cancer-prone disorder caused by germ-line mutation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog mutated on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor-suppressor gene. Affected patients commonly develop <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps,</b> and show an elevated risk of developing colorectal cancers. The etiology of these peculiar polyps remains unclear, although previous work has suggested somatic PTEN alterations in the stroma of <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps.</b> After a long latency period, we find epithelial-specific PTEN deletion to cause formation of <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> in the colorectum without stromal PTEN loss. More important, we find that these lesions closely recapitulate all of the characteristic histopathological features of <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> seen in patients with CS, including stromal alterations and dysplastic transformation to colorectal carcinoma. The stromal alterations we identify after epithelial-specific PTEN loss suggest that PTEN {{may be involved in}} altered epithelial-mesenchymal cross talk, which, in turn, predisposes to colorectal neoplasia and polyposis. Our transgenic model is the first to recapitulate colorectal juvenile polyposis in patients with CS.

Results We identified Lhx genes in two cnidarians and a placozoan and report the expression of Lhx genes during embryonic development in Nematostella and the demosponge Amphimedon. Members of the six major LIM homeobox subfamilies are represented in the genomes of the starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, and the placozoan Trichoplax adhaerens. The hydrozoan cnidarian, Hydra magnipapillata, has retained four of the six Lhx subfamilies, but apparently lost two others. Only three subfamilies are represented in the haplosclerid demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. A tandem cluster of three Lhx genes of different subfamilies and a gene containing two LIM domains in the genome of T. adhaerens (an animal without any neurons) indicates that Lhx subfamilies were generated by tandem duplication. This tandem cluster in Trichoplax is likely a remnant of the original chromosomal context in which Lhx subfamilies first appeared. Three of the six Trichoplax Lhx genes are expressed in animals in laboratory culture, as are all Lhx genes in Hydra.

40|$|Abstract = Safety and {{efficacy}} of colonoscopic polypectomy without using general anesthesia in young children with <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> were studied. Between July 1987 and June 1993, seventy six colorectal polyps of up to 4. 5 cm diameter were removed by dia-thermy snare during 43 colonoscopic polypectomy sessions on 38 children aged from 6 months to 13 years (mean, 4. 4 years). Thirty four children had single polyps. The re-maining four children had more than two polyps. One of them was juvenile polyposis. General anesthesia was not used in any infant or child. In 31 (82 %) patients, colonoscopic polypectomy was performed on an ambulatory basis. Most <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> (89 %) occurred as a solitary lesion. In 76 % of patients, polyps were located in the rectosigmoid region. Seventy nine percent of the polypectomized <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> were between 1 cm and 3 cm diameter in size. No complications related to medication, colonoscopy. or snare polypectomy were observed {{in any of the}} children. The major clinical manifestations of children with <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> were hematochezia (89 %), ab-dominal pain (19 %), mucoid stools or diarrhea (45 %), and anemia (29 %). These clinical symptoms disappeared soon after removal of polyps. In 18 of 33 patients with <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps,</b> barium enema did not demonstrate any colonic polyps. More than 6 months' delay of diagnosis was noted in 40 % of patients. Only 32 % of patients were diagnosed to have <b>juvenile</b> <b>polyps</b> within 3 months from the onset of hematochezia.

The adenomas showed immunoreactivity mainly in the superficial part of the mucosa, whereas the distribution in the carcinomas and metastases was more diffuse. Comparative immunostaining of serial sections for Ki- 67, a well established marker of cell proliferation, confirmed that MN/CA IX is expressed in areas with high proliferative capacity.
