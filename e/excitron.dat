50|$|The six BE {{departments}} are conducting national level technical symposia every year, namely Framers (Civil Engineering), Vogue Zenith (Computers Science Engineering), <b>Excitron</b> (Electrical & Electronics Engineering), Gliterz (Information Technology), Plasma (Mechanical Engineering) and Vibrantz (Electronics & Communication Engineering).|$|E
50|$|This {{excitation}} or keep-alive circuit {{was absolutely}} necessary for single-phase rectifiers {{such as the}} <b>excitron</b> and for mercury-arc rectifiers used in the high-voltage supply of radiotelegraphy transmitters, as current flow was regularly interrupted every time the Morse key was released.|$|E
50|$|Like glass-bulb valves, steel-tank mercury arc valves {{were built}} {{with only a}} single anode per tank (a type {{also known as the}} <b>excitron)</b> or with {{multiple}} anodes per tank. Multiple-anode valves were usually used for multi-phase rectifier circuits (with 2, 3, 6 or 12 anodes per tank) but in HVDC applications multiple anodes were often simply connected in parallel in order to increase the current rating.|$|E

5000|$|Special {{types of}} {{single-phase}} mercury-arc rectifiers are the Ignitron and the [...] The <b>Excitron</b> {{is similar to}} other types of valve described above but depends critically {{on the existence of}} an excitation anode to maintain an arc discharge during the half-cycle when the valve is not conducting current. The Ignitron dispenses with excitation anodes by igniting the arc each time conduction is required to start. In this way, ignitrons also avoid the need for control grids.|$|E
