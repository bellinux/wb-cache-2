5|$|With {{the aim of}} {{boosting}} the recovery in the eurozone economy by lowering interest rates for businesses, the ECB cut its bank rates in multiple steps in 2012–2013, reaching an historic low of 0.25% in November 2013. The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> currencies, which is hoped will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery.|$|E
5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as {{well as in the}} cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} bank rate to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E

5|$|On the {{day after}} the killings, the head of the State Treasury, Pekka Syrjänen, said that {{students}} would be able to seek compensation from the state for physical and psychological damage caused by the shootings. This was in accordance with the Crime Damage Act, which also stipulated that payments were to be adjusted <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> forms of compensation that the students received. Claimants were able to apply if they had suffered a loss of earnings, pain and suffering, or damage or loss to personal belongings {{as a consequence of the}} attack.

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to {{all but the most}} privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly {{a result of the}} manner in which it was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. What drives moral action? A {{narrative}} {{analysis of}} rescuers of Jews during World War II suggests {{it is not}} reason or religion (the explanations most frequently offered by scholars), but rather identity and a particular view of self <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> Findings suggest the tremendous power of identity to constrain choice, reveal {{the complexity of the}} moral life, underscore the importance of identity for moral motivation, and fill in critical gaps in our understanding of the moral psychology. In particular, an examination of moral exemplars focuses attention on the self concept, especially the extent to which critical values are integrated into one’s sense of self {{and the extent to which}} a particular perspective (a way of seeing one’s self <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>others)</b> triggers a sense of moral salience. The analysis suggests that if we can understand how people see the world and themselves <b>in</b> <b>relation</b> <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> if we can decipher their cognitive frameworks, perceptions, and categorization schema, we may begin to determine why identity exerts such a powerful influence on our treatment of others...|$|R

40|$|Background: Research {{evidence}} suggests that self-understanding {{is likely to be}} limited in individuals with autism.
