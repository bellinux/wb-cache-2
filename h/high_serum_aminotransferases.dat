40|$|BACKGROUND. An {{elevation}} in liver enzymes and, most notably, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) activity, {{has been}} correlated with metabolic syndrome and obesity. However, whether obesity per se or obesity-related co-morbidities affect aminotransferase activity is still unclear. In {{this study we}} sought to evaluate <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> activity in morbid and uncomplicated obese subjects METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> activity, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed in 290 morbid and 105 uncomplicated consecutive obese subjects matched for body mass index (BMI) (40. 1 +/- 6. 8 vs. 39. 9 +/- 8. 3 kg/m(2), respectively), age (35. 9 +/- 10 vs. 34. 8 +/- 9. 6 years, respectively), sex distribution and duration of obesity. RESULTS: Uncomplicated obese subjects showed significantly lower serum ALT activity (17. 58 +/- 6. 3 (range 10 - 39) vs. 23. 43 +/- 16 (range 12 - 89) U/l, (p< 0. 001)), and lower aspartate aminotransferase (AST), AST/ALT ratios and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (gammaGT) (p< 0. 01 for all) than morbid obese subjects.

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the genetic aetiology of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and the impact of known cholestasis genes (BSEP, FIC 1, and MDR 3) on the development of this disease. Patients and methods: Sixty nine Finnish ICP patients were prospectively interviewed for a family history of ICP, and clinical features were compared in patients with familial ICP (patients with a positive family history, n= 11) and sporadic patients (patients with no known family history of ICP, n= 58). For molecular genetic analysis, 16 individuals from two independently ascertained Finnish ICP families were genotyped for the flanking markers for BSEP, FIC 1, and MDR 3. Results: The pedigree structures in 16 % (11 / 69) of patients suggested dominant inheritance. Patients with familial ICP had <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> levels and a higher recurrence risk (92 % v 40 %). Both segregation of haplotypes and multipoint linkage analysis excluded BSEP, FIC 1, and MDR 3 genes in the studied pedigrees. Additionally, the MDR 3 gene, previously shown to harbour mutations in ICP patients, was negative for mutations when sequenced in four affected individuals from the two families. Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that the aetiology of ICP is heterogeneous and that ICP is due to a genetic predisposition in a proportion of patients. The results of molecular geneti...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAntituberculosis drug-related liver injury (ATLI) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} hepatotoxicity in many countries. Whether monitoring liver tests is beneficial to prevent this potentially grave adverse drug reaction (ADR) is open to debate. The Taiwan Drug Relief Foundation (TDRF) was established by the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration to collect severe cases of ADR and carry out drug injury relief tasks. Our intention was to explore the role of monitoring liver tests in the susceptibility and severity of ATLI from the database of this foundation. All cases of suspected ATLI collected by the TDRF from 1999 to 2012 were reviewed. The basic demographic data, clinical course, and laboratory data of these patients were analyzed. A total of 57 cases with severe ATLI were verified and enrolled into this study. There was a high mortality (71. 9 %) in this cohort. Twenty-four cases (42. 1 %) were chronic viral hepatitis B carriers, who had <b>higher</b> baseline <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> level than noncarriers. The patients without monitoring liver tests had <b>higher</b> peak <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase,</b> bilirubin levels, and mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 8. 87; 95 % confidence interval =  1. 32 – 59. 41; p =  0. 024) than those with monitoring liver tests. In conclusion, patients with severe ATLI whose records were collected by the TDRF have a high mortality. Patients without follow-up monitoring liver tests had more severe liver injuries and higher mortality than those with monitoring live tests. To alleviate this potentially grave ADR, checking of liver biochemical tests prior to antituberculosis treatment and periodic monitoring of these tests thereafter are highly suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{progression}} of fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C determines the ultimate prognosis {{and thus the}} need and urgency of therapy. Fibrogenesis is a complex dynamic process, which is mediated by necroinflammation and activation of stellate cells. The liver biopsy remains the gold standard to assess fibrosis. Scoring systems allow a semiquantitative assessment and are useful for cross-sectional and cohort studies and in treatment trials. The rate at which fibrosis progresses varies markedly between patients. The major factors known {{to be associated with}} fibrosis progression are older age at infection, male gender, and excessive alcohol consumption. Viral load and genotype do not seem to influence significantly the progression rate. Progression of fibrosis is more rapid in immunocompromised patients. Hepatic steatosis, obesity, and diabetes may also contribute to more rapid {{progression of}} fibrosis. There are no tests that reliably predict the rate of progression of fibrosis in an individual patient. <b>High</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) levels are associated with a higher risk of fibrosis progression, and worsening of fibrosis is uncommon in patients with persistently normal <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> levels. <b>Serum</b> markers for fibrosis are not reliable and need to be improved and validated.

40|$|Background: <b>High</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) {{levels have}} been {{associated}} with increased risk of diabetes and with increased mortality, but associations of variations of ALT in the normal range with outcomes have been less well studied.

The associations between ALT and morbidity and mortality outcomes were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for a comprehensive panel of cardiovascular risk factors.

At the end of therapy, viral DNA clearance and aminotransferase normalization were significantly (p less than 0. 05) more frequent in treated patients than in controls. After 16 months' follow up, the difference was still significant for hepatitis B e antigen clearance and transaminase normalization. Hepatitis B virus DNA reactivation was observed during follow up in 43 % of treated patients and 50 % of controls.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the hypothesis that}} Th 1 phenotype cytokines {{are associated with the}} increasing activity of hepatitis and Th 2 phenotype cytokines with decreasing activity in the liver of chronic viral hepatitis, expressions of the mRNA of the cytokines IL- 2, IFN-gamma and IL- 4 in the liver of 23 patients with chronic hepatitis B were investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients were divided into three groups according to the phase of acute exacerbation of hepatitis as increasing (n = 9), decreasing (n = 8), and stable phase (n = 6). Both IL- 2 and IFN-gamma mRNA were preferentially expressed in increasing phase than in decreasing phase (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, respectively) and associated with the <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) level. On the other hand, IL- 4 mRNA was detected in decreasing phase with significant frequency compared with increasing phase (P < 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE — The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} predictors of incident diabetes during follow-up of nondiabetic patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) in the Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) program. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — A total of 1, 620 nondiabetic patients had full baseline datasets. We compared baseline demographic, medication, and laboratory data for patients who did or did not develop diabetes and conducted logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic curve analyses. RESULTS — Over a median period of 2. 8 years, 126 of the 1, 620 patients (7. 8 %) developed diabetes. In multiple logistic regression analysis, the following baseline characteristics were independently associated with incident diabetes in decreasing order of significance by stepwise selection: higher A 1 C (odds ratio [OR] 1. 78 per 1 SD increase; P 0. 0001), higher BMI (OR 1. 64 per 1 SD increase; P 0. 0001), lipid-lowering therapy (OR 2. 05; P 0. 0005), lower serum creatinine concentration (OR 0. 68 per 1 SD increase; P 0. 0018), diuretic therapy (OR 4. 81; P 0. 003), digoxin therapy (OR 1. 65; P 0. 022), <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> concentration (OR 1. 15 per 1 SD increase; P 0. 027), and lower age (OR 0. 81 per 1 SD increase...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study of 90 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction, 15 (28. 3 %) of 53 patients with an anterior wall infarction developed a left ventricular thrombosis diagnosed by cross sectional echocardiography. Patients received anticoagulants {{only after a}} left ventricular thrombosis had been diagnosed. Twenty eight patients had an inferior infarction, {{but none of these}} had a left ventricular thrombosis. Five (5. 5 %) of the 90 patients suffered a cerebrovascular accident, and all had an anterior wall infarction. In four of these five patients a left ventricular thrombosis was confirmed by echocardiography before the cerebrovascular accident. All patients with left ventricular thrombosis had apical akinesis. The incidence of a thrombosis did not differ in patients with a first anterior myocardial infarction and with reinfarctions. Among the 40 patients with a first anterior wall infarction, 12 with a thrombosis had a significantly higher incidence of enlarged heart on chest radiographs and significantly <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> enzyme activity than those without.

40|$|We {{have defined}} 10 linear {{immunogenic}} regions encoded by the putative hepatitis C virus (HCV) structural proteins (core and envelope) by employing an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) and by using 17 sequential synthetic peptides covering the N-terminal 330 amino acids of the structural polyproteins as antigens. These peptides correspond to amino acids 1 to 24, 21 to 44, 42 to 68, 64 to 91, and 100 to 120 of the putative core protein and amino acids 192 to 212, 223 to 238, 236 to 258, 250 to 266, and 307 to 330 of the putative envelope protein. In particular, the peptide covering amino acids 21 to 44 of the core protein was reactive with all but one (40 of 41) of the serum samples giving a positive signal in the passive hemagglutination assay (PHA) using the core and nonstructural proteins (NS 3 / 4) of the virus as antigens. We detected the HCV genome in 25 (61 %) of 41 PHA-positive serum samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of 25 PCR-positive serum samples, 17 serum samples had reactivity to the peptides derived from the envelope protein. On the other hand, only 1 of the 16 PCR-negative serum samples had reactivity to the peptides derived from the envelope protein.

During r-IFN treatment, serum HBV-DNA levels fell in all, but 2 patients. Final evaluation at 16 months after randomization {{revealed that the}} rate of complete response, i. e., loss of both HBV-DNA and HBeAg with ALT normalization was 22. 2 % (2 of 9 cases) in patients on interferon and 12. 5 % (1 of 8 cases) in untreated patients for the group with <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) and with piecemeal necrosis on liver biopsy on entry. The corresponding value was 25 % (2 of 8 cases) in treated and 12. 5 % (1 of 8 cases) in untreated patients with low liver disease activity.

At 15 weeks of age, 8 chickens were selected from each group for the nutrient digestibility trial. The results showed that body weight gain during the 0 to 4 week period decreased as the feed intake and feed conversion rate (FCR) increased linearly with increasing level of DFWP inclusion.

For this purpose, we analyzed and reviewed published cases of 16 patients from various European countries. In all patients, herbal hepatotoxicity was of probable and highly probable causality for GC, using the original and updated scale of CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences).

In addition, though the combination of diabetes and chronic heart failure (CHF) carries a poor prognosis, few {{studies have examined}} predictors of new-onset diabetes in those with CHF. In patients with symptomatically mild CHF who participated in the placebo-controlled Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and Survival Study in Heart Failure, we examined the effect of the aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, on physician-diagnosed diabetes using univariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. To identify predictors of new-onset diabetes (measures of glycaemia were not available), data from trial arms were combined and multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted. At baseline, the mean age of 1846 initially non-diabetic patients was 69 years and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 26. Over 21 months, 69 (3. 7) developed diabetes (33 on eplerenone, 36 on placebo). Eplerenone had no effect on new-onset diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 94, 95 confidence interval (CI) 0. 591. 52] and no effect on the composite of new-onset diabetes or mortality (HR 0. 80, 95 CI 0. 641. 01).

40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} {{may have}} a generally benign prognosis, either because most hepatocytes are not significantly injured or mechanisms to replace damaged hepatocytes are induced. To determine {{the relative importance of}} these mechanisms, we compared hepatocyte damage and replication in ethanol-fed and ob/ob mice with very indolent fatty liver disease to that of healthy control mice and PARP- 1 (-/-) mice with targeted disruption of the DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Compared to the healthy controls, both groups with fatty livers had significantly <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> values, hepatic mitochondrial H(2) O(2) production, and hepatocyte oxidative DNA damage. A significantly smaller proportion of the hepatocytes from fatty livers entered S phase when cultured with mitogens. Moreover, this replicative senescence was not reversed by treating cultured hepatocytes with agents (i. e., betaine or leptin) that improve liver disease in intact ethanol-fed or leptin-deficient mice. Hepatocytes from PARP 1 (-/-) mice also had more DNA damage and reduced DNA synthesis in response to mitogens. However, neither mice with fatty livers nor PARP- 1 -deficient mice had atrophic livers. All of the mice with senescent mature hepatocytes exhibited hepatic accumulation of liver progenitor (oval) cells and oval cell numbers increased with the demand for hepatocyte replacement. Therefore, although hepatic oxidant production and damage are generally increased in fatty livers, expansion of hepatic progenitor cell populations helps to compensate for the increased turnover of damaged mature hepatocytes. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that induction of mechanisms to replace damaged hepatocytes is important for limiting the progression of fatty liver disease. status: publishe...|$|R

Over the past decade, several host and HBV factors predictive of clinical outcomes in Asian HBV carriers have been identified. The community-based REVEAL-HBV study illustrated the strong association between HBV-DNA level at study entry and risk of HCC over time, and male gender, older age, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT) level, positive HBeAg, higher HBV-DNA level, HBV genotype C infection and core promoter mutation are independently associated with a higher hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk. Another hospital-based ERADICATE-B cohort further validated the HCC risk started to increase when HBV-DNA level was higher than 2, 000 IU/mL. Of particular note, in patients with low viral load (HBV-DNA level < 2, 000 IU/mL), HBsAg level ≥ 1, 000 IU/mL was a new independent risk factor for HCC. With the results from REVEAL-HBV study, a risk calculator for predicting HCC in adult non-cirrhotic patients has been developed and validated by independent international cohorts (REACH-B). With the combination of HBV-DNA, HBsAg, and ALT levels, ERADICATE-B study proposed an algorithm to predict disease progression and categorize risk levels of HCC as well as corresponding management in Asian HBV carriers.

It suggests an association between an elevated <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> level and MS. Little data show the relationship between the levels of <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and the incidence of MS in Ningxia, China. Methods: A total of 5415 subjects who received medical health checkups from 2007 to 2009 were enrolled in the study. The participants were interviewed by trained health workers under a structured questionnaire. MS was defined according to the modified ATPIII criteria for Asian Americans by the American Heart Association (AHA-ATP III). Results: The prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT (> 40 Â U/L) were 7. 1 % and 22. 2 % in males, and 2. 1 % and 4. 8 % in females respectively. The prevalence of MS was 32. 1 % in males and 15. 4 % in females. The components of MS were significantly more in the group with elevated aminotransferase levels than in the group with normal aminotransferase levels. The odds ratios (95 % CI) for elevated AST were 1. 90 (1. 49, 2. 42), 2. 59 (2. 01, 3. 39), 1. 68 (1. 32, 2. 15), and 1. 81 (1. 36, 2. 42) in the adults with abdominal obesity, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> triglycerides levels, <b>high</b> blood pressure, and high plasma glucose levels respectively.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} and identify prevalent hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes {{and to explore}} lamivudine-resistant mutations among treated and untreated patients in Jordan. METHODS: A total of 107 cases with chronic hepatitis B were recruited from different medical centers in Jordan. Serological tests were preformed for all cases using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay. HBV Genotyping was performed for 70 cases using Line probe genotyping assay. The YMDD mutations were explored for 20 cases (4 were lamivudine naive) using the INNO-LiPA HBV DR assay. RESULTS: Genotype D was the only detected genotype. A total of 6 YMDD mutations were detected in 5 treated patients (31 %) while one mutation was detected in the naive patients. Seventeen percent of cases were positive for HBeAg and had statistically significant <b>higher</b> levels of <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferases.</b> CONCLUSION: HBV genotype D {{appears to be the}} only circulating type in Jordanian patients.

Methods: 25 children with AIH, based on the International Scoring Criteria of Autoimmune Hepatitis (IAIHG score system), recruited from Pediatric Hepatology clinic, Benha University Hospitals have been analyzed for their clinical, biochemical features, histological profile and their response to treatment. Results: 25 children were 15 female (60 %) and 10 male (40 %) their ages ranged from 3 to 15  years old. The main clinical presentation were jaundice (68. 0 %), abdominal pain (48. 0 %), acute hepatic-like illness was the first presentation in (32. 0 %), hepatomegaly (80. 0 %), splenomegaly (40. 0 %) lower limb edema (12. 0 %), and ascites (12. 0 %). All patients at first presentations had <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (ALT), aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> (AST), and <b>serum</b> immunoglobulin G (IgG).

Over 21 months, 69 (3. 7 %) developed diabetes (33 on eplerenone, 36 on placebo). Eplerenone had no effect on new-onset diabetes [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 94, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 59 – 1. 52] and no effect on the composite of new-onset diabetes or mortality (HR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 64 – 1. 01). Independent predictors of new-onset diabetes included digoxin therapy, <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase,</b> longer duration of heart failure, current or previous smoker, higher waist circumference, lower age, and higher systolic blood pressure with a combined c-statistic of 0. 74. Conclusions: Eplerenone had no effect on new-onset diabetes in patients with CHF, but further large-scale studies are required to address this question comprehensively. Commonly recorded parameters provided useful information for predicting new-onset diabetes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the clinical course and outcome of patients who were diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by scrub typhus and who received ventilator care in the intensive care units (ICU) of two university hospitals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all adult ventilated patients who were diagnosed with ARDS caused by scrub typhus. RESULTS: Eleven (1. 7 %) of 632 scrub typhus patients were diagnosed with ARDS (median age 72; seven were male). Eight patients had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (four patients). Eight patients (72. 7 %) were admitted in November. The most common chief complaints of the patients were fever and rash (63. 6 %). All patients had skin eschar and rash; seven were treated for shock. On the day of diagnosis with ARDS, the median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 20 (range 11 - 28) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score was 7 (range 4 - 14). All patients had PaO 2 /FiO 2 &lt; 200 mmHg, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> aspartate <b>aminotransferase</b> level (&gt; 40 IU/L), and hypoalbuminemia (&lt; 3. 3 g/dl). Nine patients were treated with doxycycline on the day of admission. Their median lengths of stay in the ICU and hospital were 10 (range 4 - 65) and 14 (4 - 136) days, respectively. The mortality rate during treatment in the hospital was 36. 4 %. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the risk of ARDS among patients diagnosed with scrub typhus was at least 1. 7 %, with a hospital mortality rate of 36. 4 %...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{autoimmune}} hepatitis (JAIH) is a progressive inflammatory liver disease, affecting mainly young girls, from infancy to late adolescence, characterized by active liver damage, {{as shown by}} <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> activity of <b>aminotransferases,</b> by elevated immunoglobulin G levels, <b>high</b> titers of <b>serum</b> non organ-specific and organ-specific autoantibodies, and by interface hepatitis on liver biopsy. It is a multifactorial disease of unknown etiology in which environmental factors act as a trigger in genetically predisposed individuals. Two types of JAIH are identified according to the autoantibody panel detected at diagnosis: AIH- 1, characterized {{by the presence of}} anti-smooth muscle antibody and/or antinuclear antibody and AIH- 2, by anti-liverkidney microsomal antibody type 1 and/or by the presence of anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibody. Epidemiological distribution, genetic markers, clinical presentation and pattern of serum cytokines differentiate the two types of AIH suggesting possible pathogenetic mechanisms. The most effective therapy for AIH is pharmacological suppression of the immune response. Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made to avoid severe liver damage and progression of fibrosis. The aim of this review is to outline the most significant and peculiar features of JAIH, based largely on our own personal database and on a review of current literature. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc...|$|R

The objective was to identify the cause of elevated <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferases</b> in this patient in a systematic manner. Thorough history and physical examination revealed a background history of rippling muscle disease secondary to caveolin- 3 protein deficiency, with typical clinical signs. There was a positive family history of musculoskeletal disease in the patient's father and brother.

40|$|Background/PurposeTimely {{diagnosis}} and prompt treatment {{can reduce the}} complications of scrub typhus. It is thus important to find easy laboratory tests {{to help in the}} diagnosis, especially in patients without eschar at initial presentation. Because <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> elevation is common in scrub typhus, its associated factors and clinical implications need further investigations. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective study in Kinmen, Taiwan, to collect clinically suspected scrub typhus patients notified to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for confirmation during 2005 – 2010. Scrub typhus was diagnosed and Orientia tsutsugamushi was genotyped by serological or molecular assays. The laboratory data and clinical information were recorded for analysis. ResultsOverall, 344 suspected scrub typhus patients were reported to Taiwan Centers for Disease Control and 288 of them were certified scrub typhus. Scrub typhus patients had significantly more thrombocytopenia, <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> elevation (76 % vs. 54 %, p =  0. 001), higher frequency of fever, eschar, and lymphadenopathy, compared with nontyphus patients. Hepatic dysfunction in scrub typhus was associated with older age, longer fever duration, and absence of lymphadenopathy, but seemed to be unrelated to the rickettsial genotypes. Multivariate analysis showed that <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> elevation (odds ratio: 3. 75; p =  0. 003; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 56 – 9. 01) independently predicted scrub typhus. Furthermore, in suspected scrub typhus patients without eschar, 92 % of true typhus patients had <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> elevation compared with the nontyphus ones (odds ratio: 6. 47; p = 0. 028, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 23 – 34. 11).

40|$|One year of {{lamivudine}} treatment {{results in}} increased hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion and serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA negativity {{in children with}} chronic hepatitis B and <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> concentrations. Two hundred seventy-six children who participated in a 1 -year randomized, placebo-controlled study of lamivudine were enrolled in a 24 -month, open-label extension. Patients were stratified into two groups based on HBeAg status at week 48 of the previous study: 213 HBeAg-positive children were entered into a treatment arm, and 63 HBeAg-negative children were entered into an observation arm to evaluate durability of HBeAg loss. In the treatment arm, 28 of 133 (21 %) children previously treated with lamivudine and 23 of 77 (30 %) children who previously received placebo achieved the primary end point: virological response (VR) (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA negativity) at month 24. The incidence of YMDD (tyrosine, methionine, aspartate, aspartate) mutations at month 24 was 64 % (66 / 103) in the children previously treated with lamivudine and 49 % (34 / 70) in those previously treated with placebo. The incidence of VR at month 24 was 5 % (5 / 100) for patients with YMDD mutant HBV and 54 % (39 / 72) for patients without. The durability of response in the observation arm was 89 % (48 / 54) at month 24. In conclusion, further clinical response was seen over the 24 -month open-label study period in children who had not initially achieved a VR after 12 months of lamivudine treatment. However, the incidence of YMMD mutations increased over time and resulted in lower response rates. VR was maintained in most patients who had initially responded to lamivudine in the first 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Although {{impaired}} {{liver regeneration}} {{is thought to}} be a major cause of death in patients with fulminant hepatitis, the mechanisms are not well defined. Since IL- 12 synthesis has been reported to be up-regulated in murine hepatitis virus infection, we studied the influence of continuous IL- 12 stimulation on murine liver regeneration using flow cytometric and functional analyses. In nonhepatectomized mice, interestingly, the number of hepatic NK cells was significantly decreased on day 7, after six IL- 12 injections, and day 14, after 13 IL- 12 injections. The number of hepatic NKT cells was markedly increased on day 7 and day 14 of daily IL- 12 treatment. The cytotoxic activity of hepatic lymphocytes against both YAC- 1 and p 815 cells was enhanced on day 2, after single IL- 12 injection, and day 7, after six IL- 12 injections. In contrast, hepatic lymphocytes isolated 24 h after partial hepatectomy with IL- 12 pretreatment did not show any cytolytic activity against either YAC- 1 cells or p 815 cells. However, continuous IL- 12 stimulation resulted in a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> (sALT) level 24 h after the partial hepatectomy as compared with sALT levels in mice subjected to either partial hepatectomy or IL- 12 pretreatment alone. On the other hand, the expression of hepatic TNF-α mRNA was markedly enhanced by continuous IL- 12 stimulation even 24 h after partial hepatectomy, as compared with that in non-treated mice and hepatectomy alone. Simultaneous administration of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α mAb completely inhibited IL- 12 -induced in vivo enhancement of liver damage after partial hepatectomy. In conclusion, IL- 12 induces the specific cytolytic activity against regenerating hepatocytes in vivo mainly through the enhancement of TNF-α synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{familial}} intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) types 1 and 2 {{are characterized}} by normal serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity and are due to mutations in ATP 8 B 1 (encoding FIC 1) and ABCB 11 (encoding bile salt export pump [BSEP]), respectively. Our goal was to evaluate the features that may distinguish PFIC 1 from PFIC 2 and ease their diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed charts of 62 children with normal-GGT PFIC in whom a search for ATP 8 B 1 and/or ABCB 11 mutation, liver BSEP immunostaining, and/or bile analysis were performed. Based on genetic testing, 13 patients were PFIC 1 and 39 PFIC 2. The PFIC origin remained unknown in 10 cases. PFIC 2 patients had a higher tendency to develop neonatal cholestasis. <b>High</b> <b>serum</b> alanine <b>aminotransferase</b> and alphafetoprotein levels, severe lobular lesions with giant hepatocytes, early liver failure, cholelithiasis, hepatocellular carcinoma, very low biliary bile acid concentration, and negative BSEP canalicular staining suggest PFIC 2, whereas an absence of these signs and/or presence of extrahepatic manifestations suggest PFIC 1. The PFIC 1 and PFIC 2 phenotypes were not clearly correlated with mutation types, but we found tendencies for a better prognosis and response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or biliary diversion (BD) in a few children with missense mutations. Combination of UDCA, BD, and liver transplantation allowed 87 % of normal-GGT PFIC patients to be alive at a median age of 10. 5 years (1 - 36), half of them without liver transplantation. CONCLUSION: PFIC 1 and PFIC 2 differ clinically, biochemically, and histologically at presentation and/or during the disease course.

40|$|Primary {{sclerosing cholangitis}} (PSC) {{is a rare}} cholestatic liver disease {{characterized}} by chronic inflammation of the biliary tree resulting in liver fibrosis. PSC {{is more common in}} male less than 40 years of age. The diagnosis of PSC is based on clinical, laboratory, image, and histological findings. A biochemical profile of mild to severe chronic cholestasis can be observed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography is the golden standard method for diagnosis, but magnetic resonance cholangiography is currently also considered a first-line method of investigation. Differences in clinical and laboratory findings were observed in young patients, including higher incidence of overlap syndromes, mostly with autoimmune hepatitis, <b>higher</b> <b>serum</b> levels of <b>aminotransferases</b> and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and lower incidence of serious complications as cholangiocarcinoma. In spite of the detection of several HLA variants as associated factors in large multicenter cohorts of adult patients, the exact role and pathways of these susceptibility genes remain to be determined in pediatric population.

In this investigation we primarily aimed to evaluate the prevalence of MetS and its components among army and secondly to explore the association between elevated <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and the components of metabolic syndrome. Methods: A total of 380 army personnel from a military camp in Southern Iran participated in this cross-section-al study. Life style related characteristics, anthropometric features, <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and components of MetS, based on National Cholesterol Education Program—Adult Treatment Panel III, were measured. Statisti-cal significant was set as p value less than 0. 05. Results: The mean age of participants was 35. 0 ± 7. 5 year-old and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 8. 1 %. The prevalence of the components of MetS including; central obesity, abnormal fasting blood glucose, hypertension, hypertriglycridemia and low HDL cholesterol level was 8. 6 %, 10. 4 %, 18. 5 %, 31 %, and 45. 5 % respectively. MetS had significant relationship with obesity (P< 0. 001) and abnormal Waist Circumferance/Hip Circumference ratio (P< 0. 001).

However, the significance of relatively low levels of aminotransferases in relation to metabolic disorders has not been fully investigated in the general population. We inves­tigated the association between serum amiontransferase levels and metabolic disorders using data from a survey in Jilin province, China. Methods: In 2007, a survey was conducted throughout Jilin, China, covering both urban and rural areas. A total of 3835 people, 18 to 79 years old including 1761 men and 2074 women, underwent real-time ultrasonography, blood tests including aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and had interviews with a structured questionnaire. Results: <b>Serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> levels within the normal range were asso­ciated with metabolic syndrome independent of age, occupation, cultural and educational level, income, body mass index, waist circumference, smoking, and alcohol intake. Compared with the lowest level (50 IU/L were 1. 92, 2. 50, 2. 97, and 3. 52 in men, and 1. 38, 1. 54, 3. 06, and 2. 62 in women, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveMetabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) is {{a combination}} of medical disorders that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. It suggests an association between an elevated <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> level and MS. Little data show the relationship between the levels of <b>serum</b> <b>aminotransferase</b> and the incidence of MS in Ningxia, China. MethodsA total of 5415 subjects who received medical health checkups from 2007 to 2009 were enrolled in the study. The participants were interviewed by trained health workers under a structured questionnaire. MS was defined according to the modified ATPIII criteria for Asian Americans by the American Heart Association (AHA-ATP III). ResultsThe prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ALT (> 40  U/L) were 7. 1 % and 22. 2 % in males, and 2. 1 % and 4. 8 % in females respectively. The prevalence of MS was 32. 1 % in males and 15. 4 % in females. The components of MS were significantly more in the group with elevated aminotransferase levels than in the group with normal aminotransferase levels. The odds ratios (95 % CI) for elevated AST were 1. 90 (1. 49, 2. 42), 2. 59 (2. 01, 3. 39), 1. 68 (1. 32, 2. 15), and 1. 81 (1. 36, 2. 42) in the adults with abdominal obesity, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> triglycerides levels, <b>high</b> blood pressure, and high plasma glucose levels respectively. After adjustment for age, the odds ratios (95 % CI) for elevated ALT were 3. 08 (2. 63, 3. 61), 4. 30 (3. 64, 5. 08), 1. 26 (1. 08, 1. 48), 2. 16 (1. 93, 2. 65) and 2. 38 (1. 96, 2. 87) in adults with abdominal obesity, <b>high</b> <b>serum</b> triglycerides levels, low serum high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL-C), high blood pressure, and high plasma glucose levels respectively. The odds ratios (95 % CI) for elevated AST were 1. 67 (1. 06, 2. 63), 2. 28 (1. 46, 3. 63), 2. 59 (1. 59, 4. 21) and for elevated ALT 2. 02 (1. 50, 2. 73), 2. 68 (1. 96, 3. 65), 3. 94 (2. 86, 5. 43) for the subjects with 1, 2, and ≥ 3 risk factors after adjustment for age, gender, and BMI.
