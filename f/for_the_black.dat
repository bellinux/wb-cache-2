5|$|The Ekaterina II {{class were}} {{a class of}} four battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. They were the first battleships built <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea Fleet. Their design was highly unusual in having the main guns on three barbettes grouped in a {{triangle}} around a central armored redoubt, two side-by-side forward {{and one on the}} centerline aft. This was intended to maximize their firepower forward, both when operating in the narrow waters of the Bosphorus and when ramming. Construction was slow because they were the largest warships built until then in the Black Sea and the shipyards had to be upgraded to handle them.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
