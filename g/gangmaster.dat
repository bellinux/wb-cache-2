50|$|<b>Gangmaster</b> Lin Liang Ren {{was found}} guilty of the {{manslaughter}} of at least 21 people (two further cocklers were thought to have been killed but their bodies were never found).

Ren was sentenced to 12 years for manslaughter, 6 years for facilitating illegal immigration (to be served concurrently with the manslaughter sentence), and 2 years for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice (to be served subsequent to the manslaughter sentence). Lin Mu Yong was sentenced to four years and nine months. Zhao Xiao Qing was sentenced to two years and nine months for facilitation of illegal immigration and perverting the course of justice.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2012 Confor (the Forestry {{industry}} body) broadly {{welcomed the}} government's {{response to the}} Forestry Task Force, but {{in a meeting with}} forestry minister Lord Taylor, chief executive Stuart Goodall expressed frustration that the issue of <b>Gangmaster</b> licensing had been left to the government's Red Tape Challenge, and said it will continue to lobby hard for complete exemption from licensing http://www.confor.org.uk/NewsAndEvents/Default.aspx?pid=130. As a result it issued a press statement in April 2012 http://www.confor.org.uk/NewsAndEvents/News.aspx?pid=23&id=1136, leading to coverage in several regional media outlets. These alleged that the GLA had an “in your face” http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Forestry-sector-end-face-spot-checks/story-15803053-detail/story.html style that is not only unnecessary but also costing jobs and harming British forests as small and medium-sized enterprises are no longer willing to take on work which might require GLA licences http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2012/04/11/north-east-forestry-firms-in-call-to-government-51140-30734495/ http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/country-view/farming/timber-jobs-tied-up-in-bonds-of-red-tape-1-4446951http://www.kms.ee/articles/Red_tape_potentially_inhibiting_forestry_job_creation?230 [...] The criticism failed to acknowledge the positive effect of the GLA's forestry pilot, which includes the removal of costly inspection fees complained of in the reports.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Gangmasters</b> (Licensing) Act 2004 covers {{some of the}} lowest-paid {{workers in}} a more {{comprehensive}} way. It {{was introduced in the}} wake of the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster. It requires all agencies (commonly known as [...] "gangmasters") which provide labour in the agricultural, shell fishing and food packaging sectors to operate under a licence. The <b>Gangmasters</b> Licensing Authority issues these (currently there are 1,159 licences) and it oversees and enforces standards requiring employees to be treated fairly.|$|R

50|$|In 2014, {{the subject}} of {{widening}} the GLA remit was again raised during the drafting phases of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 with proposals added by opposition Labour MP David Hanson who proposed an amendment http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2014-2015/0096/amend/pbc0961510a.551-552.html that would ‘enable the <b>Gangmasters</b> Licensing Authority to tackle modern day slavery'. The amendment {{would have given the}} Home Secretary the power to add other industries to the <b>Gangmasters</b> (Licensing) Act effectively providing scope to extend the GLA sector but it was voted down by the sitting coalition Government.|$|R
5000|$|The unreformed {{condition}} of the Poor Law, under which {{the support of the}} poor fell upon each individual parish, instead of a union of parishes, made landlords reluctant to erect cottages on the reclaimed land for the benefit of their tenants. Labour had to be obtained for the cultivation of these new lands. Women, girls and boys, being cheaper than men to employ, consequently made up the majority. The tendency to moral and physical ruin resulting from this nomadic life was so great that an inquiry into the {{condition of}} agricultural child labour was included in the reference to the commission on child-labour appointed in 1862, and the results were so startling that the [...] "Agricultural Gangs Act" [...] was passed in 1867, forbidding the employment of any child under eight years old, and of any female under a male <b>gangmaster,</b> unless a female licensed to act as gangmistress were also present.|$|E

Later he acted in Sultan, Vanshoddharakudu and Neeku Nenu Naaku Nuvvu which won Nandi Award for Akkineni Award for Best Home-viewing Feature Film. Later he acted in Raam and Billa, {{a film of}} the Don film series and acted with Prabhas for the first time.Later he acted in Thakita Thakita and Rebel.

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 5 February 2004, dozens of illegal Chinese workers were {{collecting}} cockles off the Cumbrian coast when rising tides led to 23 of them drowning in Morecambe Bay. They were all illegal immigrants, mainly from the Fujian province of China, and were described as untrained and inexperienced. They were being exploited by gang leader Lin Liangren, who paid them £5 per 25 kg of cockles. Local authorities were alerted {{by one of the}} gang members who contacted them on a mobile phone, but only one of the workers was rescued from the waters; partly because the phone call was unclear both on the extent and severity of the danger, and on their location. A total of 21 bodies, of men and {{women between the ages of}} 18 and 45, were recovered from the bay after the incident. Two of the victims were women; the vast majority were young men in their 20s and 30s and it is presumed that two more bodies were lost at sea. The disaster led to the <b>Gangmaster</b> Licensing Act 2004 and the formation of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority (also the perpetrator, Lin Liangren, was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, numerous others linked with the disaster were also imprisoned on immigration offences and of perverting the course of justice).|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, {{employment}} agencies were quasi-legal entities in international law. The International Labour Organisation in many Conventions called on member states to abolish them. However, the UK never signed up. The major piece of legislation which regulates agency practices is the Employment Agencies Act 1973, though it was slimmed considerably by the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. This abolished licences, so agencies operate without governmental oversight, except for a small inspectorate and occasional court cases. After the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster, Parliament enacted the <b>Gangmasters</b> (Licensing) Act 2004, requiring agencies (<b>gangmasters)</b> in the agricultural, shellfish and food packing sectors to be licensed.|$|R
50|$|The UK's main {{piece of}} {{legislation}} falls under the Employment Agencies Act 1973, which required licensing until 1994. There is an exception, for employment agencies working in the agricultural, shellfishing and food packing sectors, under the <b>Gangmasters</b> (Licensing) Act 2004.|$|R
