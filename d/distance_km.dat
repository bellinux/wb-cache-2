40|$|Abstract: The {{ability to}} {{reliably}} detect hazardous airborne biological materials is an inherently difficult and important problem for Defence (i. e., force protection), national security (i. e., detection of anthropogenic and natural hazards, evaluation of risks for first responders) and for ecological monitoring (i. e., air pollution). There are {{a multitude of}} approaches {{to the problem of}} biological detection, all of which differ in sophistication, sensitivity, efficiency, response time, deployment feasibility and cost. A key challenge of providing sound scientific advice on a prototype detection system is the ability to evaluate against these criteria in order to select the optimal solution for the operational requirements. An example of such a study is presented in the current paper. <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> ...|$|E

In Switzerland, all running races started in 1999 to record race times with an electronic chip system and all race results became available in this year on the websites of the specific races. Of all recorded races, only those half-marathons and marathons were considered which were held on a road, not on a trail. Only flat marathons were considered and no mountain marathons were included. For all considered races, start and finish {{had to be on}} the same altitude. Athletes with missing age were excluded from data analysis. In order to avoid a selection bias due to a limitation to top runners (e.g. annual fastest, annual ten fastest), we considered all finishers.

This study investigates the impact of opening a new RT clinic on distance and road travel time to RT, and overall utilisation for prostate and breast cancer patients over a 3 -year period in North Queensland (NQ), Australia. Methods: The study used retrospective audit of two radiotherapy databases and a geographic information system to illustrate patient origins and distance to the RT clinic used over 3 years. Prostate and female breast cancer patients were selected from the radiation oncology databases of The Townsville Hospital (TTH) and Radiation Oncology Queensland (ROQ) Cairns between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2013. Distance from a patient's home origin to the RT facility was mapped using a geographic information system (ArcGIS software), and travel time (minutes) and road <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> determined by Google Maps road directions.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationship}} between temperature and family composition of fly assemblages. Flies were surveyed at six locations in the Baekdudaegan mountain range (South Korea) at which mean annual temperature (MAT) ranged from 7. 3 °C to 9. 3 °C. Ten sampling sites were selected at each location, and flies were sampled at each site by 10 pitfall traps with an interval of 5  m in August 2009. Flies were identified at family level. Family temperature index was used to calculate community temperature indexes (CTI) of six locations. Through the sampling, 8, 526 flies in 41 families were collected. Phoridae was most abundant in six locations. Sciaridae, Muscidae, Heleomyzidae, and Mycetophilidae were also abundant. Values of CTI were positively related to values of MAT. Difference in temperature between locations had more influence on the family composition of fly assemblages compared with <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> between locations.

3000|$|... the <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> between producers’ {{house and}} their farms (DISTEX). Producers {{who have their}} farm close to their house will have less {{difficulty}} to transport organic fertilizers and other inputs used in the organic cotton production. This means that peasants who have their farms close to their house {{will be more likely}} to adopt organic farming. However, farms closed to producers’ houses are generally smaller in size, reducing thus the possibility to practice some cropping systems strongly encouraged in organic agriculture such as crop rotation and inter-cropping. In such a condition, producers who have their farms far from their houses would be more likely to practice organic cotton. In short, we hypothesized that the sign of the variable DISTEX will be positive or negative. Furthermore, we introduced the square of DISTEX in our probit model in order to check whether there is nonlinearity in the relationship between organic cotton adoption and the distance between producers’ house and their farm. In other words, we tested whether the relationship between the distance and the adoption of organic cotton is U-shaped or hill-shaped; [...]...|$|E
40|$|Mount Erebus {{has long}} been {{recognized}} to produce very similar seismic signatures associated with its Strombolian eruptions. Preliminary research performed on similar seismograms from December 1999 to January 2000 suggested a sudden decorrelation of the coda, accompanied by relative stability in the early seismogram. Using coda wave interferometry, this decorrelation was interpreted as a median change within the volcano. Closer examination of this data in this thesis shows that clipping due to event size variations {{as well as more}} subtle features controlled by event size strongly influence such analysis techniques. Once it became obvious that source effects were very important influences on seismogram similarity, more sophisticated methods were implemented to better understand them. A moving window cross correlation analysis demonstrated more comprehensively that eruption size is a significant factor in seismogram similarity. A surprising discovery {{to come out of this}} research was the existence of time bands of strong correlation, probably arising from scatterers within the volcano at some <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> from the lava lake, which are even visible in the late coda (30 + s).

40|$|U. S. policy {{initiatives}} {{have sought to}} improve health through attracting neighborhood supermarket investment. Little evidence exists to suggest that these policies will be effective, in particular where there are socioeconomic barriers to healthy eating. We measured the independent associations and combined interplay of supermarket access and socioeconomic status with obesity. Using data on 9702 UK adults, we employed adjusted regression analyses to estimate measured BMI (kg/m 2), overweight (25 ≥ BMI < 30) and obesity (≥ 30), across participants’ highest educational attainment (three groups) and tertiles of street network <b>distance</b> (<b>km)</b> from home location to nearest supermarket. Jointly-classified models estimated combined associations of education and supermarket distance, and relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). Participants farthest away from their nearest supermarket had higher odds of obesity (OR 1. 33, 95 % CI: 1. 11, 1. 58), relative to those living closest. Lower education was also associated with higher odds of obesity. Those least-educated and living farthest away had 3. 39 (2. 46 – 4. 65) times the odds of being obese, compared to those highest-educated and living closest, with an excess obesity risk (RERI = 0. 09); results were similar for overweight. Our results suggest that public health can be improved through planning better access to supermarkets, in combination with interventions to address socioeconomic barriers...|$|E
