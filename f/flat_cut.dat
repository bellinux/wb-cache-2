The 7th-century Forsbrook Pendant also mixes garnet and blue glass inlays. Anglo-Saxon enamel was also used in the production of jewellery, with coloured glass melted in separate cells.|$|E

50|$|During the 15th century, the Cerro del Chiquihuite {{was located}} {{on the shores of}} Lake Texcoco, some 9 to 12 {{kilometers}} from the heart of the Aztecan empire, Tenochtitlán. The Cerro del Chiquihuite was made principally of a pinkish and violet rock called andesita de lamprobolita, an extrusive igneous rock. One of the principle merits of this rock is the pseudo stratification of its deposited layers of varying thickness. This characteristic allows for <b>flat</b> <b>cuts</b> of stone to be obtained with ease to be used for the tiling of the floor, corners and overhead masonry.
