50|$|Two major {{methods have}} been used to measure glucose. The first, still in use in some places, is a {{chemical}} method exploiting the nonspecific reducing property of glucose in a reaction with an <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> that changes color when reduced. Since other blood compounds also have reducing properties (e.g., urea, which can be abnormally high in uremic patients), this technique can produce erroneous readings in some situations (5 to 15 mg/dL has been reported). The more recent technique, using enzymes specific to glucose, is less susceptible to this kind of error. The two most common employed enzymes are glucose oxidase and hexokinase.|$|E

40|$|The {{generally}} accepted hypothesis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics suggests that CSF is actively formed mainly by choroid plexuses, circulates unidirectionally along the brain ventricles and subarachnoid space, and is passively absorbed mainly into the dural venous sinuses. CSF formation rate (Vf) {{has been extensively}} studied by the ventriculo-cisternal perfusion technique, the results {{of which have been}} used as the key evidence for confirmation of this hypothesis. This method and the equation for the calculation of Vf have been established {{on the basis of the}} assumption that the dilution of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> is a consequence of a newly formed CSF, ie, that a higher CSF formation rate will result in a higher degree of dilution of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance.</b> However, it has been experimentally shown that the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> dilution inside the CSF system does not occur because of a “newly formed” CSF, but it is a consequence of a number of other factors (departure of substances into the surrounding tissue, passing around the collecting cannula into the cortical and spinal subarachnoid space, departure into the contralateral ventricle, etc). Using this technique it is possible to “calculate” the CSF formation even in dead animals, in an in vitro model, and in any other part of the CSF system outside the ventricles that is being perfused. Therefore, this method is indirect and any dilution of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> in the perfusate caused by other reasons would result in questionable and often contradictory conclusions regarding CSF formation rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) formation rate (Vf) {{has been extensively}} studied by the ventriculocisternal perfusion, a method still regarded as the most precise one. This method {{as well as the}} equation for the calculation of the CSF formation rate (Vf) was established by Heisey et al 4 on indicator dilution in perfusate. They assumed that the dilution of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> in perfusion is a consequence of newly formed CSF i. e. a higher CSF formation rate would result in a higher degree of dilution of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance.</b> Therefore, such method is indirect and any mistake in the interpretation of the degree of indicator dilution would lead to questionable and often contradictory results regarding CSF formation rates. According to Heisey’s equation, Vf shoud not depend on the rate of ventriculocisternal perfusion. However {{it has been shown that}} Vf is perfusion dependt value 10, and also that during perfusion the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> is partially absorbed into surrounding tissue. It is possible that obtained Vf dependence on perfusion rate was caused by observed absorption of indicator substances. For that reason, in anaesthetised cats ventriculocisternal perfusion was performed at higher (252. 0 mL/min) and at lower perfusion rate (65. 5 mL/min) and Vf was calculated at both experimental and corrected (just for absorbed amount) values of <b>indicator</b> <b>substance.</b> Since (inspite of the correction) the difference of 12. 4 mL/min between lower (15. 0 mL/min) and higher perfusion rate (27. 4 mL/min) was obtained, it is obvious that ventriculocisternal perfusion method cannot be considered reliable for measuring CSF formation rate...|$|E

30|$|The characterization, {{communication}} and minimization of risks emanated from organic micropollutants and pathogens {{in the water}} cycle are in {{the focus of the}} research project TransRisk. For risk characterization organic micropollutants are classified in toxicological relevant contaminant categories with the aim to identiy <b>indicator</b> <b>substances.</b> The entity of metabolites which are of toxicological relevance for humans will be used for conveying a risk quotient. In addition, micropollutant-induced selection processes in bacteria and pathogens, which take place already at low, sub-inhibitory concentrations and lead to the formation of pathogenic factors (virulence, resistance), are integrated into the risk characterization. For minimization of risks the combination of biological and oxidative (ozonation) waste water treatment as well as the application of iron bacteria in biological waste water treatment will be compared with more established treatment techniques such as activated carbon filtration. To evaluate the risks of drinking water contamination by micropollutants and pathogens the developed concept will be implemented in the Donauried region (Southern Germany), considering the entire urban water cycle (waste water, surface water, groundwater as well as drinking water). The developed approaches for the communication of risks will be directly applied in the region.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{requirements}} of the EU Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD, article 17. 2 a) criteria for the assessment of the chemical status of groundwater have to be developed, which may serve as starting points for a trend reversal (article 17. 2 b) in case the good status is failed. Against this background an EU-wide applicable approach to assess natural background levels (NBLs) and threshold values (TVs) for the definition of the groundwater chemical status has been developed. NBLs are derived based on a preselection method using aquifer typologies as natural reference systems. Samples with purely anthropogenic substances (e. g. PAC, pesticides) as well as samples, in which <b>indicator</b> <b>substances</b> for anthropogenic inputs (e. g. nitrate) are exceeding a certain value, are excluded. The NBLs are defined for the remaining groundwater samples of the aquifer typology under concern as the concentration range between the 10 % and 90 % percentiles. The threshold values (TVs) get established with reference to the NBLs and a "not acceptable reference value" (REF), e. g. drinking water standards or toxicological values, guaranteeing that the TVs are higher than the NBLs, but lower than the REF values. The applicability of the methodology for NBL and TV derivation has been applied to the transboundary groundwater body of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany, Switzerland and France...|$|R

The ideal indicator dilution curve is one which measures the instantaneous time-concentration relationship of the <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> without distortion.

Participants were 241 nursing students enrolled in their first year of nursing courses at seven colleges and universities located across the United States. Findings indicated that 42 % of students scored higher than the EARS mean; 24 % reported current substance use; and 15 % scored in the probable abuse/dependence category of CAGE. Students who reported current substance use and those scoring in the probable substance abuse/dependence category {{were significantly more likely to}} score above the EARS median.

Such identification of collateral ves-sels aids understanding {{of some of}} the symptoms of chronic liver disease (1 - 4). The size and lo-cation of collateral vessels is shown; however, the blood flow through them is not measured. Cer-tain syndromes, such as the neurological complica-tions of chronic liver disease (portal systemic en-cephalopathy), depend more on the total collateral blood flow than on the presence of any specific col-lateral vessels (5). This paper reports a method for measuring the portal collateral blood flow and its application in 12 patients.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} some methods of making human {{exposure}} estimates, aimed at describing the human exposure for selected air pollutants in Sweden that are suspected carcinogens. Nitrogen oxides (NOX) {{have been chosen}} as an <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> for estimating the concentration of the urban plume. Earlier investigations {{have shown that the}} traffic in Swedish cities contributes around 85 % to the measured NOx concentrations, and that most of the mutagenicity in urban air originates from traffic. The first section of this paper describes measurements in Stockholm of some unregulated light hydrocarbons, such as ethene, ethyne, propane, propene, butane, and isobutane. In addition, measurements of some volatile aromatic hydrocarbons are presented. Simultaneous measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) were made. The ratios between CO and the individual specific compounds were determined by linear regression analysis. By analysis of relationships between CO and NO X, NO concentrations {{can be used as a}} tracer to describe the exposure for these specific compounds. NOX are considered to be a better tracer than CO, because NOX or NO 2 values exist for many places over a long time, while CO is measured mostly in streets with high concentrations. At low concentrations, instruments that measure normal CO levels give no detectable signals. Through use of atmospheric dispersion models and models that describe how people live and work in urban areas it has been possible to describe the average exposure to NOx in cities of different sizes. The exposure to NOx for people living in the countryside has also been estimated. In this way, it has been possible to calculate the average exposure dose for NOX for the Swedish population. This figure is 23 pg/mi 3.

40|$|The indicator-dilution {{method was}} used in the dog in an attempt to define the {{proportion}} of the "central " blood volume contained in the lung vessels. When injections were made into the pulmonary artery with sampling from the femoral artery only half or even less of the calculated blood volume could be accounted for by the lungs. When;i venous injection site was used, the proportion in the lungs was reduced to a third or less. Thus when peripheral sites are used for the inscription of indicator-dilution curves few deductions can be made about either the actual volume or even relative changes in the volume of blood in the lungs. PROVIDED certain conditions are ful-filled, the volume of a vascular compart-ment may be measured by analysis of a dilu-tion curve obtained at the outlet after rapid injection of an indicator at the inlet. In the Stewart-Hamilton method the volume is rep-resented by the product of the cardiac output and the mean transit line of the indicator particles. 1 Mathematical proof of the validity of this measurement has been published by Meier and Zierler. 2 Attempts {{have been made in the}} past to assess changes in the volume of blood in the vessels of the kings by measuring a volume variously termed as "central, " "intratho-racic, " or "cardiopulmonary.

To explore if or how any bacteria associated with muscle-invading Anisakis larvae may affect the spoilage rate of fish mince, a controlled storage trial was conducted. Fillets of farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), exclusively fed on dried and heat-treated compound feed and hence expectably free from Anisakis larvae, were aseptically collected and homogenised. Fish mince aliquots were added different volumes of Anisakis homogenate based on larvae which were freshly sampled from the visceral cavity of NE Atlantic blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The volumes of added parasite homogenate (parasite(+) -samples) reflected different infection intensities from 15 (low) to 50 (high) larvae per 100 g fish fillet, representing an actual Anisakis intensity range in the flesh of blue whiting. The samples were kept at 4 °C for 15 days and subjected to microbiological, sensory and chemical evaluation at 3 days intervals. Upon visual examination and plate count measurements (PC) on Iron Agar Lyngby (IAL), the samples without any parasite additives (no[parasite]) spoiled differently and more rapidly than any of the parasite(+) -samples. However, H 2 S-producing bacteria were only recorded in the latter samples, which were also the only ones that showed increased levels of the spoilage <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> trimethylamine (TMA). Moreover, the parasite(+) -samples changed their sensory characteristics at a later stage compared to the no[parasite]-samples. Although some cultures of H 2 S-producing bacteria were found on IAL, molecular identification by PCR-DGGE of the actual bacteria was not conclusive. Psychrobacter sp. which has no or only little spoilage activity, was identified in all samples until trial day 9, but was probably outgrown by the stronger spoilers Pseudomonas fluorescence/fragi and Photobacterium phosphoreum. Thus, and somewhat unexpected, our findings indicate that – under the present trial conditions – fish mince contaminated with bacteria which originate from Anisakis larvae, spoiled less rapidly than samples without any parasite-related bacteria present. Moreover, the shelf-life of fish mince was apparently not reduced by the presence of bacteria transferred to the mince by Anisakis larvae...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the current}} issues widely {{discussed}} among numerous research groups and in lots of scientific papers refers {{to the role of}} the free radicals and their adversaries, specifically in the human skin. The objective of this thesis was to investigate whether there is a correlation, and if so which, between the cutaneous antioxidative status and the roughness of the skin as a macroscopic measurand. From the group of carotenoids, lycopene and β-carotene were selected as <b>indicator</b> <b>substance</b> for the antioxidative protective system. These two components could be determined noninvasively, in vivo, at high accuracy and reproducibly using a Raman resonance spectroscopic system specifically developed at the Center of Experimental and Applied Cutaneous Physiology (CCP), Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergology of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin. This permitted to address a second objective of the present thesis, namely to influence the bio-availability of β-carotene by varying the cooking conditions for carrots, pepper, broccoli and potatoes, and by varying the storage conditions for regular plums. Using the PRIMOS- 3 D-measuring system, it could be demonstrated in the experiments that the roughness of the skin of the volunteers, whose age variance was restricted to only 10 years (40 - 50 years), was the lower the higher their antioxidative status of the skin. This correlation, which could be successfully detected for the first time via the lycopene content, clearly showed that an optimum supply of the skin with carotenoids considerably influences the ageing process and that the intake of healthy food is an excellent preventive strategy against premature skin aging. The determined changes in the β-carotene concentrations during the cooking process permitted to roughly divide carrots, pepper, broccoli and potatoes into two groups. While in group I the β-carotene values increased with extended cooking time (carrot, yellow pepper, potato type „Rosaria“),the group II vegetables, i. e., broccoli, red pepper and potatoes of types „Arkula“ and „Adretta“ showed a decline of bio-available β-carotene. This could be due to the different composition of the total of antioxidants functioning as protective chains in the respective vegetables. Surprisingly, the β-carotene content of the „Rosaria“ type potato with its red peel, was comparably high to that of carrots or yellow pepper. Different storage conditions of stone fruit (Prunus domestica) resulted in strong changes of the measured β-carotene concentrations. If stored at room temperature, the bio-availability increases with storage time; if stored at 6 °C, β-carotene remains stable for 96 h. The addition of alcohol increases the bio-availability of carotene in the fruits with time until a decay due to transition into the alcoholic phase results in a reduction of β-carotene in the fruits. This thesis shows that antioxidants, above all carotenoids like lycopene and β-carotene, play an extremely important role for the condition of the skin. For an optimum supply with these substances, the results of the cooking and storage experiments permit a simple recommendation. Vegetables should be eaten raw but not completely cooked, duly considering that fruit and vegetables contain not only carotenoids but a variety of different antioxidants which protect each other against the destructive action of the free radicals. A highly efficient antioxidant, such as Vitamin C, is temperature-sensitive, although stabilised by a high carotenoid concentation. Regular plums should preferably be stored 72 h in alcohol before eating. The antioxidative protective system of the skin should be affected scarcely or not at all by the low alcohol amount in the stored plums...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{are able}} to produce {{a wide variety of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds. This thesis deals with sampling, analysis and identification of such compounds, produced by microorganisms commonly found in buildings. The volatiles were sampled on adsorbents and analysed by thermal desorption cold trap-injection gas chromatography, with flame ionization and mass-spectrometric detection. The injection was optimized, with respect to the recovery of adsorbed components and the efficiency of the chromatographic separation, using multivariate methods. Eight adsorbents were evaluated with the object of finding the most suitable for sampling microbial volatiles. Among the adsorbents tested, Tenax TA proved to have the best properties for the purpose. Some carbon-containing adsorbents, e. g., Tenax GR and Carbopack B, showed a catalytic effect on thermal decomposition of some compounds, mainly terpene derivatives. Five fungal species, Aspergillus versicolor, Pénicillium commune, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Paecilomyces variotii and Phialophora fastigiata, and anactinomycete, Streptomyces albidoflavus, were cultivated on various artificial media and/or building materials. Cultivation was performed in culture flasks, provided with air inlet and outlet tubes. Humidified air was constantly led through the flasks, and samples were taken by attaching adsorbent tubes to the outlet tubes of the flasks. The cultivation medium proved to be of vital importance for metabolite production, quantitatively as well as qualitatively. For Streptomyces albidoflavus the effect of medium, cultivation temperature, and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the supplied air on the production of volatiles, was studied using multivariate techniques. The medium and the temperature exerted the largest influence, but the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels also affected the amounts of some metabolites produced. The produced volatile metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and reference compounds. Alcohols, ketones, sulphur compounds and terpenes were most frequently found, but hydrocarbons, ethers and esters were also produced by some species. Among the most commonly produced metabolites, which are also suggested as potential <b>indicator</b> <b>substances</b> for excessive growth of microorganisms in buildings, were 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone, 3 -methyl- 2 -pentanone, dimethyl disulphide, -methylfuran,  2, 5 -dimethylfuran and geosmin.

40|$|Forest {{biomass is a}} {{significant}} <b>indicator</b> for <b>substance</b> accumulation and forest succession, and a spatiotemporal biomass map would provide valuable information for forest management and scientific planning. In this study, Landsat imagery and field data cooperated with a random forest regression approach were used to estimate spatiotemporal Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province of East China. As a result, the AGB retrieval showed an increasing trend for the past decade, from 74. 24 ton/ha in 2004 to 99. 63 ton/ha in 2013. Topography and forest management were investigated to find their relationships with the spatial distribution change of biomass. In general, the simulated AGB increases with higher elevation, especially {{in the range of}} 80 – 200 m, wherein AGB acquires the highest increase rate. Moreover, the forest policy of ecological forest has a positive effect on the AGB increase, particularly within the national level ecological forest. The result in this study demonstrates that human activities have a great impact on biomass distribution and change tendency. Furthermore, Landsat image-based biomass estimates would provide illuminating information for forest policy-making and sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Despite thewell-established {{finding that}} American Indian {{adolescents}} {{are at a}} greater risk of illicit substance use and abuse than the general population, few generalist explanations of deviance have been extended to American Indian substance use. Using a popular gen-eralist explanation of deviance, General Strain Theory (GST), we explore the predictive utility of this model with a subsample of American Indian adolescents fromWaves I and II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add-Health). Overall, we find mixed support for the utility ofGST to account forAmerican Indian adolescent substance use. While exposure to recent life events, a common measure of stress exposure, was found to be a robust <b>indicator</b> of <b>substance</b> use, we found mixed support for the thesis that negative affect plays a key role inmediating the link between strain and substance use. However, we did find evidence that personal and social resources serve to condition the link between stress exposure and substance use,with parental control, self-restraint, reli-giosity, and exposure to substance using peers each serving to moderate the association between strain and substance use, albeit in more complex ways than expected...|$|R
