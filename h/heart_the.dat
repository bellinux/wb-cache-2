Faith is like a tree which thrives with good water and hypocrisy is like an abscess which thrives on pus and blood. Whichever flourishes more, be it the tree of faith or the abscess of hypocrisy, wins control of the heart." ...|$|R

5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial effusion, which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an effusion. This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
5|$|Excess {{intake of}} calcium may cause hypercalcaemia, {{but because of}} the inefficient {{absorption}} of calcium by the intestines a more likely cause is excessive vitamin D intake or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It can also occur due to the bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasise to bone. This results in deposition of calcium salts into the <b>heart,</b> <b>the</b> blood vessels, and the kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia may lead to soft tissue calcification, which can lead to serious consequences: for example, calcification of the vascular wall can lead to a loss of elasticity and the disruption of laminar blood flow, and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Likewise, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intake results in hypocalcaemia, often caused by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective receptors to it in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, potentially causing tetany and defects in cardiac conduction.|$|E
5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning.

At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have known}} about <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood. From the primarily religious views of earlier societies towards <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> ancient Greeks are considered {{to have been the}} primary seat of scientific understanding of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> in <b>the</b> ancient world. Aristotle considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as <b>the</b> source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to <b>the</b> lungs. Erasistratos (304–250 BCE) noted <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood. He also discovered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> valves.|$|R
50|$|If {{there is}} a defect in the septum, it is {{possible}} for blood to travel from the left side of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to <b>the</b> right side of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> or <b>the</b> other way around. Since the right side of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> contains venous blood with a low oxygen content, and the left side of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> contains arterial blood with a high oxygen content, it is beneficial to prevent any communication between the two sides of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> and prevent <b>the</b> blood from the two sides of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> from mixing with each other.|$|R
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E

Sophie finds Howl in bird form, and takes him back to Calcifer. The witch returns Howl's heart, and Sophie places it back inside Howl, {{returning}} him to life and freeing Calcifer. Howl wakes up and Sophie embraces him. Although Calcifer is now free, he returns to his former company. Suliman, watching through a crystal globe, decides to end the war. Howl, Sophie, and the others are seen high in the air in a new flying castle, while the bombers return from the war.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{respiration}} {{is accomplished}} without lungs. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses {{a system of}} internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of {{little more than a}} single, perforated dorsal tube that pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the hemolymph, arthropods' fluid analog of blood, inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through openings {{on the sides of the}} abdomen called spiracles.|$|E

Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus.

5|$|Many {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana narrate the {{friendship}} and companionship developed between Trijata and Sita. Trijata fulfils two important objectives: she comforts Sita and constantly updates Sita about the happenings {{of the war}} and the welfare of Rama. The Balaramadasa Ramayana describes Trijata assuaging Sita's grief when they hear that Indrajit has wounded Rama and Lakshmana a second time. In the Balaramayana of Rajasekhara, Trijata employs two rakshasas to bring her news from the battlefield. The Ananda Ramayana narrates that, upon hearing Lakshmana's conch sound, Sita urges Trijata to find out what has happened. Trijata learns of the death of Indrajit by Lakshmana and passes the news to Sita. The Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas also depicts Trijata breaking the news of Indrajit's death to Sita, upon her inquiry. In another episode in the text, the two discuss the impending duel between Rama and Ravana {{on the final day of}} war. Sita is concerned that the ten-headed Ravana is invincible and will magically regrow his severed heads. Trijata reassures Sita that Rama will slay Ravana by shooting an arrow through the demon-king's <b>heart.</b> <b>The</b> text emphasizes that Trijata is a devotee of Rama, a feature also found in the Bhavartha Ramayana.|$|E
