40|$|Building with {{earth is}} one of the most ancient and {{traditional}} ways of building. Consequently, many historic and new-built earthen buildings can be found all over the world. However, the specific characteristics of earthen materials make the <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> very sensitive to external damaging agents. In particular, the weakness and fragility extensively recognized on earthen materials make this type of constructions very vulnerable from a structural perspective. In general, the structural damage on <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> occurs in the form of cracks, which debilitate the structural behaviour and compromise the durability. Injection of mud grouts can be seen as a reliable and economic solution for repairing <b>earth</b> <b>constructions.</b> The success of such intervention on a historical construction requires following an appropriated design methodology. However, the knowledge about mud grouts is still limited, and thus research efforts are needed in order to develop such methodology and to surpass many of the difficulties that the restorers of <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> are currently facing. Understanding the rheology of the mud grouts {{is one of}} the key issues of the all process. Hence, this paper explains an initial proposal of methodology for the design of mud grouts and an experimental campaign that aimed to understand the role of the clay fraction in the rheology of mud grouts.

40|$|Framework) The {{structural}} damage {{often found in}} <b>earth</b> <b>constructions,</b> can result from several factors and agents. Nevertheless, earthquakes are often object of great concern among the researchers dealing with this construction typology. In fact, strong earthquakes {{have a very high}} destructive effect on <b>earth</b> <b>constructions,</b> e. g. the complete destruction of Bam city, in Iran, during the 2003 earthquake, where adobe was the predominant construction typology. Several reasons contribute to the vulnerability of <b>earth</b> <b>constructions,</b> such as the low strength and fragility of the material and the overall high dead-weight. The fragile and weak connections are repeatedly appointed as the main reason for their collapse. Furthermore, their seismic behaviour problems are increased if the cracking is introduced by other decay agents, as for example, structural deficiencies and foundation settlements, are present. Cracking reduces the structure overall stiffness, especially if the cracks are localized in the connection between walls. In order to recover the initial stiffness of those constructions, repairing measures are required. Reconstruction of the damaged areas is an often applied solution. For new constructions this is a reliable solution. For historic constructions it is questionable because the identity of the construction can be deeply changed. Grouting can be used as an alternative repair solution for cracks in walls and damaged connections, on precondition that the compatibility of materials and durability are respected, since it is an irreversible solution. Therefore, mud based grouts seem to be the most suitable choice regarding these concerns. Moreover, grouting can also be used as complement of other strengthening solutions, like application of ties, and filling of voids and gaps in order to prevent further decay by, for example, water infiltration. (Background) In the literature concerning the conservation of <b>earth</b> <b>constructions,</b> studies and trials of mud based grout application for consolidation of <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> can be found. Nevertheless, the knowledge about these grouts is very limited. Therefore, mud grouts are still to be explored {{in order to have a}} proper design methodology developed. The reactivity to water of the active element of earth (clay) is a major drawback and brings great difficulties and problems to the grouts formulation, where five parameters are at stake: rheology, stability, shrinkage, strength and bond. The relationship between them has to be studied in order to allow the development of mud grouts embracing the requirements that can lead to successful grouting interventions, and to access their limitations. (Paper objectives) This paper aims, in general, to contribute for the development of compatible grouts for the repairing of <b>Earth</b> <b>constructions.</b> It will present the first results of an ongoing experimental research concerned mainly with the study of the grouts rheology, and bond development between the grout and the original materials. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{rammed earth}} {{technique}} {{has a significant}} presence in the earthen built heritage, where it served to build from simple dwellings to fortresses. However, the high vulnerability of rammed <b>earth</b> <b>constructions</b> to decay agents and to seismic events puts at risk their further existence {{and the lives of}} millions of people. With respect to the seismic behaviour of rammed earth walls, the understanding and modelling of their shear behaviour are topics rarely approached in literature. Nevertheless, these topics are of extreme importance in the preservation and strengthening of rammed <b>earth</b> <b>constructions.</b> This paper presents an experimental and numerical work where the shear behaviour of unstabilised rammed earth (URE) is analysed. The experimental program consisted in the testing of several URE wallets under diagonal compression, which allowed {{a better understanding of the}} shear behaviour of URE.
