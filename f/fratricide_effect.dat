Moreover, assuming the entire world stockpile of weapons were grouped together, it would be difficult, due to the nuclear <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect,</b> to ensure the individual weapons would go off all at once. Nonetheless, many people believe that a full-scale nuclear war would result, through the nuclear winter effect, in the extinction of the human species, though not all analysts agree on the assumptions that underpin these nuclear winter models.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Noise effects {{induced by}} {{elongation}} {{have to be}} considered globally in a multi-channel tomographic reconstruction analysis. Such an analysis allows a fine estimation of performance and to compare launching op-tions. We developed a modal LGS tomographic code based on pseudo-analytical matrix formalism. This modal analysis is computing and memory intensive. Therefore we limit the simulation to downscaled cases with di-ameters ranging from D = 4 to 21 m. We also limit the number of turbulent layers to a few equivalent layers. Including spot elongation and Rayleigh <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect,</b> when considering a global tomographic reconstruction, edge launching gives lightly better performance and limits the risk of possible underestimation of fratricide scatter. ...|$|E
40|$|Cytotoxic T {{lymphocytes}} (CTLs) {{have been}} shown to be relatively resistant to cytolytic attack by other CTLs. We show here, however, that cloned CTLs, in the absence of other cells, are destroyed by exposure to their cognate peptides (defined as those that in association with major histocompatibility complex proteins are recognized by the antigen-specific receptor of the T cell). Destruction is proportional to peptide concentration and can be prevented by a second peptide that competes with the cognate peptide for presentation by the class I major histocompatibility complex proteins of the CTLs. The speed and extent of peptide-induced changes in the appearance of CTLs suggest that the destruction may be due primarily to self-recognition and self-destruction of individual CTLs (suicide) rather than to the destruction of some CTLs by others of the same clone in the same culture (<b>fratricide).</b> This <b>effect</b> may also take place in vivo because the appropriately timed injection of a cognate peptide into ovalbumin-immunized mice appeared to deplete their spleens of primed anti-ovalbumin CTLs. The results point to a possible physiologic mechanism for postthymic elimination of cytolytic T cells that recognize their own peptides in association with their own major histocompatibility complex protein. The results also raise the possibility that cognate peptides might eventually prove therapeutically useful for eliminating CTL clones that cause pathological cell destruction, as in some autoimmune diseases and some viral infections...|$|R
40|$|This thesis contextualises and {{explores the}} reconceptualization {{of the myth}} of Eteokles and Polyneices in Greek, Latin and Italian tragedy, the {{literary}} genre that {{more than any other}} offers the opportunity to trace its progressive transformation across a series of relatively continuous and consistent phases. Within these limits, this study represents the first comprehensive, systematic and detailed comparative analysis of the cultural development of this myth, charting the shaping of its key themes: war and rivalry, autochthony and patriotism, the connection between incest, parricide and <b>fratricide,</b> the <b>effects</b> of predestination/family curse, the clash between private and public interests, and the legitimate limits of power. By means of a close examination of the thesis’ main corpus (constituted by Aeschylus’ Seven against Thebes, Sophocles’ Antigone, Oedipus Tyrannos and Oedipus at Colonus, Euripides’ Phoenician Women, Seneca’s Oedipus and Phoenissae, Dolce’s Giocasta and Alfieri’s Polinice) this dissertation demonstrates that the brothers are not merely two stereotypical types whose characterisation as mortal enemies remains static and unvaried. Although their rivalry never stops, the meaning, dynamic and purpose of their struggle are progressively but profoundly transformed throughout the centuries. In particular, I argue that the martial component that initially defined this myth, admittedly important throughout its legacy, is variously adapted to accommodate either a warning against the horrors of violence and subjugation, a cautionary appeal against overly aggressive foreign policy, a denunciation of the unbearable price of civil strife, or an aspiration to pacifism. In parallel, I analyse how the reflection on power and power struggle becomes increasingly predominant, eventually displacing the war theme as the main focus of this myth with a warning against the dangers of tyranny...|$|R
40|$|Laser beams {{projected}} {{from the}} ground to form laser guide stars (LGS) experience scattering and absorption that reduce their intensity as they propagate through the atmosphere. Some fraction of the scattered light will be collected by the other LGS wavefront sensors and causes additional background {{in parts of the}} pupil. This cross-talk {{is referred to as the}} <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect.</b> In this paper we quantify the magnitude of four different sources of scattering/absorption and back scattering, and evaluate their impact on performance with various zenith angles and turbulence profiles for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) MCAO system, NFIRAOS. The resulting wavefront error is on the order of 5 to 20 nm RMS, provided that the mean background from the fratricide can be calibrated and subtracted with an accuracy of 80...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of our}} study of the {{so-called}} <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e. the increased background observed in a number of a wavefront sensor’s sub-apertures, due to the scattering of laser photons on dust or clouds particles or air molecules located along a laser beam. Using the formalism developed by the LIDAR community, we computed the background levels to be expected on various kinds of adaptive optics systems to be installed eventually on the E-ELT (42 m). In the case of pure Rayleigh backscattering, the induced background, expected to be constant (as it mainly depends on the air molecules density), is not a show stopper. We however stress that in the presence of sub-visible clouds or dust particles along the laser beam, the significant amount of induced background, which is likely to be variable, could potentially affect the performance of AO systems. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the data preprocessing and reduction methods together with SLODAR analysis and wind profiling techniques for GeMS: the Gemini MCAO System. The wavefront gradient {{measurements of the}} five GeMS's Shack-Hartmann sensors, each one pointing to a laser guide star, are combined with the DM commands sent to three deformable mirrors optically conjugated at 0, 4. 5 and 9 km in order to reconstruct pseudo-open loop slopes. These pseudo-open loop slopes are then used to reconstruct atmospheric turbulence profiles, based on the SLODAR and wind-profiling methods. We introduce the SLODAR method, and how it has been adapted {{to work in a}} close-loop, multi Laser Guide Star system. We show that our method allows characterizing the turbulence of up to 16 layers for altitudes spanning from 0 to 19 km. The data preprocessing and reduction methods are described, and results obtained from observations made in 2011 are presented. The wind profiling analysis is shown to be a powerful technique not only for characterizing the turbulence intensity, wind direction and speed, but also as it can provide a verification tool for SLODAR results. Finally, problems such as <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect</b> in multiple laser system due to Rayleigh scattering, centroid gain variations, and limitations of the method are also addressed.

40|$|Laser {{tomography}} and multiconjugate {{adaptive optics}} are under development for ground-based extremely large telescopes. Continuous wave sodium guide star lasers {{are planned for}} these systems, but their use raises some difficulties due to the extended nature of the beacons generated in the mesosphere and their spatiotemporal variability. We describe a performance analysis {{on the impact of}} laser launch telescope (LLT) location for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) multiconjugate adaptive optics system. A semianalytical first-order noise propagation calculation is presented, supplemented by end-to-end Monte Carlo physical optics simulations. The principal conclusion of the study is that modestly superior performance is achieved with multiple LLT locations around the primary mirror, compared to a single central LLT behind the secondary mirror, but the largest value of any of these improvements is of the order of 20 nm rms for the expected wavefront sensor noise levels, suggesting that the final choice of geometry should depend primarily on the cost and complexity of implementation trade-off. This conclusion is also fully supported by the fact that, for the TMT 70 arcsec laser guide star (LGS) asterism, the <b>fratricide</b> <b>effect</b> reduces the performance of the central launch geometry by only a small amount. The reduction ranges from only a few nm rms at zenith to a few tens of nm at a 45 ° zenith angle in the worst case that the effect cannot be calibrated...|$|E
