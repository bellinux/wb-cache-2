40|$|Objectives {{of family}} {{planning}} that are usually mentioned are unwanted pregnancy prevention, extensive population growth reduction, health improvement of women, children and population as a whole. The study objective was to make an assessment {{about the state of}} knowledge and characteristics of using methods for family planning in women of diferente age in the Municipality of Nis. The study included 1584 women aged 15 - 49. The data were collected by conducting the poll. Contraception was defined as the method {{of family planning}} mostly by <b>interviewees</b> older than 35 years of age, while this was the least case with <b>interviewees</b> younger than the age of 20. The <b>interviewees</b> younger than the age of 20 usually get information from several sources, the older, from newspapers and media. The <b>interviewees</b> up to 35 years of age think that condom is the most efficient method of contraception. The <b>interviewees</b> aged 36 - 49 think that the most efficient method of contraception is the intra-uterus spiral. Most of the <b>interviewees</b> (88. 8 %) estimate their knowledge about contraception as satisfactory. 81. 9 % of <b>interviewees,</b> having sexual relations protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy permanently or occasionally. Modern means of contraception are used by 72 % of <b>interviewees</b> younger than the age of 20. <b>Interviewees</b> of all age categories mostly make the decision on their own about the contraception use. 35 % of <b>interviewees</b> estimate their method of contraception as completely safe. The greatest number of <b>interviewees</b> with intentionally interrupted pregnancies came from the age group 36 - 49 (53. 8 %).

5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees were above reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the <b>interviewee</b> might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E

30|$|Reactivity {{occurs when}} the {{collected}} data and observations are taking place just because the investigator is there. The first part of our interview protocol was built to avoid this kind of phenomena, specially when we did “breaking the ice” questions, {{trying to make the}} <b>interviewees</b> comfortable. At a first moment, <b>interviewees</b> may get intimidated by the recording equipment, but after some minutes they forget that they are being recorded and begin to act more naturally. A small part (approximately 20 %) of the <b>interviewees</b> already knew the researchers before the interviews and had a previous relationship with them.

The method {{of choice is}} focus group interview which allowed to investigate our <b>interviewees</b> thoughts and perceptions. This method facilitate space where opinions and knowledge are generated between the <b>interviewees.</b> Based on theory concepts from Pierre Bourdieu, Abraham Maslow, Henrik Dahl and Preben Sepstrup the study concludes that the <b>interviewee’s</b> habitus and capital - which are parts of the life situation - represents factors that influence the <b>interviewee’s</b> choices of respectively the physical and digital magazine and the digital source of information. In addition the <b>interviewees</b> view of relevance, information needs, view of information value and view of information costs are also factors that influence their choices...|$|R

During research, one <b>interviewee</b> recommended using the A303 to reach southwest England, adding it was [...] "less boring than the motorway, and you've always got Stonehenge". The programme was praised for its eclecticism and enthusiasm for {{what could have been a}} tedious subject.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>interviewee,</b> François, {{a middle-aged}} woodcutter who {{spent time in}} the forests inland (east) from the main road between Morondava and Belo sur Mer, and five of his friends, {{reported}} seeing kidoky recently. [...] Their description of the animal and François's imitation of its long call were virtually identical to Pascou's. [...] One {{of the young men}} insisted that its fur had a lot of white in it, but the other men could not confirm that. François and his friends reported that it had never climbed a tree in their presence, and that it flees on the ground in short leaps or bounds. [...] When Burney imitated the sideways leaping of a sifaka moving on the ground, one of the men corrected him, pointing out that he was imitating a sifaka. [...] The man's imitation of the gallop kidoky used was very baboon-like. The men also reported that imitating its call can draw the animal closer and cause it to continue calling.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{increasing}} professionalism of research managers and administrators. The paper firstly discusses recent changes to the research environment and follows with changes to research administration. Then follows with the discussion of the research method and research findings. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with research managers and administrators working in various Higher Education Institutions in the North West of England during the period from June to August 2005. Four <b>interviewees</b> were research managers and administrators working in research support and another four working in research students support areas. Two research support officers and two research student administrators have research backgrounds while the other two have administration background. The interview questions aim to seek the <b>interviewees</b> comments on the development of knowledge and skills that facilitate them to perform their role and the preference modes for delivering the professional development events. The <b>interviewees</b> working on different areas have different requirement on their knowledge requirement. The <b>interviewees</b> working in research student support area think it is important to develop their knowledge on their understanding of students needs. While, the <b>interviewees</b> working in research support suggested that it is important to be kept updated on changes to the research environment and relevant policies. The <b>interviewees</b> with different backgrounds have different skills training needs. <b>Interviewees</b> with research background suggested it is important to provide research skills training for colleagues who do not have research background. On the other hand, <b>interviewees</b> with administration background think their administration skills should be further enhanced. All <b>interviewees</b> prefer that professional development events be delivered in informal mode, such as conference and workshops...|$|R
30|$|All {{interviews}} were digitally recorded and transcribed. After {{a member of}} the research team reviewed the transcripts, they were returned to the <b>interviewees</b> for further clarification or editorial corrections.

All <b>interviewees</b> returned their transcripts and confirmed that the data were accurate. Once all transcripts were confirmed they were de-identified for analysis.|$|R
30|$|Most <b>interviewees</b> {{would prefer}} it if less or easier {{mobility}} {{was required to}} participate in their daily activities. In particular, the number of transfers on public transport required or the overall travel time {{are considered to be}} inconvenient. Two <b>interviewees</b> use the car on a regular basis for their daily mobility, three more households own a car, but two <b>interviewees</b> only use it as a passenger. Even though five additional <b>interviewees</b> indicate the wish to own a private automobile, they are also aware of the disadvantages, such as congestion or parking issues, and therefore, would not use an automobile for daily mobility. The desire to own a car is therefore not necessarily connected to the need for a car.|$|R
500|$|Barlow {{played the}} part of the detectives during filming, asking scripted {{questions}} to Seifert's character, but is never featured in Her Story. When watching police interviews for research, Barlow found himself empathising with the <b>interviewee,</b> which inspired him to exclude the detective from the game. He stated that the interviews typically feature [...] "double betrayal", in which the detectives are [...] "pretending to be the best friend". Barlow felt that removing the detective from the game empowers Seifert's character, allowing players to empathise. When conducting research for Her Story, Barlow looked at the case regarding the murder of Travis Alexander, which made him consider the manner that female murder suspects are treated in interrogations, stating that they [...] "tend to be fetishised, more readily turned into archetypes". This was further proved to Barlow when studying the interviews of Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox; he found that media commentary often ignored the evidence of the investigation, instead focusing on the expressions of the suspects during the interviews. Barlow conducted further research by studying texts about psychology, and the use of language.|$|E
500|$|Berkeley sees machinima as [...] "a strangely hybrid form, looking {{forwards}} and backwards, {{cutting edge}} and conservative {{at the same}} time". Machinima is a digital medium based on 3-D computer games, but most works have a linear narrative structure. Some, such as Red vs. Blue and The Strangerhood, follow narrative conventions of television situational comedy. Nitsche agrees that pre-recorded ("reel") machinima tends to be linear and offers limited interactive storytelling; he sees more opportunities in machinima performed live and with audience interaction. In creating their improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and talk show Tra5hTa1k with ILL Will, the ILL Clan blended real and virtual performance by creating the works on-stage and interacting with a live audience. In another combination of real and virtual worlds, Chris Burke's talk show This Spartan Life takes place in Halo 2s open multiplayer environment. There, others playing in earnest may attack the host or his <b>interviewee.</b> Although other virtual theatrical performances {{have taken place in}} chat rooms and multi-user dungeons, machinima adds [...] "cinematic camera work". Previously, such virtual cinematic performances with live audience interaction were confined to research labs equipped with powerful computers.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after Spider-Man's introduction, {{publisher}} Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find {{it was one of}} the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling series with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One <b>interviewee</b> selected Spider-Man because he was [...] "beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us." [...] Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita, Sr. replaced him as penciler and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It only lasted for two issues, but it represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer annuals that began in 1964.|$|E
