40|$|Observations {{of marine}} air {{temperature}} (MAT) by Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) {{are known to}} contain significant biases due to solar heating of the sensor environment. MAT and humidity observations are usually made using wet- and dry-bulb thermometers housed in Stevenson screens, or with psychrometers. These instruments are typically mounted in the bridge wings or on the wheel-house top. If not sited carefully then the instruments can be poorly exposed to the undisturbed environmental conditions and have inadequate ventilation, leading to biased observations of both MAT and humidity. In this paper we use observations collected {{as part of the}} VOS Climate (VOSClim) project to investigate the relationship between <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure</b> and heating errors. The heating errors are estimated as the difference between the observed MAT and the collocated output of a numerical weather prediction model. The instrument exposures are assessed from hotographs of the instruments. Currently, photographs of the instruments and sufficient observations exist for 17 VOSClim ships. Two methods of assessing the <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure</b> using the observations are presented. The first method is based on the skewness of the distribution of estimated heating errors for individual ships. The second method is based on a correction developed to correct the heating errors and uses the ratio of the heating to cooling terms in the correction. When ships are ranked both on the skewness and on the ratio of the heating to cooling terms, there is a statistically significant correspondence between the rankings and the visual assessments of <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure.</b> The skewness of the distribution of estimated errors in MAT is proposed as a simple indicator of <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure...</b>|$|E

The exponential decay of <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure</b> to the sun and that of time are combined, and the product is used to describe the sensitivity change. Measured UV irradiances are employed to develop the values of the exponential decays, and the degradation coefficients for time dependence are found to vary with time at shorter wavelengths. Instrument sensitivity is described in terms of a functional relationship based on exponential decay with time with time-varying time dependence and on exponential decay with exposure with constant exposure dependence. The relationship provides a technique for treating data from the solar backscatter UV instrument both at short- and long-term intervals, and solar irradiance is calculated based on the approach...|$|E

40|$|Each Keck {{instrument}} {{presents a}} consistent software {{view to the}} user interface programmer. The view consists of a small library of functions, which are identical for all instruments, and a large set of keywords, that vary from instrument to instrument. All knowledge of the underlying task structure is hidden from the application programmer by the keyword layer. Image capture software uses the same function library to collect data for the image header. Because the image capture software and the instrument control software are built {{on top of the}} same keyword layer, a given observation can be 'replayed' by extracting keyword-value pairs from the image header and passing them back to the control system. The keyword layer features non-blocking as well as blocking I/O. A non-blocking keyword write operation (such as setting a filter position) specifies a callback to be invoked when the operation is complete. A non-blocking keyword read operation specifies a callback to be invoked whenever the keyword changes state. The keyword-callback style meshes well with the widget-callback style commonly used in X window programs. The first keyword library was built for the two Keck optical instruments. More recently, keyword libraries have been developed for the infrared instruments and for telescope control. Although the underlying mechanisms used for inter-process communication by each of these systems vary widely (Lick MUSIC, Sun RPC, and direct socket I/O, respectively), a basic user interface has been written that can be used with any of these systems. Since the keyword libraries are bound to user interface programs dynamically at run time, only a single set of user interface executables is needed. For example, the same program, 'xshow', can be used to display continuously the telescope's position, the time left in an <b>instrument's</b> <b>exposure,</b> or both values simultaneously. Less generic tools that operate on specific keywords, for example an X display that controls optical <b>instrument</b> <b>exposures,</b> have also been written using the keyword layer...|$|R

Two different fluoroscopic systems, one with an undercouch tube and one with an overcouch tube, were compared. The dose rate was measured during the simulation of a fluoroscopy procedure, using an ionization chamber as a dosemeter. The distribution of scattered radiation has been determined and results show a much higher dose rate in cases of an overcouch tube arrangement. When X-ray units with an undercouch tube are concerned, under same exposure conditions, the dose rate is higher in cases of a vertical beam. Prior to the measurements, the ionization chamber was examined in order to evaluate its suitability as a survey meter used in diagnostic radiology. Measurements show that below 1. 2 s, the ionization chamber gives an underestimation of dose rates.

As our previous work has shown (1), poorly diffusible, vital dyes, intradermally injected, enter the superficial lymphatic capillaries of the skin, and ordinarily are retained by them for several minutes before escape occurs into the interstitial tissue. Conspicuous increases in the permeability of the walls of these vessels, as manifested by an almost immediate escape of dye from the channels, follow such stimuli as the application of gentle heat, ultraviolet irradiation, or a firm stroke over the surface, too slight to abrade the skin. Studies of the lymphatic capillaries in the ear of the mouse have disclosed similar changes in the permeability of the walls of these vessels (2, 3).

40|$|Suppose a {{fund manager}} uses {{predictors}} in changing portfolio allocations over time. How does predictability translate into portfolio decisions? To {{answer this question}} we derive a new model within the Bayesian framework, where managers are assumed to modulate the systematic risk in part by observing how the benchmark returns are related to some set of imperfect predictors, and {{in part on the}} basis of their own information set. In this portfolio allocation process, managers care about the potential benefits arising from the market timing generated by benchmark predictors and by private information. In doing this, we impose a structure on fund returns, betas, and benchmark returns that help to analyze how managers really use predictors in changing investments over time. The main findings of our empirical work are that beta dynamics are significantly affected by economic variables, even though managers do not care about benchmark sensitivities towards the predictors in choosing their <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure,</b> and that persistence and leverage effects play a key role as well. Conditional market timing is virtually absent, if not negative, over the period 1990 - 2005. However such anomalous negative timing ability is offset by the leverage effect, which in turn leads to increase mutual fund extra performance. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{likelihood}} methodology {{which can be}} used to search for evidence of burst repetition in the BATSE catalog, and to study the properties of the repetition signal. We use a simplified model of burst repetition in which a number N_ r of sources which repeat a fixed number of times N_ rep are superposed upon a number N_ nr of non-repeating sources. The <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure</b> is explicitly taken into account. By computing the likelihood for the data, we construct a probability distribution in parameter space that may be used to infer the probability that a repetition signal is present, and to estimate the values of the repetition parameters. The likelihood function contains contributions from all the bursts, irrespective of the size of their positional errors [...] - the more uncertain a burst's position is, the less constraining is its contribution.

40|$|The {{solar and}} longwave {{environmental}} irradiance geometry (SOLWEIG) model simulates spatial variations of 3 -D radiation fluxes and {{mean radiant temperature}} (T mrt) as well as shadow patterns in complex urban settings. In this paper, a new vegetation scheme is included in SOLWEIG and evaluated. The new shadow casting algorithm for complex vegetation structures {{makes it possible to}} obtain continuous images of shadow patterns and sky view factors taking both buildings and vegetation into account. For the calculation of 3 -D radiation fluxes and T mrt, SOLWEIG only requires a limited number of inputs, such as global shortwave radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, geographical information (latitude, longitude and elevation) and urban geometry represented by high-resolution ground and building digital elevation models (DEM). Trees and bushes are represented by separate DEMs. The model is evaluated using 5 days of integral radiation measurements at two sites within a square surrounded by low-rise buildings and vegetation in Göteborg, Sweden (57 °N). There is good agreement between modelled and observed values of T mrt, with an overall correspondence of R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 91 (p[*]<[*] 0. 01, RMSE[*]=[*] 3. 1 K).

40|$|Instrumental {{variable}} {{analysis is}} a widely used method to estimate causal effects {{in the presence of}} unmeasured confounding. When the <b>instruments,</b> <b>exposure</b> and outcome are not measured in the same sample, Angrist and Krueger (1992) suggested to use two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimators that use sample moments from an instrument-exposure sample and an instrument-outcome sample. However, this method is biased if the two samples are from heterogeneous populations so that the distributions of the instruments are different. In linear structural equation models, we derive a new class of TSIV estimators that are robust to heterogeneous samples under the key assumption that the structural relations in the two samples are the same. The widely used two-sample two-stage least squares estimator belongs to this class, but it is not asymptotically efficient. We then attempt to relax the linearity assumption. To identify the magnitude of the causal effect nonparametrically, we find that {{it is important that the}} noise variables in the instrument-exposure equation have the same distributions in the two samples. However, this assumption is in general untestable because the exposure is not observed in one sample. Nonetheless, we may still identify the sign of the causal effect in the absence of homogeneity of the noise variables. Comment: 16 pages, 1 figure, 5 table...|$|R

Methods: In eight randomly selected dental schools, all fourth-year students were surveyed by means of a self-administered anonymous questionnaire in December 2010. The Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS) questionnaire served as the data collection <b>instrument.</b> <b>Exposure</b> to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) was assessed during the previous week. Chi-square test, logistic regression, and linear regression served for statistical analyses. Results: The response rate was 84 % (325 students, 66 % female).

Most of the students agreed on queried tobacco control policies. The lowest agreement (72 %) was for banning smoking in coffee shops and teahouses. A logistic regression model showed that adjusted for gender, passive smoking at home is significantly associated with current tobacco use. A linear regression model suggested that the total score of attitudes is significantly associated with passive smoking at home, passive smoking in other places, tobacco use experience, and current tobacco use.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} and development effort was to design and build a prototype instrument designated the 'Thermal Infrared Multispectral Camera' (TIRC). The Phase 2 effort was {{a continuation of the}} Phase 1 feasibility study and preliminary design for such an instrument. The completed instrument designated AA 465 has application in the field of geologic remote sensing and exploration. The AA 465 Thermal Infrared Camera (TIRC) System is a field-portable multispectral thermal infrared camera operating over the 8. 0 - 13. 0 micron wavelength range. Its primary function is to acquire two-dimensional thermal infrared images of user-selected scenes. Thermal infrared energy emitted by the scene is collected, dispersed into ten 0. 5 micron wide channels, and then measured and recorded by the AA 465 System. This multispectral information is presented in real time on a color display to be used by the operator to identify spectral and spatial variations in the scenes emissivity and/or irradiance. This fundamental instrument capability has a wide variety of commercial and research applications. While ideally suited for two-man operation in the field, the AA 465 System can be transported and operated effectively by a single user. Functionally, the instrument operates {{as if it were a}} single exposure camera. System measurement sensitivity requirements dictate relatively long (several minutes) <b>instrument</b> <b>exposure</b> times. As such, the instrument is not suited for recording time-variant information. The AA 465 was fabricated, assembled, tested, and documented during this Phase 2 work period. The detailed design and fabrication of the instrument was performed during the period of June 1989 to July 1990. The software development effort and instrument integration/test extended from July 1990 to February 1991. Software development included an operator interface/menu structure, instrument internal control functions, DSP image processing code, and a display algorithm coding program. The instrument was delivered to NASA in March 1991. Potential commercial and research uses for this instrument are in its primary application as a field geologists exploration tool. Other applications have been suggested but not investigated in depth.

Experience in Europe, however, is still limited and ESD is only performed in a few selected centers, with low volumes of cases, no description of training programs, and few published reports. In 2008, a panel of experts gathered in Rotterdam to discuss indications, training, and the wider use of ESD. The panel of experts and participants reached a consensus on five general statements: 1) ESD aims at treating mucosal cancer; 2) treatment aims for R 0 resection; 3) ESD should meet quality standards; 4) ESD should be performed following national or European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) guidelines or under institutional review board approval; and 5) ESD cases should be registered. Due to the high level of expertise needed to perform the technique safely, ESD should be performed in a step-up approach, starting with lesions presenting in the rectum or in the distal stomach, then colon, proximal stomach, and finally in the esophagus. Registration is advised either at the local site or at a national or ESGE level, and should include information on indication (Paris classification of lesion, location, and histological results prior to treatment), technique used (e.  g. type of knife), results (en bloc and R 0 resection), complications, and follow-up.
