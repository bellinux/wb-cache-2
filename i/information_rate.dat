40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study of the coded performance of long-haul spectrally-efficient WDM optical fiber transmission systems with different coded modulation decoding structures is presented. Achievable <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> are derived for three different square QAM formats and the optimal format is identified {{as a function of}} distance and specific decoder implementation. The four cases analyzed combine hard-decision (HD) or soft-decision (SD) decoding together with either a bit-wise or a symbol-wise demapper, the last two suitable for binary and nonbinary codes, respectively. The <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> achievable for each scheme are calculated based on the mismatched decoder principle. These quantities represent true indicators of the coded performance of the system for specific decoder implementations and when the modulation format and its input distribution are fixed. In combination with the structure of the decoder, two different receiver-side equalization strategies are also analyzed: electronic dispersion compensation and digital backpropagation. We show that, somewhat unexpectedly, schemes based on nonbinary HD codes can achieve <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> comparable to SD decoders and that, when SD is used, switching from a symbol-wise to a bit-wise decoder results in a negligible penalty. Conversely, from an information-theoretic standpoint, HD binary decoders are shown to be unsuitable for spectrally-efficient, long-haul systems...|$|R

40|$|Self-synchronization {{under the}} {{presence}} of additive noise {{can be achieved by}} allocating a certain number of bits of each codeword as markers for synchronization. Difference systems of sets are combinatorial designs which specify the positions of synchronization markers in codewords {{in such a way that}} the resulting error-tolerant self-synchronizing codes may be realized as cosets of linear codes. Ideally, difference systems of sets should sacrifice as few bits as possible for a given code length, alphabet size, and error-tolerance capability. However, it seems difficult to attain optimality with respect to known bounds when the noise level is relatively low. In fact, the majority of known optimal difference systems of sets are for exceptionally noisy channels, requiring a substantial amount of bits for synchronization. To address this problem, we present constructions for difference systems of sets that allow for higher <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> while sacrificing optimality to only a small extent. Our constructions utilize optimal difference systems of sets as ingredients and, when applied carefully, generate asymptotically optimal ones with higher <b>information</b> <b>rates.</b> We also give direct constructions for optimal difference systems of sets with high <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> and error tolerance that generate binary and ternary self-synchronizing codes...|$|R
40|$|Using no {{conventional}} measurements {{in position}} space, <b>information</b> extraction <b>rates</b> exceeding one bit per photon are achieved by employing high-dimensional correlated {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) states for object recognition. The correlations are shown to be insensitive to axial rotation of the target object: the information structure of an object's joint OAM coincidence spectrum is unchanged even when the object undergoes random rotations between each measurement. Additionally, OAM correlations alone are shown to be sufficient for full image reconstruction of complex, off-axis objects, and novel object symmetries are observed in the phases of OAM-object interaction transition amplitudes. Variations in mutual <b>information</b> <b>rates,</b> due to off-axis translation in the beam field, are studied, and it is shown that object symmetry signatures and <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> are independent of environmental factors sufficiently far from the beam center.
