40|$|Introduction: Amoxicillin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of pharmaceuticals that benefits humans and animals. However, antibiotics excertion in wastewaters and environment have emerged as a serious risk to the biotic environment, and their toxic effects can harm the organisms. Iron-based metallic nanoparticles have received special attention in regard with remediation of groundwater contaminants. In the typical nZVI-based bimetallic particle system, Fe acts as the reducing agent. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the synthesis and characteristics of nZVI in regard with degrading AMX. Methods: In this study, nZVI nanoparticles were synthesized using the liquid-phase reduction method by EDTA as a stabilizer material. Structure and properties of nanoparticles were characterized by BET, SEM, XRD and EDX analysis. A multi-variate analysis was applied using a response surface methodology (RSM) in order to develop a quadratic model as a functional relationship between <b>AMX</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency and independent variables (initial pH values, dosage of nZVI, contact time and amoxicillin concentration). The four independent variables of solution pH (2 – 10), AMX concentration (5 - 45 mg/l), contact time (5 - 85 min) and nanoparticles dose (0. 25 – 1. 25 g) were transformed to the coded values. Results: The study results demonstrated that more than 69 % of AMX was removed by nZVI. The optimal <b>AMX</b> <b>removal</b> conditions using nZVI were found as 1. 25 g of nZVI, pH 4, contact time of 80 min and concentration of 30 mg/l. Conclusions: The ability of nZVI in degradation of AMX revealed that these materials can serve as a potential nano material with respect to the environmental remediation...|$|R

40|$|A recent paper [Tormala ZL, Jia JS, Norton MI (2012). The {{preference}} <b>for</b> <b>potential.</b> Journal {{of personality}} and social psychology, 103 : 567 - 583] demonstrated that persons often prefer potential rather than achievement when evaluating others, because information regarding potential evokes greater interest and processing, resulting in more favorable evaluations. This research aimed to expand on this finding by asking two questions: (a) Is the preference <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> effect replicable in other cultures? (b) Is there any other mechanism that accounts for this preference <b>for</b> <b>potential?</b> To answer these two questions, we replicated Tormala et al. &# 39;s study in multiple cities (17 studies with 1, 128 participants) in China using an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis approach to test our hypothesis. Our results showed that the preference <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> effect found in the US is also robust in China. Moreover, we also found a pro-youth bias behind the preference <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> effect. To be specific, persons prefer a potential-oriented applicant rather than an achievement-oriented applicant, partially because they believe that the former is younger than the latter...|$|R
