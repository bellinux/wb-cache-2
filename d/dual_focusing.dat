50|$|Some low budget {{entry-level}} monoculars from China claim “dual focusing”, {{which means}} focusing {{by means of}} twisting either {{the main body of}} the monocular, and/or the smaller ring near the eyepiece (referred to as the dioptre adjustment on binoculars). Quite why <b>dual</b> <b>focusing</b> is felt necessary on a monocular is questionable but could be for marketing reasons; there is no real technical benefit with such a system, which is never found on the top-quality monoculars from manufacturers like Opticron, Leica and Zeiss.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{estimating}} target locations that are sparse in a pulse-Doppler radar's unambiguous region by sampling the received signal at sub-Nyquist rates. The received signal is modeled as a finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signal, and the problem of estimating the delays in a single transceiver radar is formulated as one of recovery of sparse common-support (SCS) FRI signals, which arises in the context of channel estimation in multiple input, multiple output communication systems. The delays are estimated by the SCS-FRI reconstruction method. We present a new method termed delay focusing to estimate theDoppler shifts. To obtain overall performance gains, we also present an extendedmethod called <b>dual</b> <b>focusing,</b> which combines both delay and Doppler focusing schemes, and has the capability to superresolve targets in the delay-Doppler plane. The performance of the recovery methods in the presence of noise is also analyzed. We demonstrate that the proposed estimation methods are robust to noise. Monte Carlo performance analysis in the presence of noise shows that the <b>dual</b> <b>focusing</b> method accurately resolves closely spaced targets and yields a significant decrease in normalized mean-square error of up to 10 - 20 dB for the estimated Doppler shifts. We also simulate the scenario where multiple targets are in a formation, that is, when they are closely spaced along both delay and Doppler axes, and show that the <b>dual</b> <b>focusing</b> method achieves a hit rate of nearly 100 % at a much lower signal-to-noise ratios than that required for Doppler focusing...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} single element-based dual focused photoacoustic {{microscopy}} (PAM) that shows improved signal-to-noise ratio and lateral resolution compared to conventional single focused PAM in the out-of-focus region. This dual focused PAM {{is based on}} the novel design of a single element-based dual focused transducer coupled with improved image reconstruction method using synthetic aperture <b>dual</b> <b>focusing</b> technique (SADFT). Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was used to fabricate the dual-focused transducer and phantom experiments were conducted to demonstrate the advantages of this novel transducer design. Experimental results obtained show that the signal-to-noise ratio and lateral resolution can be improved with a factor of 2 X in the conventionally out-of-focus region using this technique...|$|E

40|$|Abstract�This study investigates a voltage-controllable liquid {{crystals}} lens with a Fresnel zone electrode. When {{applying a}} proper voltage on the liquid crystal cell, a Fresnel-zone-distributed electric field is induced to direct liquid crystals aligned in a concentric structure. Owing to the concentrically aligned liquid crystals, a Fresnel lens is formed. We probe the Fresnel liquid crystal lens using a polarized incident beam with a wavelength of 632. 8 nm, {{finding that the}} diffraction efficiency depends on the applying voltage. A remarkable diffraction efficiency of ~ 39. 5 % is measured at the voltage of 0. 9 V. Additionally, a <b>dual</b> <b>focus</b> lens is fabricated by attaching a plane-convex lens to the Fresnel liquid crystals cell. The Fresnel LC lens and the <b>dual</b> <b>focus</b> lens may be applied for DVD/CD pick-up head, confocal microscopy system, or electrically-controlling optical systems.

Specifically, in SC, the nuclear prominence is characterized by obligatory and unique nature, while the pre-nuclear prominence is optional and secondary.
