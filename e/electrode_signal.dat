40|$|Causal {{inference}} {{concerns the}} identification of cause-effect relationships between variables, e. g. establishing whether a stimulus affects activity in a certain brain region. The observed variables themselves often do not constitute meaningful causal variables, however, and linear combinations need to be considered. In electroencephalographic studies, for example, one {{is not interested in}} establishing cause-effect relationships between <b>electrode</b> <b>signals</b> (the observed variables), but rather between cortical signals (the causal variables) which can be recovered as linear combinations of <b>electrode</b> <b>signals.</b> We introduce MERLiN (Mixture Effect Recovery in Linear Networks), a family of causal inference algorithms that implement a novel means of constructing causal variables from non-causal variables. We demonstrate through application to EEG data how the basic MERLiN algorithm can be extended for application to different (neuroimaging) data modalities. Given an observed linear mixture, the algorithms can recover a causal variable that is a linear effect of another given variable. That is, MERLiN allows us to recover a cortical signal that is affected by activity in a certain brain region, while not being a direct effect of the stimulus.

40|$|Abstract: The signal {{conditioning}} and processing circuits of conventional electromagnetic ow-meters {{have been designed}} to provide an accurate average owrate measurement signal, principally for the purpose of process control. One consequence of this is that the ‘noise ’ and other low frequency components of the <b>electrode</b> <b>signal</b> are suppressed. Hitherto, the possibility that they may carry potentially useful information has been overlooked, but there are studies which show that information regarding the ow regime can be identied by spectral analysis of the higher frequency or ‘noise’ components of the sensor signals from some other types of owmeters. If the entire <b>electrode</b> <b>signal</b> is analysed, using well-established signal analysis methods, diagnostic information regarding the ow regime in which the owmeter is operating can be recovered and several distinctly different ow regimes can be identied, such as increased turbulence, swirling ow, ow pulsations and two-phase ow, all of which adversely affect the performance of the owmeter. This paper presents the results of laboratory simulations of these ow regimes and describes a fuzzy logic method for identifying them. It also suggests a change to the conventional mode of operation and signal processing which would enable the additional functions to be implemented without involving any modication to the design or construction of the conventional owtube. The potential benets which arise from its application include the identication of ow regimes which adversely affect the performance of the owmeter in its installed position and the ability to verify, on line, that the owmeter is functioning correctly...|$|E

30|$|An {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) coherence {{network is}} {{a representation of}} functional brain connectivity, and is constructed by calculating the coherence between pairs of <b>electrode</b> <b>signals</b> {{as a function of}} frequency. Typical visualizations of coherence networks use a matrix representation with rows and columns representing electrodes and cells representing coherences between <b>electrode</b> <b>signals,</b> or a 2 D node-link diagram with vertices representing electrodes and edges representing coherences. However, such representations do not allow an easy embedding of spatial information or they suffer from visual clutter, especially for multichannel EEG coherence networks. In this paper, a new method for data-driven visualization of multichannel EEG coherence networks is proposed to avoid the drawbacks of conventional methods. This method partitions electrodes into dense groups of spatially connected regions. It not only preserves spatial relationships between regions, but also allows an analysis of the functional connectivity within and between brain regions, which could be used to explore the relationship between functional connectivity and underlying brain structures. As an example application, the method is applied to the analysis of multichannel EEG coherence networks obtained from older and younger adults who perform a cognitive task. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step before a more detailed analysis of EEG coherence networks.|$|R

40|$|Halothane, {{independent}} of oxygen tension, increased the signal of the gold/silver-silver chloride microelectrode. The output of microelectrodes at different oxygen {{tensions in the}} presence of in-creasing amounts of halothane has been measured. Halothane causes an increase in the <b>electrode</b> <b>signal</b> which is proportional to its concentration. This effect results from the polarographic reduction of halothane.
