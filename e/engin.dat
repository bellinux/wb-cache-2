Peirce applied for leave to appeal. She began to explore Raghip's mental state, arguing that his confession {{could not be}} relied upon, and arranged {{for him to be}} examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, a specialist in suggestibility; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible, with a mental age of between 10 and 11. Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven Kamlish. Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence, and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire {{on the deck of the}} Tangmere block, given that he was renting a shop there.|$|E

25|$|The first era of Turkish Cypriot poetry {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the Latin alphabet, characterised by poets such as Nazif Süleyman Ebeoğlu, Urkiye Mine Balman, <b>Engin</b> Gönül, Necla Salih Suphi and Pembe Marmara, had strong nationalistic elements due to the political attitudes of Turkish Cypriots at the time and stylistically reflected the poetry of the Turkish mainland. Meanwhile, other poets, such as Özker Yaşın, Osman Türkay, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twice, and Nevzat Yalçın sought to write in more original styles, with the influence of nascent poetic styles in Turkey and those in Britain. This group of poets were very prolific and increased the popularity of poetry in the Turkish Cypriot community, and are seen as key figures in Turkish Cypriot literature.|$|E

25|$|In April 2014, the President of the Constitutional Court, Haşim Kılıç, accused Erdoğan of {{damaging}} {{the credibility of}} the judiciary, labelling Erdoğan's attempts to increase political control over the courts as 'desperate'. During the chaotic 2007 presidential election, the military issued an E-memorandum warning the government to keep within the boundaries of secularism when choosing a candidate. Regardless, Erdoğan's close relations with Fethullah Gülen and his Cemaat Movement allowed his government to maintain a degree of influence within the judiciary through Gülen's supporters in high judicial and bureaucratic offices. Shortly after, an alleged coup plot codenamed Sledgehammer became public and resulted in the imprisonment of 300 military officers including İbrahim Fırtına, Çetin Doğan and <b>Engin</b> Alan. Several opposition politicians, journalists and military officers also went on trial for allegedly being part of an ultra-nationalist organisation called Ergenekon.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{characteristics of}} the period following the 12 September 1980 military intervention was the disregard {{to the right to}} life and the increase in torture cases and deaths due to torture. The HRFT published two reports on Deaths in Custody (14 and 15 years since the military take over) presenting a list of 419 deaths in custody (in 15 years) with a suspicion that torture might have been the reason. Another 15 deaths were attributed to hunger strikes while medical neglect was given as the reason for 26 deaths. On the basis of this list Helmut Oberdiek compiled a revised list for 20 years (12 September 1980 to 12 September 2000) and concluded that in 428 cases torture may have been the reason for the death of prisoners. In 2008 alone the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey reported of 39 deaths in prison. In some cases torture was involved. In 2012, two prison guards and an official were given life sentences for the torture death of activist <b>Engin</b> Çeber, the first such verdict in Turkey's history.|$|E

500|$|Detectives {{came under}} {{enormous}} pressure {{to find those}} responsible for his death, amid tabloid coverage that was sometimes openly racist. Faced {{with a lack of}} forensic evidence, the police arrested 359 people, interviewed most of them without solicitors, and laid charges based on untaped confessions. Three adults and three youths were charged with the murder; the adults, Winston Silcott, <b>Engin</b> Raghip and Mark Braithwaite (the [...] "Tottenham Three"), were convicted in 1987. A widely supported campaign arose to overturn the convictions, which were quashed in 1991 when forensic tests cast doubt on the authenticity of detectives' notes from an interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself. Two detectives were charged in 1992 with perverting the course of justice and were acquitted in 1994.|$|E

Turkish officials encouraged him to study law, offering him a scholarship, so that he could promote the interests of Turkish citizens in Greece. He thus entered Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1953. When he was in his second year, he was accused of incitement in the bombing incident. <b>Engin</b> said that he had been followed by Greek intelligence agents so closely from the start of his university education, that he could name one ("Triondafilos").|$|E

After graduation, he started an internship in Cyprus. However, he was summoned by Orhan Öztırak, the minister of internal affairs, to monitor Greek radio stations. Next he placed first in a government exam {{that led to his}} to becoming the governor (kaymakam) of the most important district, Çankaya. One year later, the chief of the police force, Hayrettin Nakipoğlu, invited him to be the chair of the Political Affairs Branch (...)

He remained in the police force thereafter, working his way up to the chief of the security department, and the deputy chief of the entire police force.

More recently, La Perrière's Le miroir politique (1555) has received attention, thanks to the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault identifies the work of La Perriere as belonging to Early Modern France and foreshadowing discourses of governmentality.|$|R
