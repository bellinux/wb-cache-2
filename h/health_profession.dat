25|$|The <b>health</b> <b>profession</b> of {{occupational}} therapy was conceived {{in the early}} 1910s {{as a reflection of}} the Progressive Era. Early professionals merged highly valued ideals, such as having a strong work ethic and the importance of crafting with one's own hands with scientific and medical principles. The National Society for the Promotion of Occupational Therapy, now called the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA), was founded in 1917 and the profession of Occupational Therapy was officially named in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics in {{countries}} that follow the Anglo-American model normally function under the authority (medical direction) {{of one or more}} physicians charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. Credentialing may occur {{as the result of a}} State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, credentialing may occur by means of a College of Paramedicine. In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating <b>health</b> <b>profession.</b> The final common method of credentialing is through certification by a Medical Director and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of standing order protocols (off-line medical control) and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there are}} {{relatively}} few studies of rehabilitation in MS, its general effectiveness, when {{conducted by a}} team of specialists, has been clearly demonstrated in other diseases such as stroke or head trauma. As for any patient with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to limiting and overcoming disability; however there are particular difficulties in specifying a 'core team' because people with MS may need help from almost any <b>health</b> <b>profession</b> or service at some point. Neurologists are mainly involved in the diagnosis and ongoing management of [...] multiple sclerosis, and any exacerbations. The comprehensive rehabilitation process for patients with multiple sclerosis is generally managed by physiatrists. Allied treatments such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy or occupational therapy can also help to manage some symptoms and maintain quality of life. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression should involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits.|$|E

2500|$|The {{scope of}} the role varies widely across the world, having {{originally}} developed as a paraprofession in the United States during the 1970s. [...] Since this time, {{in countries such as}} the United Kingdom, the paramedic role has developed into an autonomous <b>health</b> <b>profession,</b> with individual licence to practice, whilst in other countries (including the United States) the paramedic remains an agent working on behalf of a doctor. There are different models of care for EMS providers which significantly influence the scope of practice of paramedics in an area. [...] In the Franco-German model paramedics directly support a doctor in the field, in a role more akin to a hospital nurse, rather than operating with clinical autonomy.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a mental}} <b>health</b> <b>profession,</b> art therapy is {{employed}} in many clinical and other settings with diverse populations.

Closely related in practice to marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors, U.S. art therapists are licensed under various titles, depending upon their individual qualifications and the type of licenses available in a given state. Art therapists may hold licenses as art therapists, creative arts therapists, marriage and family therapists, counselors of various types, psychologists, nurse practitioners, social workers, occupational therapists, or rehabilitation therapists. [...] Art therapists may have received advanced degrees in art therapy or in a related field such as psychology in which case they would have to obtain post-master's or post-doctorate certification as an art therapist. [...] Art therapists work with populations of all ages and {{with a wide variety of}} disorders and diseases. [...] Art therapists provide services to children, adolescents, and adults, whether as individuals, couples, families, or groups.|$|E
