40|$|NoThe complex {{formation}} of Islamic geometric Patterns (IGP) {{is one of}} the distinctive features in Islamic art and architecture. Many have attempted to reproduce these patterns in digital form, using various pattern generation techniques. Shape grammars are an effective pattern generation method, providing good aesthetic results. In this paper we present a novel approach in generating 3 D IGP using an extended shape grammar: Parametrized Shape Grammar (PSG). PSG allows a user to generate both original and novel forms of Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>motifs</b> (a repeated unit of a pattern). PSG is generalized to generate n-fold Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>motifs</b> in a 3 D environment, practically implemented as a 3 D modeling tool within Autodesk Maya. The parametrization within each grammar rule is the key to generating numerous original and novel Islamic <b>geometric</b> <b>motifs...</b>|$|R

Light Floors was constructed in a <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> and displayed across the floors of three rooms in the gallery. Both yellow and ultraviolet lights were shown in different sequences through the acrylic. A press release for the installation noted that, “Miss Katzen exercises complete control over her medium. She states that ‘light in all its aspects is employed. Reflectiveness, transparency, emission, and the transformation from spatial to temporal coordinates is situated.’ The result is that ‘arbitrariness and effect are canceled out.” Katzen continued to use light as a medium in The Universe is the Environment (1969) and Liquid Tunnel, an octagonal tunnel that featured fluorescent light shown through water, which played with the variations of optics and the similarities of liquids and solids.|$|E
50|$|Waves are {{frequently}} found at Pampa Grande, primarily on ceramics/pottery. The waves have two different interpretations. Often waves appear {{in conjunction with}} right triangles or “stairs”. These geometric shapes would have served as an abbreviated version of earlier and more complex motifs. The first way this <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> has been interpreted is symbolizing marine life and its importance. Expert, Ilana Johnson, explains one way the waves can be interpreted. They “…could have been an abbreviated version of the stylized catfish or double-headed serpent motif found in panels on the murals at Huaca de la Luna and Huaca El Brujo Moche sites”. The second way these wave motifs are interpreted are as the Temple of the Stairway and Wave. This {{is said to have}} been a ceremonial place where ritual human sacrifice took place. The wave motif is often found in several places on one piece of pottery.|$|E

50|$|Knitters {{probably}} {{began using}} Fair Isle patterning {{in the early}} 1900s (decade), contrasting shades and colours of wool. As they now use only natural colours, the range is limited to whites, greys, browns and blacks, or a combination produced during the carding process. Most knitwear includes {{only two or three}} colours. In sweaters, the colours form either geometric or representational designs. Characteristically they are placed horizontally on the mid-portion of the body of the sweater. If the design in this centre portion is geometric, it is laid out in a broad band and repeated on the sleeves. If the main design is representational, it is usually centred on the back, with the same design on the front of a pullover, or two smaller versions of the same representation {{on either side of the}} front on a cardigan. There are usually <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> bands above and below the representational figure, which are also repeated on the sleeves.|$|E
50|$|The north tower, {{which was}} built in the second period of church {{construction}} in 1420 - 1440, was finished in the third period of construction in 1462. This is proved by Košice's arms with the sculpted year 1462 over the portal of the west façade which is also the entrance to the tower. The tower stays at four - square floor plan and has three levels. From the fourth level it narrows to an octagonal floor plan. A simply decorated tower has between floor cordons decorated by cresting with a <b>geometric</b> <b>motif.</b> Between the fourth and the fifth floor the decoration is complemented by rosette - roses, while each of them is profiled to the different shape. The Zigmund tower was heavily damaged between 1490-1491 when Košice was besieged by John I Albert's army. It was reconstructed by Mikláš Crompholz from Nisa, under the guidance of Vaclav from Prague in 1494 - 1497. After the fire in 1775 the tower was built up a little bit and on the top of it a Rococo monkshood was mounted, which created the sixth floor of the tower. The monkshood is covered by a copper sheet with the gold-coated plumber components. On the top of it there is copper cross 3 meters tall. On the first floor there is the mechanism of a large clock, on the second floor there is construction for the bells. On the third floor are two bells from 1926. Alexander Buchner had new bells cast - The God's heard which has 1 530 kg and which holds names of killed people in The World War I. There is also a fire brigade room which was used until the 1970s.|$|E
40|$|Hatching is a shading {{technique}} in which tone {{is represented by}} a series of strokes or lines. Drawing using this technique should follow three criteria: the lighting, the object geometry and its material. These criteria respectively provide tone, <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> orientation and <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> style. We present a GPU real time approach of hatching strokes over arbitrary surfaces. Our method is based on a coherent and consistent model texture mapping and takes into account these three criteria. The triangle adjacency primitive is used to provide a coherent stylization over the model. Our model computes hatching parameter per fragment according to the light direction and the geometry and generates hatching rendering taking into account these parameters and a lighting model. Dedicated textures can easily be created off-line to depict material properties for any kind of object. As our GPU model is designed to deal with texture resolutions, consistent mapping and geometry in the object space, it provides real time rendering while avoiding popping and shower-door effects...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the survey}} on block-printed batik {{production}} using metal blocks in Thailand’s three southernmost provinces – Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat, only batik factories in Narathiwat were found using such method. Since the blocks were made of metal, their parts were damaged by getting bent, twisted or hit by one another when stored. Additionally, the metal parts would come off the plates {{because they were not}} properly welded. According to Mr. Ya Bindorlao, a metal block-maker, batik block production and repair required meticulous skills and expertise. In addition, some blocks were repairable while others were discarded due to high repair cost although some parts were still functional. Batik makers, therefore, tended to use the same blocks repeatedly, limiting innovative patterns in the market. The objectives of this study were as follows: 1) To collect and examine batik motifs on metal blocks in the three southernmost provinces of Thailand. 2) To develop modular batik blocks, whose parts can be removable and adjustable in order to create more patterns The study shows that the motifs found on the metal blocks can be classified into six categories: 1) a flora motif, 2) a <b>geometric</b> <b>motif,</b> 3) a fauna motif, 4) an object motif, 5) ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{preparation}} {{of a range of}} phenyl, pyridyl and pyrazinyl substituted pyridazinesvia the inverse electron demand [2 + 4] Diels?Alder reaction between 3, 6 -di(2 -pyridyl) - 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazines (bptz) and 3, 6 -di(2 -pyrazinyl) - 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrazines (bpztz) and suitable dienophiles including acenaphthalene. The resulting polyaromatic compounds vary systematically in the number of aromatic substituents and the number and position of N-heteroatoms. For four of these compounds, the effect of the molecular changes on the solid-state structures were investigated using single crystal X-ray crystallography. The pyridazines were used as bidentate ligands in {M(II) (bipy) 2 } and tris(homoleptic) complexes (M = Fe, Ru). The optical and electrochemical properties of these complexes reflect the electron accepting character of the new ligands. The facial and meridional isomers of the tris complexes could be separated by column chromatography (on silica), thus allowing a spectral comparison of their absorption and emission properties. The solid-state structures of several of the metal complexes are discussed, including that of the facial isomer of the trisRu(II) complex of 3, 6 -bis(2 -pyridyl) - 4, 5 -bis(4 -pyridyl) pyridazine?a potential preformed <b>geometric</b> <b>motif</b> for the predirected construction of supramolecular assemblies...|$|E
