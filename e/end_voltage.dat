50|$|The {{effects of}} this {{modulation}} on voltage magnitude and phase angle is illustrated using phasor diagrams that map VR, VS, and the resistive and inductive components of Vline drop. Three power factor scenarios are shown, where (a) the line serves an inductive load so the current lags receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage,</b> (b) the line serves a completely real load so the current and receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> are in phase, and (c) the line serves a capacitive load so the current leads receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage.</b> In all cases the line resistance R causes a voltage drop that is in phase with current, and the reactance of the line X causes a voltage drop that leads current by 90 degrees. These successive voltage drops are summed to the receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage,</b> tracing backward from VR to VS in the short line approximation circuit. The vector sum of VR and the voltage drops equals VS, and it is apparent in the diagrams that VS does not equal VR in magnitude or phase angle.The diagrams show that the phase angle of current in the line affects voltage regulation significantly. Lagging current in (a) makes the required magnitude of sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> quite large relative to the receiving end. The phase angle difference between sending and receiving end is minimized, however. Leading current in (c) actually allows the sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> magnitude be smaller than the receiving end magnitude, so the voltage counterintuitively increases along the line. In-phase current in (b) does little to affect the magnitude of voltage between sending and receiving ends, but the phase angle shifts considerably.|$|E

Due to very low, or no load - very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification (Ferranti effect). The receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> may become double the sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> (generally in case of very long transmission lines).

5000|$|Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power systems to counteract {{the effect of the}} line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> being higher than sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage.</b> In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system.

A multi objective optimization method is proposed to determine optimal allocation of a distributed generation (DG) unit in a radial distribution feeder. The DG allocation problem has been formulated as multi objective function which includes two objectives: viz Power Loss Reduction and Tail <b>End</b> Node <b>Voltage</b> Improvement with associated weights. The proposed methodology uses Genetic Algorithm to optimize the multi objective function. This method is tested on standard IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system using MATLAB 8. 0.

50|$|HVDC links {{can be used}} {{to control}} {{problems}} in the grid with AC electricity flow. The power transmitted by an AC line increases as the phase angle between source <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> and destination ends increases, but too large a phase angle will allow the systems {{at either end of the}} line to fall out of step. Since the power flow in a DC link is controlled independently of the phases of the AC networks at either end of the link, this phase angle limit does not exist, and a DC link is always able to transfer its full rated power. A DC link therefore stabilizes the AC grid at either end, since power flow and phase angle can then be controlled independently.|$|E
40|$|A {{temporary}} overvoltage is an oscillatory {{phase to ground}} or phase to phase over voltage that is relatively long duration and is undamped or only weakly damped. Temporary over voltages usually originate from faults, sudden charge of load, Ferranti effect, linear resonance, ferroresonance, open conductor, induced resonance from coupled circuits and so forth. The steady voltage at the open end of an uncompensated transmission line is always higher than the voltage at the sending end. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} Ferranti effect. This paper presents a study of Ferranti effect in electrical transmission line. The study is based on both software and hardware. The MATLAB program gives the locus of sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> with line length which shows that receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> is greater than sending <b>end</b> <b>voltage.</b> From the experiment with transmission line simulator the values of three phase voltages at  sending end and receiving end were found which proves the Ferranti effect.

40|$|Abstract- Maximum power {{transfer}} and optimal reactive power at voltage stability limit {{is the major}} problem. In power system, engineers faced with problem of variable load ranging from minimum to maximum at or near a constant value of voltage. A power system must be planned and operated {{in such a manner}} so as it gives good quality of reliable supply. Power system must be planned, designed installed and operated in such a manner so as to avoid voltage instability and voltage collapse. When the inductive load is increased the reactive power absorption is increased and hence voltage drop in transmission lines is increased and receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> is decreased. Voltage drop in transmission line depends upon the reactive power. Power transfer and receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> can be enhanced by using shunt compensation in order to increase the load. This paper looks in to a power flow program in MATLAB environment. Thus it is a graphical method to find out the magnitude of {{power transfer}} and receiving <b>end</b> <b>voltage</b> at steady state voltage stability limit and optimum value of power transfer and receiving voltage when the system is at stable state...|$|E

But when cable is working in thunder and rain, the grounding line of the cable may induce very high voltage, and the high voltage may disturb the core lines of cable that used to transfer useful signals, so the crosstalk can’t be neglected. Experiment is done with four core lines cable without metal shield layer that lay on the earth. Experimental and simulation results are nearly same, which are compared.

Once a section of insulator at the end has electrically broken down and become conductive, the full voltage is applied across the remaining length, so the breakdown will quickly progress from the high <b>voltage</b> <b>end</b> to the other, and a flashover arc will start.

50|$|The {{collector}} resistors can {{be replaced}} by a current mirror, whose output part acts as an active load (Fig. 3). Thus the differential collector current signal is converted to a single <b>ended</b> <b>voltage</b> signal without the intrinsic 50% losses and the gain is extremely increased. This is achieved by copying the input collector current from the right to the left side where the magnitudes of the two input signals add. For this purpose, the input of the current mirror is connected to the right output and the output of the current mirror is connected to the left output of the differential amplifier.The current mirror inverts the right collector current and tries to pass it through the left transistor that produces the left collector current. In the middle point between the two left transistors, the two signal currents (current changes) are subtracted. In this case (differential input signal), they are equal and opposite. Thus, the difference is twice the individual signal currents (ΔI - (-ΔI) = 2ΔI) and the differential to single ended conversion is completed without gain losses. Fig. 4 shows the transmission characteristic of this circuit.|$|R
