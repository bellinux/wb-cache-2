30|$|Estimating {{hydraulic}} characteristics (transmissivity {{and storage}} coefficient or specific yield) of aquifer systems {{is an essential}} part of groundwater studies. The most effective, reliable and standard way of determining these characteristics is to conduct and analyze <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> such as <b>pumping</b> <b>test.</b> When the <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> are performed in small-diameter wells, several methods are available for analyzing the <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data (Theis 1935; Cooper and Jacob 1946; Neuman 1974; Hantush 1964) depending upon the type of aquifer. These methods are based on one of the assumptions that <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> is performed in small-diameter well for which storage can be neglected. However, the <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in the hard-rock subsurface formations are generally conducted in large-diameter wells where the pumped water initially comes from the well storage. The contribution of storage gradually decreases with the advancement of pumping time, and water starts to move from aquifer to well. At later stages of time, almost entire pumped water is supplied from the aquifer (Rushton 2003).|$|R

However, {{how to address}} the problem of performance assessment maximizing the use of available monitoring data, and how to build a framework that integrates performance assessment, fault detection, and diagnosis are still a significant challenge. For this purpose, this article introduces an approach to performance assessment and fault diagnosis for rotating machinery, including wavelet packet decomposition for extracting energy feature samples from vibration signals acquired during normal and faulty conditions; clustering analysis for demonstrating the separability of the samples; and Fisher discriminant analysis for providing an optimal lower-dimensional representation, in terms of maximizing the separability among different populations, by projecting the samples into a new space. In the new low-dimensional space, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) between the new measurement data and normal population can be calculated for performance assessment. Moreover, this model for performance assessment only requires data to be available in normal conditions and any one of all possible fault conditions, without the necessity for the full life cycle of condition monitoring data. In addition, if monitoring data under different fault conditions are available, the fault mode can be identified accurately by comparing the MDs between the new measurement data and each fault population. Finally, the proposed method was verified to be successful on performance assessment and fault diagnosis via a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pump</b> <b>test</b> and a ball bearing test.|$|R
40|$|The Beverley uranium mine, {{operated}} by Heathgate Resources (Heathgate), {{is located on}} the arid plain between the northern Flinders Ranges and Lake Frome, approximately 550 km North of Adelaide in South Australia. The deposit exists as coffinite mineralisation hosted in permeable sands within the confined, saline Beverley aquifer, some 125 m below the ground surface. Uranium is mined using moderately acidic in-situ recovery (ISR) technology which entails circulating oxidizing fluid through the ore body to mobilize the uranium which is then pumped to the surface and recovered. Oxidizing fluid is then re-circulated and as the chloride levels become unmanageable the excess, high chloride, fluids are stored within the mined-out areas of the aquifer. The demonstrated ability to manage both the mining fluids and the high chloride “disposal stream ” within the aquifer system was a critical criterion of permitting and regulatory approval of the mine in the late 1990 s.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of fractured rocks and their hydraulic properties has recently received growing attention {{as the result}} of plans to build nuclear waste repositories. Studies have shown the need to refine existing methods of measuring hydraulic parameters of fractured rocks, especially for contaminant transport problems. Traditional approaches have generally tried to model <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> in fractured media, first by conventional type curve analysis and then using more and more sophisticated models if the match of analytical predictions was poor with field data. In some instances it is possible to obtain a good match by, e. g., using a leaky aquifer model, even though the parameters obtained might not reflect the underlying geometric properties of the aquifer, leading to misleading interpretations. This study focused on the combination of two novel approaches of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumping</b> <b>tests</b> in fractured media, using recently developed theories of flow in fractal media, and inverse modelling: 1. A theoretical study investigating the properties of regular and stochastic fractal fracture networks. The main aim is to study functional relationships between fractal dimension measures of these networks, fractional flow dimensions, network connectivity and fracture probability in order to condition stochastic fracture networks. This is a first step to model the pumping response making use of the underlying fractal structure of fractured rocks. Computer codes and algorithms were developed and adapted to generate two-dimensional fracture networks with fractal properties using an iterated function system. Code was developed to prepare these networks for input into a finite element code so that the fractional flow dimension can be obtained. Results indicate that connectivity is related to flow dimension, and also to the network topology (“diffusion slowdown"). Calibration curves were generated that relate fractal dimension, flow dimension, fracture probability and connectivity. 2. Another part {{of this study was to}} test the usefulness of a direct inverse modelling approach (“simulated annealing"). This method tries to fit existing <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data by altering the conductivity properties of a network input “template" (e. g. a generic 2 -D regular mesh), without the intermediate step of parameter estimation using traditional type curves. A new approach was the combination of this method with the fractal fracture network generator mentioned above. Computer programmes were developed to inverse model synthetic <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data generated from fractal networks. It was revealed that inverse modelling runs generate networks with similar fractal properties as the one that was used to generate the <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data. The actual appearance of networks, however, can be radically different. Most importantly, by generating several instances of networks for the same input data it is possible to obtain a measure of uncertainty, with networks showing similar connectedness in regions of low uncertainty and large variations in other regions, enabling to determine how well different wells are connected, and where more data need to be collected to allow meaningful predictions In addition to the results obtained, the developed computer code will be of potential great use for the research group, enabling further work to study fractal media. The simulated annealing method and fractal network algorithms can be easily extended to 3 -D and should be used in future work as soon as real data sets and enough computing power become available. A possible application of this method would be the interpretation of the NIREX RCF 3 long term <b>pumping</b> <b>test</b> data set (requested data from NIREX did not arrive in time for this project) ...|$|R

Understanding groundwater flows in such a context is of prime importance for sustainable aquifer management. Here, we describe a detailed study of fracture properties and relate the hydraulic connectivity of fractures to groundwater flows at local and watershed scales. Investigations were carried out at a dedicated Experimental Hydrogeological Park in Andhra Pradesh (Southern India) where a large network of observation boreholes has been set up. Twenty-height boreholes have been drilled in a small area of about 18, 000 m 2 in which borehole loggings and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> were carried out to locate the main flowing fractured zones and investigate fractures connectivity. Several <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tests</b> (nineteen slug <b>tests</b> and three <b>pumping</b> <b>tests)</b> performed under two water level conditions revealed contrasting behavior. Under high water level conditions, the interface including {{the bottom of the}} saprolite and the first flowing fractured zone in {{the upper part of the}} granite controls groundwater flows at the watershed-scale. Under low water level conditions, the aquifer is characterized by lateral compartmentalization due to a decrease in the number of flowing fractures with depth. Depending on the water level conditions, the aquifer shifts from a watershed flow system to independent local flow systems. A conceptual groundwater flow model, which includes depth-dependent fracture connectivity, is proposed to illustrate this contrasting hydrological behavior. Implications for watershed hydrology, groundwater chemistry and aquifer vulnerability are also discussed...|$|R
