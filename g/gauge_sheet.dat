30|$|Cold-formed {{steel is}} the common term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing thin <b>gauges</b> of <b>sheet</b> steel into goods. CFS goods are created by the working of sheet steel using stamping, rolling, or presses to deform the sheet into a usable product. The use of CFS construction materials has {{become more and more}} popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry, both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin <b>gauges</b> of <b>sheet</b> steel. The material thicknesses for such thin-walled steel members usually range from 0.0147  in. (0.373  mm) to about ¼ in. (6.35  mm). Steel plates and bars as thick as 1  in. (25.4  mm) can also be cold-formed successfully into structural shapes. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up zs and other components. The manufacturing of CFS products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling (Chen 2010).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The present work {{studied the}} {{microstructure}} of near-surface deformed layers and their evolution from the transfer slab {{to the cold}} rolled final <b>gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> of an AA 3104 aluminium alloy. Electron microscopy of ultramicrotomed cross-sections revealed two types of near-surface deformed layers, i. e. type A and type B, both with different microstructures to the underlying bulk alloy. A typical feature of the deformed layers is the nano-sized ultrafine grains, with diameters ≤ 200 nm for the type A and ≤ 500 nm for the type B deformed layer. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicated that oxide particles are present along grain boundaries within the type A deformed layer, while the type B deformed layer is free of oxide particles. The type A deformed layer is mainly generated at elevated temperatures {{during the early stages}} of hot rolling. Its thickness is non-uniform across the surface, with a maximum of ~ 4 µm on the transfer slab, ~ 1 µm on the re-roll <b>gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> and ~ 0. 8 µm on the final <b>gauge</b> <b>sheet.</b> While the surface of the hot rolled sheet is mainly covered by the type A deformed layer, the surface undergone cold rolling is alternately covered by the type A and the type B deformed layers...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A high-purity Al alloy and a {{supersaturated}} Al- 0. 3 wt. % Sc alloy were accumulative roll bonded (ARB) at 200 °C {{to generate}} 0. 5 mm <b>gauge</b> <b>sheet</b> consisting of 32 alternating layers of Al and Al(Sc). The material was subsequently annealed for 6 h at 350 °C. The deformation and annealed microstructures were investigated using {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The deformation microstructure composed primarily of lamellar bands of unequal fineness with shear bands and deformation bands being additional substructural features in the Al(Sc) layers. The high strain deformation generated Al layers containing lamellar boundaries separated by a large fraction of high angle grain boundaries, thereby creating the ideal microstructure for continuous recrystallization. Annealing of the as-deformed material generated a hybrid microstructure consisting of alternating layers consisting of ~ 20 µm grains produced by continuous recrystallization (Al layers) and a lightly recovered substructure (Al(Sc) layers); the latter were highly resistant to recrystallization due to precipitation of nanosized Al 3 Sc particles during annealing...|$|E

This report examines how the combustible core of expanded polystyrene insulated panel behaves when exposed to a radiant heat source at elevated temperatures. A number of fires in commercial/industrial buildings constructed from this product, mainly in Europe, have highlighted concerns about its performance and safety. A series of experiments were conducted which simulated the situation of a flue passing through a roof or ceiling in a building that was constructed from expanded polystyrene insulated panel. Specimens of the product were placed immediately adjacent to a stainless steel flue with surface temperatures ranging from 600 - 900 °C approximately. The behaviour of the expanded polystyrene core of the insulated panel was monitored. The primary conclusion of the project was that, although the expanded polystyrene core of the specimens ignited for the higher flue temperatures, {{there was no evidence of}} the combustion spreading through the core. In all cases, the flaming died out after the core had shrunk far enough away from the flue...|$|E
50|$|Stamped brasses {{on heavy}} horse harness {{appeared}} on the scene around 1880, with a small number occurring perhaps a decade or so earlier, and it is highly likely that the process developed from one that was already established in the manufacture of carriage harness trappings and military insignia. However, production of these appears to have peaked shortly before the First World War, and Since the 1920s, a few types have been produced but their quality is rather poor being made from thinner <b>gauge</b> brass <b>sheet.</b> Due to serious considerations of the sheer weight of cast harness decorations carried by working horses (first raised by the early animal welfare movements in the late 19th century) it is thought that the first stamped brasses were made as a lighter, (and cheaper) alternative to cast brasses being later exported throughout the British Empire. Unlike their cast cousins, stamped brasses were not made in moulds, but pressed out of rolled sheet brass approximately 1/16 in thickness although other <b>gauges</b> of <b>sheet</b> than earlier examples. Due to the ease of their manufacture, many thousands of these stamped types were produced, but there are some that are very rare.|$|R

The droplet detachment during short circuiting is controlled so as to reduce spatter and fume generation and improve productivity (Stava 1993; Goecke 2005 a, b; Huisman 2000). These arcs are commercially marketed under different trade market names: Cold Metal transfer (CMT): (FRONIUS International GmbH), ColdArc: (EWM Hightec Welding GmbH), Surface Tension Transfer (STT): (Lincoln Electric), Cold Process (CP): (CLOOS), FastRoot (KEMPPI), Regulated Metal Deposition (RMD): (Miller Electric Mfg), etc. Pépe et al. (2011) investigated the efficiency of controlled GMAW. The results revealed for STT, fast root and CMT an efficiency of around 85 %. Controlled short arc {{can be used in}} almost all welding positions, with almost all kinds of metallic materials, and with different thicknesses. Controlled short arc is applicable to joining thin sheets, joining zinc-coated and non-coated stainless steel metal sheets, and joining aluminium alloys. Welding of very thin metal sheets made of carbon steel, high alloy steel, low alloy steels, and aluminium is also possible (Deruntz 2003). Nowadays, the thicknesses of materials used in the car industry are becoming lower than 0.3  mm and the GMAW process with short arc is no longer suitable. Further applications of controlled short arc are GMAW robot welding and brazing for ultra-light <b>gauge</b> <b>sheets</b> in both manual and automatic modes in any position. Dissimilar materials can be welded, such as aluminium and steel, steel and magnesium, and also magnesium alloys (Rosado et al. 2008; Srinivasan and Balasubramanian 2011; Matusiak and Pfeifer 2011). Although the control of short arc gives more flexibility of applications, it requires advanced power source and sometimes special designed torches.|$|R

A similar process for the production of a Ni-Cr-Al-ThO 2 alloy having improved oxidation resistance was investigated but the non-reproducible deposition of aluminum from duplex Cr/Al packs precluded successful scale-up.

40|$|The use {{of heavy}} <b>gauge</b> steel <b>sheets</b> for {{structural}} applications very often requires {{a combination of}} high yield strength and adequate toughness. The most cost effective way to realize a high yield strength and a high ductility in a low alloyed steel is grain refinement. In industrial practice, this refinement is realized by controlled processing. This process consists of controlling the slab reheating temperature, applying {{a large amount of}} hot deformation below the nonrecrystallization temperature (T-nr) and accelerated cooling. A better knowledge of T-nr could optimize the process and the best mechanical properties could be reached against the lowest cost. T-nr can be raised by the addition of microalloying elements such as Nb. Nb can retard the static recrystallization of austenite at low temperatures either by solute drag or by precipitation pinning. In this study, the recrystallization behavior of five Nb-microalloyed model alloys with various Nb contents, was evaluated by double hit compression tests.
