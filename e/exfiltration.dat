40|$|AbstractCurrently, in Romania {{there are}} many {{landfills}} and tailings ponds for industrial or municipal waste that are in operation or closed, many of those with environmental problems. As the vast majorities were built decades ago, without sealing and drainage measures, runoff water infiltrates in the tailings mass, this results in contamination of soil, subsoil and groundwater as result of <b>exfiltrations.</b> A first step in evaluating the contamination degree is to assess the amount of rainfall water infiltrating through and outflowing from the tailing pond. The paper presents a possible approach for this assessment, using numerical modeling for two case studies of tailing ponds: one without sealing measures and one having a lining system...|$|R
40|$|Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are {{the most}} {{critical}} menaces to modern organizations and the most challenging attacks to detect. They span {{over long periods of}} time, use encrypted connections and mimic normal behaviors in order to evade detection based on traditional defensive solutions. We propose an innovative approach that is able to analyze efficiently high volumes of network traffic to reveal weak signals related to data <b>exfiltrations</b> and other suspect APT activities. The final result is a ranking of the most suspicious internal hosts; this rank allows security specialists to focus their analyses on a small set of hosts out of the thousands of machines that typically characterize large organizations. Experimental evaluations in a network environment consisting of about 10 K hosts show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our proposal based on security analytics paves the way to novel forms of automatic defense aimed at early detection of APTs in large and continuously varying networked systems...|$|R
5|$|The Spirit of Fires crew awakens from cryosleep at the Ark and {{receives}} a UNSC {{signal from the}} surface of the installation. Spartan Red Team is deployed to investigate the signal. They recover Isabel from a base but during the <b>exfiltration,</b> Spartan Douglas-042 is injured in an engagement with Atriox and Spartan Alice-130 is left stranded on the Ark. Back on the Spirit of Fire, Isabel reveals to Captain Cutter how Atriox and the Banished invaded the Ark, which leads Cutter to declare war on the Banished. A strike team manages to set up a forward base and defeat Decimus, who is salvaging the Ark’s resources. Decimus escapes and orders a bombardment upon his own base. Upon investigating the wreckage, Isabel discovers information about the Cartographer, a map of key systems and weapons upon the Ark. The team secures a Forerunner elevator and ascends to the Cartographer.|$|E

30|$|Aquatic {{vegetation}} {{is strongly}} {{governed by the}} groundwater/surface water connectivity in aquatic ecosystems (Bornette and Amoros 1991; Bornette and Large 1995; Bornette et al. 1998 b). The distribution of aquatic plant species {{is related to the}} nutrient levels (Carbiener et al. 19901995; Onaindia et al. 1996; Britto et al. 2001) and seasonal thermal variation in the water (Bornette and Puijalon 20092011). In aquatic habitats, there is a strong correlation between the intensity of groundwater <b>exfiltrations</b> and seasonal temperature variability (Sakura 1993; Bornette and Large 1995). The various water sources that supply aquatic habitats usually strongly contrast in terms of nutrient levels (Bornette et al. 1998 a; Bornette and Arens 2002). Knowledge of the ecological requirements of species that occur in a given habitat allows the determination of the origin and turnover rate of the water that supplies the habitat (Amoros et al. 2000). For this purpose we had to i) identify the ecological range of aquatic species in terms of trophic levels in the water and temperature, ii) map the occurrence of aquatic species in the aquatic habitats of the floodplain and iii) determine the weight of groundwater supplies in each of these aquatic habitats and their potential origin, as estimated using the abundance and ecological requirements of the aquatic species.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of sensitive data {{and technologies is}} critical in preserving United States (U. S.) national security and minimizing economic losses. However, during a cyber attack, the operational capability to constrain the <b>exfiltrations</b> of sensitive data and technologies may not be available. A cyber preparedness methodology (CPM) can improve operational capability and cyber security. The CPM enables a corporation to (a) characterize cyber threats; (b) determine the level of preparedness necessary to ensure mission success; (c) facilitate strategic planning for cyber security (CS); and (d) establish priorities for CS investment planning and management decisions. The cyber preparedness framework (CPF) underlies the CPM. A corporation 2 ̆ 7 s leadership articulates its fundamental approach to risk management (RM) and mission assurance, and determines its target level of preparedness. Typically, corporations utilize the CPF to (a) characterize the caliber of the threat; (b) assess the technical and operational capabilities to counter the threat; and (c) develop the governance and processes necessary to achieve its cyber preparedness level. The problem that was investigated in this case study was how to construct a CPF for Lockheed Martin (LM) that {{works in conjunction with}} a risk management process (RMP). The goal was to extend the CPF into an RMP to construct a risk management framework (RMF) paradigm that can aid similarly large-sized private sector U. S. Government (USG) contractors in implementing the CPM. In this investigation, the author identified the corporate (a) security categorization, (b) cyber threats, (c) cyber threat level, (d) cyber preparedness level, (e) capabilities the corporation should utilize to counter cyber threats, and (f) governance and processes necessary to achieve the cyber preparedness level for a large-sized private sector USG contractor. The results of this investigation were organized in terms of RMP phases. Based on the results, the author constructed an RMF paradigm that can aid similarly large-sized USG contractors in implementing a CPM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRehabilitation of sewer {{networks}} has {{to serve}} various objectives, {{both in terms}} of present general performance, and in terms of long term sustainability. Part of these stakes are external to the sewerage utility operation, such as social impacts of sewer failures, or social impacts of works. These external impacts are to some extend considered in real life decisions, and should therefore also be taken into account in decision support systems. CARE-S project (2003 - 05 EU 5 th Framework Program), Computer Aided Rehabilitation of Sewer systems, has developed a decision support environment and software prototype, including data management procedures, a set of performance indicators, models describing the condition and evolution of sewers, models describing the risks and consequences of failures, a database describing rehabilitation technologies with their characteristics, an assessment of socio-economic criteria, a long term planning tool, multi-criteria decision tools. The objective is to help utility managers to rehabilitate the right pipe, at the right time, with the right technology. Criteria concern on one hand impacts during rehabilitation works, criteria used for the selection of the best technique for rehabilitating the concerned pipe in a multi-criteria decision making procedure, on the other hand impacts during a failure, criteria used for the selection of pipes candidates for rehabilitation. We worked out criteria such as time loss due to traffic deviation, economic loss for trades due to accessibility problems during works but also criteria concerning ground water or surface water pollution damages risk during overflow or due to <b>exfiltrations</b> from the pipes. Concerning floods damages in celars during overflow, valuation has taking into account methods used for river flooding damages concerning material goods (Werey & alii, 2005). A second project INDIGAU Performance Indicators for urban sewer networks asset management (financed by the ANR, French Research Agency, 2007 - 10) goes further on with the valuation of the impact criteria using methods coming from the environmental economics such as Willigness to pay (Rozan, 2004) or contigent ranking (Hurlimann & Mckay, 2007) recently used for giving a value to intangible damages or impacts such as odors problems or loss of sentimental affect goods such as photographs during floods due to overflows of the networks (Larabi, 2009).

The North Koreans sometimes raided the islands, and were even known to wipe out guerrillas they found, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|The 8th SOS {{opened a}} new chapter in its {{distinguished}} history when it transitioned from the MC-130 Combat Talon I to the CV-22 Osprey in August 2006. Development of the CV-22 Osprey stems directly from the 1980 failed Iran hostage rescue attempt. After three decades of development and testing, the CV-22 passed its final exam with the completion of initial operational test and evaluation flown by the 8th SOS crew. The CV-22 fulfills the unique Air Force requirement for a platform capable of long-range, infiltration and <b>exfiltration</b> to targets located anywhere in the world. With the combined ability to fly at C-130 speeds and land to austere landing areas like a helicopter, the Osprey brings a revolutionary capability to combatant commanders.|$|E
