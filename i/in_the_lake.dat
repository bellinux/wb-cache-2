5|$|Redfish and trout {{were once}} the main {{species of fish}} living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> until the {{construction}} of an embankment reduced their populations. A large quantity of silt is now deposited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from the Guadalupe River, after the dredging of a freshwater channel that supplies farmers and the Union Carbide plant in Seadrift. The channel has negatively affected the delta ecosystem by diminishing the river's nutritional input.|$|E

5|$|At {{least four}} cones, four stratovolcanoes, and three craters are visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> The Tandukbenua cone on the northwestern {{edge of the}} caldera has only sparse vegetation, {{suggesting}} a young age of several hundred years. Also, the Pusubukit (Hill Center) volcano (1971 metres above sea level) on the south edge of the caldera is solfatarically active.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> District.

50|$|The Mitchell River silt jetties {{are subject}} to erosion caused by a {{salinity}} increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> which is slowly killing off the vegetation.

5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> {{and deposited}} in the desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish.

5|$|Phumdis {{are used}} by the local people for {{constructing}} their huts for fishing and other livelihood uses, and are inhabited by about 4000 people.
