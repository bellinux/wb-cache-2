DC drives are widely used in public electric transport, such as trams, trolleybuses and electric trains. The feed-forward backpropagation neural network is used for controller.

However, different types of systems have distinct differences in electricity service conditions. These conditions partly explain why households with SHS exhibit the greatest reduction in kerosene use; why grid-connected households own more appliances; and why electricity access benefits small businesses, but seldom <b>drives</b> <b>key</b> business decisions.

40|$|Activation of JAK 2 by {{chromosomal}} translocation or point mutation is a recurrent event in hematopoietic malignancies, including acute leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Although {{the effects of}} activated JAK 2 signaling have been examined in cell lines and murine models, the functional consequences of deregulated JAK 2 {{in the context of}} human hematopoietic cells are currently unknown. Here we report that expression of TEL-JAK 2, a constitutively active variant of the JAK 2 kinase, in lineage-depleted human umbilical cord blood cells results in erythropoietin-independent erythroid differentiation in vitro and induces the rapid development of myelofibrosis in an in vivo NOD/SCID xenotransplantation assay.

The goal of the present paper is to introduce such a different type of risk modelling framework, i. e., functional risk modelling.

The direction, frequency, {{and intensity of}} biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented {{since the end of}} the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species ’ relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems. Climate change has occurred repeatedlythroughout Earth’s history, but the recentrate of warming far exceeds that of any previouswarming episode in the past 10, 000 years (1, 2) and perhaps far longer.

40|$|Anecdotal {{observations}} suggest hypoxia {{does not}} elicit dyspnea. An opposing {{view is that}} any stimulus to medullary respiratory centers generates dyspnea via corollary discharge to higher centers; absence of dyspnea during low inspired PO 2 may result from increased ventilation and hypocapnia. We hypothesized that, with fixed ventilation, hypoxia and hypercapnia generate equal dyspnea when matched by ventilatory drive. Steady-state levels of hypoxic normocapnia (PETO 2 = 60 - 40 torr) and hypercapnic hyperoxia (PETCO 2 = 40 - 50 torr) were induced in naïve subjects when free-breathing and during fixed mechanical ventilation. In a separate experiment, normocapnic hypoxia and normoxic hypercapnia, matched by ventilation in free-breathing trials, were presented to experienced subjects breathing with constrained rate and tidal volume. Air hunger was rated every 30 s on a VAS. Air hunger/PETO 2 curves rose sharply at PETO 2 0. 05). Hypercapnia had unpleasant non-respiratory effects but was otherwise perceptually indistinguishable from hypoxia. We conclude that hypoxia and hypercapnia have equal potency for air hunger when matched by ventilatory drive. Air hunger may therefore arise via brainstem respiratory <b>drive.</b> <b>Key</b> words: visual analog scale; human; perception; adverse ECG effects; steady state; shortness of breath; breathlessnes...|$|E

Efficient parameter estimation techniques {{are essential to}} obtain the parameters such as stator and rotor resistances, leakage and magnetizing inductances, because any mismatch between the actual and computed parameter values may lead to detoriation of control performance of the induction motor drive.
