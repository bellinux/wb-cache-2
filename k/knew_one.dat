5|$|As Walker was {{dominating}} the local competition, {{he began to}} look for other options. In 2007 his coach Ivan Manco, who came from Slovakia, arranged for Walker to tryout for HC Vítkovice in the Czech Republic, where Manco <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> of the coaches. Walker impressed the team enough {{to be given a}} place on their under-18 junior team. In 2009–10 he recorded 42 points in 28 games for the U18 team and earned a chance to play for the U20 team. He also returned to Australia during the Czech offseason and played for the Sydney Ice Dogs of the Australian Ice Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland was {{the scene}} of an {{attempted}} murder-suicide in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men <b>knew.</b> <b>One</b> man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near Dover. U.S. Senator Benjamin Tillman and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract) The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{reflection}} of the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin in the Czech legal order. Knowledge of one's own origin and the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin constitute not only a legal but also a moral and ethical question. The right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin (i. e. the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> parents, one's biological family and one's ancestors) is one of the subjective human rights, which belongs to every natural person. This right is more or less reflected in majority of institutes of family law. The thesis analyses the most important of them and indicates how the right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin is reflected in these institutes or it is not, although it should be. The work seeks to highlight possible shortcomings of the legislation and tries to propose possible solutions de lege ferenda. There are also stated (for the purposes of comparison) some examples of foreign legislation in cases of some legal institutes. The diploma thesis is based on the legislation effective on the 26 th March 2016. It is composed of an introduction, five chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter {{deals with the}} right to <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin and its legal regulation in the Czech Republic. It mainly discusses the international conventions that are (in compliance with the Art. 10 of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle? The principle, also {{sometimes}} called “positive introspection”, {{says that if}} <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P. It is widely, although not universally, acknowledged that the KK principle is false, {{and not just for}} the boring reason that <b>one</b> can <b>know</b> that P without having formed the belief that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P. <b>One</b> can <b>know</b> that P, and believe that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, without knowing that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to <b>know</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P than it is with respect to the fact that P itself. But how much weaker can one’s epistemic position be with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P than it is with respect to the fact that P? Of course, if <b>one</b> does <b>know</b> that P, <b>one’s</b> epistemic position with respect to the fact that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P cannot be so bad that <b>one</b> positively <b>knows</b> that <b>one</b> does not <b>know</b> that P, as opposed to merely failing to <b>know</b> that <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> that P, for knowing is 1 factive: <b>one</b> can <b>know</b> only what is indeed the case.

25|$|Chabanon {{had written}} a play on the subject, Éponine, in 1762. He later {{transformed}} it into a tragedy, Sabinus, which was performed at the Comédie-Française in 1770, but audiences were unenthusiastic. Undiscouraged, Chabanon decided to turn the piece into a libretto for a tragédie lyrique, which he offered to Gossec the following year. The composer and Chabanon already <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> other because Chabanon was a violinist {{as well as an}} author. By the summer of 1773, the score was ready and went into rehearsal at the Théâtre des Menus Plaisirs on 8 June.

25|$|By the 1920s Winter Carnaval {{celebrations}} were abandoned, and Summer Carnaval {{remained the}} only Carnaval in Santiago de Cuba. On Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays {{during the month}} of June, everyone in Cuba <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> could go to Santiago to party. The major patrons of these summer festivities were local industries: Polar, La Cristal and Hatuey beers; Bacardi rum; and Eden tobacco. Many of the participants in Summer Carnaval were the newly unemployed sugar and coffee workers, who were quite willing to remain in Santiago after the harvest and work for their commercial patrons in the jobs that the festival season created. This combination- the unemployed and the commercial sponsor- contributed to the popularity of Summer Carnaval. During the 1940s and early 50s, Carnaval in both Santiago de Cuba and Havana became more commercialized.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} breed standard {{was written in}} 1933. This standard attempted to differentiate the Estrela as a distinct breed. This led to the hooked tail and double dew claws becoming a requirement. All colors were allowed. The standard has undergone small refinements since then. For example, dew claws became optional by 1955, and the allowed colors have been limited {{a few times to}} achieve today’s current set.Prior to World War II, the Estrela breeders were still primarily the shepherds and farmers of the region. Since they were mostly illiterate, they did not make any attempt to follow the official breed standard, if they even <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> existed. But by the early 1950s, interest in the breed returned, and the annual concursos were reinstated. Again the intent was to stimulate interest among the Serra residents and to encourage them to adhere to the official standard. During this period, the long-haired variety was most popular at shows, but “show dogs” represented (and still do) {{only a small portion of}} the Estrela population in Portugal. Many of the working dogs were (and are) short-haired.|$|E

MCC delegates took issue with Wills' [...] "continued non-attendance" [...] at meetings, and when the club fell into debt, his poor administrative skills were blamed. He acted on year-long threats in mid-1858 and deserted the MCC, leaving its records and amenities in dissaray; to this day, the only minutes that cannot be found date from his secretaryship. A lasting tension existed between Wills and the MCC's inner circle. According to Martin Flanagan, [...] "It was a relationship which couldn't last as Wills only <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> way—his own." ...|$|E

500|$|Weinberg {{was still}} living at home when he met Bruce Springsteen on April 7, 1974 when his band, The Jim Marino Band, were Springsteen's support at Seton Hall. Springsteen had parted ways with his drummer, Vini [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Lopez, earlier that year, and the replacement, Ernest [...] "Boom" [...] Carter, lasted only six months before leaving with pianist David Sancious to form Tone. Weinberg {{answered}} a Springsteen Village Voice newspaper ad that famously requested, [...] "no junior Ginger Bakers," [...] in reference to Ginger Baker's reputation for long drum solos. [...] Weinberg auditioned with Springsteen and the core E Street Band in mid-late August of that year at the SIR studios in Midtown Manhattan, bringing a minimalist drum kit with him consisting only of hi-hats, a snare drum and a bass drum. He <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> Springsteen song from the Marino band, [...] "Sandy", and played it. His drumming on the Fats Domino song [...] "Let the Four Winds Blow" [...] sealed the position as his. A week later he was offered the $110 per week job (US$ in [...] dollars) and he quit college immediately, about six academic credits short of a degree. Weinberg's first public performance came on September 19, 1974, at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.|$|E
500|$|Athletic {{authorities}} {{argued that}} Ward should not play {{because it would}} be discourteous to Georgia Tech, and he might be injured. [...] There was fear that if Ward played, he would be injured by malicious blows after the play had ended. [...] Playwright Arthur Miller, then a writer for Michigan’s student newspaper, learned first-hand about the strong resistance among the Georgia Tech team to playing on the same field with an African-American athlete. In his biography of Miller, Enoch Brater noted that Miller had friends from Arkansas who <b>knew</b> <b>one</b> of the Georgia Tech players. Brater described Miller’s involvement this way: “Remmel [...] took Miller with them to meet with members of the team, to protest but also to appeal to the athletes' sense of fair play. ‘Miller was {{right in the middle of}} this’, Remmel recalls. Not only did the visiting team rebuff ‘the Yankee’ Miller ‘in salty language’, but they told him they would actually kill Ward if he set one foot on the Michigan gridiron. [...] ‘The Georgia Tech team was wild.’ [...] Miller was furious. He ‘went immediately to the office of the Michigan Daily and wrote an article about it, but it was not published.’ [...] [...] [...] Remmel said that Miller ‘could not believe that the Georgia Tech team would have tried to destroy Willis Ward—but, I am sure they would have.’” ...|$|E
