25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 2005, the airline drastically reduced flights at its Indianapolis hub to only three destinations and centered scheduled flights at Chicago Midway International Airport in order to complement Southwest Airlines codeshare flights. ATA also focused on serving markets that were business oriented {{and did not have}} Southwest service, such as San Francisco, Dallas/Fort Worth, and New York–LaGuardia. Additionally, ATA began offering point-to-point service not connecting to its Midway Hub, as to benefit other Southwest Airlines focus cities, such as Las Vegas, Orlando, and Phoenix, with connections to non-Southwest destinations such as Denver and Hawaii.

25|$|Around March 29, 2010, Joran van der Sloot {{contacted}} Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly with {{an offer}} to reveal the location of her daughter's body and the circumstances surrounding her death for an advance of US$25,000 against a total of $250,000. <b>Kelly</b> <b>said</b> that he secretly went to Aruba in April to meet with Van der Sloot, who was desperate for money, and gave him $100. Kelly notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation {{to set up a}} sting operation with the Aruban authorities. On May 10, Van der Sloot accepted the amount of $15,000 by wire transfer from Birmingham to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Natalee's remains in the foundation of a house. Authorities determined that the information that he in return provided was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Natalee's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the Office of the U.S. Attorney in Birmingham later claimed in a joint statement that they were working as quickly as possible and that the Lima murder was in no way the result of them allowing Van der Sloot to flee Aruba with the extorted money.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{spoke on}} February 3, 2011, at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. His remarks closed the event, where President Obama also spoke.

[...] <b>Kelly</b> <b>said</b> that, in Tucson, as he found himself wandering in makeshift memorials and shrines, filled with Bibles and angels that [...] "You pray where you are. You pray when God is there in your heart." [...] Kelly offered the final prayer of the morning.

5000|$|When {{speaking}} to NME, lead singer <b>Kelly</b> Jones <b>said</b> {{the song is}} [...] "about finding some hope in life.

6000|$|He {{went through}} the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because {{he was going to}} have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry <b>Kelly's</b> <b>said</b> A crown! but the {{consignor}} held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office-girls. His head was full of the noises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys: ...|$|R

500|$|Moriarty {{criticized the}} game's draw {{distance}} and texture loading and Whitehead noted some framerate and environmental glitches.

500|$|<b>Kelly</b> <b>said</b> that Donen's {{impulsive}} {{marriage to}} Coyne showed an emotional immaturity {{and lack of}} good judgment, and stated that [...] "Jeannie's marriage to Stanley was doomed from the start.
