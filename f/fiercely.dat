5|$|Starting in 1997, Greyhound {{had faced}} {{significant}} {{competition in the}} northeast from Chinatown bus lines. By 2003, more than 250 buses, operated by competitors like Fung Wah and Lucky Star Bus were competing <b>fiercely</b> from curbsides in the Chinatowns of New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. When operating on inter-city routes, the Chinatown buses offered prices about 50% less than Greyhound's.

5|$|The {{election}} was <b>fiercely</b> contested, {{and both sides}} incurred great expenses during the campaign. There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years, {{and during that time}} the Taunton Market House Society was set up with the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election, and to spend money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving the town. Maxwell remained as one of Taunton's members of parliament until 1768.|$|E
5|$|The family {{atmosphere}} Revie instilled at Elland Road {{ensured that}} many Leeds United players remained firm friends and <b>fiercely</b> loyal to Revie long after their playing days had ended; his players also generally avoided financial, addiction or family problems, enjoying largely stable lives even after retirement.

5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the Hessian cavalry against the Prussians, and sent her children to stay with Queen Victoria in England. Despite her pregnancy, she performed the royal duties expected of her sex and station, making bandages for troops and preparing hospitals. On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she begged the Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the <b>fiercely</b> anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which she, like her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E
5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is <b>fiercely</b> {{defensive}} when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the <b>fiercely</b> contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|Cardinale is a {{political}} liberal who has supported feminist causes over the years. Though she lives in Paris, Cardinale is <b>fiercely</b> outspoken about being identified as an Italian. She also has expressed some pride in being born in an Italian community in Tunisia, and celebrates Tunisia's Arabic culture– as evidenced by her book Ma Tunisie and {{by the fact that}} she appeared as herself in the Tunisian film Un été à La Goulette ("A Summer in La Goulette"). She has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defence of Women's Rights since March 2000, and was a goodwill ambassador for the UNESCO World Water Day for 2006.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and <b>fiercely</b> defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth is {{well known}} for its variety of long-standing student traditions, many of which are {{centered}} on the Green. At Homecoming each fall, a bonfire is constructed on the Green by the freshman class; students and community members gather to watch the freshmen run around it as it burns. The wintertime celebration of Winter Carnival sees the construction of a snow sculpture on the Green. In the springtime, Green Key Weekend is marked by concerts and performances on the Green, which until 1984 was also the site of <b>fiercely</b> competitive Green Key chariot races.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been <b>fiercely</b> debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he <b>fiercely</b> condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, {{sent word}} to the Roman legate {{that he was willing to}} surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist <b>fiercely</b> until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|In 77 BC, {{the senate}} sent one of Sulla's former lieutenants, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great"), {{to put down}} an {{uprising}} in Hispania. By 71 BC, Pompey returned to Rome after having completed his mission. Around the same time, another of Sulla's former lieutenants, Marcus Licinius Crassus, had just put down the Spartacus-led gladiator/slave revolt in Italy. Upon their return, Pompey and Crassus found the populares party <b>fiercely</b> attacking Sulla's constitution. They attempted to forge {{an agreement with the}} populares party. If both Pompey and Crassus were elected consul in 70 BC, they would dismantle the more obnoxious components of Sulla's constitution. The two were soon elected, and quickly dismantled most of Sulla's constitution.|$|E
5|$|In May 1803 a shipload of captive West Africans, upon {{surviving}} the middle passage, were landed by U.S.-paid captors in Savannah by slave ship, to be auctioned off {{at one of}} the local slave markets. The ship's enslaved passengers included a number of Igbo people from what is now Nigeria. The Igbo were known by planters and slavers of the American South for being <b>fiercely</b> independent and resistant to chattel slavery. The group of 75 Igbo slaves were bought by agents of John Couper and Thomas Spalding for forced labor on their plantations in St. Simons Island for $100 each.|$|E
5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two <b>fiercely</b> fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{emigrated to}} Australia from England around 1880 and {{established}} himself as a journalist, subsequently serving in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1894 to 1898, during which time he <b>fiercely</b> opposed the proposed Federation despite supporting the principle. He {{was a member of the}} New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 until his election to the Australian Senate as a Free Trader from New South Wales at the first federal election in 1901. Millen led the conservative parties in the Senate from 1907 until shortly before his death in 1923.|$|E
5|$|On 10 January 1870, Rockefeller {{abolished}} the partnership of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler, forming Standard Oil of Ohio. Continuing to apply {{his work ethic}} and efficiency, Rockefeller quickly expanded the company {{to be the most}} profitable refiner in Ohio. Likewise, it became one of the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads competed <b>fiercely</b> for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company offering special deals to bulk customers like Standard Oil, outside the main oil centers. The cartel offered preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep discounts/rebates of up to 50% for their product but rebates for the shipment of competing products.|$|E
5|$|On 8February 1913, the Ottoman navy {{supported}} an {{amphibious assault}} at Şarköy. Turgut Reis and Barbaros Hayreddin, {{along with two}} small cruisers provided artillery support to the right flank of the invading force once it went ashore. The ships were positioned about a kilometer off shore; Turgut Reis was the second ship in the line, behind her sister Barbaros Hayreddin. The Bulgarian army resisted <b>fiercely,</b> which ultimately forced the Ottoman army to retreat, though the withdrawal was successful in large {{part due to the}} gunfire support from Turgut Reis {{and the rest of the}} fleet. During the battle, Turgut Reis fired 225rounds from her 10.5cm guns and 202 shells from her 8.8cm guns.|$|E
