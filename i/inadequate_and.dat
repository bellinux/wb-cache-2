5|$|In 1924 {{the museum}} {{moved to the}} Imperial Institute {{building}} (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s {{to make way for}} Imperial College) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the River Thames in Southwark.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} historians tend to {{summarise}} {{the issue by}} saying that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania and Polish attack violated it. However, Piotr Łossowski argued that such summaries are <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> misleading.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of the emotional attachment to parents of children with adequate <b>and</b> <b>inadequate</b> age <b>and</b> gender identity. Characteristics of the age and gender identity in children of preschool age (with adequate <b>and</b> <b>inadequate</b> age <b>and</b> gender identity) were established. Similar and distinctive features of the emotional attachment to parents of children with adequate <b>and</b> <b>inadequate</b> age <b>and</b> gender identity were revealed. We have also determined the presence and specificity of the relationship between characteristics of the emotional attachment to their parents and the age and gender identity in children of preschool age...|$|R

5|$|Much like in {{its early}} days, the bridge still carries a lot of traffic related to the fruit {{production}} industry, especially during picking and harvesting seasons. Bridge lifts are timed to try and avoid traffic delays. Some in the local community consider that {{the capacity of the}} bridge is <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> impedes commercial activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} founded in 1848, but a local hall was used for {{services}} until a wooden church was built in 1849. The wooden structure eventually proved <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> a larger church designed by Peabody and Stearns was built of local fieldstone at the current location between 1897 and 1898.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{maintained}} that Hoover's {{response to the}} continuing depression and the severe drought in 1930 were <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> {{pointed out that the}} $45million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to less than half the losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of radioactive materials into the air and the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{military}} and civil defenses {{were unable to}} stop the Allied attacks. The number of fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft guns assigned to defensive duties in the home islands was <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> most of these aircraft and guns had difficulty reaching the high altitudes at which B-29s often operated. Fuel shortages, inadequate pilot training, {{and a lack of}} coordination between units also constrained the effectiveness of the fighter force. Despite the vulnerability of Japanese cities to firebombing attacks, the firefighting services lacked training and equipment, and few air raid shelters were constructed for civilians. As a result, the B-29s were able to inflict severe damage on urban areas while suffering few losses.|$|E
5|$|King's {{acquired}} a lease for the Aldwych Quarter with initial term of 50 years. King's will occupy Bush House and Strand House from September 2016, and King House and Melbourne House from 2025. The Chairman of King's College London, Duke of Wellington {{said that the}} King's Strand Campus has had <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> cramped teaching space for too long, and the acquisition will transform the original campus of King's which dates back to 1829.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; {{he did not like}} the idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives so much that they had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|Stormy weather {{can cause}} the sea level by the coast to rise by up to two metres. In the past, this has caused {{disastrous}} flooding in the town, {{the worst in the}} town's history being in 1953. Coastal defences were subsequently constructed including groynes, sea walls and shingle beach. In the 1990s, these defences were deemed to be <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> an offshore breakwater, now known as Neptune's Arm, was built to protect the most vulnerable areas of the town.|$|E

5|$|The large {{population}} in Antananarivo {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain <b>inadequate</b> <b>and</b> are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. Antananarivo {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{proved to}} be a {{constant}} nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground water seepage, and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction of the tunnel was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel was {{originally}} opened {{as a single}} bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and vehicular traffic. By the 1930s, capacity was becoming <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound.|$|E

5|$|Treaties among Panama, Colombia, and the United States {{to resolve}} {{disputes}} {{arising from the}} Panamanian Revolution of 1903 had been signed by the lame-duck Roosevelt administration in early 1909, and were approved by the Senate and also ratified by Panama. Colombia, however, declined to ratify the treaties, and after the 1912 elections, Knox offered $10 million to the Colombians (later raised to $25 million). The Colombians felt the amount <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> requested arbitration; the matter was not settled under the Taft administration.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the River Slea was not navigable beyond Kyme, as {{the channel}} was <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> there were fish weirs and water mills on its course. Three {{attempts}} were made to obtain an Act of Parliament to authorise improvements, but all were defeated. In 1791, William Jessop and John Hudson were commissioned to prepare a new survey and plans. Jessop was a canal engineer of some repute, with experience of several navigations, including the River Trent at Newark, while Hudson was less well known, but had experience of canal building in eastern England and Yorkshire. Their report was published on 25 November 1791, and estimated that the improvements would cost £9,979.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} state, {{the constitution of}} 1816 began to be criticized. Opponents claimed the constitution had too many appointed positions, the terms established were <b>inadequate,</b> <b>and</b> some of the clauses were too easily manipulated by the political parties {{that did not exist}} when then constitution was written. The first constitution had not been put to a vote by the general public, and following the great population growth in the state, it was seen as inadequate. A constitutional convention was called in January 1851 to create a new one. The new constitution was approved by the convention on February 10, 1851, and submitted for a vote to the electorate that year. It was approved and has since been the official constitution.|$|E
