5|$|<b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> {{the insistence}} of ahimsa {{is not so much}} about non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The {{ultimate}} rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the hiṃsā on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.|$|E
5|$|In 2001–02 Chapman helped Fulham win the FA Women's Premier League Southern Division and {{promotion}} {{to the top}} flight. She also scored two goals in the 7–1 Premier League Cup final win over Birmingham City, after which Fulham's manager Gaute Haugenes claimed Chapman {{was good enough to}} play in any national side in the world. Chapman then scored the winning goal in the 2–1 FA Women's Cup final victory over Doncaster Belles, a volley from 20yards. <b>In</b> <b>Conclusion</b> to the 2001-02 season, Chapman went on to be awarded the Ladies Player of the Season, as well as, winning the Nationwide International Player of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|Siliconera writer Rolando again {{echoed the}} {{necessity}} for understanding Japanese due to the game's text-heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun {{despite the lack of}} WiFi functionality. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn-based role-playing game Lost Odyssey: while it brought nothing new to the genre, it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.|$|E

5|$|The {{exercises}} are intended as notes to guide a spiritual director who is leading someone else through {{an experience of}} Christian meditation. The entire experience takes about 30 days and often involves a daily interview with the director. The process begins with {{a consideration of the}} purpose of one's life and the relationship with the rest of creation. It is followed by a week of meditation about sin and its consequences. Next comes a period of meditating on the events of the life of Jesus, and another for thinking about his suffering and death. The final week is to experience the joy of the resurrection, and <b>in</b> <b>conclusion</b> to reflect on God's love and the response of love for God.|$|E

30|$|One {{possible}} explanation for the differences <b>in</b> <b>conclusions</b> arising <b>in</b> these studies may be caused by the lack of search terms more specific to the pertinent literature, such as “delay” (Baethge et al. 2003 b) or “latency” (Baldessarini et al. 2003) in the overview by Joyce and colleagues.|$|R

25|$|Because the {{velocity}} u {{is not a}} function of position x along the plate, the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x is also independent of x (but the pressure p varies linearly with x). Moreover, the Navier–Stokes equation for {{the velocity}} component perpendicular to the wall reduces to ∂p/∂z=0, so the pressure p and pressure gradient ∂p/∂x are also independent of {{the distance to the}} wall z. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> the pressure forcing ∂p/∂x can only be a function of time t.|$|E
25|$|Patients who {{complain}} of bloating frequently {{can be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with bloating. They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> abdominal distension, pain and bloating symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.|$|E

25|$|The second {{report was}} shorter. It {{recommended}} that Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski should {{move to the}} U.S. where there were plans to make heavy water on a large scale. Plutonium might be more suitable than uranium-235, and plutonium research should continue in Britain. It concluded that the controlled fission of uranium {{could be used to}} generate heat energy for use in machines, and provide large quantities of radioisotopes which could be used as substitutes for radium. Heavy water or possibly graphite might serve as moderator for the fast neutrons. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion</b> though, while the nuclear reactor had considerable promise for future peaceful uses, the committee felt that it was not worth considering during the present war.|$|E
25|$|Taylor, {{representing}} {{the field of}} Humanistic Psychology, presented a balanced review of Transpersonal psychology in the early nineties. On the negative side he mentioned Transpersonal Psychology's tendency toward being philosophically naive, poorly financed, almost anti-intellectual, and somewhat overrated as far as its influences. On the positive side he noted the fields integrated approach to understanding the phenomenology of scientific method; the centrality of qualitative research; {{and the importance of}} interdisciplinary communication. <b>In</b> <b>conclusion</b> he suggested that the virtues of Transpersonal psychology may, in the end, outweigh its defects. In a later article Taylor regarded Transpersonal psychology as a visionary American folk-psychology with little historical relation to American academic psychology, except through its association with Humanistic psychology and the categories of transcendence and consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Visitors to a Shinto shrine {{follow a}} {{purification}} ritual before presenting {{themselves to the}} kami. This ritual begins with hand washing, and swallowing and later spitting {{a small amount of}} water in front of the shrine to purify the body, heart, and mind. Once this is complete they turn their focus to gaining the kami’s attention. The traditional method of doing this is to bow twice, clap twice and bow again, alerting the kami to their presence and desire to commune with them. During the last bow, the supplicant offers words of gratitude and praise to the kami; if they are offering a prayer for aid they will also state their name and address. After the prayer and/or worship they repeat the two bows, two claps and a final bow <b>in</b> <b>conclusion.</b>|$|E
