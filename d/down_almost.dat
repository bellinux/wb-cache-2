5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate {{the difficulty of the}} problems they faced. Their tremendous optimism had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> 20%.|$|E

5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, {{on the grounds that}} it encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had little or nothing to do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} in, the rowing boats had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion {{grounded}} {{to the north}} of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two obsolescent multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), {{in a rare}} exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{was elected to the}} Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E

5|$|The third series faced {{a decline}} in viewership from the second series. The season premiere {{received}} an overnight figure of six million viewers and a 25 per cent audience share. It was <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> two million from the series two premiere in June 2003, which was seen by 7.8million. Ratings declines further as the series continues. The fifth episode dropped to five million. The penultimate episode dropped further to 4.5million, though the finale rose slightly back to five million. However, it was also down from the seven million who saw the series two finale in August 2003. With consolidated figures factored in, the third series was seen {{by an average of}} 5.77million viewers. Despite the ratings decline, the BBC already commissioned a fourth series of Spooks before the third series even began broadcasting.|$|E
5|$|Legend of Mana {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} world of Fa'Diel. The Mana Tree, the giver of mana and life for the world, burned <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> entirely nine centuries prior to the events of the game. A war erupted between faeries, human, and others seeking the scarce power of mana that was left. When the war concluded, the burnt Mana Tree slept as it regrew and the many lands of the world were stored in ancient artifacts. A hero, {{controlled}} by the player, is self-charged with restoring the world, and mana, to its former self. The Lands of Fa'Diel are populated with a large number of different creatures, including humans, faeries, demons, the jewel-hearted Jumi race, plant-like Sproutlings and Flowerlings, miner bears called Dudbears, and shadowy beings of the Underworld known as Shadoles. Fa'Diel is also the home of a host of anthropomorphic animals and objects, as well as monsters from other Mana titles such as Rabites, Chobin Hoods, and Goblins. The player controls the protagonist of the game, who is either a male or female silent protagonist. The character is unnamed and no information is given about their past; their history and personality is meant to be determined by the player.|$|E

25|$|The Task Force {{membership}} {{fell into}} several informal groupings that generally reflected the racial or ideological make-up of the city, and the Task Force operated {{on the idea}} that developing the ability to agree was its most important goal. If a certain topic was going to be discussed at the next meeting, Lowe made sure to talk to everyone individually on the topic beforehand so he knew the direction to take the meeting. The Task Force came close to falling apart came later on during a crucial period when Lowe was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat. He had a pacemaker implanted, and his absence meant Task Force discussions broke <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> immediately. But a quick recovery was made, both for Lowe and the Task Force. The Task Force reached an agreement and presented its plan for desegregating Dallas public schools to Judge Taylor. The plan was accepted essentially as written.|$|E
25|$|Having {{completed}} the patrol, the squadron reported back that the track along Lyon Ridge was suitable for tanks {{and so the}} following day, 16 June 1945, a company from the 2/28th Battalion {{with a number of}} tanks from the 2/9th Armoured Regiment launched an attack on the Japanese positions in the Pocket. A section from the 2/11th was attached to the 2/28th Battalion to provide protection to its tactical headquarters and during the attack, after the assaulting company had become pinned down, it was sent forward and deployed in support of the company that had become pinned <b>down.</b> <b>Almost</b> immediately it came under effective fire and two men were killed, while another was wounded.

25|$|The firm land of {{the delta}} used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> entirely and {{replaced}} with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (Salix alba, Salix fragilis, Salix purpurea, Salix petandra, Salix triandra etc.) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (Populus alba). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the levees of Letea and Caraorman, mixed forests of oak (Quercus robur, Quercus pedunculiflora) with various trees (Fraxinus pallisae, Ulmus foliacea, Populus tremula), shrubs (Prunus spinosa, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa canina, Berberis vulgaris etc.), and vines (Vitis sylvestris, Hedera helix, Humulus lupulus, Periploca graeca, which reaches up to 25m) grow on sand dune areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called hasmace. Fauna of this region include the meadow viper (Vipera ursinii), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), and Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo), etc.|$|E
25|$|Other plot {{developments}} included Gordon's {{marriage to}} the Hamiltons' neighbour Barbara Armstrong (Cornelia Frances), and Jill's involvement with illegal Irish immigrant Brian O'Donnell, whom she agrees to marry so he can obtain a visa {{to stay in the}} country. Jill is raped by drifter Terry Hansen (Andrew Clarke), who is revealed to be Fiona's long-lost son. In a highly controversial storyline, Terry was treated by the scriptwriters as a sympathetic character despite the rape and his subsequent spell in prison. Fiona is shattered when her boarding house in Manly burns <b>down,</b> <b>almost</b> killing Jill in the inferno. A heated love triangle occurs between the characters of Angela, Rob Keegan and Paul Sheppard, following which all three characters depart the show. After Gordon and Barbara enter a business deal with Barbara's brother Stephen Morrell (Michael Long), they are shocked when Stephen suddenly marries Patricia after a whirlwind romance. This leads to the introduction of a third family for the show- the Morrells, including Stephen's mother Dee (Mary Ward), a ruthless elderly businesswoman, and his daughter Amanda (Alyce Platt). Following Dee's death from a heart condition, major developments occur when the contents of her will are revealed, affecting the other characters' lives dramatically. Upon Dee's insistence that a male heir continue her business, Stephen tracks down the young man he believes to be his long-lost son, Andy Green (Danny Roberts).|$|E
25|$|CBS did {{not believe}} that KKR would sell WTVJ to another network, so it {{returned}} with a very low offer. KKR turned CBS's offer <b>down</b> <b>almost</b> out of hand and then approached the other networks. ABC was not interested, since it was more than satisfied with its longtime affiliate, WPLG. However, NBC was very interested because its longtime affiliate, WSVN, heavily preempted the network's daytime lineup—including programs that the network aired in the noon timeslot in favor of running a local newscast, as well as an occasional prime time show. NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than CBS and ABC at the time, and was particularly annoyed at losing valuable advertising in such a fast-growing market. This had not been a problem at first since most of the programs that were preempted by WSVN aired on West Palm Beach-based WPTV, which provided at least grade B signal coverage to nearly the entire Miami-Fort Lauderdale market, and had been available on cable in the area for decades. In the few cases where WPTV and WSVN both turned down an NBC program, the network usually arranged for other stations in the area to carry its programming. However, by 1985, WPTV had been dropped from most Miami cable systems to make way for new cable channels (partly due to limited headend channel capacity), resulting in some NBC programs that were preempted by WSVN being unavailable to some viewers. NBC realized that purchasing its own station with less restrictive ownership laws would guarantee that all of its shows would make it to air. Hence, it made an offer almost as high as Telepictures did a few months before, and in 1987, KKR agreed to sell WTVJ to NBC for $270 million.|$|E
