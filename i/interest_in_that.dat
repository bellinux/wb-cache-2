5|$|Lincoln {{was born}} in Hingham, on May 15, 1749, to Enoch and Rachel (Fearing) Lincoln. His father first apprenticed him to a local blacksmith, but the boy's lack of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> {{business}} and clear interest in reading led to his eventual enrollment in Harvard College. He graduated in 1772, and studied law under Joseph Hawley in Northampton. When news of the Battles of Lexington and Concord reached Northampton, he volunteered for military service, but only served for a short time, marching with the local militia to Cambridge, where militia were besieging British-occupied Boston.|$|E
5|$|Two {{locations}} on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations {{were the primary}} areas of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated {{to be about the}} same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

25|$|Each Group {{was split}} into several Sectors, which handled {{operations}} {{for one or}} more airfields. This formed {{the lowest level of}} the hierarchy, based at the Sector Controls, normally co-located at one of the sector's airfields. For instance, 11 Group was split into sectors A through F running anticlockwise from the south-west to north-east, along with Sector Z to the northwest. A typical sector, Sector C which saw considerable action, was controlled out of Biggin Hill, but also contained another major airbase at West Malling (Maidstone). Telephone links from Sector to Group allowed the Group's version of the map to be re-created at the Sector, again filtering out information that was not of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> area.|$|E

25|$|When her great-uncle's sole heir, Sarah Lockwood Winchester, {{the widow}} of his son William Wirt Winchester, died in September 1922, part of the multi-million dollar estate was left to Olive Winchester. Additionally, Winchester was the {{beneficiary}} of 25% of a substantial estate of her maternal great uncle, Levi Merrick Stewart (born December 10, 1827 in Corinna, Maine; died May 3, 1910 in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Following these inheritances, in 1922 Winchester provided the funds to build a home for Wiley at Northwest Nazarene College. According to Ingersol, Throughout her tenure at Northwest Nazarene, Winchester taught her specialties: Biblical language and literature. But she also grew interested in {{the whole idea of}} religious education in the local church, and at Northwest Nazarene she developed and taught the initial courses in religious education. She spurred further <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> emerging discipline by contributing frequent articles on religious education to church papers and curriculum resource manuals.|$|E

500|$|English {{music critic}} Simon Reynolds {{said that while}} the album's song titles allude to the 21st century, the album is sonically {{reminiscent}} of the 1990s, and that Ferraro shares <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> time period with contemporaries like Oneohtrix Point Never. Reynolds wrote, [...] "Far Side Virtual seems to undertake an archaeology of the recent past, conjuring the onset of the internet revolution and 90s optimism about information technology. But that recent past could equally be a case of 'the long present' in so far as the digiculture ideology of convenience/instant access/maximization of options now permeates everyday life and is arguably where faint residues of utopianism persist in an otherwise gloomy and anxious culture." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Poe {{retired from}} his {{role at the}} Messenger on January 3, 1837, as the {{installments}} were being published; some scholars suggest he was fired and this led him to abandoning the novel. His split with the Messenger began a [...] "blank period" [...] where he did not publish much and suffered from unemployment, poverty, and no success in his literary pursuits. Poe soon realized writing a book-length narrative was a necessary career decision, partly {{because he had no}} steady job and the economy was suffering from the Panic of 1837. He also set part of the story as a quest to Antarctica to capitalize the public's sudden <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> topic.|$|E

The Daily Telegraph said in a 1999 profile, [...] "In essence, she is a suburban woman who – almost in spite of herself – got caught up {{with one of the most}} extraordinary men of modern times.

500|$|After Brook Farm, George Ripley {{began to}} work as a {{freelance}} journalist. In 1849 he was employed by Horace Greeley at the New York Tribune, taking the role left vacant by Margaret Fuller. Greeley had been a proponent of Brook Farm's conversion to Fourierism. Ripley started his role with the Tribune at $12 a week and, at this wage, was not able to pay off the debt of Brook Farm until 1862. As a critic, he believed in high moral standards for literature but offered good-natured praise in the majority of his reviews. Greeley took advantage of Ripley's cheerful style of writing to boost circulation amid significant competition. Ripley wrote a [...] "Gotham Gossip" [...] column and many articles discussing local personalities and notable public events, including speeches by Henry Clay and Frederick Douglass. He stayed away from philosophy of theology, despite some efforts to persuade him to write on the subject. As he told a friend, he had [...] "long since lost... immediate <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> line of speculation".|$|E
500|$|Guy Rickards, concurring that The Wood Nymph [...] "never quite escapes a {{dependence}} on the verses", has echoed Tawaststjerna in wondering {{what might have been}} had Sibelius returned in his maturity to The Wood Nymph, as with [...] Finnish composer Kalevi Aho's response has been similar, calling the ballade [...] "an interesting work" [...] in need of [...] "more polishing". Finnish conductor Osmo Vänskä, however, has championed the ballad. [...] "It's a tremendous piece," [...] Vänskä has said in interview. [...] "He [...] never managed to revise it, but nothing is wrong with the music. Sibelius never forbade performance of The Wood Nymph." [...] Stylistically, scholars have detected in The Wood Nymph the influence of Richard Wagner. Murtomäki, for example, discerns the [...] "erotic harmonic vocabulary" [...] of Tristan und Isolde in the third section and the [...] "motive of the forbidden question" [...] from Lohengrin in the funereal march from the finale. In light of Sibelius's [...] "Nietzschean response" [...] to Wagner's operas (initially enamored, Sibelius by July 1894 had repudiated Wagner's ideas as [...] "calculated" [...] and [...] "manufactured"), such observations are of particular <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> they illustrate the extent to which Sibelius, at the time of The Wood Nymph, had not yet succeeded in breaking with the German master.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the poem}} was defended {{by a few}} critics, E. C. Pettet {{returned}} to {{the argument that the}} poem lacked a structure and emphasized the word [...] "forlorn" [...] as evidence of his view. In his 1957 work, Pettet did praise the poem as he declared, [...] "The Ode to a Nightingale has a special <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> most of us would probably regard it as the most richly representative of all Keats’s poems. Two reasons for this quality are immediately apparent: there is its matchless evocation of that late spring and early summer season [...] and there is its exceptional degree of 'distillation', of concentrated recollection". David Perkins felt the need to defend {{the use of the word}} [...] "forlorn" [...] and claimed that it described the feeling from the impossibility of not being able to live in the world of the imagination. When praising the poem in 1959, Perkins claimed, [...] "Although the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] ranges more widely than the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn," [...] the poem can also be regarded as the exploration or testing out of a symbol, and, compared with the urn as a symbol, the nightingale would seem to have both limitations and advantages." [...] Walter Jackson Bate also made a similar defense of the word [...] "forlorn" [...] by claiming that the world described by describing the impossibility of reaching that land. When describing the poem compared to the rest of English poetry, Bate argued in 1963, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] is among [...] "the greatest lyrics in English" [...] and the only one written with such speed: [...] "We are free to doubt whether any poem in English of comparable length and quality has been composed so quickly." [...] In 1968, Robert Gittins stated, [...] "It may not be wrong to regard [...] as Keats's earlier essays in this [...] form, and the great Nightingale and Grecian Urn as his more finished and later works." ...|$|E
