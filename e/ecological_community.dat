40|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>communities</b> are seldom, if ever, {{biological}} individuals. They lack causal boundaries as {{the populations}} that constitute communities are not congruent and rarely have persistent functional roles regulating the communities’ higher properties. Instead we should represent <b>ecological</b> <b>communities</b> indexically, by identifying <b>ecological</b> <b>communities</b> via {{the network of}} weak causal interactions between populations that unfurl from a starting set of populations. This precisification of <b>ecological</b> <b>communities</b> helps identify how community properties remain invariant, and why they have robust characteristics. This is a more general framework than individuality, respecting the diversity and aggregational nature of these complex systems while still vindicating them as units worthy of investigation...|$|R

5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an <b>ecological</b> <b>community</b> creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an <b>ecological</b> <b>community.</b> These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E

5|$|Associated {{species in}} the Sydney region include {{heathland}} species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered <b>Ecological</b> <b>Community.</b> Here B.oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B.serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B.aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species.|$|E

In Yanga National Park, permanent and intermittent river channels, intermittent swamps, and billabongs make up components of this <b>ecological</b> <b>community.</b> The modification of natural river flows as a result of river regulation (dams, weirs) has been identified as the main threat to this <b>ecological</b> <b>community.</b> The changed river flow regimes lead to reduced habitat quality, loss of spawning cues, and reduced opportunities for dispersal and migration. Grazing also contributes to the degradation; however, the exclusion of livestock after gazettal as a national park should ease this pressure.|$|E

Gypsum dunes support a vulnerable <b>ecological</b> <b>community</b> of herblands and bunch grasslands, and an at-risk community of Eucalyptus aff. incrassata over low scrub; at least 80 plant species are likely to occur only on gypsum dunes, including several threatened species.

25|$|Under unified neutral theory, complex {{ecological}} {{interactions are}} permitted among individuals of an <b>ecological</b> <b>community</b> (such as competition and cooperation), providing all individuals obey the same rules.

Ecologists can broadly group all life forms into one of two trophic layers, the autotrophs and the heterotrophs. Autotrophs produce more biomass energy, either chemically without the sun's energy or by capturing the sun's energy in photosynthesis, than they use during metabolic respiration. Heterotrophs consume rather than produce biomass energy as they metabolize, grow, and add to levels of secondary production. A food web depicts a collection of polyphagous heterotrophic consumers that network and cycle the flow of energy and nutrients from a productive base of self-feeding autotrophs.|$|E
