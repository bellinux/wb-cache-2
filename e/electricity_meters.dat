5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard <b>electricity</b> <b>meters,</b> which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage battery. With {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E

25|$|Most {{domestic}} <b>electricity</b> <b>meters</b> must be read manually, {{whether by}} {{a representative of}} the power company or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by telephone, post or over the internet. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.|$|E

25|$|The two {{standards}} were initially adopted because {{up to the}} second half of the 20th century in many regions of Italy electricity was supplied by means of two separate consumer connections — one for powering illumination and one for other purposes — and these generally operated at different voltages, typically 127V single phase and 220V single or split phase. The electricity on the two supplies was separately metered, was sold at different tariffs, was taxed differently and was supplied through separate and different sockets. Even though the two electric lines (and respective tariffs) were gradually unified beginning in the 1960s (the official, but purely theoretical date was the summer of 1974) many houses had dual wiring and two <b>electricity</b> <b>meters</b> for years thereafter; in some zones of Lazio the 127V network was provided for lighting until 1999. The two gauges for plugs and sockets thus became a de facto standard which is now formalized under CEI23-50. Some older installations have sockets that are limited to either the 10A or the 16A style plug, requiring the use of an adaptor if the other gauge needs to be connected. Numerous cross adaptors were used.|$|E
500|$|Electricity {{generation}} is often done with electric generators, {{but can also}} be supplied by chemical sources such as electric batteries or by other means {{from a wide variety}} of sources of energy. Electric power is generally supplied to businesses and homes by the electric power industry. Electricity is usually sold by the kilowatt hour (3.6 MJ) which is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours. [...] Electric utilities measure power using <b>electricity</b> <b>meters,</b> which keep a running total of the electric energy delivered to a customer. Unlike fossil fuels, electricity is a low entropy form of energy and can be converted into motion or many other forms of energy with high efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Electricity</b> <b>meters</b> operate by {{continuously}} {{measuring the}} instantaneous voltage (volts) and current (amperes) to give energy used (in joules, kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in-line between source and customer. For larger loads, {{more than about}} 200 ampere of load, current transformers are used, so that the meter can be located other than {{in line with the}} service conductors.
