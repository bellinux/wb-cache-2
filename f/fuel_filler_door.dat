An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|E
2500|$|Changes for the 1975 {{model year}} were minor as AMC {{focused on the}} {{development}} and introduction of its innovative Pacer, but Matadors now included a standard [...] "no maintenance" [...] electronic ignition developed by Prestolite. All U.S. market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. New [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] decals were placed by the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and on the fuel gauge. Steel-belted radial tires became standard equipment on all Matadors.|$|E
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was only}} a shadow of its former self for 1974. [...] With the Sportsroof model discontinued, Sport models were often {{difficult}} to distinguish from Gran Torino 2-doors. To add insult to injury, the Sport was even available with optional opera windows (on vinyl-roofed cars) and fender skirts. The Sport continued to have its unique emblems displayed on the grille, the C-pillar, and the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> plus [...] "Sport" [...] script was placed by the C-pillar emblem. When opera windows were ordered, the script was placed below the [...] "Gran Torino" [...] nameplate on the fenders, and the C-pillar emblem was deleted. The laser stripe was no longer available, but a lower body multi-coloured non-reflective stripe was an option. The Sport now used the same vinyl door panel of the other Gran Torinos. The instrument package became a standard feature, as were 78 series radial ply tires (70 series used in 1973). Bucket seats remained an option, but now were a low back design with separate head rests. At extra cost, Sport door panels and seats could be highlighted with coloured stripes. The optional [...] "Magnum 500" [...] wheel was revised with the formerly chromed wheel rim replaced by a polished trim ring and argent painted spokes. [...] Performance was even more lackluster for 1974 models, with power down and weight up. The 1974 Sport had a shipping weight almost [...] heavier than a 1972 Sport.|$|E

2500|$|The Ford GT {{features}} {{many new}} and unique technologies, including superplastic-formed frame, aluminum body panels, roll-bonded floor panels, a friction stir welded center tunnel, {{covered by a}} magnesium center console, a [...] "ship-in-a-bottle" [...] gas tank, a capless <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> system, one-piece <b>door</b> panels, and an aluminum engine cover with a one-piece carbon fiber inner panel.|$|R
50|$|McLaren was a {{competitive}} driver, but his legacy, the McLaren Racing Team, stems from his abilities as an analyst, engineer, and manager. In {{the early days}} of McLaren sports cars, McLaren was testing and as he drove out of the pits, he noticed the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> access <b>door</b> was flapping up and down as he drove. The current aerodynamic thinking was that it should have been pressed more firmly in place as the speed of the car increased. Instead, it bounced more vigorously as the speed increased. Instantly, his frustration at the sloppy work changed and he had an insight. Stopping in the pits, he grabbed a pair of shears, and started cutting the bodywork away behind the radiator. Climbing back in the car, he immediately began turning lap times faster than before.|$|R
50|$|The Rear Drive B-body was {{the last}} {{platform}} design to have the gasoline tank filler port behind the license plate. Exceptions included all station wagons, {{as well as all}} 1961-64 cars - which had the tank filler in the rear fender on the driver's side and 1965 Buicks which had their <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> above the license plate. Also, the Pontiac B-Body vehicles from 1941 till 1948 had the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> in the rear fender on the driver's side. Very likely this would also have been the case with the B-Body Oldsmobile and Buick.|$|E

5000|$|Mazda began {{producing}} the Festiva as the [...] "Mazda 121" [...] for Australia and Europe in 1987, but this model was never retailed in Japan. The 121 ended production in 1990, and was officially discontinued by Mazda Australia in February 1991. From October 1991, Ford Australia began importing {{the car as}} the [...] "Ford Festiva" [...] from Kia's South Korean production facility. Where the Mazda was sold as a three-door hatchback, the Ford was sold initially as a five-door only. From January 1993, a Festiva three-door, badged [...] "Festiva Trio" [...] was launched in Australia. Both versions were powered by the overhead camshaft carbureted 1.3-liter B3 engine with the five-speed manual transmission; a three-speed automatic was optional for the five-door. Standard equipment in Australia included an AM/FM radio, tachometer, intermittent windscreen wipers, remote releases for the rear <b>door</b> and <b>fuel</b> tank <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> with air-conditioning available as an option. Ford discontinued the Festiva in the Australian market in March 1994.|$|R
50|$|The SV-1 had a rear <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> {{similar to}} the early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side <b>fuel</b> <b>fillers</b> in mid 1972, so all {{production}} liftbacks had <b>fuel</b> <b>fillers</b> on the left rear quarter panel with a cover flap.|$|R

Color choice was limited to black, white, and a quartet of signature hues: Gecko, Dune, Crush, and Rock Lobster with fender flares in matte black only.|$|E

2500|$|The 1975 {{model was}} advertised as [...] "a more {{efficient}} Corvette," [...] as service intervals were extended and electronic ignition and the federally mandated catalytic converter were introduced with [...] "unleaded fuel only" [...] warnings on the <b>fuel</b> gauge and <b>filler</b> <b>door.</b> Dual exhaust pipes were routed {{to a single}} converter, then split again leading to dual mufflers and tailpipes. Starting this year, tachometers were electronically driven. The Corvette began {{to be influenced by}} the metric system as speedometers now displayed small subfaces indicating kilometers-per-hour. 75's featured revised inner bumper systems with molded front and rear simulated bumper guards. The urethane rear bumper, now in its second year, reappeared as a one-piece seamless unit. This was the final year for Astro Ventilation. Power bottomed out this year — the base engine produced only [...] and the only remaining optional motor, the L-82, dropped an astonishing , managing to deliver [...] With no larger engine available, L-82 hood emblems began to appear on cars so equipped. Unchanged was the standard rear axle ratio for the base engine, which remained at 3.08 with automatic and 3.36 with manual transmission. This was the last convertible for the 1968-82 third-generation and only 12% of the cars were ordered as such. As in previous years, a folding top came standard with roadsters and a body color or vinyl covered hardtop was optional at additional cost. Anticipating further federal safety restrictions, Chevrolet believed it would be Corvette's last soft-top model ever but the convertible returned in 1986. Due to the state’s strict emissions standards, this was the last year Chevrolet installed the L-82 engine in a Corvette destined for California.|$|R
5000|$|The Mountain Edition is {{a special}} edition of the [...] "Sport Base" [...] model made for 2010 with 32-inch tires (on 17-inch wheels), black tubular sidestep, black tail light protectors and special edition seats, as well as visual {{enhancements}} like black grid and hood decals, a black <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and graphite dash enhancements. This edition was also available in 4 doors, based on the more equipped [...] "Sport" [...] trim instead of the [...] "Sport Base" [...] trim.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, {{a special}} yellow SC2 coupé model was also built. The model was officially named [...] "Limited Edition", but soon {{became known as}} the [...] "Bumblebee Edition". 99 were produced, each with a {{certificate}} of authenticity. The [...] "Bumblebee Edition" [...] included embroidered headrests, black leather interior with yellow leather inserts on the seats and door panels, black roof and mirrors, number designation inside <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and certificate of authenticity. These are {{not to be confused with}} the regular issue Yellow Sport Coupe.|$|E
50|$|For the 1990 model year, all Legends {{came with}} {{body-colored}} side mirrors. Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats. LS model coupes {{also received a}} trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production {{of the first generation}} models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> on the sedan had been moved rearward about 15 cm.|$|E

5000|$|It also {{featured}} a concealed <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> and variable-speed windshield wipers (at {{a time when}} wipers were often operated by intake vacuum, and so tended to stop when the driver stepped on the gas pedal). Its engine-turned dashboard included complete instrumentation, a tachometer, and standard radio (which would not become an industry standard offering {{until well into the}} 1950s). The most famous feature was the [...] "coffin nose", a louvered wraparound grille, from which its nickname derived, a product of Buehrig's desire not to have a conventional grille.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other {{motorcycles}} {{that offer}} detachable side or top cases for storage, the PC800 has an integral waterproof trunk under the pillion (passenger seat).

50|$|In August 1974 the 17TS (R1317 with 1605 cc) {{finally made}} it to Australia, along with the European 1974 model year 15TS and 17TL with the later type dashboard. In early 1975 the 17TS was {{replaced}} by the 17 Gordini. Available later were the 15TS and 17TL with Gordini front suspension, inertia reel seat belts, tinted windows, tombstone seats and evaporative emission control as required by ADR. This was identified by the carbon canister under the bonnet, and hinged <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door</b> in the LBR quarter panel. In 1976 a final shipment of 1975 model year 17s was made and stock piled prior to the introduction of ADR 27A emission controls, these vehicles, again due to their high price, sold slowly through until 1978.|$|E

50|$|The 1964 Imperials {{were the}} first {{designed}} entirely by Mr. Engel. Predictably, they bore a strong resemblance to the Lincoln Continental. The dashboards seemed more conventional because the squared-off steering wheel and electroluminescent dash lighting were gone. However, there remained the ribbon-style speedometer. A split grille returned after one year's absence, inspired by the 1955 model's appearance, and the faux spare tire bulge atop the trunk lid {{gave way to a}} squared-off protrusion at the rear, carrying downward to the rear bumper. A large boss in the center of it was actually the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>door,</b> covered with a large Imperial Eagle. Horizontal, spear shaped housings hold a taillight and back-up light.
