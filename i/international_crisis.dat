5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a credible troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Crisis</b> Group {{writes that}} the AFL was reduced {{practically}} {{to the point of}} non-existence by Fall 2001, by which time a total of 4,000 personnel had been retired. The Second Liberian Civil War, originated in clashes in April 1999 but was not a major threat to Taylor until 2000–01. However, on the government side the AFL played only a minor role; irregular ex National Patriotic Front of Liberia militias backed by more privileged Taylor partisans such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit saw most of the fighting.|$|E

40|$|In the ` 90 {{the poverty}} {{increased}} in Latin America. One {{of the main}} causes was the neoliberal economics policies applied. Among those policies, the financial liberalization had a particular role: as it increased the vulnerability of Latin American economies against the <b>international</b> <b>crises.</b> Thus, the <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> were considered an extra source that generated poverty increase as shown in Argentina case. ...|$|R
40|$|Why do states facing {{high levels}} of {{international}} threat sometimes have militaries that are heavily involved in politics {{and at other times}} relatively apolitical, professional militaries? I argue that the answer to this puzzle lies in a state's history of 'acute' <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> rather than its 'chronic' threat environment. Major <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> lead to professionalization and de-politicization of militaries in both the short- and long-term. <b>International</b> <b>crises</b> underscore the need for the military to defend the state and highlight military deficiencies in this regard. Accordingly, major <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> lead to military professionalization and withdrawal from politics in order to increase military effectiveness. This effect persists years, and decades, later due to generational shifts in the officer corps. As the "Crisis Generation" of officers become generals, they bring with them a preference for professionalization and de-politicization. They guide the military towards abstention from politics. I test this theory using a new global dataset on military officers in national governing bodies from 1964 - 2008 and find strong support for the theory. Major <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> lead to two waves of military withdrawal from government, years apart. Further statistical analysis finds that this effect is most strongly felt in the non-security areas of governing, while in some cases, <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> may lead to militaries increasing their involvement in security policy-making. Further, <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> that end poorly for a state — i. e., defeats or stalemates — are found to drive more rapid waves of military withdrawal from government. The statistical analysis is supported by a case illustration of civil-military relations in the People's Republic of China, which demonstrates that the crisis of the Korean War (1950 - 53) led to two waves of military professionalization and de-politicization, decades apart. The first occurred immediately after the war. The second wave, occurring in the 1980 s, involved wholesale military withdrawal from governing bodies, which was made possible by the ascent of the "Crisis Generation" of officers in the military, who had served as junior officers in the Korean War, decades prior...|$|R
5|$|The first <b>international</b> <b>crisis</b> Harrison faced {{arose from}} disputed fishing rights on the Alaskan coast. Canada claimed fishing and sealing rights around {{many of the}} Aleutian Islands, in {{violation}} of U.S. law. As a result, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships. In 1891, the administration began negotiations with the British that would eventually lead to a compromise over fishing rights after international arbitration, with the British government paying compensation in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{tensions}} built between Germany and the United Kingdom {{as well as}} its allies. During late 1937, {{and throughout}} 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland led to an <b>international</b> <b>crisis.</b> In an attempt to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. While it had been intended as an agreement to reconcile differences, and for future issues to be resolved peacefully, relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.|$|E

5|$|Meares {{and others}} {{organized}} another expedition the following year. A {{number of vessels}} sailed to Nootka Sound, including the Argonaut under James Colnett, the Princess Royal, under Thomas Hudson, and the Iphigenia Nubiana and North West America. Colnett intended to establish a permanent fur-trading post at Nootka Sound. However, Spain had also decided to permanently occupy Nootka Sound and assert sovereignty on the North West Coast. The decision was mostly due to Russian activity in Alaska and Russia's threat to occupy Nootka Sound themselves. Spanish naval officer Esteban José Martínez arrived at Nootka in May 1789 and built Fort San Miguel. When the Argonaut arrived, a dispute arose between Colnett and Martínez, leading to the seizure of several British ships and the arrest of their crews. This incident led to the Nootka Crisis, an <b>international</b> <b>crisis</b> between Britain and Spain. War was averted with the first Nootka Convention of 1790.|$|E
5|$|President Antanas Smetona's {{unconditional}} {{acceptance of a}} second ultimatum {{in the space of}} a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule. The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis: the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas Černius. For the first time since the 1926 coup d'état, the government included members of the opposition: Leonas Bistras, of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, was named Minister of Education and Jurgis Krikščiūnas, of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants' Union, was named Minister of Agriculture. Because other parties were banned, Bistras and Krikščiūnas were officially billed as independent private citizens. Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well. However, even the looming <b>international</b> <b>crisis</b> did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite, and they continued to engage in petty political disputes.|$|E

40|$|Research Highlights and Abstract: This article: Introduces {{the concept}} of world {{disclosure}} to diplomatic studies; Advances a new logic of diplomatic action that combines pre-reflective and reflective modes of reasoning; Explains why <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> are defined by fractal not linear patterns; Suggests a world disclosing method for making sense of and managing <b>international</b> <b>crises.</b> Drawing on Heidegger's concept of 'world disclosure', the article advances an original analytical framework for studying diplomatic crisis management. It argues that <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> are not linear but fractal developments characterised {{by a set of}} self-similar events that repeat themselves at micro and macro scales in an endless loop unless stopped. As interpretations of fractal conditions are shaped by both pre-reflective and reflective considerations, diplomatic resolutions of crises require 'authentic' disclosures that challenge the epistemic framework that allows crises to reproduce. Examples from recent crises, especially the one in Ukraine, are used to empirically illustrate the main theoretical points...|$|R

40|$|Do {{audience}} {{costs have}} to be extremely large in order to credibly signal resolve and affect <b>international</b> <b>crises?</b> Existing theoretical work on audience costs suggests an affirmative answer, and recent empirical work on audience costs focuses on whether a leader can generate such large audience costs as to create a commitment to fight where no such commitment previously existed. We analyze a richer crisis bargaining model with audience costs and find that (1) audience costs can have war-reducing effects on incomplete-information crisis bargaining through a noninformative, bargaining-leverage mechanism and (2) audience costs can have war-reducing effects even when such large audience costs are not being generated as to create a commit-ment to fight where no such commitment previously existed. Even more limited audience costs can have war-reducing effects in <b>international</b> <b>crises.</b> We discuss how the bargaining-leverage mechanism {{is consistent with a}} number of prominent historical cases.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of crude oil prices, government bonds and stock market indices around outbreaks of severe <b>international</b> <b>crises</b> and wars. Using a constant-mean-return event study, we show that these events are associated with positive and significant abnormal returns on oil and bonds, which means that these two asset classes can potentially shelter shareholders from plummeting equity values during <b>international</b> <b>crises.</b> A formal safe haven analysis confirms this insight. Such price movements may reflect a reallocation of funds across asset classes {{in response to the}} events, as well as shifts in the demand for oil due to precautionary, speculative and military motives. We also calculate the weights for optimal portfolios, which could provide insurance against conflict risk...|$|R
