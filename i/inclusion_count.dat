40|$|Serotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis strains usually {{requires}} {{three to six}} serial passages in shell vials to attain sufficient antigen for typing procedures. To circumvent this problem, we developed a rapid low-passage method for serotyping of C. trachomatis clinical isolates. Isolates with an <b>inclusion</b> <b>count</b> of {{greater than or equal}} to 500 per well in primary isolation were inoculated directly onto cell culture monolayers in microtiter plates for typing. Primary isolates with a lower initial <b>inclusion</b> <b>count</b> were passed one to two times in shell vials until there were {{greater than or equal to}} 20 inclusions per well and were then inoculated onto plates for typing. Inclusions were grown to maturity and reacted with a panel of 17 C. trachomatis-specific monoclonal antibodies in pools. Wells were then reacted with a fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate and read by FA microscopy, and the reaction patterns were compared with prototype strain reaction patterns to determine the serotype. By the microtiter method, we successfully typed 1, 711 consecutive C. trachomatis isolates; 1, 215 isolates (71 %) were typed with no or with one passage. The first 209 isolates typed by the microtiter method were also typed by the dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serotyping method; 100 % agreement was demonstrated among strains that were typeable by both methods. We conclude that the microtiter method is extremely useful for accurate serotyping of large numbers of isolates and requires greatly reduced technician time...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> on inoculated McCoy cell coverslips {{were used}} as an index {{of the degree of}} {{infection}} of the cervix in women and of the urethra in men with urethritis. High <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> were obtained significantly more often from men than from women, from women with cervical ectopy, and from women who had had recent sexual intercourse. Low <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> were significantly more common in men with a past history of gonococcal urethritis. Higher chlamydial isolation rates in women with gonorrhoea and in women taking the contraceptive pill could not be attributed to a greater degree of infection, since <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> were not raised in these patients. There was evidence that strains of C trachomatis might vary in their ability to establish themselves in the genital tract because high counts in men with NGU were associated with high counts in their female consorts and the levels of counts in men were associated with the frequency of chlamydial isolation from their female consorts.

40|$|Two {{established}} cell lines, H 292 and HEp- 2, {{originating from}} the human respiratory tract, {{were found to be}} significantly more efficient and practical than the currently used HeLa 229 cells for growth of Chlamydia pneumoniae. Six strains of C. pneumoniae recently isolated from patients with respiratory ailments were used as test cultures. The H 292 and HEp- 2 cells yielded much higher <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> for all the test strains than did HeLa 229 cells.

A simple system with these two cell lines appeared to be very efficient for culturing C. pneumoniae. It does not require treatment of tissue cells with DEAE-dextran before infection, and it may eliminate the need for serial subpassages of specimens to increase culture sensitivity. Monolayers of these cells remained intact and viable in the Chlamydia growth medium so that reinfection could take place, resulting in greatly increased <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> for specimens containing few infectious units.

40|$|A {{system was}} devised for {{studying}} the interaction of a trachoma strain of Chlamydia trachomatis (G 17) and mouse fibroblasts (McCoy cells) {{in the absence of}} centrifugation, which is usually employed to enhance the infection of cell cultures with non-lymphogranuloma venereum human strains of C. trachomatis. In this system, the conditions of infection more closely approached those encountered in natural infections, and the entry of G 17 into host cells could be compared with the previously described entry of C. psittaci 6 BC and a lymphogranuloma venereum strain (440 L) of C. trachomatis. McCoy cells were infected by shaking at 37 degrees C with inocula suspended in 0. 01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7. 2, containing 0. 2 M sucrose. The efficiency of infection (<b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> without centrifugation/inclusion counts with centrifugation) was 1. 5 % for monolayers and 7. 5 % for suspensions. When measured either by <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> or by host cell-associated 14 C-amino acid-labeled G 17, association was proportional to G 17 concentration and increased linearly for 60 min. Pretreatment of host cells with diethylaminoethyl-dextran (30 micrograms/ml, 30 min) raised the efficiency of infection to about 13 % for both monolayers and suspensions. Host cells treated with cytochalasin B (2 x 10 (- 5) M, 90 min) or trypsin (50 micrograms/ml, 60 min) associated with G 17 at undiminished rates. 14 C-labeled G 17 inactivated by heat (60 degrees C, 3 min) or ultraviolet light (1, 800 ergs per mm 2) associated with McCoy cells {{at the same rate as}} live G 17.

40|$|Penicillin class {{antibiotics}} {{have demonstrated}} {{varying degrees of}} in vivo and in vitro success when tested against Chlamydia trachomatis. The activity of ampicillin-sulbactam, an agent commonly utilized {{in the treatment of}} pelvic infections, was tested to ascertain if any antichlamydial activity is present. Up to six endocervical isolates of C. trachomatis were tested against each of five antibiotics including doxycycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, ampicillin/sulbactam, and sulbactam alone. McCoy cell monolayers were inoculated with high inclusion counts of 10, 000 – 30, 000 inclusion-forming units (IFU) per coverslip, and exposed to each antibiotic. Up to nine subsequent antibiotic free culture passes were performed to assess the viability of abnormal inclusions. Doxycycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin achieved 100 % eradication of inclusions at concentrations of 4. 0, 2. 0, and 1. 0 µg/mL. Exposure to ampicillin/sulbactam resulted in a greater than 99 % reduction in the <b>inclusion</b> <b>count</b> at 32. 0 µg/mL, while sulbactam by itself demonstrated considerably less activity. Abnormal inclusions were noted only in the ampicillin/sulbactam exposed cells, and these, plus all inclusions remaining following sublethal exposure to the other antibiotics, resulted in regrowth to control levels in subsequent passes. Doxycycline and erythromycin demonstrated excellent activity. Clindamycin and ampicillin/sulbactam also significantly reduced inclusion formation, and therefore may provide adequate C. trachomatis coverage in patients receiving these antibiotics for pelvic infections...|$|E

40|$|Impurities in {{aluminium}} {{can cause}} detrimental {{physical and chemical}} inhomogeneity in the final products, as well as potentially catastrophic failures. Hence, {{one of the key}} aspects during production of aluminium and its alloys is to control the amount of inclusions/contaminants remaining within the metal after filtration, i. e. controlling the ‘Cleanliness’ of the produced material. The filtration step is the second stage of inclusion removal (after settling), and the last step of the melt treatment stage prior the casting. In the filter-boxes used today the metal head is used to prime the filter by gravity, when mounting the filter in the filter-box below the metal level in the launder. If the filter is mounted far below the launder, the priming will be good, but then an extensive amount of metal needs to be drained from the filter-box after each cast (a single filter box typically contains 500 - 600 kg of sump metal by the end of each cast). In addition, the existing technology also involves significant manual handling of molten metal and hot filters, introducing a human factor, which increases the probability for HES related incidents and adds additional costs. High Pores Per Inch (PPI) filters have proven to have excellent efficiency for inclusion removal; however, these types of filters, i. e. 50 - 80 PPI, are not commonly applied in industry. One reason that these filters are not used is that they cannot be effectively primed in many commercial cast house installations due to the excessive metal head required. The electromagnetic (EM) priming technology is a patented innovative concept (US Patent nr. 20150322543), reinventing the fundamental concept of the filter-box by eliminating the need of preheating, extensive metal head and limitations to filter thickness. The main objective of the present work has been to investigate the effect of up scaling of the EM priming technology used for the priming of molten aluminium on Ceramic Foam Filters (CFF). Focus has been on different (i) coil designs (shapes and sizes), (ii) filter grades and thickness, and (iii) aluminium alloy systems. The final goal of the thesis was a ‘proof of concept’, by realizing the theory, design, construction and validation of the EM priming effect on high grade 23 inch CFFs, i. e. on a full industrial scale filter. EM field modelling, analytical calculations and experimental validations were undertaken to estimate the shape effect of the coil (square versus round) on the shape of the magnetic field, and on the magnitude and direction of the induced Lorentz forces prior to construction of the coils. Lorentz force calculations were performed analytically, and the solutions verified by COMSOL® simulations and later validated by experimental observations. The inductive heating power were evaluated for all inductor sizes, and the Magneto Hydro Dynamics (MHD) induced by the Lorentz forces verified by COMSOL® simulations. Focus was placed on the formation of a meniscus, in order to evaluate the potential benefits of the effectively higher ‘gravity head’ to achieve priming of the CFFs. In the present work the EM priming effect was investigated using laboratory scale round 4 inch and intermediate square 9 inch CFFs, as well as industrial pilot scale square 23 inch CFFs. Filters of various grades (30, 50 and 80 PPI) and at different filter thicknesses (50, 100 and 150 mm) was tested using 3 different alloys (A 356, A 3 XXX and A 5 XXX). Batch reactors were designed for each filter size to mount from 1 to 3 filters in a stack, and used with newly designed and constructed round 4. 7, square 12. 2 and square 28. 9 inch induction coils. These coils were used to investigate the EM priming by application of EM field strengths varying from 0. 1 to 0. 25 T. A practical approach to designing induction coils with maximized generation of Lorentz force, and the strongest magnetic fields, beginning with simple inductance calculations, is also presented. The dictum to achieve priming on high-grade cold filters, i. e. to use no preheating, was kept throughout the work. The cleanliness of the metal after filtration of an EM primed CFF was investigated by two methods, i. e. (i) a purely theoretical approach using empirical mathematical models to estimate the filtration efficiency, and (ii) a method for quantification of the metal cleanliness by automated image acquisition and processing. The quantification of the melt cleanliness was conducted by a moving stage mounted on a light microscope and self-programmed macros by ImagePro® Plus 7, allowing for a less biased particle and <b>inclusion</b> <b>count.</b> The method has been successfully compared to a manually conducted cleanliness count, revealing a total error below 3 %. The results of the automated image processing method have been used to validate the proposed mathematical models. In the present work the ‘proof of concept’ has been successfully demonstrated by priming 3 stacked 50 PPI and a stack consisting of one 50 and one 80 PPI 23 inch industrial scale CFFs. A positive effect of the EM field on the priming ability of CFF without preheating was observed, and could be reproduced for every laboratory experiment, {{as well as for the}} industrial scale trials. The induced EM priming allowed priming of 150 mm thick high grade CFFs without application of preheating while using normal casting temperatures and less than the standard metal head...|$|E

Isoflavones are naturally occurring phytoestrogens, antioxidants and efflux pump inhibitors, but their therapeutic use is limited by poor water-solubility and intense first-pass metabolism. Here, we report on effects of isoflavones against C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis and describe buccal permeability and initial formulation development for biochanin A. Biochanin A was the most potent Chlamydia growth inhibitor among the studied isoflavones, with an IC 50  =  12 µM on C. pneumoniae <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> and 6. 5 µM on infectious progeny production, both determined by immunofluorescent staining of infected epithelial cell cultures. Encouraged by the permeation of biochanin A across porcine buccal mucosa without detectable metabolism, oromucosal film formulations were designed and prepared by a solvent casting method. The film formulations showed improved dissolution rate of biochanin A compared to powder or a physical mixture, presumably due to the solubilizing effect of hydrophilic additives and presence of biochanin A in amorphous state. In summary, biochanin A is a potent inhibitor of Chlamydia spp., and the in vitro dissolution results {{support the use of}} a buccal formulation to potentially improve its bioavailability in antichlamydial or other pharmaceutical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} polymixin B sulfate on cell walls of mature {{elementary}} body (EB) and of immature developmental reticulate body (RB) of Chlamydia psittaci were investigated. When purified EB {{were treated with}} polymixin (104 units per ml or more) at 37 C for 60 min, about 70 % of EB {{was found to be}} covered with a number of projections. Further incubation did not increase the percentage affected. The infectivity after treatment as assayed by the <b>inclusion</b> <b>counting</b> technique was reduced by 70 % of the original titer. These results suggest that EB with the projections are no longer infective. The projections had obscure outlines and were 20 to 40 nm in diameter when seen in thin sections. In the negatively stained preparations, the projections were composed of aggregations of fine particles 4 to 5 nm in diameter. Treatment with sodium dodecyl sulfate at the same concentration used for cell wall isolation removed the projections completely, and the cell walls were converted to rather ragged forms apparently composed of outside and inside layers. When RB cell walls prepared from infected cells at 18 hr after infection were treated with polymixin at the same concentration, the projections having the same morphology with those seen on treated EB cell walls were observed only on the inside surface of cell wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{infection}} of HeLa 229 cells in monolayer culture with trachoma (B/TW- 5 /OT) and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) (L 2 / 434 /Bu) organism was studied {{in terms of}} two parameters: radioactivity counts of cell-associated tritium labeled organisms at the initial stage of inoculation for measurement of attachment, and <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> of infection cells after incubation for measurement of growth. Factors affecting attachment and inclusion formation and correlation of the two are presented. It was shown that attachment is an important initial step in infection by Chlamydia trachomatis. The rate of attachment was temperature dependent. The attachment of LGV organisms was affected more profoundly by temperature than was that of trachoma organisms. Attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma and LGV organisms were inhibited by heparin. Diethylaminoethyl-dextran was again shown to enhance attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma but not LGV organisms. NaF {{had no effect on}} attachment, but inhibited inclusion formation of both trachoma and LGV organisms. Both attachment and inclusion formation of trachoma organisms were strongly enhanced by centrifugation of the inoculum onto the cell monolayer. Although inclusion formation of trachoma organism was much greater in susceptible cells (HeLa 229) than relatively insusceptible cells (fetal tonsil), attachment was only slightly greater. The results based on the test of two cell lines suggested that attachment prpbably is not a critical factor in determing a cell line's susceptibility to infection with trachoma organisms...|$|R

40|$|Culture is {{currently}} considered the "gold standard" for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis infections. We evaluated the Syva MicroTrak enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Gen-Probe PACE 2 tests, which detect chlamydial antigens and rRNA, respectively. These assays {{were compared with}} each other and with culture for the detection of C. trachomatis in cervical specimens obtained from 217 women attending a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of infection was 22. 1 % by culture. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were 79. 2, 98. 2, 92. 6, and 94. 3 %, respectively, for EIA. For PACE 2, the respective values were 77. 1, 97. 6, 90. 1, and 93. 7 %. After corrections for two false-negative cultures, the sensitivities and specificities were 80 and 99. 4 %, respectively, for the EIA and 78 and 98. 8 %, respectively, for the probe assay. Quantitative evaluation of the results showed that false-negative results with either assay were associated with cultures that had low <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> or were negative without subpassage. Analysis of nonculture results revealed that 2. 3 % of the EIA results and 4. 6 % of the probe assay results were within +/- 30 % of the respective assay cutoff values. These included four false-negative (one EIA and three probe) and two false-positive (one EIA and one probe) results. The Syva MicroTrak EIA and the Gen-Probe PACE 2 assay are comparable to but significantly less sensitive than culture.

40|$|Eleven {{mammalian}} cell lines, HeLa 229, HeLa M, Hep- 2, FT, BHK- 21, Vero, MK- 2, MPK, L-WO 5 A 2, McCoy, and L- 929, were tested for their susceptibility to infection with Trachoma strains TW- 3 (type C, ocular origin) and UW- 5 (type E, genital origin). All the cell layers were pretreated with diethylaminoethyl-dextran before inoculation of the organisms, and the inocula were centrifuged onto the cell layers. HeLa 229 {{was found to}} be the most sensitive to infection as determined by <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts.</b> The next most susceptible were cell lines MK- 2, Hep- 2, McCoy, and HeLa M, in that order. Infectivity in these cells ranged from 89 to 12 % of that observed in HeLa 229. The remaining cell lines, BHK- 21, L-WO 5 A 2, L- 929, Vero, MPK, and FT, were much less susceptible with infectivity less than 10 % that of HeLa 229. HeLa 229 cells and 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine-pretreated McCoy cells have been used most extensively with Trachoma organisms in our laboratories. Infectivity in these two cell culture systems, both pretreated with diethylaminoethyl-dextran, was compared using 13 Trachoma strains of both ocular and genital origins of different immunotypes. The two systems performed similarly except with two type C, three type I, and one type J strains, With the type C, I and J strains tested, considerably fewer inclusions were found in 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine-pretreated McCoy than in HeLa 229 because inclusion formation of these strains in McCoy cells was not enhanced by 5 -iodo- 2 '-deoxyuridine pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{a direct}} fluorescent-antibody stain (DFA) and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) {{with a standard}} cell culture technique {{for the detection of}} Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women in an urban family practice setting. We also evaluated a DFA sample in a commercial laboratory to determine the interlaboratory reliability of this test. There were 268 women in the study; the EIA provided a higher sensitivity (83 versus 50 %) and a higher positive predictive value (83 versus 69 %) than the DFA test and comparably high specificity (99 versus 98 %). Concordance between the two laboratories on the DFA test was not high when data were adjusted for chance agreement (kappa coefficient = 0. 64). DFA validity was optimal with an elementary body cutoff of greater than 5, while EIA validity was optimal at the recommended cutoff of 0. 1 optical density unit. None of 11 women with negative cultures after treatment had false-positive antigen tests. False-negative results with both tests were associated with low culture <b>inclusion</b> <b>counts</b> but were not strongly associated with {{the presence or absence of}} symptoms, menses, pregnancy, or recent antibiotic use. False-positive results with EIA were seen only for three women who had a chief complaint of vaginal discharge. Although the positive predictive value of DFA could be increased in high-prevalence subpopulations, EIA was still more valid in two such groups: teenagers and prenatal patients. These results indicate that EIA might be preferable for low- or moderate-prevalence populations in primary care settings and that a falloff in DFA sensitivity could be explained by lower infection burdens in low-prevalence groups...|$|R
