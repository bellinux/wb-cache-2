40|$|AbstractSince 2010, the LNG {{importing}} {{price premium}} in the Asia–Pacific markets {{has become increasingly}} high, generating great effects on the economic development in China. In addition, the natural gas dependence degree is expanding continuously, making it extremely urgent to establish a natural <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hub</b> in China, with the aim to ensure national energy security, to gain the pricing power, and to build the regional benchmark prices. Through a comparative analysis of internal strength/weakness and external competitiveness, we concluded that with intensively-issued supporting policies on the natural gas sector, the initiation of spot and futures markets, {{the rapid growth of}} gas production and highly-improved infrastructures, as well as Shanghai's advantageous location, China has more advantages in establishing an Asian Natural <b>Gas</b> <b>Trading</b> <b>Hub</b> than other counties like Singapore, Japan and Malaysia. Moreover, based on the SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity and threat) and the marketization process analysis, the following strategies were presented: to impel the establishment of a natural <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hub</b> depending on the gas supply condition, to follow the policies to complete the gas storage system, to form regional communities by taking comparative advantages, and to reinforce the marketization reform and regulation system establishment with foreign experiences for reference. This study rationalized the necessity and practicality of establishing a natural <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hub</b> in China and will help China make a proper decision and find a periodical strategic path in this sector...|$|E

With NYMEX prices as the competitive benchmark, we found empirically that the spot price responses at some <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> were systematically asymmetric, thus demonstrating a market advantage by either buyers or sellers. We further {{found that the}} presence of market power was a very plausible explanation for this price behavior at some hubs. ...|$|R
50|$|In late 2010, the project's {{construction}} and commissioning phase {{was under the}} supervision of OSL's technical team. In the meantime, a new design team was formed to finish some of the detailed engineering work. In addition, OSL assisted EKB in shifting the facility from an unmanned operation to a fully staffed operation. OSL is currently providing full engineering support service to EKB. Overall, the facility is connected to the Dutch gas transmission system by a 60 km pipeline.

40|$|Gas <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> {{have been}} {{initially}} {{developed in the}} US in 1980 s, UK in 1990 s, more recently in European in the 2000 s and mulled in East Asia now. Due to its freshness and diversification in nationality, governance and culture, the European hub experience can offer valuable lessons for East Asia. This paper seeks to advance understanding of gas hub development in Europe and provide lessons for East Asia. The European experience highlights that market liberalization and transition of gas pricing mechanism are necessary in creating the competitive markets that are needed for functional gas hubs. Political will and regulations further safeguard the competition environment needed for hub development. Natural factors, such as significant domestic production and culture could {{have a significant impact}} on the hub development and transition of pricing mechanism. In East Asia, the path to <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> might be more difficult than in Europe but a growing market creates an opportunity to start new terms with new contracts. Nevertheless, East Asian needs to work hard to development its indigenous <b>gas</b> or LNG <b>trading</b> <b>hubs...</b>|$|R
40|$|With {{survey data}} from the IGU and others {{continuing}} to demonstrate the continuing widespread adoption of hub pricing for European <b>gas,</b> and <b>trading</b> volumes growing strongly overall, this paper revisits the issue of hub price correlation. Following from her ground-breaking paper of October 2013 where {{for the first time}} in the public domain the analysis of OTC trading data revealed strong trends towards price convergence at the European <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs,</b> Beatrice Petrovich in this paper extends the analysis with data to October 2013. Focussing on price and volatility correlations between Europe’s <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs,</b> Beatrice identifies those whose trends, either temporarily or on a more sustained basis, are out of line with the ‘core group’ of North West continental hubs. Applying a forensic focus, the underlying causes of such anomalies are, where possible, identified. This involved extensive discussions with system operators, market participants and analysis of infrastructure flow data. The emerging picture is a positive one in terms of supporting the thesis that European gas hub prices respond to supply and demand forces. However as flow patterns across the European geography change, for example due to LNG being diverted away from Europe towards Asia and with the opening of North Stream, new ‘pinch points’ or bottlenecks emerge which can cause hub prices to de-link. Whether, in a European context, the appropriate incentives are in place to resolve such bottlenecks in a cost effective manner is beyond the scope of this paper. It may be worth reflecting however that despite being a liberalised gas market since the 1980 s, the US still has need to reconfigure and debottleneck its gas transmission system as its geographic loci of demand and supply continue to change and evolve. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural gas}} market in East Asia remains {{fragmented}} without a functioning benchmark price to duly reflect {{the dynamics of}} demand and supply forces in the region. A functional regional gas futures market, which is highly dependent {{on the presence of}} well-developed physical spot trading, is yet to be established. Since the intra-regional pipeline connection is largely non-existent in East Asia, it is the LNG spot cargo trading that is likely to become the basis for the regional gas futures market. This paper offers a novel approach to understanding the development of such a market by analyzing the experience of a different commodity market – the Dojima Rice Exchange (DRE) – and identifying potentially transferrable lessons in the market design and the role of government regulations. Based on the case study analysis, implications for the development of natural <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> in East Asia are offered and an LNG futures exchange design is put forward...|$|R
40|$|With European {{natural gas}} {{consumption}} having declined {{since the beginning}} of this decade it may seem strange to focus on transmission system bottlenecks in a regional market which, having seen dramatic expansion since its inception in the late 1960 s, has at best only modest growth potential. Work by Beatrice Petrovich examining the price correlation of European <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> suggests that the capacity and contractual relationships of Europeâs transmission system lagged behind changing supply flow patterns and the responsiveness required to allow gas to flow freely in response to hub price supply signals in a liberalising market. Projecting forward to 2030 this paper, using the EWI TIGER model, looks at how bottlenecks may change under two scenarios based on high and low cases for LNG and Russian pipeline gas imports respectively, in the context of modest European gas demand growth. Bottlenecks are examined both in terms of LNG and pipeline import capacity at the European border and at critical interconnector points within Europe. This paper should be of interest at a strategic level for commercial participants in the gas market and also for regulators and system operators charged with ensuring that future infrastructure is in place to facilitate pan-European traded markets against a background of changing supply patterns. This paper is the product of excellent co-operation between OIES and ewi Energy Research and Scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the four {{papers in the}} special issues on ‘Gas and LNG pricing and <b>trading</b> <b>hub</b> in East Asia’. The papers examine lessons and experience from European hub development, other commodity, the Japanese history on developing of futures markets and inter-fuel substitution in East Asia. The papers finds that liquid futures market {{is the key to}} formulate benchmark prices while a well-developed spot market is the foundation; political will and strong leadership are required to overcome the power of incumbents and to restructure the gas market that impede the the development of competitive markets; and East Asia needs to develop its indigenous <b>gas</b> or LNG <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> even in low oil prices period and its developing market allows easier changes in new contracts than in existing ones. This hub development requires governments to go through tough domestic market reforms, including liberalization and cooperation {{with each other and with}} gas exporters...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAfter the {{liberalisation}} of the <b>gas</b> industry, <b>trading</b> <b>hubs</b> {{have emerged}} in Europe. Although these hubs appear to be liquid market places fostering gas-to-gas competition, {{the efficiency of the}} gas market remains a topic of interest as a fair share of <b>gas</b> is still <b>traded</b> through long-term contracts with prices linked to the oil price while the number of gas suppliers to the European market is limited. In order to assess the efficiency of the gas market, we analyse the day-ahead spot price at the Dutch gas hub over the period 2011 – 2014. We find that the oil price had a small positive impact on the gas price. Changes in the concentration on the supply side did not affect the movement in gas prices. The availability of gas in storages and the outside temperature negatively influenced the gas price. We also find that the gas price was related to the production of wind electricity. Overall, we conclude that the day-ahead gas prices are predominantly determined by gas-market fundamentals. Policies to further integrate gas markets within Europe may extend this gas-to-gas competition to a larger region...|$|R
40|$|The global gas {{revolution}} {{is poised to}} significantly raise bills for Australian households and some gas-using businesses, but government should resist calls to protect domestic households and businesses from high gas prices. Getting gas right: Australia’s energy challenge finds that development of Australia’s liquefied natural gas export industry, which could be the world’s largest {{by the end of}} the decade, could lead to price rises for households of up to $ 170 a year. For years local prices have been low by world standards, but when suppliers can get a higher price exporting than on the domestic market, the domestic price will rise to the export level. The change will not be popular, especially when electricity prices have also been rising, but it is a natural consequence of an evolving market. Calls for a moratorium on new LNG developments or the reservation of a proportion of gas for domestic consumption are pleas for protectionism. They will lead to distorted price signals, inefficient industries, lower investment and, ultimately, higher prices. The report examines the creation of an east coast gas export market – which will join with Western Australian exports to produce an estimated $ 50 billion-a-year industry by 2017 — and Australia’s role in a gas revolution created by surging demand in Asia and new discoveries of shale gas in the United States. The report also examines Australia’s possible shortage of supply, arguing that government must resolve the impasse over coal seam gas in New South Wales, while industry must ensure that enough infrastructure is built to ensure that gas flows. Governments should also move to create a more transparent and competitive market by accelerating the development of <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> <b>hubs,</b> introducing a published price index, freeing up trading in pipeline capacity and more tightly constraining joint marketing arrangements by gas producers. For three decades, Australia has thrived from opening trade and removing protection. It should not turn the other way now...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper by}} Patrick Heather {{is the third}} he has written on the {{development}} of European <b>traded</b> <b>gas</b> <b>hubs.</b> It is the culmination of extensive field research interviewing a range of market participants from regulators, TSOs, traders and government officials â from Spain to the Baltics, from Britain to the Balkans and many points in between. In addition to comparing national aspirations with EC goals and deadlines he has noted not just the infrastructure projects required to create the connectivity for traded market development, but equally importantly the political will, cultural acceptance of traded markets and the commercial appetite. Clearly to achieve the vision of the Gas Target Model there is certainly âmuch left to doâ. In terms of assessing the stage of development of the various hubs, Patrick presents not only an update of his own quantitative and subjective measures but also incorporates the work of other relevant surveys and academic analyses. Based on this substantial synthesis, the results, both intuitively and analytically compelling, highlight the limited progress made by other hubs in âcatching up withâ the Dutch and British hubs...|$|R

Although the drivers and challenges for <b>gas</b> <b>trading</b> on the European Continent have been different from those of Britain, the desire for change at an EU policy level, the catalyst of the economic recession and the sea-change in the acceptance of trading have all contributed to an astonishing development in European gas hubs over the past few years. Based on extensive research and discussion with the key actors intimately involved, the paper provides deep insights into the characteristics of the individual hubs, the reasons behind their particular evolutionary path and their characterisation as ‘Trading Hubs’ (NBP and TTF), ‘Transit Hubs (ZEE and CEGH) and ‘Transition Hubs’ (GPL, NCG, PEGs and PSV); a framework which assists the reader in better understanding the current and future role of each. </p...|$|R
