5|$|Washington's second inauguration {{took place}} in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the first at this site) on March 4, 1793. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Supreme Court associate justice William Cushing. Washington's inaugural address was just 135 words, the shortest to date. This inauguration was brief and simple, a sharp contrast to the extravaganza four years earlier, which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> had all the trappings of a monarchical coronation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Catholics, Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed {{his eldest son}} and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial sticking point between her and Elizabeth I.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was {{in black and white}} as the Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} the inclusion of a short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, Yiu Man-tin (姚文田), {{founder and}} chief editor of Morning Bell Press (晨鐘書局) and a Hong Kong resident, {{was arrested in}} Shenzhen {{after he had been}} tricked there. He was known to have been {{preparing}} to publish book by a Chinese writer residing in the US about Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping, entitled Godfather of China, Xi Jinping (中國教父習近平). Yiu was arrested by police in Shenzhen on charges of falsely labelling and smuggling industrial chemicals worth $220,000 in 2010 and was sentenced to prison for 10 years allegedly for smuggling, even though the real reason for the trumped up charges, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> was China's increasing restrictions on political expression under Xi. Two Hong Kong magazine publishers, Wong Kin-man and Wo Chung-hau, were arrested and tried in November 2015 for running an illegal business in China after sending copies of a political magazine to people on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> {{and contributed to}} the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points out the fact that both rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E

25|$|Christianity {{was linked}} even {{more with the}} {{patriotic}} cause when some Christians refused to participate in worship of the Japanese Emperor, which was required by law in the 1930s. Although this refusal was motivated by theological rather than political convictions, the consequent imprisonment of many Christians strongly identified their faith, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Koreans, with the cause of Korean nationalism and resistance to the Japanese occupation. Catholics and Methodists complied with demands to attend Shinto ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia posed a threat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Australians, {{although}} to {{a small group of}} socialists, it was an inspiration. The Communist Party of Australia was formed in 1920 and, though remaining electorally insignificant, it obtained some influence in the trade union movement and was banned during World War II for its support for the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Menzies Government unsuccessfully tried to ban it again during the Korean War. Despite splits, the party remained active until its dissolution {{at the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E

The angle began when Mr. McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, announced as part of the storyline on WWF's Raw Is War and the final episode of WCW's Nitro (which merged into a simulcast) that he had bought WCW from under his father's nose. This led to several run-in appearances of WCW wrestlers during Raw Is War and SmackDown! over the months after WrestleMania X-Seven.|$|E

25|$|Many Catholics and nationalists {{believed}} that the IRA {{had been unable to}} defend them during the August 1969 riots. However, it is argued that the IRA's defence of Short Strand redeemed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> Catholics and nationalists. Prior to the gun battle, the IRA had been waiting for an opportunity to portray themselves as defenders of the Catholic community, which was only made possible by the over-stretching of British Army forces dealing with rioting throughout Belfast and thus unable to provide protection to the Short Strand. Among republicans, the battle is seen as a key event in the growth of the Provisional IRA.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, the New Culture Movement fostered an {{intellectual}} atmosphere that promoted Science and Democracy. Although {{some of the}} movement's leaders, such as Chen Duxiu, initially expressed admiration for the role that Christianity played in building the strong nations of the West, as well as approving the emphasis on love and social service, Christianity became identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> young Chinese with foreign control of China. The 1923 Anti-Christian Movement attacked missionaries and their followers {{on the grounds that}} no religion was scientific and that the Christian church in China was a tool of the foreigners. Such Chinese Protestants as the liberals David Z. T. Yui, head of the Chinese National YMCA, and Y. T. Wu (Wu Yaozong), Wu Leichuan, T. C. Chao, and the theologically more conservative Chen Chonggui responded by developing social programs and theologies that devoted themselves to strengthening the Chinese nation. Y. C.

25|$|As {{the result}} of an Internal Settlement signed on 3 March 1978 between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the moderate African nationalist parties, which were not in exile and not involved in the war, elections were held in April 1979. The United African National Council (UANC) party won a majority in this election, and its leader, Abel Muzorewa (a United Methodist Church bishop), became the country's first black prime minister on 1 June 1979. The country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The internal settlement left control of the country's police, security forces, civil service and judiciary in white hands, for the moment. It assured whites of about one third of the seats in parliament. It was essentially a power-sharing arrangement between whites and blacks which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> particularly the insurgents, did not amount to majority rule. However, the United States Senate voted to end economic sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 12 June.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the British Army, {{deployed}} into Northern Ireland in August 1969 {{to reinforce}} the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and restore government control, was welcomed in Catholic nationalist areas as a neutral force compared to the Protestant- and unionist-dominated RUC and Ulster Special Constabulary. However, this good relationship with nationalists did not last long. The Army was soon discredited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> nationalists by incidents such as the Falls Curfew of July 1970, when 3,000 British troops imposed martial law conditions on the nationalist lower Falls area of west Belfast. After a gun and grenade attack on troops by Provisional IRA members, the British fired over 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with both the Official IRA and Provisional IRA in the area, killing six civilians. Thereafter, the Provisionals continued targeting British soldiers. The first soldier to die was gunner Robert Curtis, killed by Billy Reid in a gun battle in February 1971.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of Ireland {{replaced}} the Constitution of the Irish Free State {{which had been}} in effect since the independence, as a dominion, of the Irish state from the United Kingdom on 6 December 1922. There were two main motivations for replacing the constitution in 1937. Firstly, the Statute of Westminster 1931 granted parliamentary autonomy to the six British Dominions (now known as Commonwealth realms) within a British Commonwealth of Nations. This {{had the effect of}} making the dominions sovereign nations in their own right. The Irish Free State constitution of 1922 was, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>many,</b> associated with the controversial Anglo-Irish Treaty. The anti-treaty faction, who opposed the treaty initially by force of arms, was so opposed to the institutions of the new Irish Free State that it initially took an abstentionist line toward them, boycotting them altogether. However, the largest element of this faction became convinced that abstentionism could not be maintained forever. This element, led by Éamon de Valera, formed the Fianna Fáil party in 1926, which entered into government following the 1932 general election.|$|E
