5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

2500|$|John Painter {{states that}} {{nothing in the}} James passage looks suspiciously like a Christian {{interpolation}} and that the account can be accepted as historical.(Painter pages 139–142). Painter discusses the role of Ananus and the background to the passage, and states that after being deposed as High Priest for killing James and being replaced by <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Damnaeus, Ananus had maintained his influence within Jerusalem through bribery.(Painter page 136) Painter points out that {{as described in the}} Antiquities of the Jews (...) Ananus was bribing both Albinus and <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Damnaeus so that his men could take the tithes of other priests outside Jerusalem, to the point that some of whom then starved to death.(Painter pages 139–142). Philip Carrington states that {{there is no reason to}} question the authenticity of the Josephus passage on James, and elaborates the background by stating that Ananus continued to remain a power within the Jewish circles at the time even after being deposed, and that it is likely that the charges brought against James by Ananus were not only because of his Christian association but because he objected to the oppressive policies against the poor; hence explaining the later indignation of the more moderate Jewish leaders.|$|E

2500|$|Matthew's account {{adds that}} Peter asked Jesus, [...] "if it is you", to tell him, or command him, {{to come to}} Jesus on the water (waters). According to the Pulpit Commentary, the word 'if' is not {{intended}} to imply any doubt on Peter's part. After Peter came down out of the ship and walked on the water, he became afraid of the storm and began to sink. He called out to Jesus for help. Jesus caught him and reproved him for his lack of faith, and led him back to the ship, whereupon the storm stopped. Matthew also notes that the disciples called <b>Jesus</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> of God.

2500|$|Oneness believers, by contrast, {{hold that}} God is {{absolutely}} and indivisibly one (Deuteronomy 6:4), {{and do not}} accept the idea of three distinct centers of consciousness in the Godhead, a modern form of the ancient belief of Modalism or Sabellianism. They also affirm that in Jesus dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that Jesus is the only name given for salvation (Colossians 2:9). The Father was revealed {{to the world in}} the name of <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> was given the name of Jesus at birth, and the Holy Spirit comes to believers in the name of Jesus. Thus they believe the apostles correctly fulfilled Christ’s command to baptize “in the name [...] of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost” by baptizing all converts with the invocation of the name of Jesus (Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38; 8:16; 10:48; 19:5; 22:16).|$|E

2500|$|In New Testament theology, in {{addition}} to [...] "life" [...] (zoe, i.e. ζωὴ in Greek), {{there is also a}} promised spiritual life sometimes described by the adjective eternal (aionios i.e. αἰώνιος in Greek) but other times simply referred to as [...] "life".

2500|$|The Bahá'í Faith {{and related}} topics have {{appeared}} in fiction in multiple forms. The mention of the Bahá'í Faith, prominent members, or even individual believers {{have appeared in}} a variety of fictional forms including science fiction, and fantasy, as well as styles of short stories, novelettes, and novels, and even diverse media of the printed word and TV series. A 2005 estimate is of more than 30 references though it could be far more. Out of these near three dozen references, there are perhaps a dozen where there is a significant relationship with the religion, where the Bahá'í Faith is a crucial aspect of the story. The first occurrence known is perhaps Marie von Najmajer wrote a poem dedicated to Tahirih in Gurret-úl-Eyn: Ein Bild aus Persiens Neuzeit published in 1874.

2500|$|However, {{the fact}} that the virgin birth is {{mentioned}} only by Matthew and Luke is considered to produce doubt as to its truth by scholars such as Jürgen Moltmann. He writes: [...] "In the New Testament, Christ's 'virgin birth' is related only by Luke and Matthew. It was unknown, or considered unimportant, in wide areas of early Christian belief (the Pauline and Johannine sectors, for example). But from the third century onwards it became a firm component of the Christian creeds and theological christologies." [...] He also writes: [...] "The virgin birth {{is not one of the}} pillars that sustains the New Testament faith in Christ. The confession of faith in <b>Jesus,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Son</b> of God, the Lord, is independent of the virgin birth, and is not based on it." [...] "Moreover, we find the confession of faith in Christ in Christian traditions which know nothing of the virgin birth, or do not mention it." [...] He concludes: [...] "that the virgin birth does not provide the justification for confessing Christ." [...] John L. McKenzie notes that, if these two narratives were missing from the New Testament, [...] "there would be no biblical mention of the virgin birth". He adds, [...] "the event is unusual enough for one to wonder why an author who knew of it would not mention it." [...] Bart D. Ehrman writes, [...] "The tradition that Jesus' mother was a virgin is given by both Matthew and Luke, and to that extent, it's independently attested. But it has always struck scholars as odd that the tradition—which surely would be an important thing to know!—isn't attested anywhere else in our earliest sources, even among writers who would have had a real interest in publicizing {{the fact that}} God himself was actually Jesus' father." [...] The Oxford Companion to the Bible, on the fact that nowhere else in the Bible is the virgin birth attested, has: Such an argument from silence cannot be determinative, but it is an important consideration for people who see the virgin birth as a feature created within the early traditions about Jesus rather than a historical occurrence. Those who doubt the historicity of the virgin birth argue that it was created by the early church as a way of honoring the coming of Jesus as the Son of God or of explaining the idea of God becoming flesh. Miraculous human birth stories are common in biblical tradition, going back to Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17.15—19, 18.9—15, I. 1—7), and numerous references to deities impregnating women are found within the Greco-Roman tradition. The mother Of Heracles, for instance, was said to have been impregnated by Zeus (Diodorus Siculus, 4-9, 1—10).|$|E
