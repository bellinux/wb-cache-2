5|$|The {{scale of}} {{camouflage}} patterns {{is related to}} their function. Large structures need larger patterns than individual soldiers to disrupt their shape. At the same time, large patterns are more effective from afar, while small scale patterns work better up close. Traditional single scale patterns work well in their optimal range from the observer, but an observer at other distances will not see the pattern optimally. Nature itself is very often <b>fractal,</b> where plants and rock formations exhibit similar patterns across several magnitudes of scale. The idea behind multi-scale patterns is both to mimic the self-similarity of nature, and also to offer scale invariant or so-called <b>fractal</b> camouflage that works at close range {{as well as at}} traditional combat range.|$|E

25|$|A <b>fractal</b> {{dimension}} is an index for characterizing <b>fractal</b> patterns or sets by quantifying their complexity as {{a ratio of}} the change in detail to the change in scale. Several types of <b>fractal</b> dimension can be measured theoretically and empirically (see Fig. 2). <b>Fractal</b> dimensions are used to characterize a broad spectrum of objects ranging from the abstract to practical phenomena, including turbulence, river networks, urban growth, human physiology, medicine, and market trends. The essential idea of fractional or <b>fractal</b> dimensions has a long history in mathematics that {{can be traced back to}} the 1600s, but the terms <b>fractal</b> and <b>fractal</b> dimension were coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1975.|$|E
25|$|Unlike topological dimensions, the <b>fractal</b> index {{can take}} non-integer values, {{indicating}} that a set fills its space qualitatively and quantitatively differently from how an ordinary geometrical set does.

Similarly, a surface with <b>fractal</b> dimension of 2.1 fills space very much like an ordinary surface, but one with a <b>fractal</b> dimension of 2.9 folds and flows to fill space rather nearly like a volume.

25|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} in <b>fractal</b> geometry, a <b>fractal</b> dimension is a ratio providing a statistical index of complexity comparing how detail {{in a pattern}} (strictly speaking, a <b>fractal</b> pattern) changes with the scale at which it is measured.

25|$|If {{a circle}} {{boundary}} is drawn around the two-dimensional {{view of a}} <b>fractal,</b> the <b>fractal</b> will never cross the boundary, {{this is due to}} the scaling of each successive iteration of the <b>fractal</b> being smaller. When fractals are iterated many times, the perimeter of the <b>fractal</b> increases, while the area will never exceed a certain value. A <b>fractal</b> in three-dimensional space is similar, however, a difference between fractals in two dimensions and three dimensions, is that a three dimensional <b>fractal</b> will increase in surface area, but never exceed a certain volume. This can be utilized to maximize the efficiency of ion propulsion, when choosing electron emitter construction and material. If done correctly, the efficiency of the emission process can be maximized.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to model the {{distribution}} of galaxies with a <b>fractal</b> pattern was made by Luciano Pietronero and his team in 1987, and a more detailed view of the universe’s large-scale structure emerged over the following decade, {{as the number of}} cataloged galaxies grew larger. Pietronero argues that the universe shows a definite <b>fractal</b> aspect over a fairly wide range of scale, with a <b>fractal</b> dimension of about 2. The <b>fractal</b> dimension of a homogeneous 3D object would be 3, and 2 for a homogeneous surface, whilst the <b>fractal</b> dimension for a <b>fractal</b> surface is between 2 and 3.

25|$|<b>Fractal</b> {{dimensions}} {{were first}} applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms {{for which the}} details seemed {{more important than the}} gross picture. For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical <b>fractal</b> dimension equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height).

25|$|This idea {{of being}} {{detailed}} relates to another feature that can be understood without mathematical background: Having a fractional or <b>fractal</b> dimension greater than its topological dimension, for instance, refers to how a <b>fractal</b> scales compared to how geometric shapes are usually perceived. A regular line, for instance, is conventionally understood to be 1-dimensional; if such a curve is divided into pieces each 1/3 {{the length of the}} original, there are always 3 equal pieces. In contrast, consider the Koch snowflake. It is also 1-dimensional for the same reason as the ordinary line, but it has, in addition, a <b>fractal</b> dimension greater than 1 because of how its detail can be measured. The <b>fractal</b> curve divided into parts 1/3 the length of the original line becomes 4 pieces rearranged to repeat the original detail, and this unusual relationship is the basis of its <b>fractal</b> dimension.|$|E
