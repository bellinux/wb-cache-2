500|$|In some areas, an earth closet was used. Invented by Henry Moule, {{this system}} used a metal {{container}} {{as with the}} pail system, but small amounts of a mixture of peat, dry earth and ashes were used to cover the excreta, removing any smells almost immediately. [...] These <b>deodorisers</b> were often applied with a small scoop or shovel, but more elaborate systems existed where the powder was kept in a box near the seat, with a small handle to control the amount deposited on the excrement. [...] Charcoal—which could be obtained cheaply from street-sweepings—and sawdust were also used to good effect. [...] The process was {{more expensive than the}} simpler pail system. [...] The mixture of earth and excreta could often be dried and re-used, but the fear of infections meant that it was sometimes used instead as a garden fertiliser.|$|E
40|$|Volatile {{substances}} are {{chemical compounds}} that give off fumes at room temperature. They are also called ‘inhalants’ {{in recognition of}} their route of administration [1]. They are central nervous system depressants, and their use involves deliberate inhalation to produce a state of altered consciousness or intoxication. Onset of effect occurs rapidly because the extensive capillary surface of the lungs readily absorbs the vapour, causing blood levels to peak within minutes of use [2]. There are approximately 250 household, medical and industrial products that contain potentially intoxicating volatile substances [1]. Many of these are readily available. Volatile substances are usually classified into four groups [3]: •	 solvents-liquids or semi-liquids that vaporise at room temperature, such as glues and petrol •	 gases-medical anaesthetics and fuel gases, such as lighter fuels •	 aerosols-sprays containing propellants and solvents •	 nitrites-amyl nitrite or cyclohexyl nitrite found in room <b>deodorisers</b> Nitrates, however, do not directly affect {{the central nervous system}} and their use occurs primarily for enhancement of sexual pleasure, rather than intoxication. The volatile substances most commonly used for intoxication are aliphatic, aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons. These include toluen...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigated}} {{strategies used}} by older and working-aged women to manage urinary incontinence (UI) {{in their daily}} lives. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The sample comprised 103 older (> 65 years; mean = 74. 6 years) and 104 working-aged (18 - 65 years; mean = 50. 3 years) community-dwelling Australian women with self-reported UI. They had experienced UI {{for an average of}} 5 years and a majority rated their UI severity as moderate to severe. INSTRUMENT: Based on a comprehensive literature review, a 93 -item author-developed questionnaire was developed and pilot tested to identify the type and frequency of strategies used by participants to manage UI. Items were developed that queried demographic and lower urinary symptom characteristics (type, severity, duration). METHODS: Participants were recruited via public and privately funded continence clinics and an advertisement in a local newspaper, with a 66 % retention rate following recruitment. Questionnaires were posted to participants with a reply paid envelope for return. RESULTS: The women used a range of strategies to manage UI in their daily lives. A large proportion of women from both groups chose to (1) go to the toilet immediately after urge (older 94 %; working-aged 92 %); (2) integrate urine loss management a normal part of everyday life (older 81 %; working-aged 78 %); (3) stopping activities that make them leak (older 85 %; working-aged 83 %); and (4) using pads and aids for urinary containment (older 87 %; working-aged 73 %). Older women were more likely to use most of the strategies identified in the questionnaire. These strategies included the following: stop drinking in the evening (older 64 %; working-aged 43 %; P =. 003); organize their bedroom close to the toilet (older 61 %; working-aged 36 %; P =. 001); limit travel (older 45 %; working-aged 18 %; P = <. 001); limit socializing (older 30 %; working-aged 11 %; P =. 001); and limit new relationships (older 25 %; working-aged 11 %; P =. 01). Respondents engaged in a variety of hygiene measures such as washing (older 86 %; working-aged 60 %; P =. 001), changing pads frequently (older 76 %; working-aged 58 %; P =. 008), and using <b>deodorisers</b> (older 68 %; working-aged 50 %; P =. 008). Working-aged women were more likely to modify (older 17 %; working-aged 70 %; P <. 001) or avoid (older 8 %; working-aged 32 %; P =. 001) sexual activity. CONCLUSION: Both older and younger women aimed to normalize UI in their daily lives, using strategies designed to keep the bladder empty, maintain secrecy, and preserve social continence. Knowledge of these strategies and the difference between older and working-aged women will enable health care professionals to initiate more targeted support and advice for women with UI.

5000|$|In 1993, {{inspired}} by Mayan skulls, he made 25 skulls, using crystal {{to create a}} glistening effect: [...] "When the light hits it, {{it looks as if}} it is covered in diamonds." [...] Initially he used paradichlorobenzene, a substance more often found as a toilet <b>deodoriser.</b> He first showed such a skull at the Cohen Gallery. He subsequently developed this idea, using materials such as soap and wax, artificial diamonds and Swarovski crystals.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} quality characteristics for refined {{vegetable oils}} focus on a bland taste, a light colour and a good oxidative stability. Currently, an increased interest is observed for functional minor components naturally present in oils and fats performing a beneficial nutritional effect. Refining of crude vegetable oils involving degumming, bleaching and deodorisation has a high influence {{on the content of}} functional minor components. In this study the difference of chemical versus physical refining will be studied. Especially the reduction of the tocopherol content in refined oil is mainly due to oxidation of the tocopherol. Also the content of sterols in free and esterified form is changing during the various stages of refining. As the economic value of physical <b>deodoriser</b> distillates is much lower compared to chemical distillates an improved deodorization technology to increase the quality of physical <b>deodoriser</b> distillates by condensation of the distillate in two separate fractions was developed. Free fatty acids distillated in the initial stages of the deodorization process are collected in a first distillate, followed by a condensation of tocopherols and phytosterols in a second distillate with a high economic value. The fractionated distillation of free fatty acids and tocopherols / phytosterols was achieved by optimisation of the deodorization temperature profile...|$|R

The original features of the process were the use of sulphuric acid as a decoloriser and <b>deodoriser</b> of strongly-smelling fats, and their subsequent distillation, when acidified, by the aid of super-heated steam. The invention was profitable, and in the Panic of 1847 the business was sold for £250,000.|$|R
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or <b>deodoriser</b> and {{scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron {{with them when they}} settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|R
5|$|The {{attack on}} Singapore Harbour was codenamed Operation Jaywick, {{the brand name}} of a popular {{lavatory}} <b>deodoriser,</b> and {{had nothing to do}} with guerrillas or fifth columnists. It had been carried out by Lieutenant Colonel Ivan Lyon from 'Z' Special Unit, a group of AngloAustralian commandos who had sailed from Western Australia to Singapore in an old Japanese fishing boat, the Krait, named after a Malayan snake. Once within striking distance of the harbour, the commandos took to folboats (folding canoes), and paddled into the docks under cover of night. Using limpet mines, they sank six Japanese ships of 2,0005,000 tons, including several tankers, and then slipped away to their rendezvous with the Krait, finally returning successfully to Australia. (The Krait is now preserved and on display at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Sydney). The Japanese could not conceive that a force could penetrate their lines of defence and have the audacity to attack their shipping. They therefore concluded that it must have been an internal operation, carried out by Chinese guerrillas organised from Changi Prison.|$|R
