25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand. In {{the middle of}} the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, {{about the size of a}} penny, accompanied by acute pain in {{the middle of the}} red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.|$|E
25|$|We’re {{so lucky}} to have gotten here, and if we {{look back on the}} fact that we were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being {{distributed}} and making these albums under budget… there was one year when we were the only band on the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> appreciate how odd it was that we had the chance to do that because it doesn’t really happen in a lot of cases.|$|E
25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out. He got even, though. One time there were two strikes on him and he swung as the pitch was coming in. But he didn't swing at the ball. He swung right at my wrists. Sometimes I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> feel the pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{everybody}} pays him homage. I nearly blow my top. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> {{hear the}} way he was whistled when he rode. I think of the organisers of the Tour, who shortened the time trial to make him lose. His home town of Rouen organises commemorations but, me, I haven't forgotten that it was in Antwerp that he made his farewell appearance. More than once, I saw him crying in his hotel room after suffering the spitting and insults of spectators. People said he was cold, a calculator, a dilettante. The truth is that Jacques was a monster of courage. In the mountains, he suffered as though he was damned. He wasn't a climber. But with bluffing, with guts, he tore them to shreds (il les a tous couillonnés).|$|E

[...] The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Rosa Parks. The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. [...] "I was {{a big fan of}} Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s.

Michael Ashley wrote in Who's Who in Horror and Fantasy Fiction (1978), [...] "Typewriter in the Sky (1940) is a rollicking farce of a man written into another's story". Everett F.

Janrae Frank of The Washington Post commented, [...] "Much of his best work of the '40s and '50s, Fear, Slaves of Sleep, Typewriter in the Sky, is written in exactly the same style and won reader polls at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Once the {{production}} {{on the film}} was completed, Hillenburg wanted to end the series [...] "so the show wouldn't jump the shark", but Nickelodeon wanted more episodes produced. Hillenburg said [...] "Well, there was concern when we did the movie [...] that the show had peaked. There were concerns among executives at Nickelodeon." [...] Hillenburg resigned as the series' showrunner, and appointed Paul Tibbitt, who previously served as a writer, director, and storyboard artist of the show, to overtake the role. Hillenburg considered Tibbitt {{one of his favorite}} members of the show's crew, and [...] "totally trusted him". Tibbitt still helmed the showrunner position, until October 2015 when Vincent Waller & Marc Ceccarelli took his position, and also functions as an executive producer. Hillenburg no longer writes or runs the show on a day-to-day basis, but reviews each episode and delivers suggestions. He said, [...] "I figure when I'm pretty old <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> paint. I don't know about running shows." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, Madonna said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} throw an old song for fun, and 'Holiday' {{seemed to be}} a {{universal}} favourite. In addition to that it's one of the only old songs I've done that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> sing and not feel I've totally outgrown it." [...] Performing it {{as a part of the}} encore, Madonna appeared on the stage in a polka-dotted blouse with matching flounces at the bottom of white trousers and hair in a top knot with a ponytail. The costume was adopted from a My Fair Lady dress and was designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier. Three different performances are found in the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90 VHS, the Blond Ambition World Tour Live VHS and the [...] documentary. The performance included in the documentary was used as a music video to promote it. The performance received four nominations at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, including Best Female Video, Best Dance Video, Best Choreography in Video and Best Cinematography in Video, but did not win any of the categories.|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{intellectual}} pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As {{a small boy}} {{he had begun to}} visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: [...] "The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren... <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> see the swing of MacLaren's bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised". In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus's heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. [...] "I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene".|$|E

500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least every day is a new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E

500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>still</b> feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used.
