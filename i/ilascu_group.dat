50|$|Andrei Ivanțoc (born 9 March 1961) is a Moldovan politician. He {{was among}} the four leaders (the Ilie <b>Ilașcu</b> <b>group,</b> {{comprising}} also Alexandru Leşco and Tudor Petrov Popa) of the Tiraspol branch of the pro-Romanian Christian-Democratic People's Party of Moldova who were accused of terrorism by the authorities of the breakaway Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR).|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of Ilaşcu and Others v. Moldova and Russia (2004), the European Court of Human Rights found their {{detention}} arbitrary and did not recognize the sentence. It also demanded that Moldova and Russia release the other Ilie <b>Ilaşcu</b> <b>Group</b> members, Andrei Ivanţoc and Tudor Petrov-Popa, at that time still imprisoned in Transnistria.|$|E
50|$|Petrov-Popa was a Soviet army {{veteran of}} the war in Afghanistan who was convicted {{together}} with four other men in the so-called <b>Ilașcu</b> <b>Group</b> for acts of terrorism including assassination by the separatist authorities of Transnistria. The trials in 1993 were considered by many human rights groups as unfair and lacking in due process. Adding to this impression were the clearly political aspects, in that Petrov-Popa and Ivanţoc as well as the others were Romanian unionists.|$|E
5000|$|According to Amnesty International, as of 2004 [...] "Torture {{and other}} ill-treatment in police {{detention}} remained widespread; the state failed {{to carry out}} prompt and impartial investigations and police officers sometimes evaded penalties. Political dissidents from <b>Ilașcu</b> <b>Group</b> were released from arbitrary detention in the break-away Transdinester region only after an order of the European Court of Human Rights. In 2009, when Moldova experienced its most serious civil unrest in a decade, several civilians, including Valeriu Boboc, were killed and many more injured.|$|E
