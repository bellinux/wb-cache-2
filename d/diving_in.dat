5|$|Trapezes {{are often}} used with diving shots. When <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> tidal waters {{at the end of}} slack water, the trapeze may be {{released}} from the diving shot to drift in the current as the divers make their decompression stops.|$|E

5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn {{increases the risk of}} other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The Hills {{conceal the}} largest {{underground}} river system in Britain; attempts {{to move from}} one cave to another through the underground rivers {{led to the development of}} cave <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> Britain. The first cave dive was attempted at Swildon's Hole in 1934, and the first successful dive was achieved the following year at Wookey Hole Caves, which has the deepest sump in Britain at 76m (250ft). The cave complexes at St. Dunstan's Well Catchment, Lamb Leer, and Priddy Caves have been identified as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E

In his third year as MSU head coach, Weise coached the Spartans to a program-best sixth-place team finish at the NCAA Championship. Matt Gianiodis is the head coach of both men and women's swimming and <b>diving.</b> <b>In</b> his four years as head coach, Spartan swimmers and divers have broken 14 varsity records.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{continues}} his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, {{the head of}} the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on the hull of his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of <b>diving.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. <b>Diving</b> <b>in</b> liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{north of}} Havana, Cuba, Elena emerged into the Gulf of Mexico. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, Elena {{intensified}} into a Category 1 hurricane. Analysis of steering currents {{through the morning}} of August 30 suggested that Elena would continue on its northwestward track, striking the area between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Biloxi, Mississippi within 30 hours. Unexpectedly, a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents, allowing Elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed. Roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity, the storm abruptly turned east {{in response to the}} trough. Having defied initial forecasts, Hurricane Elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest Florida. Forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the Florida Peninsula and into the western Atlantic. However, the relatively weak trough moved rapidly, and instead of fully engaging Elena, its axis passed over the storm's center. Further, post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segments.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand {{the effects of the}} diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for <b>diving</b> <b>in</b> a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for <b>diving.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed {{to make sure that they}} could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E
