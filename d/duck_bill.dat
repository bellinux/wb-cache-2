25|$|The kepi was {{formerly}} {{the most common}} headgear in the French Army. Its predecessor originally appeared during the 1830s, {{in the course of}} the initial stages of the occupation of Algeria, as a series of various lightweight cane-framed cloth undress caps called casquette d'Afrique. These were intended as alternatives to the heavier, cloth-covered leather French Army shako. As a light and comfortable headdress, it was adopted by the metropolitan (French mainland) infantry regiments for service and daily wear, with the less practical shako being relegated to parade use. In 1852, a new soft cloth cap was introduced for campaign and off-duty. Called bonnet de police à visière, this was the first proper model of the kepi. The visor was generally squarish in shape and oversized and was referred to as bec de canard (<b>duck</b> <b>bill).</b> This kepi had no chinstrap (jugulaire). Subsequent designs reduced the size of the cap and introduced chinstraps and buttons. The kepi became well known outside France during the Crimean War and was subsequently adopted in various forms by a number of other armies (including the U.S. and Russian) during the 1860s and 1870s.|$|E

5000|$|Lingula is {{probably}} {{derived from the}} Latin word for tongue [...] "lingua" [...] and a diminutive suffix -ula, so small tongue.

50|$|Swan neck {{deformity}} {{has many}} possible causes {{arising from the}} DIP, PIP, or even the MCP joints.

50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} <b>duck</b> <b>bill.</b> It comes in three models : side scew, centre screw and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an intrauterine contraceptive device, taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} self-retaining. Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the vaginal wall retractor. However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|E
