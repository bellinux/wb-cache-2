40|$|A circuit which {{maintains}} the inertial {{element of a}} gyroscope or accelerometer at a constant position by delivering pulses to a rebalancing motor is discussed. The circuit compensates for temperature changes by using a temperature sensor that varies the threshold of inertial element movement required to generate a rebalance pulse which reacts to changes in viscosity of the <b>flotation</b> <b>fluid.</b> The output of the temperature sensor also varies the output level of the current source to compensate {{for changes in the}} strength of the magnets of the rebalancing motor.

40|$|A {{variety of}} faecal {{examination}} methods have shown variable sensitivity in identifying larvated Spirocerca lupi (S. lupi) eggs. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine which faecal examination method, including a novel modified centrifugal flotation method, was most sensitive in the diagnosis of spirocercosis. Faeces were collected from 33 dogs diagnosed with spirocercosis by oesophageal endoscopy at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic Hospital between 2008 and 2009. If the first evaluation was negative, a second faecal sample was evaluated 24 - 48 h later. Ten faecal examinations using 1 g aliquots of faeces were performed per sample. Four faecal examination methods were evaluated; direct faecal examination using saline, direct faecal flotation, a modified faecal centrifugal flotation and a laboratory performed faecal sedimentation/flotation. The direct and modified centrifugal flotation methods were each performed using four faecal flotation solutions; NaNO 3 (Specific gravity (SG) 1. 22), MgSO 4 (SG 1. 29), ZnSO 4 (SG 1. 30) and saturated sugar (SG 1. 27). The sedimentation/flotation method utilized MgSO 4 (SG 1. 29). The modified centrifugal flotation method required centrifugation (1400 G) of a prepared faecal suspension (1 g faeces suspended in 5 ml of flotation solution) after which 0. 1 ml of the supernatant was aspirated from the surface using an adjustable volume micropipette for microscopic examination. The 10 faecal examination tests were statistically analysed using the Friedman test (nonparametric equivalent of analysis of variance) p= 0. 000, z value = 0. 05. The sensitivity of the tests ranged between 42 % and 67 %, with the NaNO 3 solution showing the highest sensitivity in both the direct and modified centrifugal flotation methods. The modified NaNO 3 centrifugal method ranked first with the highest mean egg cell count (45. 24 ± 83). The modified centrifugal NaNO 3 method was found to be superior (i. e. higher egg counts) and significantly different (p< 0. 001) compared with the routine saturated sugar, ZnSO 4 and MgSO 4 flotation methods. The direct flotation method/technique using NaNO 3 <b>flotation</b> <b>fluid</b> was also superior and significantly different (p< 0. 001) when compared to the same technique using ZnSO 4 or MgSO 4 flotation fluids. Neoplastic transformation of oesophageal nodules was confirmed in 15 % (n= 5) of dogs and a further 18 % (n= 6) had both neoplastic and non-neoplastic oesophageal nodules. S. lupi eggs were demonstrated in 40 % of dogs with neoplastic nodules and in 72. 9 % of dogs with non-neoplastic nodules. The mean egg count in the non-neoplastic group (61) was statistically greater (p= 0. 02) than that of the neoplastic group (1). The results show that faecal examination using the direct and modified centrifugal flotation methods with the NaNO 3 <b>flotation</b> <b>fluid</b> are the most sensitive methods in the diagnosis of spirocercosis. The modified centrifugal flotation method using this solution has the highest mean egg count. The study also found that dogs with neoplastic nodules shed significantly fewer eggs than dogs with non-neoplastic nodules. CopyrightDissertation (MMedVet) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Many soil ecologists still {{encounter}} practical difficulties when extracting microarthropods {{from the}} soil. Methods using a humidity gradient, {{established by the}} use of a heat source, for collecting soil animals appeared not sufficiently efficient in case of sandy soils. For such type of soils, flotation techniques proved more suitable. The use of toxic or aggressive <b>flotation</b> <b>fluids</b> like kerosene, dibromo ethane, carbon tetrachloride and heptane, however, makes these methods less favourable. To circumvent this problem, a novel technique has been developed based on the flotation principle but using olive oil. The method uses a pumping system that injects olive oil {{at the base of a}} Perspex column in which the soil sample is suspended in water using a propeller. In this way, intensive contact between oil droplets and the organisms is established, increasing extraction efficiency. After stopping the propeller, animals can easily be collected from the oil floating to the water surface. Adding coloured mites to soil samples was used to determine extraction efficiency of the method. Average (±SD) recoveries of 82. 7 ± 7. 4 % (n = 34) and 89. 7 ± 10. 0 % (n = 10), respectively were obtained when extracting storage mites and predatory mites from a sandy soil. © 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Diagnosis of mushroom exposure in animals is {{hampered by the}} lack of rapid diagnostic tests. Our study evaluated the feasibility of using flotation concentration and microscopic evaluation of spores for mushroom identification. Evaluation of this method in living animals exposed to toxigenic mushrooms is limited by ethical constraints; therefore, we relied upon the use of an in vitro model that mimics the oral and gastric phases of digestion. Methods: In our study, mycologist-identified toxigenic (poisonous) and nontoxigenic fresh mushrooms were collected in North Carolina, USA. In phase 1, quantitative spore recovery rates were determined following magnesium sulfate, modified Sheather&# 39;s sugar solution, and zinc sulfate flotation (n= 16 fungal species). In phase 2, mushrooms (n= 40 fungal species) were macerated and digested for up to 2 hours in a salivary and gastric juice simulant. The partially digested material was acid neutralized, filtered, and spores concentrated using zinc sulfate flotation followed by microscopic evaluation of spore morphology. Results: Mean spore recovery rates for the three <b>flotation</b> <b>fluids</b> ranged from 32. 5 % to 41. 0 % (P= 0. 82). Mean (± standard error of the mean) Amanita spp. spore recovery rates were 38. 1 %± 3. 4 %, 36. 9 %± 8. 6 %, and 74. 5 %± 1. 6 % (P= 0. 0012) for the magnesium sulfate, Sheather&# 39;s sugar, and zinc sulfate solutions, respectively. Zinc sulfate flotation following in vitro acid digestion (phase 2) yielded spore numbers adequate for microscopic visualization in 97. 5 % of trials. The most common spore shapes observed were globose, spiked, elliptical, smooth and reticulate. Conclusion: Flotation can concentrate mushroom spores; however, false negative results can occur. Spore morphology could not be used to differentiate species of mushroom-forming fungi since the spore shape and surface characteristics seen {{in the present study were}} often observed with multiple species of mushroom-forming fungi.

40|$|CSIRO has {{developed}} a model of <b>flotation</b> using computational <b>fluid</b> dynamics (CFD) software that incorporates fluid motion in realistic vessel geometries. The model also predicts particle capture by bubbles in the system using equations based on the induction time concept. This work looks to experimental studies at the microscale to provide an improved basis for the attachment predictions in the overall model of flotation. A model cell {{has been set up}} to study the behaviour of 150 micron glass particles in the vicinity of a captive 1. 3 mm air bubble. The interaction is recorded on high-speed video, permitting direct estimation of relevant parameters such as the approach velocity, and the duration of particle sliding over the bubble surface. A new experimental configuration has allowed the particle path toward, around, and away from the bubble to be totally unimpeded. Particle trajectories show a significant deviation at surprisingly large separations, due to the hydrodynamics. However, surface properties are more important in determining eventual attachment. Sliding durations have been measured, and these can be related back to a threshold duration to achieve attachment, known as the 'induction time'. Events where a sliding particle 'jumps in' toward the bubble may indicate the precise moment of attachment, providing a more accurate estimate of induction time. Flotation modellers must consider processes ranging from bulk hydrodynamics to molecular chemistry. However, the micromechanics that forms a bridge between those two processes turns out to be critical. Direct observation of particle-bubble interaction through high-speed videography provides insight into flotation modelling, to allow prediction of attachment based on a realistic combination of hydrodynamic and chemical factors. 11 page(s...|$|R
