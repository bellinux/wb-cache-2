2500|$|Individual retail {{speculative}} traders {{constitute a}} growing segment of this market {{with the advent}} of retail foreign exchange trading, both in size and importance. Currently, they participate indirectly through brokers or banks. Retail brokers, while largely controlled and regulated in the USA by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and National Futures Association, have previously been subjected to periodic foreign exchange fraud. To deal with the issue, in 2010 the NFA required its members that deal in the Forex markets to register as such (I.e., Forex CTA instead of a CTA). [...] Those NFA members that would traditionally be subject to minimum net capital requirements, FCMs and IBs, are subject to greater minimum net capital requirements if they deal in Forex. A number of the foreign exchange brokers operate from the UK under Financial Services Authority regulations where foreign exchange trading using margin is part of the wider over-the-counter derivatives trading industry that includes contracts for difference and <b>financial</b> <b>spread</b> betting.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{usefulness}} of several measures of <b>financial</b> <b>spreads</b> (the slope of the yield curve, the reverse yield gap, the credit quality spread) for fore-casting real economic activity and inflation in the euro area. A quarterly Bayesian vector autoregression model is {{used to assess the}} marginal forecasting power of <b>financial</b> <b>spreads</b> for real economic activity and inflation. A benchmark BVAR is set up, containing real GDP, inflation and key indicators of monetary policy and foreign macroeconomic variables. The properties of the spreads as leading indicator are then assessed by augmenting the benchmark BVAR with the spreads, one at a time. We find that <b>financial</b> <b>spreads</b> have no or negligible marginal predictive con-tent for either target variable. Overall, there is no ready-to-use financial indicator that can replace an encompassing multivariate model for the prediction of target variables in the euro area. <b>financial</b> <b>spreads,</b> bayesian VAR models, bayesian analysis, forecasting...|$|R

50|$|In the UK {{and some}} other European {{countries}} the profit from spread betting is free from tax. The UK {{and some other}} European countries tax authorities designate <b>financial</b> <b>spread</b> betting as gambling and not investing, meaning it is free from capital gains tax and stamp tax, {{despite the fact that}} its regulated as a financial product by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK.

The popularity of <b>financial</b> <b>spread</b> betting in the UK and some other European countries, compared to trading other speculative financial instruments such as CFDs and futures is partly due to this tax advantage.

We show that when shocks to monitoring and collateral dominate those to goods productivity and the velocity of money demand, money and the external finance premium become closely linked. This is because increases in asset prices allow banks to raise the supply of loans leading to an expansion in aggregate demand, via a compression of <b>financial</b> interest rates <b>spreads,</b> which in turn tends to be inflationary. Thus money and <b>financial</b> <b>spreads</b> are negatively correlated when banking sector shocks dominate.

40|$|In the {{canonical}} monetary policy model, money is endogenous to the optimal path for {{interest rates and}} output. But when liquidity provision by banks dominates the demand for transactions money from the real economy, money is likely to contain information for future output and inflation because of its impact on <b>financial</b> <b>spreads.</b> And so we decompose broad money into primitive demand and supply shocks. We find that supply shocks have dominated the time series in both the UK and the US in the short to medium term.

40|$|This paper interprets {{contagion}} {{effects as}} a perceived increase (triggered by events occurring elsewhere) in {{the volatility of}} aggregate shocks impinging on the domestic economy. The implications of this approach are analyzed in a model with two types of credit market imperfections: domestic banks borrow at a premium on world capital markets, and domestic producers (whose demand for credit results from working capital needs) borrow at a premium from domestic banks which possess comparative advantage in monitoring the behavior of domestic agents. <b>Financial</b> intermediation <b>spreads</b> are shown {{to be determined by}} a markup that compensates for the expected cost of contract enforcement and state verification and for the expected revenue lost in adverse states of nature. Higher volatility of producers' productivity shocks increases both <b>financial</b> <b>spreads</b> and the producers' cost of capital, resulting in lower employment and higher incidence of default. The welfare effects of volatility are non-linear. Higher volatility does not impose any welfare cost for countries characterized by relatively low volatility and efficient financial intermediation. The adverse welfare effects are large (small) for countries that are at the threshold of full integration with international capital markets (close to financial autarky), that is, countries characterized by a relatively low (high) probability of default. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the predictability {{of real estate}} asset returns using a number of time series techniques. A vector autoregressive model, which incorporates <b>financial</b> <b>spreads,</b> is able to improve upon the out of sample forecasting performance of univariate time series models at a short forecasting horizon. However, as the forecasting horizon increases, the explanatory power of such models is reduced, so that returns on real estate assets are best forecast using the long term mean of the series. In the case of indirect property returns, such short-term forecasts {{can be turned into}} a trading rule that can generate excess returns over a buy-and-hold strategy gross of transactions costs, although none of the trading rules developed could cover the associated transactions costs.
