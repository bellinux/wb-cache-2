Instead, he favors tax credits {{of up to}} $5,000 for families to get health insurance. His plan focuses on enhancing competition {{in the health care}} industry as a way to lower costs. To that end, McCain favors the Health Care Choice Act, which would allow citizens to purchase health insurance nationwide instead of limiting them to in-state companies, and to buy insurance through any organization or association they choose as well as through their employers or buying direct from an insurance company. In an October 2007 statement, McCain said: [...] "In health care, we believe in enhancing the freedom of individuals to receive necessary and desired care.

2500|$|The Ninth Amendment (1791) {{declares}} that individuals have other fundamental rights, {{in addition to}} those stated in the Constitution. During the Constitutional ratification debates Anti-Federalists argued that a Bill of Rights should be added. [...] The Federalists opposed it on grounds that a list would necessarily be incomplete but would be taken as explicit and exhaustive, thus enlarging the power of the federal government by implication. [...] The Anti-Federalists persisted, and several state ratification conventions refused to ratify the Constitution without a more specific list of protections, so the First Congress added what became the Ninth Amendment as a compromise. Because the rights protected by the Ninth Amendment are not specified, they are referred to as [...] "unenumerated". [...] The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to privacy, and the right to make important decisions about one's <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>or</b> body.|$|E

By regulation, the Department of Health and Human Services extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent contractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of [...] "business associates". PHI is any information held by a covered entity that concerns health status, provision of <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>or</b> payment for health care that {{can be linked to}} an individual.

2500|$|In Canada, such privately run for-profit and not-for-profit {{facilities}} also exist. [...] Because of cost factors, some provinces operate government-funded {{public facilities}} run by each province's or territory's Ministry of Health, {{or the government}} may subsidize {{the cost of the}} facility. In these care homes, elderly Canadians may pay for their care on a sliding scale based on annual income. The scale that they are charged on depends on whether they are considered [...] “Long Term Care” or “Assisted Living.” For example, commencing in January 2010 seniors living in British Columbia’s government subsidized “Long Term Care” (also called “Residential Care”) will pay 80% of their after-tax income unless their After Tax Income is less than $16,500. The “Assisted Living” tariff is calculated more simply as 70% of the After-Tax Income. As seen in the province of Ontario, there are waiting lists for many long-term care homes, though, so families may need to resort to hiring home <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>or</b> paying for a stay in a private retirement home.|$|E

At the market in Kakuma town (outside the camp), refugees come to sell their food rations at very low prices. Some traders specialize in buying up food rations from the refugees in small quantities and selling it in large quantities to merchants outside the camp. Most of the local retailers have been ruined by the competition with refugees. Goods sold in the camp are very cheap because refugees do not pay tax, rent, food, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>or</b> education for their children. Still, taking formal and informal economy together the monthly turnover in the camp is $300,000 to $400,000. Taxation in the camp would yield {{more than two million}} Kenyan Shillings.

[...] Additionally, Waters, representing a congressional district whose median income falls far below the national average, argued that patriotism alone had not been the sole driving force for those U.S. service personnel serving in Iraq. [...] Rather, [...] "many of them needed jobs, they needed resources, they needed money, so they're there". [...] In a subsequent floor speech, Waters told her colleagues that Congress, lacking the votes to override the [...] "inevitable Bush veto on any Iraq-related legislation," [...] needed to [...] "better [...] the administration's false rhetoric about the Iraq war" [...] and [...] "educate our constituents [...] {{the connection between the}} problems in Pakistan, Turkey, and Iran with the problems we have created in Iraq".

This paper reports the results of a survey {{of economic}} evaluations in EC countries to identify the impact of the results on decision and policy making in <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> <b>Health</b> service researchers in 10 EC countries were identified and asked to participate in the survey. The researchers were asked to locate economic evaluations in their country and complete a standardised questionnaire for each study. The criteria for inclusion in the survey were first, the studies should have been started or reported since 1987, second, the evaluations should include a comparison of the cost and consequences of the technologies assessed and finally, the appraisals should include a comparison of alternative <b>health</b> <b>care</b> technologies <b>or</b> programmes. A total of 66 studies which met the survey criteria were reported. Of these, 27 % were thought to have influenced <b>health</b> <b>care</b> decision makers <b>or</b> policy. The results suggested that method of dissemination, source of funding and purpose of the study may be important determinants of whether an economic evaluation will be used in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> policy <b>or</b> decision making. The results of the survey suggest that economic evaluation currently has a relatively low impact on <b>health</b> <b>care</b> policy <b>or</b> decision making.
