2500|$|Ullman {{revealed}} her long-held {{desire to}} return to British television in 2015. [...] "I have lived in America for a really long time, but I was never away from England. I was always there, I just didn't work there. I wasn't offered anything there really. So when the BBC called me last year, I was really thrilled. I mean, I {{wanted to do something}} England. The last thing I'd done was with Michael Palin. We did [...] in 1992, I think. We did a show about the class system in Britain and it was <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> fun. And from that HBO picked that up and I did [...] So it started from a British show." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who'd {{have ever}} thought that such fine people existed?" [...] Saxon pondered. [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful,</b> {{when you come}} to think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Holmes, I {{admit that}} {{what you say is}} interesting: it's more than interesting--it's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful.</b> But let us have it a little clearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where does the money come from?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And that I {{can think}} such {{thoughts}} as these is <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful,</b> [...] And that I can remind you, {{and you think}} them and know them to [...] be true, is <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful.</b>|$|R
60|$|DUKE. [Uneasily.] We {{all felt}} devilish queer <b>just</b> now. <b>Wonderful</b> things {{there are in}} the world. [After a pause.] I suppose it's all electricity.|$|R
60|$|And yet in this mood, as in most, {{there is}} a sort of left-handed truth involved. These heroes are not so far removed from us after all. They were men of like passions with ourselves, with the same flesh about them, the same spirit within them, the same world outside, the same devil beneath, the same God above. They and their deeds were not so very wonderful. Every child who is born into the world is <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful,</b> and, for aught we know, might, 'mutatis mutandis, do <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful</b> deeds. If {{accident}} and circumstance helped them, the same may help us: have helped us, if we will look back down our years, far more than we have made use of.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a good wizard now," [...] {{asserted}} Aunt Em, {{looking at}} the little man admiringly. [...] "The way he made those tents grow out of handkerchiefs was <b>just</b> <b>wonderful!</b> And didn't he enchant the wagon wheels so they'd find the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost under now," [...] {{the officer}} {{answered}} cheerily. [...] "We've managed {{to put it}} out somehow for the present. But what can you do in the way of putting out fire when the very earth under your feet's inflammable! I never saw stuff burn like that. The flames spread at first on every side with <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> rapidity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{my father}} never married. He loved her all the time. I've got a lovely poem home that she wrote to him. It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful,</b> and it sings like music. Well, long, long {{afterward}} her husband died, and then she and my father made their love marriage. They didn't get married until 1882, and she was pretty well along." ...|$|E
5000|$|Marea {{was pleased}} with her performance: [...] "I am so excited! Being here is <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful</b> as winning a gold medal. Thank you, thank you to everyone". At 14 years and 261 days she was the {{youngest}} track and field athlete competing at the 2004 Olympics.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{used for}} {{a story in the}} Oklahoma Times newspaper. Caption: "Mrs. R. G. Sinclair's {{wonderful}} memories of Multi and Vati and Marzipans all are coming to life as she gets reaquanted with mr. and Mrs. Helmuth Schwarze, Bremen, Germany, and finds the candies taste <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful</b> as she remembered. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, [...] "he has <b>just</b> {{bought the}} <b>wonderful</b> orchid called 'Odontoglossum Pavo.' That {{is what they}} are all talking about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The theatres?" [...] {{said another}} lady. [...] "How {{you must have}} enjoyed them. I just love the theatres. Last week my husband and I were at the Palatial--it's moving pictures--where they have that film with the motor {{collision}} running. It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful.</b> You see the motors going at full speed, and then smash right into one another--and all the people killed--it's really fine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and it's a {{good thing}} I didn't lose the money when I tried to. You see, mother, what I hadn't {{realized}} was the good {{that could be done}} with all that money if a man put his heart into it. They can start in as soon as they like and tear down those buildings. My! but it's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> {{what you can do with}} money. I'm glad I didn't lose it!" ...|$|E
60|$|It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> {{how these}} things run when they're organized. Take the first luncheon, for example. There they all were, every man in his place, every captain at his post {{at the top of}} the table. It was hard, perhaps, for some of them to get there. They had very likely to be in their stores and banks and offices till the last minute and then make a dash for it. It was the cleanest piece of team work you ever saw.|$|E
5000|$|Current Montgomery Mayor Vera [...] "Susie" [...] Waters, who is paid $265 per month, {{but also}} works as office manager for two pharmacies, said that small-town {{finances}} [...] "aren't {{in good shape}} right now. Any kind of equipment we purchase, we rely strictly on grants. When {{we can get a}} donation of equipment it's <b>just</b> a <b>wonderful</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll never refuse me, Professor," [...] he asserted, confidently. [...] "I'm an old supporter, I am. I've {{seen you}} in Blackburn and Manchester, and twice here. <b>Just</b> as <b>wonderful</b> as ever! And that young lady of yours, Professor, begging your pardon if she is your daughter, as no doubt she is, why, she's a nut and no mistake." ...|$|R
50|$|The King and Eyebright {{suddenly}} appear back home, {{looking over}} the kingdom. The King can now see <b>just</b> how <b>wonderful</b> and beautiful his kingdom is. Eyebright thought she could only see five round islands in a row, but the King cannot possibly be mistaken so she agrees {{that it is a}} beautiful kingdom. Eyebright then runs off and the King returns home to bed.|$|R
6000|$|And {{the working}} class too. It is <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> how [...] {{prohibition}} has increased their efficiency. In the old days [...] they used to drop their work the moment the hour struck. Now [...] they simply refuse to do so. I noticed yesterday a foreman [...] {{in charge of a}} building operation vainly trying to call the [...] bricklayers down. [...] "Come, come, gentlemen," [...] he shouted, [...] "I [...] must insist on your stopping for the night." [...] But they just [...] went on laying bricks faster than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can never}} trust those gilt-edge Britishers," [...] said Jean Graham with authority. [...] "There was old man Peters who {{took one of}} them in, and he'd sit in the store nights making little songs to his banjo, and talking <b>just</b> <b>wonderful.</b> Said he was a baronet or something, if he had his rights, and made love to Sally. Old fool Peters {{believed}} him, and lent him three hundred dollars to start a lawsuit over his English property with. Dessay Peters thought red-haired Sally would look well trailing round as a countess in a gold-hemmed dress. The baronet took the money, but wanted some more, and lit out the same night with Lou of the Sapin Rouge saloon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I must," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "You don't {{know how}} I've grown to value, to lean upon, him. At times I have {{felt as if}} I always {{wanted him to be}} near me; I like to feel {{wherever}} I am--at the play, at a restaurant, anywhere --that I can reach out and touch him. I know," [...] she continued, [...] "that it's only a wild fancy and that others would laugh at it, but you can understand, can you not--carino caruso mio? And think, darling, in our new life, how busy he, too, will be--making money for all of us--in a new money market. It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> how he does it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brumley {{was silent}} for a little while. [...] "You see," [...] he resumed, [...] "at the worst this new social life may become a sort of slavery in barracks; at the best--it might become {{something}} very wonderful. My mind's been busy now for days thinking <b>just</b> how <b>wonderful</b> the new life might be. Instead of the old bickering, crowded family home, a new home of comrades...." ...|$|R
6000|$|And that I {{can think}} such {{thoughts}} as these {{is just as}} wonderful; And that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true, is [...] <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful.</b> And that the moon spins round the earth, and on with the earth, is equally [...] wonderful; And that they balance themselves with the sun and stars is equally [...] wonderful.|$|R
50|$|Church of St. Just, {{built in}} the sixteenth century. The church of St. <b>Just</b> is a <b>wonderful</b> example of {{architecture}} typical of Gallura completely built of granite and decorated to the smallest detail.|$|R
60|$|We reached Savannah on Tuesday, {{and were}} to leave in the steamer for St. Augustine Thursday afternoon. Thursday morning {{we went out to}} the {{cemetery}} of Bonaventure, one of the loveliest places in the whole world, where there are long avenues of live-oaks that stretch {{from one side of the}} road to the other, like great covered arbors, and from every limb of every tree hang great streamers of gray moss, four and five feet long. It was <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> to look at. The whole place seemed dripping with waving fringe. Rectus said it looked to him as if this was a graveyard for old men, and that every old fellow had had to hang his beard on a tree before he went down into his grave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I'm {{afraid that}} poor lad, Stead, is in poor plight. You mind, {{he was always}} a still, steady, {{hard-working}} lad, and when his father was killed, and his house burnt, and his brother ran away, the way he and his sister turned to was <b>just</b> <b>wonderful.</b> They went to live in an old hut in the gulley down there, and they have made the place so tidy as it does your heart good to look at it. They bred up the young ones, and the younger girl is well married to one of the Squire's folks, and everyone respected them. But, as ill-luck would have it, some robbers from Bristol seem to have got scent of their savings. Some said that the Communion Cup was hid somewhere there." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful.</b> Just think - I {{was only}} Miss South Africa yesterday. Now I'm Miss World. And I feel {{on top of}} the world." [...] Penny Coelen excited call back home after winning Miss World.|$|E
5000|$|Those {{who worked}} with Greenberg have {{described}} him as nervous, driven, and short in both stature and temper. One associate described him as a [...] "buttoned-down lawyer who was very creative, very forceful, and willing to take great chances." [...] His associate Michael Katz described him as [...] "incredibly bright and articulate, <b>just</b> a <b>wonderful,</b> spontaneous speaker. I think {{was a very good}} leader [...] [...] [...] [...] dynamic and very tough and demanding." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with the Editor in Chief of The Advocate, Halford broke down in tears and told Judy Wieder, [...] "It's a wonderful moment when you {{walk out of the}} closet. Now I've done that and I've freed myself. It's a great feeling for me to finally let go and make this statement—especially to The Advocate, because this magazine has brought me so much comfort over the years. Obviously this is <b>just</b> a <b>wonderful</b> day for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Williamson {{rode with}} great {{distinction}} in England, Ireland and Europe winning thirteen classic races, eight in Ireland, two in England and three in Europe. [...] "He and Scobie Breasley {{were the best}} two jockey’s I’ve ever seen," [...] International jockey Ron Hutchison said, [...] "he was extremely patient, sitting and waiting until the final three hundreds to take off. He was <b>just</b> a <b>wonderful</b> stylist, so nice to watch, a straight back, low in the saddle and perfect balance." ...|$|R
5000|$|Enya {{performed}} {{her song}} at the Academy Awards on March 24, 2002. She was [...] "absolutely" [...] {{excited about the}} performance. For her it was the [...] "first time to be nominated, and to get to perform, it's <b>just</b> <b>wonderful,</b> absolutely wonderful." ...|$|E

5000|$|In September 1963, George Harrison of The Beatles visited Benton {{while on}} vacation, {{the first time}} {{any member of the}} group visited American soil. He stayed at the home of his sister, Louise, at 113 McCann Street. The {{bungalow}} is now the Hard Day's Nite Bed and Breakfast. Harrison also performed with a band called [...] "The Four Vests" [...] at the Veterans of Foreign Wars hall in Eldorado, Illinois. In an interview, Harrison's sister Louise said [...] "his real first visit to America was {{when he came to the}} midwest in September 1963 and he met these wonderful, warm, friendly, real warm Midwesterners... school teachers, retired miners and all kinds of <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> people... and a little band. He had a fantastic time. He thought they were <b>just</b> <b>wonderful</b> people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{love your}} friends," [...] she said. [...] "I think Mrs. Dartrey is {{perfectly}} sweet and Dartrey is <b>just</b> as <b>wonderful</b> as I had pictured him. They are so strangely unusual," [...] she went on. [...] "I can scarcely believe, even now, that our dinner actually {{took place in}} my little room here--Stephen Dartrey, the man I have read about all my life, and this brilliant young wife of his. Thank you so much, dear friend, for bringing them." ...|$|R
60|$|The peasants were mighty {{kind and}} hearty, and flew around and {{did their best}} to make us comfortable. This morning I breakfasted on the shore in the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat. Clean cloth, napkin and table furniture, white sugar, a vast hunk of {{excellent}} butter, good bread, first class coffee with pure milk, fried fish <b>just</b> caught. <b>Wonderful</b> that so much cleanliness should come out of such a phenomenally dirty house.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was really}} <b>just</b> another <b>wonderful</b> song from Dave's pen to us. It's never been {{performed}} by anyone else with {{any degree of}} success in my mind because it's a simple song recorded with extreme dynamic subtlety. Every piece has its place from the softly swooshing drum machine beat to the insistent bass line that doesn't always follow the chords - a true McComb/Casey trademark - to the several melodies that act as counterpoint to the vocal.
