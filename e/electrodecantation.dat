40|$|Dewatering of silica and alumina {{suspensions}} {{was accomplished}} using <b>electrodecantation</b> and electrocoagulation. Electrocoagulation {{was found to}} occur in high-conductivity alumina suspensions (250 - 1300 μS/cm), while <b>electrodecantation</b> {{was found to be}} the separation mechanism in low-conductivity suspensions of alumina and silica (< 20 μS/cm). With these low-conductivity suspensions, a clear fluid layer developed {{on the surface of the}} suspension. A clear fluid layer did not develop in high conductivity silica suspensions, 250 μS/cm, even though <b>electrodecantation</b> was found to dominate the separation. Spatial variations in the pH and conductivity were measured at the completion of <b>electrodecantation</b> experiments. A boundary-layer model was developed to quantitatively establish the principles of <b>electrodecantation.</b> This model provides an explanation for the formation of the clear fluid layer on the surface of colloidally stable suspensions and provides an understanding of how buoyancy driven motion redistributes ions produced/consumed at the electrodes, which results in the formation of pH and conductivity gradients. The growth rate of the clear layer at the top of the chamber is initially slower than that predicted by the model; at later stages the theory and experiments are in agreement. Numerical simulations were performed to support the boundary-layer model and were used to incorporate important features such as electrode reactions, ion gradients, and cell geometry omitted from the model. Two-dimensional simulations were performed to study the effects of buoyancy driven motion in the absence of any ion gradients. Due to limited computer resources, one-dimensional simulations were used to show that a clear fluid layer would not necessarily be expected in high-conductivity suspensions and to study the effects of electrode reactions in the absence of any fluid motion. To characterize properties important to <b>electrodecantation,</b> two techniques were developed to measure particle diffusion coefficients, size, and electrophoretic mobility. Taylor-Aris dispersion measurements are shown to provide accurate diffusion coefficient measurements for colloidal particles up to about 0. 3 μm in diameter and capillary electrophoresis is used to establish a novel method for measuring electrophoretic mobilities of colloids that compares favorably with existing methods...|$|E
40|$|A basic {{physical}} model of <b>electrodecantation</b> {{has been developed}} and tested. Experimental data of Belongia (1999) were used to compare with computational results obtained from the model. The model was developed to calculate the transient velocity field, electric potential and particle distribution for the parameter space encountered in stable colloidal dispersions. The model included {{the effects of a}} spatially nonuniform electric field that existed in the experiments of Belongia (1999) because of the type and position of the electrodes used. As a result, the model required numerical methods for its solution. The problem was found to depend largely on three dimensionless groups: Re, a Reynolds number, Pe an electric Péclet number and ¤ a large dimensionless parameter denoting the Grashof number divided by the Reynolds number. Because A^(1 / 3) >> 1, nonuniform computational meshes were needed to resolve the exceedingly thin natural convection boundary layers that occur. Additionally, because Pe >> 1, a flux-limiting (FCT) numerical method was used to solve the particle transport equation. Results from the basic {{physical model}} show excellent agreement with the scaling of the experimental data but exhibit about 80 % relative error when compared with experimental data on the decantation time. Consequently, a physicochemical model of <b>electrodecantation</b> was developed to include electrical conductivity variations that develop as ions transport during <b>electrodecantation.</b> Results show markedly better agreement (about 10 % relative error) with experimental data concerning the decantation rate. Additionally, the physicochemical model is able to predict the pH and electrical conductivity stratification that was measured experimentally by Belongia (1999). A problem concerning the electrohydrodynamic deformation of miscible fluids, with differing electromechanical properties (electrical conductivity and dielectric constant), was also investigated. Numerical results predicting the sense and extent of deformation for various values of the two fluids’ electrical conductivity ratio compare well (less than 10 % relative error) with measurements by Rhodes, et al. (1989). The role of dielectric constant differences in electrohydrodynamic deformations was also investigated. It was determined that an O(1) difference in the fluids’ dielectric constants is necessary to produce electrohydrodynamic deformations on the time scales reported by Rhodes, et al. (1989) and Trau, et al. (1995) ...|$|E
