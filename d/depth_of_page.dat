40|$|A common way {{to present}} 3 D {{materials}} to human observers nowadays is by stereoscopic displaying on 3 D TVs or head-mounted displays {{such as the}} Oculus Rift. However, not everyone can see three-dimensional solid shape from stereoscopic viewing and the three-dimensional images remain two-dimensional pictures to them rather than solid shapes. Scientists and artists {{have spent a lot}} of effort in finding ways to dissolve pictorial space into visual space. In other words, they want to figure out how to create a sense of stereopsis in an observer when he or she is looking at non-stereo and stereo pictures. There are many monocular depth cues in addition to binocular disparity that can enhance depth perception, and these cues can therefore also create an impression of stereopsis when the viewing conditions are right. One <b>of</b> these <b>depth</b> cues is <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is defined as the distance range in which objects are perceived as sharp. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is a popular photographic technique that effectively makes the main subject in a picture appear sharp and the foreground and background blurred. The goal of this thesis is to understand the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field in pictures from a relatively low perceptual level to a relatively high cognitive level. This thesis mainly reveals how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the impression of stereopsis and how binocular disparity influences the perception <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. I start the thesis with a study on the discrimination thresholds <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. Then, a subjective study is reported in which I investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception for binocular viewing. The next two studies address the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on a more cognitive level. The first of these two studies explored the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection in pictures. The other one was conducted to evaluate how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the aesthetic appeal and overall quality in photographs. Four subjective studies were conducted to achieve our goals. The cornerstone of the work described in this thesis is that humans are much more sensitive to changes in small <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field than in large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. A second important finding is that stereoscopic viewing does not significantly affect discrimination thresholds. Based on the discrimination thresholds that were measured in this study, I selected five levels <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field that can be well discriminated under stereo viewing conditions in the second study to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception. I found that the presence <b>of</b> strong <b>depth</b> cues, in this case binocular disparity, weakens the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field as a depth cue when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is small. In contrast, when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is not small, perceived depth decreases with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field irrespective of whether binocular disparity is zero or not. With respect to the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection, I found that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field directs viewers' attention similarly under both non-stereo and stereo viewing conditions. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field does however weaken the effect of binocular disparity on change detection. In the final study, I found that there are no common rules on how to manipulate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field to make pictures more beautiful or have higher quality. The role <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on aesthetic appeal and overall quality varies across content categories.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences <b>depth</b> perception in nonstereo photographs, it remains unclear how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field affects <b>depth</b> perception under stereo viewing conditions. We showed participants stereo photographs with different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> field using a Wheatstone stereoscope and a commercially available 3 D TV. The depicted scene contained a floor, a background, and a measuring probe at different locations. Participants drew a floor plan of the depicted scene to scale. We found that perceived depth decreased with decreasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field for shallow <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> field in scenes containing a heightin-the-field cue. For larger <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> field, different effects were found depending on the display system and the viewing distance. There was no effect on perceived depth using the 3 D TV, but perceived depth decreased with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field using the Wheatstone stereoscope. However, in the 3 D TV case, we found that the perceived depth decreased with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field in scenes in which the height-in-the-field cue was removed. This indicates that the effect <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on perceived depth may be influenced by other depth cues in the scene, such as height-in-the-field cues...|$|R
5000|$|Focal {{length and}} {{diaphragm}} aperture affect the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field {{of a scene}} - that is, how much the background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in [...] "acceptable focus" [...] (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field (not {{to be confused with}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> focus) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance. A large or deep <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is also governed by the format size. If one considers the field of view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same field of view. Then, the smaller the image is, the more <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is obtained, for the same field of view.
