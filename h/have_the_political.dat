25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the State of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E
25|$|The {{approach}} {{known as}} food sovereignty views the business practices of multinational corporations {{as a form}} of neocolonialism. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands. Under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.|$|E

500|$|Russia {{continues}} to oppose further expansion, {{seeing it as}} inconsistent with understandings between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and European and American negotiators that allowed for a peaceful German reunification. NATO's expansion efforts are often seen by Moscow leaders as a continuation of a Cold War attempt to surround and isolate Russia, though they have also been criticised in the West. A June 2016 Levada poll found that 68% of Russians think that deploying NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland – former Eastern bloc countries bordering Russia – {{is a threat to}} Russia. Ukraine's relationship with NATO and Europe has been politically divisive, and contributed to [...] "Euromaidan" [...] protests that saw the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014. In March 2014, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk reiterated the government's stance that Ukraine is not seeking NATO membership. Ukraine's president subsequently signed a bill dropping his nation's nonaligned status in order to pursue NATO membership, but signaled that it would hold a referendum before seeking to join. Ukraine is one of eight countries in Eastern Europe with an Individual Partnership Action Plan. IPAPs began in 2002, and are open to countries that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> will and ability to deepen their relationship with NATO.|$|E

[...] The European Parliamentary deputy Richard Howitt, spoke for the European Parliament's Socialist and Democrat Group when he declared his support for the referendum results. [...] "The unexpectedly large 'yes' vote in Turkey's constitutional referendum is a sign of the population's support for reforms that will prepare the country for European Union membership."

2500|$|In 1942, Luce won a Republican {{seat in the}} United States House of Representatives {{representing}} Fairfield County, Connecticut, the 4th Congressional District. She based her platform {{on three}} goals: [...] "One, to win the war. Two, to prosecute that war as loyally and effectively as we can as Republicans. Three, {{to bring about a}} better world and a durable peace, with special attention to post-war security and employment here at home." [...] She took up the seat formerly held by her late stepfather, Dr. Albert Austin. An outspoken critic of Roosevelt's foreign policy, Luce was supported by isolationists and conservatives in Congress, and she was appointed early to the prestigious House Military Affairs Committee. Although she was {{by no means the only}} female representative on the floor, her beauty, wealth, and penchant for slashing witticisms caused her to be treated patronizingly by colleagues of both sexes. She made a sensational debut in her maiden speech, coining the phrase [...] "globaloney" [...] to disparage Vice President Henry Wallace's recommendation for airlines of the world to be given free access to US airports. [...] She called for repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act, comparing its [...] "doctrine of race theology" [...] to Adolf Hitler's, advocated aid for war victims abroad, and sided with the administration on issues such as infant-care and maternity appropriations for the wives of enlisted men. Nevertheless, Roosevelt took a dislike to her and campaigned in 1944 to attempt to prevent her re-election, publicly calling her [...] "a sharp-tongued glamor girl of forty." [...] She retaliated by accusing Roosevelt of being [...] "the only American president who ever lied us into a war because he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> courage to lead us into it." ...|$|E
