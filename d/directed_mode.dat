40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>mode</b> coding in the bi-predictive {{pictures}} (B-pictures) can efficiently {{improve the}} performance of bi-predictive coding, because it exploits the temporal correlation by bi-directional prediction from both forward and backward reference pictures, and meanwhile {{it does not require}} any bits for coding the motion vectors.

In other words, it is more desirable to obtain the true motion vectors, because the derived motion vectors need not be coded.

They are here evaluated {{on the fast}} fading radio channels encountered in IS- 136 TDMA systems, {{with the aim of}} clarifying several issues: How much can channel estimation performance be improved with these tools, as compared to LMS adaptation? When can an improved tracking MSE be expected to result in a meaningful reduction of the bit error rate? Will optimal prediction of future channel estimates significantly improve the equalization? Can one single tracker with fixed gain be used for all encountered Doppler frequencies and SNR’s, or must a more elaborate scheme be adopted? These questions are here investigated both analytically and by simulation. An exact analytical expression for the tracking MSE on two-tap FIR channels is presented and utilized.

40|$|AbstractHomotetrameric kinesin- 5 motors are {{essential}} for chromosome separation and assembly of the mitotic spindle. These kinesins bind between two microtubules (MTs) and slide them apart, toward the spindle poles. This process must be tightly regulated in mitosis. In in vitro assays, Eg 5 moves diffusively on single MTs and switches to a <b>directed</b> <b>mode</b> between MTs. How allosteric communication between opposing motor domains works remains unclear, but kinesin- 5 tail domains may be involved. Here we present a single-molecule fluorescence study of a tetrameric kinesin- 1 head/kinesin- 5 tail chimera, DK 4 mer. This motor exhibited fast processive motility on single MTs interrupted by pauses. Like Eg 5, DK 4 mer diffused along MTs with ADP, and slid antiparallel MTs apart with ATP. In contrast to Eg 5, diffusive and processive periods were clearly distinguishable. This allowed us to measure transition rates among states and for unbinding {{as a function of}} buffer ionic strength. These data, together with results from controls using tail-less dimers, indicate that there are two modes of interaction with MTs, separated by an energy barrier. This result suggests a scheme of motor regulation that involves switching between two bound states, possibly allosterically controlled by the opposing tetramer end. Such a scheme is likely to be relevant for the regulation of native kinesin- 5 motors...|$|E

However, a mechanism for earlier onset of viral gene expression in cell-to-cell spread was previously uncharacterized. Here we used time-lapse microscopy combined with automated image analysis to quantify {{the timing of the}} onset of HIV gene expression in a fluorescent reporter cell line, as well as single cell staining for infection over time in primary cells. We compared cell-to-cell spread of HIV to cell-free infection, and limited both types of transmission to a two-hour window to minimize differences due to virus transit time to the cell. The mean time to detectable onset of viral gene expression in cell-to-cell spread was accelerated by 19 % in the reporter cell line and by 35 % in peripheral blood mononuclear cells relative to cell-free HIV infection. Neither factors secreted by infected cells, nor contact with infected cells in the absence of transmission, detectably changed onset. We recapitulated the earlier onset by infecting with multiple cell-free viruses per cell. Surprisingly, the acceleration in onset of viral gene expression was not explained by cooperativity between infecting virions. Instead, more rapid onset was consistent with a model where the fastest expressing virus out of the infecting virus pool sets the time for infection independently of the other co-infecting viruses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{advances}} in proteomics {{technologies such as}} two-hybrid, phage display and mass spectrometry have enabled us to create a detailed map of biomolecular interaction networks. Initial mapping efforts have already produced a wealth of data. As {{the size of the}} interaction set increases, databases and computational methods will be required to store, visualize and analyze the information in order to effectively aid in knowledge discovery. Results This paper describes a novel graph theoretic clustering algorithm, "Molecular Complex Detection" (MCODE), that detects densely connected regions in large protein-protein interaction networks that may represent molecular complexes. The method is based on vertex weighting by local neighborhood density and outward traversal from a locally dense seed protein to isolate the dense regions according to given parameters. The algorithm has the advantage over other graph clustering methods of having a <b>directed</b> <b>mode</b> that allows fine-tuning of clusters of interest without considering the rest of the network and allows examination of cluster interconnectivity, which is relevant for protein networks. Protein interaction and complex information from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used for evaluation. Conclusion Dense regions of protein interaction networks can be found, based solely on connectivity data, many of which correspond to known protein complexes. The algorithm is not affected by a known high rate of false positives in data from high-throughput interaction techniques.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the extant lepidosaur Sphenodon (New Zealand tuatara) has been {{extensively}} examined by palaeontologists and comparative anatomists because of its phylogenetic status as the only living member of the Rhynchocephalia. It is also of interest because of its sophisticated feeding apparatus and a prooral (anteriorly <b>directed)</b> <b>mode</b> of shearing used to rip food apart. However, despite several detailed descriptions of the skull, the three-dimensional relationship between individual bones of the skull has generally been ignored. Here we provide the first joint by joint description of the hard tissue anatomy for almost every cranial suture in the skull of Sphenodon. This survey shows that most joints involve either abutments (e. g., along the midline) or extensive overlaps (e. g., more peripheral areas) {{but there are others}} that are heavily interlocked (e. g., postorbital-postfrontal) or involve a notable amount of soft tissue (e. g., vomer-premaxilla). There is variation in facet surface texture (e. g., smooth, ridged, pitted) but extensive interdigitation is uncommon and generally restricted to one plane. The joints do not appear suited to promote the marked intracranial movement reported in lizards such as geckos. However, {{it is possible that the}} base of the premaxillae would have been able to pivot slightly when loaded or impacted by the lower jaw during shearing. The extensive overlapping joints probably serve to maximise the surface area available for soft tissues that can dissipate and redistribute stress while maintaining the rigidity of the skull. These joints are larger in adults which bite more forcefully and may feed on harder prey. Marc E. H. Jones, Neil Curtis, Michael J. Fagan, Paul O'Higgins and Susan E. Evan...|$|E

This study investigated whether rs 4307059 also operates as a quantitative trait locus underlying a broader autism phenotype in the general population, focusing specifically on the social communication aspect of the spectrum. Method: Study participants were 7, 313 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Single-trait and joint-trait genotype associations were investigated for 29 measures related to language and communication, verbal intelligence, social interaction, and behavioral adjustment, assessed between ages 3 and 12 years. Analyses were performed in one-sided or <b>directed</b> <b>mode</b> and adjusted for multiple testing, trait interrelatedness, and random genotype dropout. Results: Single phenotype analyses showed that an increased load of rs 4307059 risk allele is associated with stereotyped conversation and lower pragmatic communication skills, {{as measured by the}} Children's Communication Checklist (at a mean age of 9. 7 years). In addition a trend toward a higher frequency of identification of special educational needs (at a mean age of 11. 8 years) was observed. Variation at rs 4307059 was also associated with the phenotypic profile of studied traits. This joint signal was fully explained neither by single-trait associations nor by overall behavioral adjustment problems but suggested a combined effect, which manifested through multiple sub-threshold social, communicative, and cognitive impairments. Conclusions: Our results suggest that common variation at 5 p 14. 1 is associated with social communication spectrum phenotypes in the general population and support the role of rs 4307059 as a quantitative trait locus for autism spectrum disorder...|$|E

We consider a secondary system deployed {{in a field of}} primary receivers. Primary receivers are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson point process with a density parameter λp. We assume that the secondary system consists of source, relay, and destination terminals, and the source terminal can communicate with the destination terminal either directly (<b>direct</b> <b>mode)</b> or using the relay (relaying mode). We derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of both modes including pathloss, shadowing and multipath fading, and validate the analytical results by simulation. We also derive analytical expressions for the maximum interference caused by both modes to the primary receivers. The results show that to achieve the same median SNR level, the relaying mode may cause less interference to the primary receivers than the <b>direct</b> <b>mode</b> in high pathloss and low shadowing conditions. However, the relaying mode has much higher interference than the <b>direct</b> <b>mode</b> if both modes have the same capacity performance.
