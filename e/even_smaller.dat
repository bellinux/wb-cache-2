5|$|A type Ia {{supernova}} (type one-a) {{is a type}} of supernova {{that occurs}} in binary systems (two stars orbiting one another) in which one of the stars is a white dwarf. The other star can be anything from a giant star to an <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Cacti whose stems are <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> may be {{described}} as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as Ferocactus latispinus, or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.|$|E

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|The {{optical depth}} of the Thebe gossamer ring is about 3, which is three times lower than the Amalthea gossamer ring, but the total mass of the dust is the same—about 107–109kg. However the {{particle}} size distribution of the dust is somewhat shallower than in the Amalthea ring. It follows a power law with q< 2. In the Thebe extension the parameter q may be <b>even</b> <b>smaller.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be <b>even</b> <b>smaller,</b> but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

5|$|Burma in the 15th {{century was}} divided into four {{principal}} power centers: the Ava Kingdom in present-day central Burma, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom on the southern coast, the Mrauk-U Kingdom (Arakan) in the west, and various Shan States {{in the east and}} the north. Beginning in the 1480s, Ava began to disintegrate into <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> kingdoms. By the early 15th century, Ava's former vassals—Mohnyin (and its allies Confederation of Shan States) in the north and the Prome Kingdom (Pyay) in the south—were regularly raiding their former overlord's territory with increasing frequency and intensity.|$|E
5|$|G. tibicen eylandtensis, the Top End magpie, {{is found}} from the Kimberley in {{northern}} Western Australia, across the Northern Territory through Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt {{and into the}} Gulf Country. It is a small subspecies with a long and thinner bill, with birds of Groote Eylandt possibly <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> than mainland birds. It has a narrow black terminal tailband, and a narrow black band; the male has a large white nape, the female pale grey. This form was initially described by H. L. White in 1922. It intergrades with subspecies terraereginae southeast of the Gulf of Carpentaria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, {{there was an}} old ferry road near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A {{railroad}} bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
5|$|Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR): A single Saturn V could {{launch a}} {{spacecraft}} that {{was composed of}} a mother ship which would remain in orbit around the Moon, while a smaller, two-stage lander would carry two astronauts to the surface, return to dock with the mother ship, and then be discarded. Landing {{only a small part}} of the spacecraft on the Moon and returning an <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> part to lunar orbit minimized the total mass to be launched from the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Multiracial {{individuals}} {{are also a}} visible minority in Texas. People identifying as multiracial form 1.9 percent of the population, and number over 448,000 people. Almost 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage, and make up 0.3 percent of the population. People of European and Native American heritage number over 108,800 (close {{to the number of}} Native Americans), and make up 0.5 percent of the population. People of European and Asian heritage number over 57,600, and form just 0.2 percent of the population. People of African and Native American heritage were <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> in number (15,300), and make up just 0.1 percent of the total population.|$|E

5|$|Students must {{finish school}} before turning 21 years old. In 2007, the school's 12-week trimesters were changed into smaller six-week mini-terms, {{and then in}} 2011, <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> three-week terms {{in order to improve}} {{attendance}}. Students who miss more than three days in a three-week mini-term do not earn full high school credit. As a result of this change, attendance increased by 100%, though daily attendance is still about 50%. It takes 60 hours of class work to earn one credit.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further benefit is that it is available in liquid form, which allows for <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|Coalitions between organisms of {{the same}} species have also evolved. An extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects, such as bees, {{termites}} and ants, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce. On an <b>even</b> <b>smaller</b> scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth causes cancer.|$|E
