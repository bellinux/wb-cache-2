5|$|Carnivorous {{bivalves}} have {{a greatly}} reduced style, and a chitinous gizzard that helps grind {{up the food}} before digestion. In other ways, their gut <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of filter-feeding bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Marula oil, {{extracted}} from the kernel of Sclerocarya birrea. Used as an edible oil with a light, nutty flavor. Also used in soaps. Fatty acid composition <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of olive oil.|$|E
5|$|Stela 30 is {{the first}} {{surviving}} monument to be erected after the Hiatus. Its style and iconography <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Caracol, {{one of the more}} important of Tikal's enemies.|$|E
40|$|Four meteor spectra are {{analyzed}} for chemical composition and radiative processes. The chemical compositions of the Taurid, Geminid, and Perseid meteors <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{of a typical}} stony meteorite. The chemical composition of the sporadic meteor <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a nickel iron meteorite. The radiation from optical meteors <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a low temperature gas, except that strong, anomalous ionic radiation is superposed on the neutral radiation in bright, fast meteors...|$|R

30|$|Now, {{since the}} {{estimates}} for JKI, JKN and JKSP <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of JKM, also estimates of JI, JN and JSP <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of JM, therefore using {{a very similar}} argument, it can be easily shown that JKI, JKN, JKSP iterative schemes converge faster than JI, JN, JSP iterative schemes.|$|R
5|$|The winter habitat <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{used for}} breeding, except that high ground and other exposed localities are avoided; however, the island {{subspecies}} T. p. hebridensis will frequent the seashore in winter.|$|E
5|$|A archaeological {{study in}} 2010 {{revealed}} that {{the layout of the}} rock-cut caves in the temple <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of other rock-cut temples such as the Rockfort and Pechipalai cave temple. The unfinished caves in the temple, along with the lower cave temples in Tiruchirappalli and Tiruparankunram, each have a shrine for Shiva in the east and Vishnu in the west, separated by a central bay between them.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows {{in the dark}} with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Crime in Paris <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> in {{most large}} cities. Violent crime is {{relatively}} {{rare in the}} city centre. Political violence is uncommon, though very large demonstrations may occur in Paris and other French cities simultaneously. These demonstrations, usually managed by a strong police presence, can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human menstrual cycle <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle.|$|E
5|$|From the 21st Dynasty onward, more {{copies of}} the Book of the Dead are found in hieratic script. The {{calligraphy}} <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds {{to the size of}} the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Mortimer {{applied to}} switch to the Netherlands {{national}} team; since her mother is from that country, she has dual citizenship. In June 2014, the Hamilton Spectator reported the change. Although day-to-day funding in the Netherlands <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> in Canada, the former offers prize money; in the 2012 Paralympics, Mortimer would have won $60,000 for her gold medals alone. She will train in Amersfoort.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Roman helmet ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached. The helmet would {{originally}} have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of which <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the 3rd-century Guisborough Helmet, discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of the helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard.|$|E
5|$|Its {{external}} morphology <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Holochilus brasiliensis, {{and over}} the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys. Within the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.|$|E

5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The researchers found that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|MFGM is a {{structurally}} complex bioactive milk component, {{found in}} human milk {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of human MFGM.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen carved stone monuments were {{originally}} found at El Chal, {{all of which}} are badly eroded. Various monuments are broken into fragments. Only five stelae and three altars bore sculpted designs. The stelae exhibit a variety of forms but all the altars are circular. None of the hieroglyphic texts found on the monuments of El Chal have yet been deciphered. The sculptural style of the monuments <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of 8th century monuments from Sacul, Ucanal and Naranjo.|$|E
