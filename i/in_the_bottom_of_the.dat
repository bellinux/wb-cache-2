5|$|On May 27, 2016, Granderson hit a {{walk off}} home run against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He {{was the first}} batter up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 9th inning. As of June 16, 2016, Granderson had hit 17 lead-off homers since joining the Mets in 2014, a {{franchise}} record. On September 17, Granderson hit two solo home runs against the Minnesota Twins at Citi Field. The first tied the ballgame <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11th inning and the second won the game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 12th inning. He became only the eighth player in Major League history to hit multiple home runs in extra innings of the same game.|$|E
5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller grounded out. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first, Carl Furillo grounded out, and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third to end the inning.|$|E

5|$|Chad Durbin {{relieved}} Happ {{in the top}} of the seventh. He walked Johnny Damon, {{who then}} stole second base. Rodriguez was then hit by a pitch, and Damon scored on a single by Jorge Posada. Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh and retired the side in order. Brett Myers retired the first two batters {{in the top of}} the eighth, but Hideki Matsui then hit a solo home run pinch hitting for Chamberlain. Phil Hughes pitched a third of an inning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth and allowed a solo home run to Carlos Ruiz before being relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera closed out the game, throwing just five pitches to record the final two outs. This game was Pettitte's 17th career postseason win, extending his MLB record.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, Albert Pujols doubled with two out, and Scott Rolen hit a line drive towards Mueller, who caught {{it to end}} the inning. Morris walked Ramírez and Ortiz <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inning. Varitek then tripled to center field to give the Red Sox a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Pujols doubled again {{and was able}} to score on an error by Mueller. The Red Sox also scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inning when Bellhorn doubled to center with two runners on base, to give them a three-run lead. Cal Eldred came in to relieve Morris in the fifth inning, after he had walked the leadoff hitter, having already given up four runs in the {{previous}} four innings. Mueller committed his World Series record-tying third error of the game, in the sixth inning; however, the Cardinals failed to capitalize. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inning, Trot Nixon led off with a single to center, and two more singles by Johnny Damon and Orlando Cabrera enabled two more runs to score to make it 6–1.|$|E

5|$|Nick Swisher {{walked to}} lead off {{the fifth inning}} and {{advanced}} to second on a Melky Cabrera single. Swisher restored the Yankees' lead, scoring on a single by Jeter, and Cabrera added to it by scoring a run on a Damon single. Brett Gardner replaced Cabrera in center field as a defensive substitution <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixth inning after Cabrera left the game due to a hamstring injury. Chan Ho Park relieved Phillies starter Joe Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless in that inning. Chase Utley hit his third solo home run of the series <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh with two outs, bringing the game to 4–3. Dámaso Marte relieved Sabathia and got the final out of the seventh without further scoring.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} inning with two runs, but the Phillies {{answered}} with back-to-back doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inning. The Phillies tied the game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Replays showed that Howard did not touch home plate as he slid across; however, the Yankees did not appeal. Swisher led off the fifth inning with a walk, scoring on a single by Derek Jeter, and Melky Cabrera scored on a single by Damon. Park relieved Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless. Chase Utley hit his third home run of the series <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh with two outs. Dámaso Marte struck out Howard to end the inning. After a game-tying home run by Feliz, Lidge entered the game in the ninth and gave up a two-out single to Damon. With Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and advanced to third as the base was uncovered due to the pull shift against Teixeira. Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double to left field, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single which scored Teixeira, who had singled, and Rodriguez. Mariano Rivera entered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth and notched his second save of the series.|$|E

5|$|Granderson and Daniel Murphy {{were the}} two most {{productive}} hitters in the Mets lineup during their 2015 postseason run to the World Series. While Murphy cooled off in the World Series against the Kansas City Royals, Granderson {{continued to be a}} consistent threat for the Mets out of the leadoff spot and also had three home runs and five RBIs in that World Series. In Game 1, after the Royals tied the game in the ninth inning with a home run off Mets closer Jeurys Familia, Granderson made an excellent leaping catch with nobody out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 11th inning, off the bat of the Royals fastest runner Jarrod Dyson, preventing what would have at least been a lead off triple and likely saving the game at the time, though the Royals would go on to win the game anyway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14th inning on a sacrifice fly by Eric Hosmer. Throughout the series, playing right field, Granderson played the most consistent and solid defense of any Mets fielder.|$|E
5|$|Greinke {{was called}} up to the major leagues on May 22, 2004, and made his major league debut against the Oakland Athletics, {{allowing}} two runs in five innings. At 20 years old he was the youngest player in the majors and came close to picking up the win, but the team's closer, Jeremy Affeldt, gave up the lead with two outs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth inning.|$|E
5|$|In Game 7 of the World Series, Freese hit {{a two-run}} double <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first inning, {{bringing}} his 2011 postseason RBI total to 21, an MLB record. The Cardinals {{went on to}} win the game and the series, making Freese a World Series champion for the first time. For his efforts, Freese was named the World Series MVP. He became the sixth player to win the LCS and World Series MVP awards in the same year. Freese also won the Babe Ruth Award as the postseason MVP.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} game of a July 25 doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park, {{starting}} pitcher Roberts batted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ninth in a 0–0 shutout. With Bob Rush on the mound for Chicago, Roberts managed a walk and was replaced on base by Caballero, who promptly took second base on a hit and run groundout by first baseman Eddie Waitkus. A single to center field by Richie Ashburn allowed the speedy Caballero to score from second and completed the doubleheader sweep for Philadelphia—Bubba Church having pitched a three-hit shutout {{in the first game}} earlier in the day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, the Dodgers {{scored three}} runs off Maglie. Reese and Snider hit {{back-to-back}} singles, and Maglie threw a wild pitch, allowing Reese to score. After Robinson was walked, Andy Pafko hit a single to score Snider. Cox added another single to score Robinson before the inning ended, making the score 4–1 in favor of the Dodgers. Newcombe got the Giants out in order <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighth, and Larry Jansen did the same in relief of Maglie in {{the top of the}} ninth.|$|E

He {{finished with}} six strikeouts, three hits allowed and retired the last 14batters he faced. The Cardinals avoided a shutout when Walker {{hit a home}} run to center field off Foulke in the ninth inning, but Foulke retired the other three batters he faced in the inning to secure the win for the Red Sox 4–1.|$|E
5|$|On August 18 at AT Park, in a 10-7 {{win over}} the New York Mets, Bumgarner became the second pitcher {{in the modern era}} after Hal Jeffcoat of the 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs to allow a grand slam and then hit a go-ahead home run in the same inning, {{according}} to the Elias Sports Bureau. Bumgarner surrendered a grand slam to future teammate Justin Ruggiano {{in the top of the}} fourth inning and proceeded to hit a two-run home run off of Jacob deGrom <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fourth inning.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate.
