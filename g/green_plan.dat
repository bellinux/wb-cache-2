40|$|Abstract. The {{core and}} {{foundation}} of urban sustainable development is urban <b>green</b> <b>planning,</b> as urban <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> will directly determine the structure, morphology and {{results of the}} future development of city. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the relationship between urban <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> and sustainable development. The research indicates that, at this stage the focus of China's urban <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> is the construction of new production and consumption pattern oriented to low-carbonization development. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the associated legislation for urban <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> and development, to draw up and promulgate associated norms, and to reinforce evaluation and supervision for it...|$|R

40|$|Agenda 21 {{explicitly}} {{recommends the}} use of existing planning experience when drawing up sustainable development strategies. Many local authorities {{all over the world}} have gained experience with so-called <b>green</b> <b>planning,</b> and <b>green</b> <b>plans</b> were already addressing the escalating environmental problems before the Earth Summit took place in 1992. According to the literature, the aspirations of Local Agenda 21 (LA 21, Chapter 28 of Agenda 21), particularly those concerning cross-sectoral integration and community involvement, are more ambitious than those of older types of environmental policy-making and planning. In this paper we relate these aspirations to past experiences of local <b>green</b> <b>planning,</b> touching upon the principle of subsidiarity. This leads to an examination of this older experience in relation to the constraints on effective cross-sectoral integration and public involvement at the lowest level of government. Since the publication of the first National Environmental Policy Plan on 25 May 1989, the Netherlands has been viewed worldwide as a successful pioneer in the field of <b>green</b> <b>planning.</b> The Dutch system of <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> contains very specific ideas about cross-sectoral integration and community involvement, making the experiences gained with local <b>green</b> <b>planning</b> an interesting source of material for investigating the constraints on cross-sectoral integration and public involvement at the lowest level of government...|$|R

[...] Republican candidate for county prothonotary, Howard Reed, called the <b>Green</b> <b>plan</b> {{the first step to}} eventual total annexation of the county by Philadelphia.

It closed in 1848 and was used as a corn mill from 1886. The building is in a poor state of repair, and on the Buildings at Risk Register. The mill house is a Grade II Listed building, and housed a restaurant for a time, but is now empty. Soon the river splits, the northern channel dropping down, while the southern artificial channel maintains its level as it supplied the first of two mills at Cuckney. There have been mills here for several centuries, for a cotton mill was destroyed by fire in 1792. A lake called Cuckney Dam, covering , provided the water to power its replacement, which ceased operation on 12 July 1844. After the machinery had been removed, the Duke of Portland turned the building into a National School. The mill is now part of Cuckney Primary School, and its weir and sluices have been retained. The drop in level of some [...] between the mill pond and the river beyond has enabled the school to harness the river to generate electricity. Its 7kW crossflow turbine generating a significant proportion of the energy used by the school, was funded by a grant from Powergen's <b>Green</b> <b>Plan</b> fund and a Clear Skies grant.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years, landscape-scale <b>green</b> {{infrastructure}} <b>planning</b> {{has emerged as a}} way to support green spaces that provide ecosystem services and to revalue them in the planning and land development process. Despite the growth, there is little empirical research on the specific strategies that comprise local government <b>green</b> infrastructure <b>planning</b> and their success in supporting three important aspects of green space networks: size/shape, quality, and connectivity. This research fills that gap by examining how county planning agencies carry out <b>green</b> infrastructure <b>planning</b> and the effectiveness of county strategies in retaining, preserving, and connecting green space over time. The mixed-methods approach uses interviews and document review to create a framework for <b>green</b> infrastructure <b>planning</b> followed by remote sensing, GIS analysis, and a landscape ecology-oriented spatial analysis program (FRAGSTATS) to assess on-the-ground change in green space networks between 2000 and 2010. Results show that counties that incorporate many <b>green</b> infrastructure <b>planning</b> policies and strategies are more successful in retaining green space acreage, quality, and connections over time than those that use fewer. The facets of <b>green</b> infrastructure <b>planning</b> with the greatest potential impact on green space results are connectivity and growth management. The outcome suggests that counties interested in supporting green space networks should focus on policies specifically designed to support connectivity - such as purchasing land and development rights to create large contiguous blocks of protected forestland - and strategies oriented toward bounding growth, such as urban growth boundaries and restrictive rural zoning. ...|$|R
