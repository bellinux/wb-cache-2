5|$|A {{number of}} films {{have been made}} about Emdens wartime <b>exploits,</b> {{including}} the 1915 movies How We Beat the Emden and How We Fought the Emden and the 1928 The <b>Exploits</b> of the Emden, all produced in Australia. German films include the 1926 silent film Unsere Emden, footage from which was incorporated in Kreuzer Emden of 1932, and Heldentum und Todeskampf unserer Emden, produced in 1934. All three films were directed by Louis Ralph. More recently, in 2012, Die Männer der Emden (The men of the Emden) was released, which was made about how the crew of Emden made {{their way back to}} Germany after the Battle of Cocos.|$|E

5|$|Drummond is a First World War veteran, brutalised by his {{experiences}} in the trenches and bored with his post-war lifestyle. He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure, and soon finds himself embroiled {{in a series of}} <b>exploits,</b> many of which involve Carl Peterson—who becomes his nemesis—and Peterson's mistress, the femme fatale Irma. After his first adventure Drummond marries his client, Phyllis Benton; in later episodes she becomes involved in Drummond's <b>exploits,</b> often as the victim of kidnapping by Drummond's enemies.|$|E

50|$|The {{first public}} homebrew <b>exploit,</b> ninjhax (developed by smealum), allows {{the user to}} scan a QR Code to <b>exploit</b> the game Cubic Ninja. Other ways to run the Homebrew Launcher are fairly numerous, {{including}} freakyhax, an <b>exploit</b> in the Deluxe edition of Freakyforms: Your Creations, Alive!, Doodlebomb, an <b>exploit</b> in the 1.1.1 and older versions of Swapdoodle, and smashbroshax, a New 3DS exclusive <b>exploit</b> for the 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|R
50|$|Tools of the TradeA hacker has {{a certain}} set of tools {{that he needs to}} help him when <b>exploiting.</b> An <b>exploit</b> script is a tool in which uses already written <b>exploit</b> code to find holes in the system or program. Using <b>exploit</b> scripts is easy for even a non-hacker to use because the code is already written in it. A couple exams of some <b>exploit</b> tools are shown in the book and how to use them.|$|R
5000|$|On July 27, 2015, Jordan [...] "Smealum" [...] Rabet, the {{developer}} of the Cubic Ninja <b>exploit,</b> {{announced a new}} version of the homebrew <b>exploit,</b> with the same features. On July 31, Rabet confirmed that the game the <b>exploit</b> was found in was IronFall: Invasion. On August 11, Nintendo temporarily delisted the game off the Nintendo eShop, as to prevent the <b>exploit</b> from spreading further. Six days later, Rabet released his <b>exploit.</b> On October 13, IronFall: Invasion returned to the eShop with [...] "Update Data", which prevents the <b>exploit</b> from being used. As of January 15, 2016, the <b>exploit</b> has been patched on system menu 10.4.0-29 which released the same day. When trying to load the game, the system does not allow users to launch the title until the software is updated, forcing users to download the patch, rendering the <b>exploit</b> unusable even if the older version of the game is available.|$|R

Cochrane is replaced in the book by the fictional Jack Aubrey, who repeats many of Cochrane's real-life <b>exploits</b> including the defence of a convoy and the recapture of one of its merchants from a privateer, and the capture of a large Spanish frigate, based on the Gamo, but renamed Cacafuego for the novel.|$|E

50|$|Although {{originally}} released for the Verizon Galaxy S5, {{the root}} <b>exploit</b> was made compatible with most Android devices available at that time. For example, it was tested {{and found to}} work with the AT&T Galaxy S5, Nexus 5, and Galaxy S4 Active. Updates continued to be applied to the root <b>exploit</b> to increase its capabilities with other devices running Android. Updates to the Android operating system closed the source of the <b>exploit.</b> Samsung officially responded to the towelroot <b>exploit</b> by releasing updated software designed to be immune from the <b>exploit.</b>|$|R

50|$|JIT {{spraying}} is a {{class of}} computer security <b>exploit</b> that circumvents the protection of address space layout randomization (ASLR) and data execution prevention (DEP) by <b>exploiting</b> the behavior of just-in-time compilation.

50|$|The {{drawback}} of this <b>exploit</b> is that {{it needs}} to be installed/compiled on each individual memory card. Simply copying the <b>exploit</b> is not possible; this means that an already modded or <b>exploited</b> system is required to install FMCB on a Memory Card.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drive-by {{downloads}} are {{the preferred}} distribution vector for many malware families. In the drive-by ecosystem many <b>exploit</b> servers run the same <b>exploit</b> kit {{and it is}} a challenge understanding whether the <b>exploit</b> server {{is part of a larger}} operation. In this paper we propose a technique to identify <b>exploit</b> servers managed by the same organization. We collect over time how <b>exploit</b> servers are configured and what malware they distribute, grouping servers with similar con-figurations into operations. Our operational analysis reveals that although indi-vidual <b>exploit</b> servers have a median lifetime of 16 hours, long-lived operations exist that operate for several months. To sustain long-lived operations miscre-ants are turning to the cloud, with 60 % of the <b>exploit</b> servers hosted by special-ized cloud hosting services. We also observe operations that distribute multiple malware families and that pay-per-install affiliate programs are managing <b>exploit</b> servers for their affiliates to convert traffic into installations. To understand how difficult is to take down <b>exploit</b> servers, we analyze the abuse reporting process and issue abuse reports for 19 long-lived servers. We describe the interaction with ISPs and hosting providers and monitor the result of the report. We find that 61 % of the reports are not even acknowledged. On average an <b>exploit</b> server still lives for 4. 3 days after a report. ...|$|R

50|$|Out of the 10 billion plus web pages, {{there are}} many {{legitimate}} sites that do not use <b>exploit</b> browser vulnerabilities, and to start crawling from most of these sites {{would be a waste}} of resources. An initial list was therefore manually created that listed sites known to use browser vulnerabilities to compromise visiting systems with malware. The HoneyMonkey system then follows links from <b>exploit</b> sites, as they had higher probability of leading to other <b>exploit</b> sites. The HoneyMonkey system also records how many links point to an <b>exploit</b> site thereby giving a statistical indication of how easily an <b>exploit</b> site is reached.|$|R
