5|$|Nigella Lucy Lawson (born 6 January 1960) is an English journalist, broadcaster, {{television}} personality, gourmet, {{and food}} writer. She {{is the daughter}} of Nigel Lawson, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Vanessa (née Salmon) Lawson, whose family owned the J. Lyons and Co. food and catering business. After graduating from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford University, Lawson started work as a book reviewer and restaurant critic, later becoming the deputy literary editor of The Sunday Times in 1986. She then embarked upon a career as a freelance journalist, writing for a number of newspapers and magazines. In 1998, she brought out her first cookery book, <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Eat,</b> which sold 300,000 copies and became a best-seller. She wrote her second book in 2000, How to Be a Domestic Goddess, which won her the British Book Award for Author of the Year.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with critiques ranging from largely positive to very negative. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club gave the episode a slightly positive review {{and gave it}} a B- rating. He wrote, [...] "The Office is far from a profound show when it just throws its characters in a room and observes their behavior, but there’s a certain charm to it." [...] McNutt noted that, despite feeling that the episode's description of [...] "Darryl teaches Nellie <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a taco" [...] was a poor move on NBC's part, he thought they [...] "could have spent more time with Nellie learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a taco." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote positively of the episode, noting, [...] "For the first time in forever this is an episode of The Office that actually has a lot going on. Whether the stuff that’s happening is actually meaningful or significant in any way is up for debate, but I actually enjoyed most of this episode." ...|$|E

500|$|After leaving {{school at}} 16, {{he decided to}} be a painter and began {{training}} in commercial illustration at Saint Martin's School of Art. While attending a rehearsal for a workshop at the Oval House, a fire eater was teaching people <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> fire {{and he decided to}} join. A circus agent saw him busking and hired him for three years. He later trained for three years as an actor at the Drama Centre London. Brosnan has described the feeling of becoming an actor and the impact it had on his life: [...] "When I found acting, or when acting found me, it was a liberation. It was a stepping stone into another life, away from a life that I had, and acting was something I was good at, something which was appreciated. That was a great satisfaction in my life." ...|$|E

500|$|Dishes served {{included}} the favourite pigeon, served with foie gras, wrapped in cabbage {{and served with}} a potato purée. Another popular dish was lobster grilled and served with truffle butter. White also brought dishes from his previous restaurant as well, including his Koffman inspired pig's trotter, served with sweetbreads and Périgueux sauce (a white wine and truffle sauce). The menu itself {{was accompanied by a}} quote from Salvador Dali, [...] "At six I wanted to be a cook, at seven Napoleon and my ambition has been growing steadily ever since." [...] The dessert menu featured a quote from French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, [...] "To know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> well, one must first learn how to wait." [...] These quotes were later spoofed on menus in his other restaurants. Another element featured on The Restaurant menus, were the years of the creation of each dish.|$|E
500|$|Its successor, How to be a Domestic Goddess (2000), focuses {{primarily}} on baking. Of this second bestseller, The Times wrote of Lawson's book, that it [...] "is defined by its intimate, companionable approach. She is not issuing matronly instructions like Delia; she is merely making sisterly suggestions". Lawson rejected feminist criticism of her book, adding that [...] "ome people did take the domestic goddess title literally rather than ironically. It {{was about the}} pleasures of feeling like one rather than actually being one." [...] The book sold 180,000 copies in four months, and won Lawson the title of Author of the Year at the British Book Awards in 2001, fending off competition from authors such as J. K. Rowling. <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Eat</b> and How to be a Domestic Goddess {{were published in the}} U.S. in 2000 and 2001. As a result of the book's success, The Observer took her on as a social affairs columnist.|$|E
500|$|It {{had first}} been {{thought that the}} dwarfs would be {{the main focus of}} the story, and many {{sequences}} were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, would have shown the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a [...] "lodge meeting" [...] in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).|$|E

[...] Some of this variation {{may be the result}} of [...] "environmental shaping" [...] (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> insects.
