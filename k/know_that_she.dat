Felicia, whose plan was foiled when she was pulled over by a police officer for speeding, is now incarcerated and swears that Paul will be dead within six months.|$|E
5|$|Patty Hearst guest {{stars in}} the episode, {{something}} that was planned since July 2006. Hearst did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would be appearing on the show until after she was chosen {{due to a lack}} of communication between her and her agent. She was reluctant to appear as a character similar to herself, but she eventually agreed. In addition, Hearst's character was initially scheduled to have a lesbian kiss with Keri Lynn Pratt's character, but the scene was vetoed by the network for unknown reasons.|$|E

5|$|In 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is {{not known}} what the boy's name was, but he died in {{childhood}} in 83. Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of Augusta upon Domitia, while their son was deified, appearing as such on the reverse of coin types from this period. Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly exiled Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia. Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir. By 84, Domitia {{had returned to the}} palace, where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident. Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> at least accompanied the Emperor to the amphitheatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her. It {{is not known}} whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again. Despite allegations by Roman sources of adultery and divorce, the marriage appears to have been happy.|$|E
5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have a meltdown leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

From Suetonius, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> at least accompanied the Emperor to the theatre, while the Jewish writer Josephus speaks of benefits he received from her.

25|$|Vivian Alvarez Solon (born 30 October 1962) is an Australian who was unlawfully {{removed to}} the Philippines by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) in July 2001.

Solon's family had listed her as a missing person since July 2003, and until May 2005, did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been deported.

25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creatingâ€“in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We never learn {{anything}} about her husband, but we do <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them {{by the events of}} Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E
25|$|By chance, at a {{reception}} Asad met Pola, an American of Polish origin who {{was destined to}} become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He {{fell in love with}} her and when he came to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-Pakistani national. He applied through the proper channels but the Governor-General rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he sat down and wrote his extraordinary The Road to Mecca.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Bournonville {{decided to}} compose {{his own version}} of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an {{engraving}} from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation {{in the same way as}} the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.|$|E

25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley.

As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate. They also discuss Bianca's secret that she is pregnant with Zach's child via sperm donation, and Bianca's new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor.

25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that heâ€™s happy just to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them itâ€™s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with white hair and a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E

25|$|On December 23, 2005, it {{is shown}} (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the {{automobile}} accident that {{was thought to}} have claimed her life {{while she was in}} Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he can see her. Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal {{the fact that she is}} still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden.|$|E
