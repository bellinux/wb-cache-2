5|$|On the mainland, SR 160 {{once again}} runs atop the east levee, now 1–2 miles (1.5–3km) west of Interstate 5. The final {{bridge over the}} river is the <b>Freeport</b> Bridge, which carries County Route E9 to the west levee, where it turns south to return to SR 160 at {{the west end of}} the Paintersville Bridge. About a mile (1.5km) beyond the <b>Freeport</b> Bridge, SR 160 leaves the levee, enters the city of Sacramento (where state {{maintenance}} and control ends), passes under I-5, and farms give way to suburbs. Here the former SR 160 is known as <b>Freeport</b> Boulevard, a major surface road that passes the Sacramento Executive Airport and Sacramento City College. <b>Freeport</b> Boulevard turns to the northwest at about 4th Avenue. It was formerly a one-way pair with 21st Street with <b>Freeport</b> heading one-way southbound and 21st heading one-way northbound. The city converted these streets back to two-way streets for traffic calming purposes in 2008. After a short jog west on Broadway, former SR 160 turns north on the one-way pair of 15th (southbound) and 16th (northbound) Streets, almost immediately crossing Business 80 and entering downtown Sacramento.|$|E
