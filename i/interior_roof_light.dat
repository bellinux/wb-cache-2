40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{techniques in}} {{the built environment}} offer {{some of the most}} economical methods of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This dissertation examines some of the options for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the operation of a retail warehouse building in the Sydney climate. The research was undertaken using DesignBuilder, EnergyPlus, Ecotect and Radiance software packages to simulate variations of a model with the ultimate goal of achieving a net-zero energy building. The research was divided into two main sections. In the first section, some techniques {{that can be used to}} increase the energy efficiency of a retail warehouse building were explored with the aim of reducing the energy use to close to a minimum level. The techniques examined include increased insulation, improved <b>roof</b> <b>lighting,</b> the use of natural ventilation and the use of efficient artificial lighting. When compared to the base case building, savings of up to 73 % of the annual energy use were achieved using these relatively simple techniques. The second section examines the effect of changes made to the regulation of <b>roof</b> <b>lights</b> as specified in Section J of the 2010 version of the Building Code of Australia (BCA) which provides the mandatory minimum building standards for all Australian commercial buildings. A base case model was simulated with various <b>roof</b> <b>lighting</b> options to determine the effect of recent changes to these regulations. Additionally, the size of a photovoltaic array large enough to provide an annual output of energy equal to the annual energy consumption of the building, was calculated for each of these models, effectively making them zero energy buildings. The difference in the capital expenditure for these zero energy models were compared and it was found that for this particular building, the changes made in the 2010 version of the BCA resulted in a less efficient and more expensive building. It is concluded that the changes have focused on improving the heat transfer properties of the <b>roof</b> <b>lights</b> to the detriment of the daylight penetration properties. To ensure the next generation of buildings are more energy efficient, consideration needs to be given to both the thermal and the daylight properties of <b>roof</b> <b>light</b> materials...|$|R

It incorporates acoustical laminated glass, triple door seals, a five-layer <b>interior</b> <b>roof</b> liner, sound absorbing mats, recycled denim insulation and specially manufactured 18-inch forged alloy wheels, which minimize road noise. Buick's VentiPorts reappeared at the Verano's introduction, a styling feature unique to Buick dating back to 1949.|$|R
