500|$|Although vocals {{would usually}} take many {{alternate}} takes to complete, Hoppus completed {{much of the}} vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. [...] "It's in a pretty high register for me, so I just blasted it out one night after dinner. That's, like, 90 per cent of what's on the final track," [...] he told Kerrang!. The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought; [...] "We realized, 'Well, this part here could sound rad <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> piano in here.' So we tried it out, and it sounded rad," [...] said Hoppus. The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., {{best known for his}} work with Beck.|$|E
500|$|Consequently, {{there was}} a demand for bootleg {{recordings}} of the band. The most notorious of these was an LP entitled H Bomb, recorded at Aachen on 11 July 1970, {{which led to a}} subsequent court case when Virgin Records' Richard Branson was prosecuted for selling it. An article in Melody Maker that examined the bootleg phenomenon claimed that H Bomb was the best selling one at that time. This success, along with albums from other artists such as the Who's Live at Leeds and the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out convinced the band that an official live album would be commercially successful. [...] At the time, Glover told Sounds magazine that [...] "there are so many bootlegs of us going around, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> out our own live set, it should kill their market." ...|$|E

500|$|Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston {{gave him}} a video of the tepui {{mountains}} of Canaima National Park; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is so far out, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> it in the movie you wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design {{because they had to}} fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature.|$|E
500|$|Fodor {{responds}} {{to this problem}} with what he defines as [...] "a slightly less crude causal theory". According to this approach, {{it is necessary to}} break the symmetry {{at the base of the}} crude causal theory. Fodor must find some criterion for distinguishing the occurrences of A caused by As (true) from those caused by Bs (false). The point of departure, according to Fodor, is that while the false cases are ontologically dependent on the true cases, the reverse is not true. There is an asymmetry of dependence, in other words, between the true contents (A= A) and the false ones (A = A or B). The first can subsist independently of the second, but the second can occur only because of the existence of the first:From the point of view of semantics, errors must be accidents: if in the extension of [...] "horse" [...] there are no cows, then it cannot be required for the meaning of [...] "horse" [...] that cows be called horses. On the other hand, if [...] "horse" [...] did not mean that which it means, and if it were an error for horses, it would never be possible for a cow to be called [...] "horse". Putting the two things together, it can be seen that the possibility of falsely saying [...] "this is a horse" [...] presupposes the existence of a semantic basis for saying it truly, but not vice versa. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> this in terms of the crude causal theory, the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] depends on the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse"; but the fact that horses cause one to say [...] "horse" [...] does not depend on the fact that cows cause one to say [...] "horse"...|$|E

Criticising the decision Belhaj was quoted as saying that [...] "I went through a secret trial once before, in Gaddafi’s Libya. It took about a half hour, and I never saw any of the evidence against me.

2500|$|Note {{that not}} every {{continuous}} function on the boundary {{can be used to}} produce a function inside the boundary that fits the given boundary function. For instance, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> the function, defined for |z|=1, [...] into the Cauchy integral formula, we get zero for all points inside the circle. In fact, giving just the real part on the boundary of a holomorphic function is enough to determine the function up to an imaginary constant – there is only one imaginary part on the boundary that corresponds to the given real part, up to addition of a constant. We can use a combination of a Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes inversion formula to construct the holomorphic function from the real part on the boundary. For example, the function [...] has real part [...] On the unit circle this can be written [...] Using the Möbius transformation and the Stieltjes formula we construct the function inside the circle. The i/z term makes no contribution, and we find the function [...] This has the correct real part on the boundary, and also gives us the corresponding imaginary part, but off by a constant, namely i.|$|E
