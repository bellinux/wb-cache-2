40|$|International audienceThe {{remote sensing}} {{constitutes}} a vast {{field of study}} whose repercussions are many and varied on environmental management. The phenomenon of <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> is a major climatic event in Africa. But the observation means of this phenomenon are still too much limited. The development of an approach consisting in the detection of <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> from satellite images can be a solution. In this work, we present a new approach for <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> detection in the infrared images coming from the METEOSAT satellite. It is then proved necessary of finding automatic or semi-automatic analysis methods to assist their detection and interpretation. Thus {{we are interested in}} image fusion methods for detection structures in the images. In this paper, we present some statistical methods which enable to extract texture features from the images. Then, we describe the method used for selection the best attributes for the images segmentation into three classes: “water clouds”, “ocean” and “continent”. We then use a method which enable us to segment the class “continent” of the image for <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> detection. Finally, we compare our results with another one which shows the zone of presence or absence of <b>dust</b> <b>clouds.</b> This comparison shows that we are in concord because visually, we have a good analogy of shape on the <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> zone {{as well as on the}} part without <b>dust</b> <b>clouds...</b>|$|R

5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> before picking him up. The <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E
5|$|A white dwarf's stellar and {{planetary}} system is inherited from its progenitor star and may {{interact with the}} white dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope of the central star of the Helix Nebula suggest {{the presence of a}} <b>dust</b> <b>cloud,</b> which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the central star. Similarly, observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> around the young white dwarf G29-38 (estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago), which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf. Some estimations based on the metal content of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15% of them may be orbited by planets and/or asteroids, or at least their debris. Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets, that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and, given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals, to attempt to detect them looking for the signatures of their interaction with the white dwarf's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{and during}} the Martian global dust storms in 1977, local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> were {{identified}} from thermal observations. Local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> appear up to 40 K cooler than the surrounding region in the daytime and appear warm at night. In contrast to their well-developed and consistent thermal signatures, local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> exhibited little albedo contrast. Multiple observations of the same areas show that local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> form and dissipate {{in a few days}} or less, and clouds were observed to move with velocities of from 14 to at least 32 m/sec. Local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> are common along the receding edge of the south polar cap (observed primarily for orbiter imaging) and in the restricted area - 10 deg to - 30 deg, 80 deg to 125 deg W (observed primarily by the infrared thermal mapper); several of the latter occurred over a ridge in Claritas Fossae, indicating strong topographic control. In their active growing stage, local <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> are probably about 8 km high and have relatively abrupt tops. The accumulation of <b>dust</b> from local <b>clouds</b> reached similar levels immediately prior to both global storms, supporting the hypothesis that such dust accumulations are responsible for triggering the global dust storms...|$|R

40|$|BAM furnace {{apparatus}} {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the minimum ignition temperature of coal dusts (MITC) in O 2 /CO 2 atmospheres with an O 2 mole fraction from 20 to 50 %. Three coal dusts: Indonesian Sebuku coal, Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and South African coal were tested. Experimental {{results showed that the}} dust explosion risk increases significantly with increasing O 2 mole fraction by reducing the minimum ignition temperature for the three tested coal <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> dramatically (even by 100 °C). Compared with conventional combustion, the inhibiting effect of CO 2 was found to be comparatively large in <b>dust</b> <b>clouds,</b> particularly for the coal dusts with high volatile content. The retardation effect of the moisture content on the ignition of <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> was also found to be pronounced. In addition, a modified steady-state mathematical model based on heterogeneous reaction was proposed to interpret the observed experimental phenomena and to estimate the ignition mechanism of coal <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> under minimum ignition temperature conditions. The analysis revealed that heterogeneous ignition dominates the ignition mechanism for sub-/bituminous coal dusts under minimum ignition temperature conditions, but the decrease of coal maturity facilitates homogeneous ignition. These results improve our understanding of the ignition behaviour and the explosion risk of coal <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> in oxy-fuel combustion atmospheres. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright <b>dust</b> <b>cloud,</b> obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that effects related to either electrostatic charging or discharging might be able to account for some of the transient lunar phenomena. One possibility is that electrodynamic effects related to the fracturing of near-surface materials could charge any gases that might be present, such as implanted solar wind or radiogenic daughter products. If this were to occur at the surface, the subsequent discharge from this gas might be able to give rise to phenomena visible from Earth. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the triboelectric charging of particles within a gas-borne <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> could give rise to electrostatic discharges visible from Earth. Finally, electrostatic levitation of dust near the terminator could potentially give rise to some form of phenomenon visible from Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{cluster is}} {{dominated}} by hot blue and extremely luminous stars that have formed within the last 100 million years.

Computer simulations have shown that the Pleiades were probably formed from a compact configuration that resembled the Orion Nebula. Astronomers estimate that the cluster will survive for about another 250 million years, after which it will disperse due to gravitational interactions with its galactic neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> exists {{around the}} Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust above the Moon. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would take at least ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} considered using {{a hydrogen}} bomb for the project, but the United States Air Force vetoed this idea {{due to the}} weight of such a device, {{as it would be}} too heavy to be propelled by the missile which would have been used. It was then decided to use a W25 warhead, a small, lightweight warhead with a relatively low 1.7 kiloton yield. By contrast, the Little Boy bomb dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945 had a yield of some 13–18 kilotons. The W25 would be carried by a rocket toward the hidden side of the Moon, near the terminator, where it would detonate on impact. The <b>dust</b> <b>cloud</b> resulting from the explosion would be lit by the Sun and therefore visible from Earth. According to Reiffel, the Air Force's progress in the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles would have made such a launch feasible by 1959.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Dust</b> <b>clouds</b> {{originating}} from deserts of Africa are carried by wind {{and lead to}} the deterioration of air quality seasonally. In this study, the effect of <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> on outdoor air quailty {{and its impact on}} the concentration of ambient air particulate matter (PM 10) were investigated in Ankara. Method: The ambient air particulate matter parameter was analyzed in the samples collected from the measurement stations of Ankara Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency Environmental Health Research Department Air Quality Control and Research Laboratory. Pollutants in ambient air as particulate matter in 10 μm diameter (PM 10) were measured by MP 101 M model PM 10 analyzers produced by Environment S. A companies based were used. Results: The relationship between desert dusts falling over the city today and hourly variation of PM 10 concentration and meteorological data belonging to the dates January 14 - 15, 2009 and March 11 - 12, 2010 were studied. Results of this study showed that <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> substantially reduced ambient air quality. Conclusion: Ambient air quailty was impaired on the days that <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> were present and significantly affect human health and cause economic damage. Reasonable precautions should be taken before the desert <b>dust</b> <b>clouds</b> appear by local authorities and even individiuals to ensure the public health protection in countries that are affected by dust transportation, like Turkey.
