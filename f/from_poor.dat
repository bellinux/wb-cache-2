5|$|Aston {{commented that}} {{throughout}} his life he suffered <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who {{had gone through the}} same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> support: no compilers completely {{supported the}} standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the abolition of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E

In the used car market, BA Falcons tend to suffer <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> depreciation rates, due to influxes of ex-fleet models entering the second-hand market {{and because of the}} cost of fuel.|$|E

5|$|From early childhood, Johnson {{suffered}} <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> eyesight, {{especially in}} his left eye, which interfered with his education.

5|$|Nitrogen analogues of the Nazarov {{cyclization}} reaction (known as imino-Nazarov cyclization reactions) {{have few}} instances; {{there is one}} example of a generalized imino-Nazarov cyclization reported (shown below), and several iso-imino-Nazarov reactions in the literature. Even these tend to suffer <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> stereoselectivity, poor yields, or narrow scope. The difficulty stems from the relative over-stabilization of the pentadienyl cation by electron donation, impeding cyclization.|$|E

The centre's clock tower is the only visible section from the old building.

Areas of the building, particularly the council chambers, continue to suffer <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> acoustics.|$|E
50|$|Although the Bill {{removes the}} need to pay fees up front - meaning that {{students}} may have more spending money while studying - it will still leave them with a greater debt {{at the start of}} their careers. While it was predicted that people <b>from</b> <b>poorer</b> backgrounds may be put off from enrolling for a degree because of the measure, the number of young people engaged in higher education has actually risen, most markedly in those coming <b>from</b> <b>poorer</b> backgrounds.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the war, Kathleen Verity began to suffer <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> health, and the family planned a trip to South Africa in the English winter of 1939 to aid her recovery and so Verity could take up one of several offers of a coaching job.

5|$|Young Gaudí {{suffered}} <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> health, including rheumatism, {{which may}} have contributed to his reticent and reserved character. These health concerns and the hygienist theories of Dr. Kneipp contributed to Gaudí's decision to adopt vegetarianism early in his life. His religious faith and strict vegetarianism led him to undertake several lengthy and severe fasts. These fasts were often unhealthy and occasionally, as in 1894, led to life-threatening illness.|$|E
5|$|Ōkami {{was one of}} {{the last}} PlayStation 2 games {{selected}} for release prior to the release of the PlayStation 3.

Mainstream adoption of the game has improved with age, and Ōkami is now considered to be one of the best video games ever made, as well as a prime example of artistic expression in video games.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mort {{established}} a grammar school by the chapel in 1631 {{which was in}} use until 1833. Children <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> families were admitted free and those who could afford to pay covered the costs. Mort's School closed in 1894. In 1832 children were taught in a barn at the vicarage, the curate, Alfred Hewlett, improved it and the chapel {{was used as a}} classroom. A national school built by subscription on land donated by Captain Durie of Damhouse opened in November 1841. Meanleys Infant School was opened at Gin Pit in 1904 to serve the mining community that had grown up by there. Other schools were built at Ellesmere Street and Marsland Green.|$|E

40|$|Children <b>from</b> <b>poorer</b> {{backgrounds}} {{are generally}} observed {{to have lower}} educational outcomes than other youth. However, the mechanism through which household income affects the child's outcomes remains unclear. Either, poorer families are financially constrained or some characteristics of the family make the children less likely to participate in post-compulsory education. We propose a methodology that separates financial and familial effects. As in previous studies, we find that pupils <b>from</b> <b>poorer</b> families {{are less likely to}} invest in education. However, a financial transfer would not lead to a significant increase in schooling investment, which supports the view that the family characteristic effects dominate the financial constraint effects. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E
5|$|Carey's fifth studio album Butterfly, and the {{compilation}} album, #1's, {{were both}} certified five-times Platinum in the US; the latter remains the best-selling album in Japan by a non-Asian artist, selling 3.25 million copies. Rainbow (1999), Carey's sixth studio effort, received triple platinum certification from RIAA. But {{it was her}} first album since Emotions to not reach {{number one in the}} US. Carey parted from Columbia/Sony Music in 2001 and signed a contract with EMI's Virgin Records worth a reported US$100 million, the largest record contract ever signed. She released her next album, Glitter, which was the soundtrack to the film of same name. The album suffered <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> publicity and became a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|Catalytic {{reagents}} {{have been}} less successful, with most variations suffering <b>from</b> <b>poor</b> yield, poor enantioselectivity, or both. There are also issues with substrate scope, most having limitations with methylene transfer and aliphatic aldehydes. The trouble stems from {{the need for a}} nucleophilic sulfide that efficiently generates the ylide which can also act as a good leaving group to form the epoxide. Since the factors underlying these desiderata are at odds, tuning of the catalyst properties has proven difficult. Shown below are several of the most successful catalysts along with the yields and enantiomeric excess for their use in synthesis of (E)-stilbene oxide.|$|E
