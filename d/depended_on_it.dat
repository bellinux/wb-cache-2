5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others.|$|E
5|$|Another side {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued in a slightly modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E

25|$|Further {{consequences}} {{can occur}} in cases when the on-field decision has been overturned. For example, the batsman is given out LBW, but the ball runs away off his pads, for what would be 4 leg-byes that win the game. The bowling side {{is thought to have}} won. The review adjudges the bowler to have overstepped. The batting team are awarded only a 1 run penalty for the no ball, and an extra ball or free hit, but fail to score off it, and the bowling side still win, even though the batting side would have won if the umpire's decision had matched the video evidence discovered, although perhaps the fielding side might have tried harder to save the 4 leg byes had they known the match <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> For such complications and other reasons, including concern to control the amount of time used in review, the ICC is experimenting with 'no ball instant notification,' under which the umpire is immediately given the additional information to call no ball while the ball is still live.|$|E

500|$|In {{a country}} where surveys of the {{religious}} composition at the time estimated the Buddhist majority to be between 70 and 90 percent, President Diệm {{was a member of}} the Catholic minority, and pursued discriminatory policies favoring Catholics for public service and military promotions, as well as in the allocation of land, business arrangements and tax concessions.

500|$|A second survey {{carried out}} by the king's commissioners, Thomas Legh and Richard Leyton, {{provided}} for the final suppression on charges of a lack of quality of religious life. Prior James Cockerell of Guisborough was forced to resign and was replaced by Robert Pursglove, who was loyal to the king. The priory's dissolution was not welcomed by locals, who derived economic benefit from its presence – in 1536, around 500 families <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for their livelihood. The strength of feeling was recorded in a letter from Lord Conyers and Sir John Bulmer to Thomas Cromwell: [...] "On Sunday, 11th July , at Gysburn in Yorkshire, when the parish priest was declaring the articles [...] directed by the King to the Archbishop of York, one John Atkeynson alias Brotton came violently and took book forth of the priest's hands, and pulled it in pieces." [...] Popular discontent sparked the Pilgrimage of Grace, in which Prior Cockerell was implicated. When the revolt failed, he was hanged at Tyburn with the Prior of Bridlington, the Abbot of Jervaulx and the former Abbot of Fountains.|$|E

500|$|In South Vietnam, {{where the}} Buddhist {{majority}} {{was estimated to}} comprise between 70 and 90 {{percent of the population}} in 1963, President Ngô Đình Diệm's pro-Catholic policies antagonized many Buddhists.

Diệm once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting the man was from a Buddhist background, [...] "Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted."

The Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and the [...] "private" [...] status that was imposed on Buddhism by the French, which required official permission to conduct public Buddhist activities, was not repealed by Diệm. Land owned by the Catholic Church was exempt from land reform measures. Catholics were also de facto exempt from the corvée labor that the government obliged all citizens to perform; U.S. aid was disproportionately distributed to Catholic majority villages. Under Diệm, the Catholic Church enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and in 1959, he dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at major public events in South Vietnam.|$|E
