5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). <b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the {{practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics {{who already had}} considerable freedom to practice in private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E
5|$|Farnese's attack {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of distracting the Dutch States forces from Maastricht. After the battle, the Spanish Army moved quickly to Turnhout, taking the castle of Grobbendonk on its way and appearing before Masstricht on 8 March, just six days after the battle of Borgerhout. François de la Noue followed the Spanish till Herentals with some troops, but {{when he realized that}} Farnese was to lay siege to Maastricht, {{it was too late for}} him to reinforce the city's garrison. Moreover, mutinies and defections hampered the Dutch efforts to save the city. The English soldiers under John Norrey's orders, who remained out of Antwerp, kidnapped the abbot of St. Michael's Abbey in demand for back pays, and William of Orange's had to mediate to placate them. <b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the battle increased the Walloon defections from the States General to the Spanish party in the following months. Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing joined the Spanish Army with 5,000 Walloon troops of the Dutch States army and expelled from Menen a garrison loyal to the States General.|$|E

25|$|While {{his father}} Constantijn had wished his son Christiaan to be a diplomat, {{it also was}} not to be. <b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> the First Stadtholderless Period that began in 1650 meant that the House of Orange was not in power, {{removing}} Constantijn's influence.

25|$|The American radical feminist group Redstockings were {{strongly}} opposed to lesbian separatism, seeing interpersonal relationships with men {{as an important}} arena of feminist struggle, and hence seeing separatism as escapist. Like many radical feminists of the time, Redstockings saw lesbianism primarily as a political identity rather than a fundamental part of personal identity, and therefore analyzed it primarily <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms.</b> Redstockings were also opposed to male homosexuality, which they saw as a deeply misogynistic rejection of women. Redstockings' line on {{gay men and lesbians}} is often criticized as homophobic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the {{emergence}} of a first autonomous Lebanese Emirate in the southern Mount Lebanon had important impacts in Jebbet Bsharri. <b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> it ended in 1621 the role of the Muqaddams of Bsharri as the traditional lords of the region being the official representatives of the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli. In economical terms, the southern Mount Lebanon under the stable rule of the Emir Fakhreddine attracted many families who were encouraged by the Emir to establish there. An important migration took place from Jebbet Bsharri to the south but also to Aleppo, Syria.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, Neptune is {{associated}} with sophistication, dreams, extravagance, artistry, and empathy, but with illusion and vagueness too. Its appearance coincided {{with the discovery of}} anesthetics and hypnotism. <b>In</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> Neptune was linked to the rise of nationalist movements throughout Europe in countries like Germany, Italy, Hungary, Ireland, and Serbia, seeking independence for their nations inspired by an idealized past of legend. It was also linked to the rise of socialism and the beginnings of the welfare state. Neptune coincided with the utopian ideals of Communism, when Marx and Engels first published 'The Communist Manifesto' in 1848. Neptune also represents the day of Friday, alongside Venus.|$|E
50|$|Although Cromwell always {{maintained}} a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars {{that at least}} while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the Henrician Reformation was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb.

50|$|A {{hereditary}} dictatorship, {{or family}} dictatorship, <b>in</b> <b>political</b> science <b>terms</b> a personalistic regime, {{is a form}} of dictatorship that occurs in a nominally or formally republican or socialist regime, but operates in practice like an absolute monarchy, <b>in</b> that <b>political</b> power passes within the dictator's family. Thus, although the key leader is often called president or prime minister rather than a king or emperor, power is transmitted between members of the same family due to the overwhelming authority of the leader.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the debate}} over {{contemporary}} Canadian identity is argued <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values. To the political philosopher Charles Blattberg, Canada should be conceived as a civic or political community, a community of citizens, one that contains many other kinds of communities within it. These include not only communities of ethnic, regional, religious, civic (the provincial and municipal governments) and civil associational sorts, but also national communities. Blattberg thus sees Canada as a multinational country and so asserts that it contains a number of nations within it. Aside from the various aboriginal First Nations, there is also the nation of francophone Quebecers, that of the anglophones who identify with English Canadian culture, and perhaps that of the Acadians.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Canadian identity was traditionally dominated by three fundamental themes: first, the often conflicted relations between English Canadians and French Canadians {{stemming from the}} French Canadian imperative for cultural and linguistic survival; secondly, the generally close ties between English Canadians and the British Empire, resulting in a gradual political process towards complete independence from the imperial power; and finally, the close proximity of English-speaking Canadians to the United States. In the 20th century, immigrants from African, Caribbean and Asian nationalities have shaped the Canadian identity, a process that continues today with the ongoing arrival {{of large numbers of}} immigrants from non-British or non-French backgrounds, adding the theme of multiculturalism to the debate. Much of the debate over contemporary Canadian identity is argued <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms,</b> and defines Canada as a country defined by its government policies, which are thought to reflect deeper cultural values.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, Konstantin's father Tsar Nicholas I {{made him}} General-Admiral of the Imperial Navy {{and head of}} the Department of the Imperial navy. In this position, {{he was in charge of}} {{reforming}} a navy that had largely remained unchanged since the time of Peter the Great. It fell upon Konstantin to not only preside over an archaic fleet but also to see it through the disaster of the Crimean War. In the midst of the conflict, his father died and Konstantin advised his brother to search for peace in a war already lost. In early 1856, he accompanied his brother Alexander II to the Crimea to view first-hand the devastation of the War. These early military experiences gave Konstantin a loathing of army life and the futility of war. From then on, he was a man of peace, despite his keen interest in the navy, and <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> a progressive. There was a close working relationship between the two brothers, which was responsible for many reforms. Konstantin was also sent on a diplomatic mission to Napoleon III.|$|E

500|$|Monteverdi {{is usually}} {{described}} as an [...] "Italian" [...] composer, even though in his lifetime the concept of [...] "Italy" [...] existed only as a geographical entity. Although {{the inhabitants of the}} peninsula shared much in common in terms of history, culture and language, <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> the people experienced various layers of (mostly foreign) authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families such as the Gonzagas and the Medicis.

500|$|She summoned {{church leaders}} {{from both sides}} to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the {{resulting}} Colloquy of Poissy ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission. Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms.</b> In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, [...] "she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well {{if only she could}} get the party leaders to agree". In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant Edict of Saint-Germain in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants. On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the Massacre of Vassy, the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at Vassy (Wassy), killing 74 and wounding 104. Guise, who called the massacre [...] "a regrettable accident", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the French Wars of Religion. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.|$|E
500|$|King Philip {{probably}} shadowed Richard's army, as {{the latter}} moved through the Loire Valley, in an attempt at constraining the Engish army's ability to manouevre. [...] However, Richard doubled-back on the French, in which pursuit [...] the English king's horse was killed. It remains uncertain whether, {{despite the fact that}} contemporaries described the encounter as a battle, the two forces ever made contact. It is possibe that the rear portion of the French force engaged with that of the English. However, as part of a war in which skirmishing was the usual form of encounter, Fréteval was no different, and, it has been said, it 'does not deserve the label of a battle.' In what was most likely an ambush by the English, Philip appears to have abandoned his baggage train in a wood as Richard approached, and escaped to a Saint-Hilaire chapel on Whitsun Eve. Philip's 'sudden departure', wrote historian John Gillingham, was 'the last straw for his troops, already demoralized by the threat to their supplies.' Richard proceeded to harry the retreating French soldiers, before entering Verneuil in triumph. The engagement at Fréteval has been described as 'a minor disaster' for the Philip, although probably more <b>in</b> <b>political</b> <b>terms</b> than military.|$|E
