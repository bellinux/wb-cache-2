6000|$|... "More am I," [...] he said, [...] "but I find I am dining {{with the}} Prime Minister at nine o'clock. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you may have}} some {{influence}} with her." ...|$|E
60|$|I think <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{had already}} begun it, in my poor way: but <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> now, whether or no.|$|R

60|$|Twilight was deepening. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enquire of {{him again}} the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Agreed," [...] said Paul; [...] "but now <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> our pork may be raw, {{and that}} we shall want fire to cook it. Have you got flint and steel in your pocket, Master Trench?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I cannot claim {{any great}} {{experience}} in life," [...] the Saw-Horse answered for himself. [...] "but I seem to learn very quickly, and often <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{know more than}} any of those around me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why, hang it, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> by {{the time}} we reach New York you Twichells will be invading Europe and once more we shall miss the connection. This is {{thoroughly}} exasperating. Aren't we ever going to meet again? ...|$|E

60|$|I reached London {{the next}} evening. Passing the theatre {{on my way}} <b>to</b> Queen's Square, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop my cab {{for a few minutes}} and look in.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, doctor; {{about your}} niece, you know: {{you must have}} views of some sort; that's of course. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> perhaps {{we are all in}} the dark together. If so, a little candid {{speaking}} between you and me may set it all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{probably}} shall if {{it comes}} off,' said Allen. 'I say, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we shall be weighing-in {{in a couple of}} minutes, and I haven't started to change yet. Good, I've not brought evening dress or somebody else's footer clothes, as usually happens on these festive occasions.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I answered, As you ask me, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{it might}} help Lord [...] Salisbury’s going on, were she to make {{reference}} to No. 2 of my [...] memorandum [the paragraph just quoted], {{and to say that}} in her [...] judgment he would be safe in receiving it in a spirit of trust.|$|E
60|$|I {{happened}} to want some fishing-tackle {{for the use}} of a guest, when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> search the old writing-desk already mentioned, in which I used to keep articles of that nature.|$|R

60|$|Having to-day written General Buell a letter, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send General Halleck {{a copy of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... “Always contrary, eh?” {{returned}} Uncle John, with a tolerant smile, {{for he was}} in no wise {{disturbed by}} this adverse criticism of his defunct sister—a criticism that in fact admitted little argument. “But <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the most peculiar thing about this name is that you three girls, who were once Aunt Jane’s nieces, are now Niece Jane’s aunts!” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{my table}} at St. James's Hall might be {{appropriately}} ornamented {{with a little}} holly next Tuesday. If the two front legs were entwined with it, for instance, and a border of it ran round {{the top of the}} fringe in front, with a little sprig by way of bouquet at each corner, it would present a seasonable appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Chelsford proposes {{for his own}} {{satisfaction}} to cross-examine you. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} probably tell him of your fancied disturbance of those papers in the safe, and of your little adventure with the Prince of Malors."

60|$|I {{asked this}} abruptly, because <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{at that moment}} that he and Peterkin should have been together.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{also should}} like to know. In another thirty hours I was to find out.|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I {{made a great}} {{mistake in}} not {{thinking}} to deliver a very bad German speech, every other sentence pieced out with English, at the Bayard Taylor banquet in New York. I think I could have made {{it one of the}} features of the occasion.)--[He used this plan at a gathering of the American students in Heidelberg, on July 4th, with great effect; so his idea was not wasted.] ...|$|E
60|$|Athwart {{all this}} tumult of my memory goes this queer figure of my unanticipated companion, so obsessed {{by himself and}} his own egotistical love that this sudden change to another world seems only a change of scene for his gnawing, uninvigorating passion. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she also must have an {{equivalent}} in Utopia, and then that idea and all ideas grow thin and vague, and are dissolved at last in {{the rising tide of}} sleep....|$|E
6000|$|That {{was their}} [...] "ideal" [...] game. As I have said, remembering that afternoon, I can sympathise with the University {{professor}} mourning {{the absence of}} University ideals in youth. Possibly at six my own ideal game may have been [...] "Mothers." [...] Looking back from the pile of birthdays upon which I now stand, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> very probably it was. But {{from the perspective of}} twelve, the reflection that there were beings in the world who could find recreation in such fooling saddened me.|$|E
60|$|She relapsed into silence. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that, having posted her {{thoroughly}} in my affairs, I {{was entitled}} to ask about hers.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I {{was in the}} {{presence}} of the aristocratic theory currently working as distinguished from my as yet unformulated intentions.|$|R
6000|$|Finally, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> such {{being my}} {{feeling about the}} matter, {{it may be useful}} to all of us if I ask you, [...] "What is yours? Do you think that the Christianity of the seventeenth century looks nobler and more {{attractive}} for such treatment of such a man?" [...] You will hardly reply that it does. But if it does not, may it not be well if all of you do what lies within your power to prevent the Christianity of the nineteenth century from repeating the scandal? ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{a growing}} estrangement between Iris and myself--and my jealousy doesn't {{altogether}} account for it. Sometimes, <b>it</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> we are thinking of what our future relations with Mountjoy are likely to be, and are ashamed to confess it to each other. Sometimes--and perhaps this second, and easiest, guess may be the right one--I am apt to conclude that we are only anxious about money matters. I am {{waiting for her to}} touch on the subject, and she is waiting for me; and there we are at a deadlock.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have seen}} papa, {{and he thinks}} {{that you ought to}} have [...] told him when I told you. <b>It</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> that would [...] have been a cruel thing to do, and most unfair to Mr. [...] Tregear, who was quite willing to go to papa, and had only [...] put off doing so because of poor mamma's death. As I had [...] told mamma, of course it was right that he should tell [...] papa. Then I told you, because you were so kind to me! I [...] am so sorry that I have got you into this trouble; but [...] what can I do? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that {{he could}} change. I felt so secure in his love. <b>It</b> never <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that anyone could take him from me.|$|R
