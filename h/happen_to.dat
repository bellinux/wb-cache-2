As Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov noted, [...] "What <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Berlin, <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Germany; what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Germany, <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> Europe." [...] Berlin had suffered enormous damage; its prewar population of 4.3 million people was reduced to 2.8 million.|$|R

5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media.

5|$|Even where a {{concurrent}} use registration is issued, the parties may eventually {{come to an}} agreement under which one party will surrender its registration. In some instances, a party will simply <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> cease using the mark in favor of a new brand name, and the registration will lapse. In other cases, the larger company will eventually acquire the smaller.|$|E
5|$|Investigators' suspicions {{began to}} turn to Stella Nickell when they {{discovered}} that she claimed that the two contaminated Excedrin bottles that she had turned over to police had been purchased at different times and different locations.

5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said {{it could}} be the most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol called it the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the most}} important things to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer called it the best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called it possibly the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most important thing to <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> PC gaming in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Tähtinen {{concludes that}} Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their {{position}} is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be his own brothers and sons.|$|E

5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following the eclipse failed to <b>happen,</b> <b>to</b> 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rhetoric}} grew more strident, however, the other monarchies started to view events with alarm. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he {{considered}} the situation surrounding his sister, the French Queen Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater and greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> New England if it were to abandon its Puritan values.|$|E

Li gets {{caught in the middle of}} the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors.|$|E

5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the total mass of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E
5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines of criticism. He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type of criticism might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E
5|$|The film {{includes}} segments {{intended to}} refute {{critics who say}} {{that global warming is}} unproven or that warming will be insignificant. For example, Gore discusses the possibility of the collapse of a major ice sheet in Greenland or in West Antarctica, either of which could raise global sea levels by approximately 20 feet (6m), flooding coastal areas and producing 100 million refugees. Melt water from Greenland, because of its lower salinity, could then halt the currents that keep northern Europe warm and quickly trigger dramatic local cooling there. It also contains various short animated projections of what could <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> different animals more vulnerable to global warming.|$|E
