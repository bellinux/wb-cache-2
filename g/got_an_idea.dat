[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I <b>got</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} writer Keith Shadwick, their {{arrangement}} follows a [...] "simple and economical form that allowed its message to unfold naturally, inviting the sound enhancement at which Beck and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith were quickly becoming expert". McCarty recalled that Samwell-Smith <b>got</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for a bass {{line from a}} song by jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck (identified as [...] "Pick Up Sticks" [...] from the 1959 Time Out album) to which he added a marching-style drum beat. As they started to develop the rhythm, chords were added– [...] "G and F, and then resolving it in D, each verse." [...] For the middle section guitar solo, the beat shifts into double-time and the instrumentation heightens the tension. This rhythmic device, originally used in jazz improvisation, was the Yardbirds' signature arrangement. Dubbed a [...] "rave-up", it was a feature of several of their songs.|$|E

[...] Badu's iChat contacts, including hip hop producers Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, and J Dilla, instant messaged her {{to get back into}} the studio and sent her tracks.

But just as I was accepting that, here comes this burst of light and energy and creativity. And that's the process, I guess, of life—the detachment and the release of something gives you even more room to grow or be creative." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{recording}} sessions for Achtung Baby, the Edge {{separated from his}} wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, [...] "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'." [...] The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: [...] "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose." [...] While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song, the Edge [...] "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo." [...] Bono said, [...] "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him {{for a kind of}} rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there." [...] Audio engineer Flood said the [...] "bold, unadulterated, naked [...] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mic. Edge just <b>got</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> tried it, and it worked straightaway." ...|$|E

They {{were able to take}} two months off and regroup afterward, something they had not previously done during their career. The quintet decided to take on a new approach for the writing process of Coming Home, rather than the usual [...] "tour bus and dressing room jams", they moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and demo new material. Despite this, main composer and lead guitarist, Chad Gilbert took a book containing over 40 riff ideas that he had written during the previous tour into the mansion. Drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained that, [...] "The whole idea is that we can be sitting around, watching TV, and suddenly be like, 'Hey, I've <b>got</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea.</b> Let's do this'. We've always wanted to do something like this, but we were never sure just how to do it. I know all the guys are really excited to get into the house, hang out and make some music." [...] The band spent four months in Malibu with studio engineer and long term friend Paul Miner, from August 2005 through November, eventually leaving with 14 finished demos to present to their record label.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{believed}} that Lynch was going to retire from the film industry; according to Abel Ferrara, Lynch [...] "doesn't even want to make films any more. I've {{talked to him about}} it, OK? I can tell when he talks about it." [...] However, in a June 2012 Los Angeles Times interview, Lynch stated that he lacked the inspiration to start a new movie project, but [...] "If I <b>got</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I fell in love with, I'd go to work tomorrow". In September 2012, Lynch appeared in the three-part [...] "Late Show" [...] arc on FX's Louie as Jack Dahl. In November 2012, Lynch hinted at plans for a new film while attending Plus Camerimage in Bydgoszcz, Poland. Speaking at the festival, Lynch said [...] "something is coming up. It will happen but I don't know exactly when". At Plus Camerimage, Lynch was also presented with a lifetime achievement award and the key to the city by Bydgoszcz's mayor Rafał Bruski. During an interview with the Los Angeles Times in January 2013, frequent Lynch collaborator Laura Dern confirmed she and Lynch are planning a new project, and The New York Times later revealed Lynch is working on the script.

2500|$|Rose {{described}} {{the writing process}} for the album as [...] "a more personal experience to him", and said that due to the events that transpired in the prior year, he would sometimes have trouble coming up with words, and would often write gibberish as a temporary filler. While Rose would be the primary writer, all {{five members of the}} band would contribute. Rose focused on more distressing themes, while Witherspoon, who had just become a father, focused his lyrics on responsibility and commitment. The album's first single, [...] "Unraveling", was co-written by Lowery and is about the collapse of a relationship, while [...] "Confession" [...] indirectly addresses Lowery quitting and returning to the band. On Lowery's return, Rose spoke [...] "Since we all write, it's hard to tell exactly what each song is about, but we like to leave it up to the listeners to decide for themselves," [...] Rose says. [...] "It's funny because in the end you almost don't know what you wrote. I remember telling John one time, 'Dude, that was an amazing line you wrote,' and he went, 'What are you talking about? You wrote that.' We wanted to change the template completely from what we did with our last album, 'Hope And Sorrow'. We were going, 'Let's bring back those other elements Clint brought in that made us what we were.' So we sort of made a silent agreement {{that we were going to}} let Clint run wild.
