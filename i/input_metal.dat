40|$|Estuaries may be {{important}} reservoirs for contaminants as they tend to act as sinks for fine, contaminant-reactive sediments, and, historically, they have acted as centres for industrial and urban development. Analysis of dated sediment cores from these areas may allow historical trends in heavy <b>metal</b> <b>input</b> to be reconstructed, and recent and historical <b>inputs</b> of <b>metal</b> contaminants to be compared. Undisturbed saltmarsh settings have been used widely in the reconstruction of historical trends in <b>metal</b> <b>input</b> as saltmarshes provide a stable, vegetated substrate of dominantly fine sediments, and are less prone to erosion and reworking than adjacent mudflat areas. In comparison, much less research on historical pollution trends has been undertaken at estuarine sites which are prone to severe local disturbance, such as intertidal areas which are routinely dredged or where sedimentary processes have been modified by human activities such as shipping, salt working, port activities, land claim etc. This paper assesses the usefulness of 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating, combined with geochemical studies, in reconstructing historical trends in heavy <b>metal</b> <b>input</b> and sediment accretion in 3 heavily-modified, industrialised estuarine areas in Europe: the Bilbao estuary (Spain), Southampton Water (UK), and the Mulinello estuary (Sicily). Of these sites, only a salt marsh core from the Mulinello estuary provides a high-resolution record of recent heavy <b>metal</b> <b>inputs.</b> In Southampton Water only a partial record of changing <b>metal</b> <b>inputs</b> over time is retained due to land-claim and possible early-diagenetic remobilisation, while at Bilbao the vertical distribution of heavy metals in intertidal flats is mainly controlled by input on reworked sediment particles and variations in sediment composition. Where 137 Cs and 210 Pb distributions with depth allow a chronology of sediment deposition to be established, and early-diagenetic remobilisation has been minimal, mudflat and saltmarsh cores from even the most heavily-disturbed estuarine sites can provide useful information on variations in historical contaminant input.

40|$|ABSTRACT The high {{strength}} AA 7075 aluminum alloy {{is commonly used}} in the aerospace components due to its exclusive mechanical properties like lightweight and {{high strength}}. This alloy cannot be welded by fusion welding techniques due to solidification cracking which severely degrade the mechanical properties of the joint.

Anyhow, the strength of friction stir welded joint is influenced by process parameters and tool parameters.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} research work, {{it is expected}} that dry recuperation of the metals in chromated copper arsenate (CCA) -treated wood waste can be achieved by low-temperature pyrolysis if a combination of pyrolysis temperature and residence time can be found, for which the two requirements: (1) zero-emission of metals, and (2) metal agglomeration are satisfied. To determine the working conditions for zero metal release, pyrolysis experiments with precisely controlled temperature and residence time and accurately known <b>input</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations of the CCA-treated wood samples, were conducted. Temperatures lower than 327 °C are considered, since the release of arsenic is thought to be controlled by the reduction reaction of As 2 O 5 to As 2 O 3, which occurs sharply at 327 °C. Metal retentions are calculated based on the measured metal concentrations in the pyrolysis residue and in the dried CCA-treated wood. The results suggest that pyrolysis at 300 °C for 20 min gives rise to zero release for the three metals (Cr, Cu, and As), while pyrolysis at 320 °C leads to nonnegligible metal releases. Thus, the experimental results suggest that the decomposition temperature of As 2 O 5 is lower than 320 °C. However, due to the high experimental uncertainty the observations are inconclusive. For future industrial applications, this study already shows that very careful control of process parameters will be required to ensure a zero arsenic emission. Moreover, this study indicates that an arsenic sampling and analysis method has to be developed and validated to be able to measure the arsenic emissions directly with high accuracy, instead of measuring metal retentions in the solid residue. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Industrial metals are now {{ubiquitous}} {{within the}} atmosphere and their deposition represents a potential source of contamination to surficial environments. Few studies, however, have examined the environmental fate of atmospheric industrial metals within different surface environments. In this study, patterns of accumulation of atmospherically transported industrial metals were investigated within the surface environments of the Snowy Mountains, Australia. Metals, including Pb, Sb, Cr and Mo, were enriched in aerosols collected in the Snowy Mountains by 3. 5 - 50 times pre-industrial concentrations. In sedimentary environments (soils, lakes and reservoirs) metals showed varying degrees of enrichment. Differences were attributed to the relative degree of atmospheric <b>input,</b> <b>metal</b> sensitivity to enrichment, catchment area and metal behaviour following deposition. In settings where atmospheric deposition dominated (ombrotrophic peat mires in the upper parts of catchments), metal enrichment patterns most closely resembled those in collected aerosols. However, even in these environments significant dilution (by 5 - 7 times) occurred. The most sensitive industrial metals (those with the lowest natural concentration; Cd, Ag, Sb and Mo) were enriched throughout the studied environments. However, in alpine tarn-lakes no other metals were enriched, due to the dilution of pollutant-metals by catchment derived sediment. In reservoirs, which were located lower within catchments, industrial metals exhibited more complex patterns. Particle reactive metals (e. g. Pb) displayed little enrichment, implying that they were retained up catchment, whereas more soluble metals (e. g., Cu and Zn) showed evidence of concentration. These same metals (Cu and Zn) were depleted in soils, implying that they are preferentially transported through catchments. Enrichment of other metals (e. g. Cd) varied between reservoirs {{as a function of}} contributing catchment area. Overall this study showed that the fate of atmospherically derived metals is complex, and depends upon metal behaviour and geomorphic processes operating at landscape scales...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnd Milling {{operations}} {{have been developed}} in response to productivity, quality and economical cost concerns. Significant advancements in controls and machining technologies have recently come together to enable the wide spread use of this operation. The main objective of this work {{is to develop a}} new procedure for predicting the metal cutting forces and coefficients during machining. The new technique proposed in this paper was found to be more flexible and easier to use than other available techniques. Experimental validation of the proposed procedure was carried out with the help of regression analysis using MINITAB- 16 software. The present paper discusses a response surface methodological approach for prediction of metal cutting coefficients in an end-milling operation of an Aluminum alloy. In this work, an approach was used to develop mathematical model based on RSM design for predicting the metal cutting forces and coefficients in an end milling operation. Different machining conditions like cutting speed, feed rate, and axial depth of cut are considered. The first order cutting force equations are developed using the response surface methodology (RSM) to study the effect of <b>input</b> <b>metal</b> cutting parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate and axial depth of cut at 50 % radial immersion on metal cutting forces and It has been observed the decrease of cutting speed along with the increase in the feed rate, axial depths of cut results in higher metal cutting forces. The differences between experimental and metal cutting forces obtained from the mathematical modeling using regression analysis at different feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cuts are presented. From the experimental results, metal cutting coefficients were determined with and without the influence of magneto rheological damping to the end milling tool. It has been observed from the experimental data that the metal cutting forces are less when compared to the forces obtained without the application of the magneto-rheological damper. The cutting parameter which affects the cutting force and their interaction are investigated in this study with and without the effect of Magneto-rheological damping. The regression models in this study are believed to produce values for metal cutting coefficients close to readings recorded experimentally with a 95 % confident level...|$|E
40|$|Strongly particle–reactive {{contaminants}} such as metals may exhibit highly accumulative behaviour when {{input to}} soils. This may cause exceedence of threshold concentrations for risk, for example for ecological effects or for crop metal content, if accumulation continues for a sufficiently long period. Since remediation of soils contaminated beyond threshold metal concentrations {{is likely to}} be costly and technically difficult, {{there is a need for}} tools to predict present and future accumulation of metals given future projections of inputs. The Intermediate Dynamic Model for Metals (IDMM) is an intermediate complexity model for describing and predicting metal accumulation and loss in topsoils over timescales of decades to centuries. The model combines mechanistic and empirical submodels for metal speciation, partitioning and aging in soils to predict solid phase and porewater metal speciation, leaching losses and plant uptake in response to time–varying inputs. The model has been applied both to a set of upland UK catchments, and to the Guanting reservoir catchment of northern China. The latter scenario presents a strongly contrasting environment, in terms of precipitation and soil chemistry, to the UK catchments. The model is driven by time series <b>inputs</b> of <b>metals,</b> starting from a pristine ‘steady state’ where <b>input</b> and output <b>metal</b> fluxes are in balance. Following estimation of historic <b>metal</b> <b>inputs,</b> particularly from atmospheric deposition, the model is able to make robust predictions of present day topsoil metal pools (within a factor of three of observations).

40|$|This {{work has}} been a {{combined}} experimental and numerical modeling effort aimed {{to help in the}} understanding of heat transfer processes when melting aluminium. In addition a newly developed type of oxy-fuel burner was investigated. Objectives set for this project include improving energy efficiency in a typical industry furnace used today and looking at possible new technology to realize higher efficiencies than normally obtained. As a starting point a literature review was done to get an overview of furnaces and technology used in aluminium remelting and recycling. The most commonly used furnace today for aluminium melting and remelting is the reverberatory furnace which was the focus of this work as well. Understanding the interaction of parameters influencing heat transfer and quantifying how heat is transferred in the furnace are key elements to be able to optimize energy efficiency. Reverberatory furnaces are usually heated by gas burners, more specifically with cold air as oxidizer. Recent developments in burner technology using pure oxygen as oxidizer has showed some promising results and was investigated in experiments and numerical models. Melting experiments were carried out in a controlled environment in a 500 kg laboratory scale furnace as a basis for understanding the heat transfer mechanisms and quantifying radiation and convection contributions when melting aluminium. The experiments also served as a reference for a numerical 1 -dimensional heat transfer model along with more advanced 3 -dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models using a commercial software package. Phenomena as turbulent flow, combustion, convection, conduction and radiation were included in the models along with latent heat release when melting metal. The influence and impact of physical parameters on the heat transfer could be determined in the numerical models and provided a more detailed analysis of the processes in the furnace. A newly developed Low Temperature Oxy-fuel (LTOF) burner was investigated and compared to a conventional cold air-fuel burner in a pilot scale furnace. Measurements of flame and furnace temperatures, gas composition and heat fluxes were done for both burners at two different input levels. Heating experiments of aluminium samples were performed to look at the difference between the burners for aluminium heating and melting applications. 3 -dimensional CFD models were developed to determine unknown quantities such as metal emissivity and quantification of radiation and convection heat transfer. The experiments also confirmed the validity of the numerical models. Finally a full scale reverberatory industry furnace was modeled using a 3 -dimensional CFD model. The air-fuel burners currently installed in the furnace was replaced by LTOF burners in the numerical model. The performance was compared to a previously published numerical model of the same furnace using air-fuel burners for two different metal configurations in the furnace. The influence of parameters such as burner <b>input,</b> <b>metal</b> emissivity, furnace wall emissivity and a dross layer was studied. The key factor when making improvements in furnaces is understanding the fundamental heat transfer processes in existing technology. The experimental and numerical modeling work presented in this thesis has studied these phenomena and created a basis from which further investigations into furnace efficiency in aluminium remelting and recycling can be done.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the work described in this thesis {{was to examine the}} effects of both waterborne and dietary routes of exposure to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) when exposed to complex metal mining mixtures. This was conducted using a 21 -day, multi-trophic, short-term fathead minnow (FHM) reproductive bioassay. The endpoints that were measured were used to assess the effects on multiple levels of biological organization (sub-organismal to population endpoints). 	The first phase of this research was conducted in situ using environmentally realistic concentrations of 3 separate metal mining effluents [20 % surface water effluent (SWE), 30 % mine water effluent (MWE), 45 % process water effluent (PWE) ] from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. Metals were analyzed in several media (water, sediments) and tissues (biofilm, Chironomus dilutus, female fathead minnow carcass, ovaries, liver and gills). The incorporation of the biofilm (primary producers) into the bioassay also added another level of organization that was novel to this study. Significant increases in metal concentrations were observed in the water and biofilm tissues in all treatments [SWE, MWE, PWE], compared to reference. Cobalt and nickel increased significantly in C. dilutus tissues in SWE (1. 4 -fold and 1. 5 -fold respectively), and copper and selenium in PWE (5. 2 -fold and 3. 3 -fold respectively), however no significant increases occurred in MWE compared to reference. There were no significant increases in metal concentrations in female FHM tissues (carcass, liver, gonads, gills) in any of the treatments, suggesting that metal bioavailability was reduced. Cumulative number of eggs per female per day increased significantly (+ 127 %) after exposure to SWE and decreased significantly (- 33 %) after exposure to PWE when compared to the reference fish. Mean total number of days to hatch was also reduced in PWE compared to reference. 	In order to gain a better understanding of the routes of exposure causing toxicity in FHM, the second phase of this research examined the effects of exposure through diet, through water or through both using a fully factorial food exposure design in a laboratory setting. In this experiment we pre-exposed C. dilutus to both 45 % PWE and laboratory control water until they reached the 3 rd- 4 th instar stage of development (approximately 21 days) where they were collected and frozen until the start of the FHM reproductive bioassay. We further examined the role of food quality on fish toxicity by assessing differences between multi trophic (where fish were fed both a live and frozen diet of C. dilutus) in the laboratory. This research was conducted at the Toxicology Centre in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The results showed that significant effects were observed when fish were fed a live diet versus a frozen diet. Condition factor and body weight increased, although inconsistent effects were observed for liver somatic index (LSI) in fathead minnows in both experiments when exposed to one or both routes of exposure. Cumulative total egg production and cumulative spawning events were both significantly affected by both waterborne and dietborne exposures with the greatest effects seen in the multi-trophic streams and particularly when fish were fed a live diet. 	This significance of this research has demonstrated the importance of including both routes of exposure when assessing effects of mine effluent. This research also shows that the artificial stream technology is a useful tool in isolating the effects of a particular point source <b>input</b> (<b>metal</b> mining mixtures) when a system is highly confounded. The results suggest that under environmentally relevant exposure conditions, trophic transfer and live diet may lead to greater reproductive effects and increased fish toxicity. This also suggests that trophic transfer is an important route of exposure that is virtually impossible to attain using typical laboratory bioassay techniques (food-borne study using artificial diets or waterborne exposures only) ...|$|E

Seven metals were targeted (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni and Pb) during dry weather periods. Since total and dissolved concentrations alone are not relevant enough for an ecological risk assessment, labile metals (free + weekly complexed) were also measured by means of DGT (diffusive gradient in thin film technique).

Pulsed current is particularly useful for these applications, as it helps limit the heat <b>input.</b> The filler <b>metal</b> should be added quickly, and a large weld pool should be avoided to prevent dilution of the base materials.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Heavy metal {{pollution}} of ground water {{is an extremely}} serious environmental problem and a costly one to remediate. In this study the Aries river water quality affected by anthropogenic factors was investigated. Usually the Aries is contaminated in two ways: by accidents, when a huge quantity of pollutants flows from tailing ponds in tributary rivulets of Aries and by anthropogenic <b>inputs</b> of <b>metals</b> and various chemical substances. The results of the analyzed parameters (total and dissolved Cu, Pb and Zn, pH, suspended solids, total dissolved solids, chemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen) showed that the water of Aries river is polluted mostly with Cu and Zn due to mining activities in Aries hydrographic basin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fruits {{especially}} citrus {{species are}} an integral part of human diet. Contamination of foodstuffs by heavy and toxic metals via environmental pollution has become an inevitable challenge these days. Therefore, the effect of pollutants on food safety for human consumption is a global public concern. In this regards, this study was conducted for Al and Cu health risk assessment through the consumption of citrus species (orange, grapefruit, sweet lime and tangerine) in Hamedan city in 2015. Methods: After collecting and preparing 4 samples from each citrus species with acid digestion method, the concentrations of Al and Cu were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES) with three replications. In addition, SPSS was employed to compare the mean concentrations of metals with maximum permissible limits (MPL) of the World Health Organization (WHO). Results: The results showed that the mean concentrations of Al in citrus samples were 3. 25 ± 0. 35 mg/kg and higher than WHO maximum permissible limits. The mean concentrations of Cu in citrus samples with 0. 16 ± 0. 05 mg/kg are lower than WHO maximum permissible limits. Also, the computed health risk assessment revealed that there was no potential risk for children and adult by consuming the studied citrus. Conclusion: Based on the results, consumption of citrus species has no adverse effect on the consumers’ health, but as a result of the increased utilization of agricultural <b>inputs</b> (<b>metal</b> based fertilizers and pesticides, sewage sludge and wastewater) by farmers and orchardists, regular periodic monitoring of chemical pollutants content in foodstuffs are recommended for food safety.

40|$|A {{new method}} for multivariate outlier {{detection}} {{able to distinguish}} between extreme values of a normal distribution and values originating from a different distribution (outliers) is presented. To facilitate visualising multivariate outliers spatially on a map, the multivariate outlier plot, is introduced. In this plot different symbols refer to a distance measure from {{the centre of the}} distribution, taking into account the shape of the distribution, and different colours are used to signify the magnitude of the values for each variable. The method is illustrated using a real geochemical data set from far-northern Europe. It is demonstrated that important processes such as the <b>input</b> of <b>metals</b> from contamination sources and the contribution of sea-salts via marine aerosols to the soil can be identified and separated...|$|R
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy <b>input.</b> Welding <b>metals</b> with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|R

During dry season, {{the impact of}} Treated Wastewater (TWW) on trace elements fluxes to the sea was clearly evidenced. In the freshwater/seawater mixing zone, most of the studied elements presented non-conservative behaviors, partly due to a non-equilibrium in the dissolved/particulate metals distribution in the effluents [1]...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the results from the}} Norwegian-Russian collaboration project NordRID project, which was carried out from December 2011 to December 2013. Four institutions have been involved; INEP and IO RAS from the Russian side and Akvaplan-NIVA and NIVA from the Norwegian side. The main purpose of the project has been to review Russian and Norwegian methods for measuring and estimating riverine <b>inputs</b> of heavy <b>metals</b> to the Barents Sea. The report gives an overview of the most common methods applied for monitoring and calculating riverine <b>inputs</b> of heavy <b>metals.</b> INEP and IO-RAS have provided both meta-data and to some extent also real data for a number of rivers draining from the Kola and Arkhangelsk area, respectively. Two pilot studies with passive sampling techniques were performed as part of the project; one with DGTs (Diffusion Gradient in Thin-films) for detection of metals, and one with passive samplers for detection of hydrophobic contaminants. Two bilateral project meetings/workshops have been carried out during the project (at Svanhovd and in Oslo). The report contains recommendations for future work based on the studies and experiences made from the project. Norwegian Ministry of Environmen...|$|R
