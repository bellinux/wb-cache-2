To defend <b>differential</b> power <b>analysis</b> attacks, Akkar and Giraud presented a Transformed Masking Method and applied it to DES implementation in 2001. Unfortunately, in 2003, Akkar and Goubin showed a superposition attack that actually is a high-order <b>differential</b> power <b>analysis</b> attack on Akkar and Giraud’s DES implementation using Transformed Masking Method, and finally they presented a DES implementation using their proposed Unique Masking Method to defend any order <b>differential</b> power <b>analysis</b> attacks, which was later improved by Akkar, Bévan and Goubin in 2004. In this paper, by exploiting a new artifice to classify the electric consumption curves, we show that Akkar, Bévan and Goubin’s improved DES implementation using Unique Masking Method is still vulnerable to a high-order <b>differential</b> power <b>analysis</b> attack. Besides, we find it is also vulnerable to a superposition attack.

40|$|Abstract. Among several {{countermeasures}} {{suggested for}} thwarting <b>differential</b> <b>analysis</b> are the random ordering of operations, insertion of random operations, and random insertion of operations. This paper presents a phase-substitution technique which {{in combination with}} subsequent time-domain <b>differential</b> <b>analysis</b> is shown {{to be able to}} thwart these three countermeasures in several experiments. Unlike previous techniques for aligning traces, this approach makes use of the phase information. The proposed technique involves: fast fourier transform, phase-substitution, inverse fast fourier transform and time-based <b>differential</b> <b>analysis.</b> Results are demonstrated using electromagnetic traces acquired from a PDA device (representing a complex embedded system including cache misses, operating system events, etc).

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of convenient serum bioassays for cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of treatment {{is one of}} top priorities in cancer research community. Although numerous biomarker candidates have been generated by applying high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, few {{of them have been}} successfully validated in the clinic. Better strategies to mine omics data for successful biomarker discovery are needed. Using a data set of 22, 794 tumor and normal samples across 23 tissues, we systematically analyzed current problems and challenges of serum biomarker discovery from gene expression data. We first performed tissue specificity analysis to identify genes that are both tissue-specific and up-regulated in tumors compared to controls, but identified few novel candidates. Then, we designed a novel computation method, the multiple normal tissues corrected <b>differential</b> <b>analysis</b> (MNTDA), to identify genes that are expected to be significantly up-regulated even after their expressions in other normal tissues are considered, and, in a simulation study, showed that the multiple normal tissues corrected <b>differential</b> <b>analysis</b> outperformed the single tissue <b>differential</b> <b>analysis</b> combined with tissue specificity analysis. By applying the multiple normal tissues corrected <b>differential</b> <b>analysis,</b> we identified some genes as novel biomarker candidates. However, the number of potential candidates was disappointingly small, exemplifying the difficulty of finding serum cancer biomarkers. We discussed a few important points that should be considered during biomarker discovery from omics data...|$|E
