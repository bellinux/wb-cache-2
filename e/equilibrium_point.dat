40|$|The {{stability}} and topological structure of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> in the potential {{field of the}} asteroid 101955 Bennu have been investigated with a variable density and rotation period. A dimensionless quantity is introduced for the nondimensionalization of the equations of motion, and this quantity can indicate the effect of both the rotation period and bulk density of the asteroid. Using the polyhedral model of the asteroid Bennu, the number and position of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> are calculated and illustrated by a contour plot of the gravitational effective potential field. The topological structure and {{the stability of the}} <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> are also investigated using the linearized method. The results show that there are nine <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> in the potential field of the asteroid Bennu, eight in the exterior of the body and one in the interior of the body. Moreover, bifurcation will occur with a variation of the density and rotation period. Different <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> will encounter each other and mix together. Thus, the number of <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> will change. The {{stability and}} topological structure of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> will also change because of the variation of the density and rotation period of the asteroid. When considering the error of the density of Bennu, the range of the dimensionless quantity covers the critical values that will lead to bifurcation. This means that the stability of the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>points</b> is uncertain, making the dynamical environment of Bennu much more complicated. These bifurcations can help better understand the dynamic environment of an irregular-shaped asteroid. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures, 4 table...|$|R
