5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to the illusion of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport were developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>later</b> 1860s.

By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
