6000|$|We {{saw this}} bear walk along, poke around, {{dig into the}} ground, go behind trees, come out again, and finally stand up on his hind feet and {{apparently}} reach for berries or something on a bush. R.C. bethought himself of his field-glass. After one look he exclaimed: [...] "Say, fellows, he's a whopper of a bear! He'll weigh five hundred pounds. <b>Just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at him!" ...|$|E

[...] "Mr. Wylde, will you <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> round these storehouses {{and see what}} there is worth taking away. You had better take my boat's crew {{as well as your}} own to help you to turn things over. Are you quite sure, lad, that there is no one beside yourselves on the island?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well he <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at me, gents, winked {{with one}} eye, {{as much as}} to say, 'I see you,' and went down again. There warn't nothing else as he could do, was there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, James. It's {{all very}} fine {{for women to}} win prizes in the lecture room, but {{you know as well}} as I do that they are no use in an emergency. Now I warrant that this woman was all nerves when she was setting your leg. That reminds me that I had better <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at it and see that it is all right." ...|$|E

[...] "Good things {{all the way up}} from juicy porterhouse and the kind of coffee Mrs. Hall makes to...." [...] He hesitated at what he was about to say, then took it at a plunge. [...] "To a woman you can love an' that loves you. <b>Just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at Saxon there with the ukulele in her lap.

But we won't trouble you much on Mrs. Peyton's account, will we, Susy? And now she and me will <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> around the shanty,--it is real old Spanish anteek, ain't it?--and sorter take stock of it, and you young folks will have to tear yourselves apart for a while, and play propriety before me. You've got {{to be on your}} good behavior while I'm here, I can tell you! I'm a heavy old 'doo-anna.' Ain't I, Susy? School-ma'ms and mother superiors ain't in the game with ME for discipline." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mrs. Dr. dear, he {{was sitting}} out on the back steps this afternoon. It was just after the news came that the Armistice had been signed and he was looking his Hydest. I can assure you he was <b>an</b> awesome <b>looking</b> beast. All at once, Mrs. Dr. dear, Bruce Meredith {{came around the corner}} of the kitchen walking on his stilts. He has been {{learning}} to walk on them lately and came over to show me how well he could do it. Mr. Hyde <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> and one bound carried him over the yard fence. Then he went tearing through the maple grove in great leaps with his ears laid back. You never saw a creature so terrified, Mrs. Dr. dear. He has never returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{struck up}} the road, and when I passed the mill I see {{a sign on}} it, [...] "Phelps's Sawmill," [...] and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody around, though it was good {{daylight}} now. But I didn't mind, because I didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only {{wanted to get the}} lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>look,</b> and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night performance--like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says: ...|$|R

"Now I'll {{tell you}} what we'll do," [...] said Hannah, when she had {{examined}} and questioned Beth, [...] "we will have Dr. Bangs, <b>just</b> to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you girls can {{stay at home and}} amuse Beth for a day or two." ...|$|R

I heard every clock strike; the sounds of morning were astir, and still I could not sleep. The ceremony, for reasons {{connected}} with our long journey to my father's place in Hampshire, was to be early--half- past ten was the hour. I looked at my watch; it was seven of the clock, and then I looked out of the window: it was a fine, soft grey morning, with a south wind tossing the yellowing boughs. I got up, dressed in a hasty way, and thought I would <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the river. It was, indeed, in glorious order, lapping {{over the top of}} the sharp stone which we regarded as a measure of the due size of water.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, boys, {{listen to}} me and {{remember}} what I say. We won't alarm anyone yet, for I've {{made up my mind}} our scare is all nonsense. Don was out lapping the water as I came by, and I don't believe he's mad any more than I am. Still, to ease our minds and compose our spirits, and get our guilty faces out of sight for a while, I think we had better drive into town to my old friend Dr Morrison, and let him <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at my work, and give us some quieting little dose; for we are all rather shaken by this flurry. Sit still, Rob; and Ted, you harness up while I run and get my hat and tell Aunty to excuse me to Daisy. I don't know those Penniman girls, and she will be glad of our room at tea, and we'll have a cosy bite at my house, and come home as gay as larks.' ...|$|E

Well, larst night, so soon as the moon was hup, the wolves here all began a-'owling. There warn't nothing for them to 'owl at.

40|$|You may be {{surprised}} to know that elderly Australians are more at risk of abuse in their own homes than they are in institutional facilities, abuse that is often inflicted by a relative or a friend. Anecdotal evidence suggest that elder abuse is on the rise, particularly financial abuse.

[...] "She ain't flyin' any {{dynamite}} flag, an' if she was an' had a hold full there wouldn't be any particular danger to us, an' anyone that has ever shipped dynamite would know it, or ought to. It's not fire that detonates dynamite, it's concussion. No sir, Mr. Harding, there's something queer here--I don't like {{the looks of}} it. Why <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> good <b>look</b> at the faces of those men. Did you ever see such an ugly-looking pack of unhung murderers in your life, sir?" ...|$|R

Perhaps things have improved now, but in the past, independent productions were always running out of funds and that affected both {{the quality of the}} movie and your own livelihood. Shaw Brothers is at least well-equipped. If you need a set for a period movie, for example, <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> in the sculpture room of the studio and you will find Shanghainese masters who specialize in making antique furniture. It is also true that New Wave directors have raised the standard. Now I can ask my crew, 'How do we compete with them when we are complacent?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|She was {{the epitome}} of grace and good taste. She was a tireless {{community}} leader {{and perhaps the most}} philanthropic citizen and arts patron to ever call Odessa home. ... Drive around Odessa and <b>just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at all the things that benefited from the generosity of both Noëls. Theaters, museums, the Salvation Army, Harmony Home: The list could go on forever. And then think about how many wonderful deeds were done quietly and anonymously. Because that's really how Ellen Noël worked her magic. She was not a giver who insisted on having her name tied to her good deeds. In fact, she really didn't want the Ellen Noël Art Museum to be named after her and had to be talked into it. Gracious and generous. There is no way to account for all of the generous donations made by the Noëls behind the scenes. There are simply too many. Her wonderful example of generosity and volunteerism has set a high standard in Odessa for philanthropists and volunteers." ...|$|E

I just cut down the short way to the Chequers, and who should I meet but Bill Sykes, coming full split round the corner. So I just ups and says 'My lad, you're wanted.' That's all I says. And he says 'I'll go along quiet, Bobby,' he says, 'without the darbies,' he says." [...] There's your Arithmetical policeman. Now try the other method.

And I noticed the foot-marks, where the chap had come right across your flower-beds. They was good big foot-marks sure-ly. And I noticed as the left foot went down at the heel, ever so much deeper than the other. And I says to myself 'The chap's been a big hulking chap: and he goes lame on his left foot.' And I rubs {{my hand on the}} wall where he got over, and there was soot on it, and no mistake. So I says to myself 'Now where can I light on a big man, in the chimbley-sweep line, what's lame of one foot?' And I flashes up permiscuous: and I says 'It's Bill Sykes!' says I."

[...] In 2013, Complex's Gus Turner ranked Ogre the nineteenth-"Most Feared God in Video Games": [...] "An Aztec deity, Ogre is the God of Fighting, which, obviously, makes him a pretty good fit for the Tekken series. <b>Just</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at him. What else needs to be said?" [...] In 2015, CDKeys rated him the sixth-best fighting game villain: [...] "True Ogre is a great visual, and helped players enjoy an epic conclusion {{to one of the}} PlayStation’s best fighting games." [...] Computer and Video Games named Ogre one of [...] "Tekken 's worst ever characters" [...] in 2011, describing him as [...] "looking more in-character on a Mardi Gras float passing out flower garlands than he does being hit in the face by Paul Phoenix". In a 2012 fan poll held by Bandai Namco, Ogre was only the 47th-most requested out of 54 Tekken characters for inclusion in the unreleased crossover Tekken X Street Fighter, receiving 1,994 (2.26%) of 88,280 votes.|$|E

5000|$|Echoes {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Robert Copsey from Digital Spy rated the album five stars {{out of five}} and called it [...] "a perfectly-crafted adult pop album; one that sounds contemporary without straw-clutching and classy without the pretension. The hands-in-the-air ballads [...] "Lie Next to Me" [...] and [...] "Silent Valentine" [...] prove that he's still the Will we've always known, just in a shinier, sharper and altogether more comfortable skin." [...] The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan compared Echoes {{to the work of}} George Michael and the Pet Shop Boys. She found that [...] "Young stamps his identity on songs with vocals that convey the disenchantment of a rich young gay man who's <b>just</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> long <b>look</b> at himself in the mirror. 'Classy' is the word that comes to mind all the way through these 13 songs." [...] Evening Standards Rick Pearson complimented the album for its [...] "playful, dancey quality" [...] which he considered [...] "a welcome change from the schmaltzy ballads that have characterised too much of Young's output." [...] He summed Echoes as [...] "a daring musical makeover that will win Young many new fans." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{not officially}} confirmed, Ralf Hütter {{suggested}} that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: [...] "We've <b>just</b> never really <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at those albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We <b>took</b> <b>a</b> lot of Polaroids in those days." [...] Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|R
5000|$|Extreme Pinball {{received}} generally negative reviews. Reviewing the PlayStation version, Rich Leadbetter of Maximum {{commented that}} [...] "the tables on offer in Extreme Pinball are <b>just</b> too dull. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{at the latest}} pinball tables and you see very flashy, licensed affairs with lashings of special effects and sampled sounds... all of which you won't find in Extreme Pinball." [...] He also criticized the prominent borders in the PAL conversion. A brief review in GamePro stated [...] "Neither as fast for as polished as Last Gladiators for the Saturn, Extreme Pinball is strangely reminiscent of Ruiner Pinball for the Jaguar or the old Time Cruise for the TG-16. Not a lot of 32-bit technology went into this standard game, and {{not a lot of}} fun comes out of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The beheadings came a {{day before}} Egypt signed a $5.9 billion arms deal to {{purchase}} 24 Dassault Rafale warplanes from France, making it the first foreign sale for the French jet. Egypt also bought a FREMM multipurpose frigate as well as missiles. The deal is believed by analysts to be an attempt by Sisi to both upgrade Egypt's military hardware and to diversify its suppliers. Patricia Adam, president of the French parliament's defense committee, said that Egypt needed planes quickly. [...] "You <b>just</b> need to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at what's happening at its border. They are especially worried by what's happening in Libya," [...] she said. French defense minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said that the Copts' execution {{was one of the}} reasons why the Egyptian government wanted to boost its security.|$|R

Why should people flock to pay for seats for what are {{practically}} dress-rehearsals of an unknown play? Half the principals have had to get up in their parts in two weeks, and they haven't had time to get anything out of them. They are groping for their lines all the time.

It's <b>just</b> ragged. <b>Take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at it in another two weeks! I know! I don't say musical comedy is a very lofty form of art, but still there's a certain amount of science about it. If you go in for it long enough, you learn the tricks, and take it from me that, if you have a good cast and some catchy numbers it's almost impossible not to have a success. We've got an excellent cast now, and the numbers are fine. I tell you--as I tried to tell Pilkington, only he wouldn't listen--that this show is all right. There's a fortune in it for somebody.
