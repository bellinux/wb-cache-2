40|$|This project, Method {{for risk}} {{assessment}} of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibrations,</b> is a degree project in industrial design at Luleå University of Technology. The project {{was conducted at}} Scania CV AB in Södertälje during spring semester 2014. The aim with the project {{was to create a}} method for risk assessment of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibrations</b> adapted for Scania’s production system. The goal was a method that will ensure Scania to control the exposure of vibrations. Literature and interviews were performed to gain knowledge about vibrations and what factors that affect exposure of vibrations. Measurements were made in different areas to complement the literature. The result is a method for risk assessment of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibrations</b> and also a method to calculate the allowed time of use until the limits of vibrations are reached. The result have been verified with measurements and the method is reasonable and reliable. It suits for production systems with repeating tasks and when the exposure time is easy to measure. It is recommended that;  Scania complement the risk assessment with a guideline and then implement it in Scania’s work routine.  The method is performed by a safety engineer or by a person with similar competence.  Scania develop a course about vibrations for the employed.

40|$|The risk {{assessment}} of <b>hand-arm</b> transmitted <b>vibration</b> is today based on {{measurements of the}} magnitude, frequency spectra and duration of the vibration stimuli. It is, however, {{reasonable to assume that}} the detrimental effects might depend on the vibration energy absorbed by the hand and arm. Therefore, the aims of this thesis have been to; (i) examine the mechanical and energy absorbing properties of the hand and arm during vibration exposure, (ii) perform theoretical calculations of the amount of absorbed energy, (iii) compare the calculated results with direct measurements. The results show that the mechanical and energy absorbing properties depend on the frequency and direction of the vibration stimuli. Higher vibration levels, as well as more firm handgrips, resulted in higher impedance and absorption of energy. The constitution of the hand and arm also affected, the results to a large extent whereas the varying hand-arm postures had only a small influence. Using the vibration characteristics for a certain tool and the mechanical properties of the hand and arm, a good agreement between theoretical calculations and direct measurements of the amount of absorbed energy could be established. Furthermore, the shape of the frequency spectra for the energy absorption was found to be unequal for different vibration directions and not in accordance with the currently used frequency weighting routine. Finally, the findings support the idea that future standards for {{risk assessment}} of vibrations should rather be based on the energy absorption concept. Godkänd; 1990; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R

Metrological performances of different transducers were assessed through the identification of their frequency response function, linearity, floor noise and sensitivity to thermal and electromagnetic disturbances. Experimental results highlighted a standard instrumental uncertainty (including the nonlinearity) lower than 5 % with the single frequency calibration procedure, such a value was reduced to 2 %. The temperature effect was negligible and the electromagnetic disturbances sensitivity was comparable to that of the piezoelectric accelerometers. The compatibility of measurements obtained with MEMS accelerometers with those of piezoelectric-based measurement chains was verified for two specific applications. An example of direct transducer fixation on the skin for vibration transmissibility measurements is also presented. Thanks to the MEMS peculiarities – mainly small sizes and low cost – since novel approaches in the vibration monitoring could be pursued. For instance, it is possible to include by design MEMS accelerometers in any hand-held tool at the operator interface, or inside the seats structures of cars, tractors and trucks.

50|$|Because workers {{maintain}} the same posture over long work days and often several years, even natural postures like standing {{can lead to}} MSDs like low back pain, but postures which are less natural like twisting or tension in the upper body are typically contributors {{to the development of}} MSDs because of the unnatural biomechanical load of these postures. There is evidence that posture contributes to MSDs of the neck, shoulder, and back. Repeated motion is another risk factor for MSDs of occupational origin because workers can perform the same movements repeatedly {{over long periods of time}} (e.g. typing leading to carpal tunnel syndrome), which can wear on the joints and muscles involved in the motion in question. Workers doing repetitive motions at a high pace of work with little recovery time and workers with little to no control over the timing of motions (e.g. workers on assembly lines) are also prone to MSDs due to the motion of their work. Force needed to perform actions on the job can also be associated with higher MSD risk in workers, because movements which require more force can fatigue muscles quicker which can lead to injury and/or pain. Additionally, exposure to vibration (as in truck drivers or construction workers, for example) and extreme hot or cold temperatures can affect a worker's ability to judge force and strength, which can lead to development of MSDs. Vibration exposure is also associated with <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> syndrome, which has symptoms of lack of blood circulation to the fingers, nerve compression, tingling, and/or numbness.|$|E

40|$|Vibrations are a {{well known}} {{potential}} cause of health diseases and therefore constitute a main {{concern for the}} safety of workers in a large number of activities. In order to prevent health hazards, national and international institutions have issued laws and directives which establish recommended limits to the workers’ exposure to vibrations during operations. Consequently, if the amount of adsorbed vibration exceeds the allowable daily limits the worker has to stop his job. Recent wireless sensing and communicating technologies can effectively be employed for such purpose, allowing to develop monitoring customized devices at affordable cost which could be easily employed during the workers’ activity. In such context, the present research proposes an innovative system aimed at estimating the <b>hand–arm</b> exposure to <b>vibration</b> according to the Standard EN ISO 5349 - 1 : 2004.

40|$|A {{number of}} biodynamic {{models of the}} hand-arm system have evolved {{on the basis of}} {{measured}} driving-point mechanical impedance (DPMI) responses to facilitate analyses of the coupled hand-tool system [1]. The parameter identifications in such models are based upon minimization of an error function of the model and the target impedance data, which may not yield a unique solution. Consequently, a number of model structures and parameter sets could be realized that would equally satisfy the target curve. Moreover, {{the vast majority of the}} reported models exhibit acute deficiencies due to excessive static deflections of model masses, presence of a low frequency mode and very light masses in the order of 1. 2 - 4. 8 grams. The models also do not characterize the dependency of the biodynamic responses on many factors, namely the hand forces, <b>hand-arm</b> posture and <b>vibration</b> intensity. This study aims at development of a hand-arm biodynamic model with considerations of the hand forces, and both the DPMI and power absorption measures, to enhance the uniqueness of the model. Methods Two different model structures are chosen for identifying the model parameters on the basis of measured DPMI and absorbed power characteristics of the hand-arm system under zh-axis vibration over a range of hand-grip and push forces. Owing to the strong influence of the hand-handle coupling forces, the models were initially derived for fixed hand forces, namely 30 N grip and 50 N push forces, as suggested in the ISO 10068 standard [2]. The equations of motion for the model are formulated and solved to compute both the DPMI and absorbed power responses. A constrained minimization function comprising weighted errors of both the DPMI and absorbed power is formulated and solved to identify the parameters. Alternate functions corresponding to different combinations of hand forces are then applied to identify hand-force dependent model parameters. Variations in the model parameters are investigated as functions of the grip, push and coupling forces through linear regression analysis. Regression-based models are formulated for deriving the hand-handle forces dependent model parameters. The validity of the model is also examined under selected combinations of hand forces. [...|$|R

Methods The baseline population consisted of 94 office and 147 manual workers at an engineering plant. Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) was assessed at baseline and at follow up (at 5, 10 and 15 years). A retrospective and a prospective cohort analysis of data were done. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure dose was defined as the product of exposure duration and the weighted <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure value according to ISO 5349 - 1. Results The retrospective/prospective incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon was 16 / 14 per 1000 exposure years among exposed and 2. 4 / 5. 0 per 1000 years among the not exposed. The retrospective dose response curve based on 4 dose classes showed that class 2, 3 and 4 had similar response and showed higher incidence than the not-exposed. The dose with RP response to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> corresponded to a 10 year A(8) value between 0. 4 – 1. 0 m/s 2.

However, reliable and valid assessment methods for vibration exposure at work are lacking. Measuring <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> objectively is often difficult and expensive, while often used information provided by manufacturers lacks detail. Therefore, a subjective <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> assessment method was tested on validity and inter-observer reliability. In an experimental protocol, sixteen tasks handling powered tools were executed by two workers. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was assessed subjectively by 16 observers according to the proposed subjective assessment method. As a gold standard reference, <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was measured objectively using a vibration measurement device. Weighted κ's were calculated to assess validity, intra-class-correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess inter-observer reliability. Inter-observer reliability of the subjective assessments depicting the agreement among observers can be expressed by an ICC of 0. 708 (0. 511 – 0. 873).

Methods We searched the Ovid/Medline and the Cochrane Library for articles discussing the etiology of osteonecrosis of the lunate published since the first description of KD in 1910 and up until July 2012 in English, French or German. Literature was classified by the level of evidence presented, the etiopathological hypothesis discussed, and the author's conclusion {{about the role of the}} etiopathological hypothesis. The causal relationship between KD and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> was elucidated by the Bradford Hill criteria. Results A total of 220 references was found. Of the included 152 articles, 140 (92 %) reached the evidence level IV (case series). The four most frequently discussed factors were negative ulnar variance (n= 72; 47 %), primary arterial ischemia of the lunate (n= 63; 41 %), trauma (n= 63; 41 %) and <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> (n= 53; 35 %). The quality of the cohort studies on <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> did not permit a meta-analysis to evaluate the strength of an association to KD.

Electrophysiological studies aimed at defining the nature of the injury have provided conflicting results. One reason for this lack of consistency might be the sparsity of published longitudinal etiological studies with both good assessment of exposure and a well-defined measure of disease. Against this background we measured conduction velocities in the hand after having assessed vibration exposure over 21 years in a cohort of manual workers. Methods The study group consisted of 155 male office and manual workers at an engineering plant that manufactured pulp and paper machinery. The study has a longitudinal design regarding exposure assessment and a cross-sectional design regarding the outcome of nerve conduction. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> dose was calculated as the product of self-reported occupational exposure, collected by questionnaire and interviews, and the measured or estimated <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2008. Distal motor latencies in median and ulnar nerves and sensory nerve conduction over the carpal tunnel and the finger-palm segments in the median nerve were measured in 2008. Before the nerve conduction measurement, the subjects were systemically warmed by a bicycle ergometer test. Results There were no differences in distal latencies between subjects exposed to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> and unexposed subjects, neither in the sensory conduction latencies of the median nerve, nor in the motor conduction latencies of the median and ulnar nerves.

Results of bivariate analysis showed that there is a great relationship-hand arm vibration exposure to Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (p-value 0. 001) and there is long-standing relationship-hand arm vibration exposure to Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (p-value 0. 001). The conclusion {{of this study is that}} there is a great relationship and long exposure to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> with Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome. Industry research is conducted also suggest owners must provide rotation on worker cutting process and rarefaction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} test method for {{evaluating}} the perceived vibration which occurs at the driver's hand in automotive steering wheel interface. The objective of the research was to develop frequency weightings for quantifying the human perception of steering wheel <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration.</b> Family of frequency weightings were developed from equal sensation curves obtained from the psychophysical laboratory experimental tests. The previous literature suggests that the only internationally standardised frequency weighting Wh is not accurate to predict human perception of steering wheel <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> (Amman et. al, 2005) because Wh was developed originally for health effects, not for the human perception. In addition, most of the data in <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> are based upon responses from male subjects (Neely and Burström, 2006) and previous studies based only on sinusoidal stimuli. Further, it has been continuously suggested by researchers (Gnanasekarna et al., 2006; Morioka and Griffin, 2006; Ajovalasit and Giacomin, 2009) that only one weighting is not optimal to estimate the human perception at all vibrational magnitudes. In order to address these problems, {{the investigation of the}} effect of gender, body mas...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{exposure}} to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> in tiller users, Forty users of tiller in northeastern provinces of Iran were examined to measure <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> parameters such as root mean square acceleration (RMS), total equivalent acceleration, Vibration Dose Value (VDV) and crest factor in three directions (x, y, and z) and various operating modes for comparing them with the relevant permitted standard levels. The <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> measurement was done according to the standards ISO 5349 - 1 and ISO 5349 - 2. The obtained results indicated that the exposure level in three modes of rota-tilling, transportation and idling were equal to 16. 95, 14. 16 and 8. 65 m/s 2, respectively. In all measurement modes, the exposure to vibration in the direction x was greater than that of y and z. Moreover, the average crest factor was calculated less than six. The highest vibration dose values were measured in rota-tilling mode when the tiller was in 2 nd  gear (60. 76 m/s 1. 75) and 1 st gear (56. 83 m/s 1. 75). The results indicated that the permitted working time was only few seconds and there was a risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The present study emphasizes on the need for interventional and control managerial measures to eliminate or reduce <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> transmitted to the tiller users' hands for avoiding major problems such as musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and  premature fatigue. In this regard, further studies are required to identify vibration sources in different types of tillers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> {{is a cause}} of <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> syndrome (HAVS). This disorder is characterized by neurological, vascular and musculoskeletal disturbances in upper extremities. In health screening of HAVS, cold provocation tests (CPTs) have been widely conducted to evaluate {{the severity of the}} damage in the peripheral vascular function. However, there is a wide difference in test conditions among countries and researchers. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released ISO 14835 - 1 in 2005, which proposed a water temperature of 12 °C and an immersion duration of 5 minutes in cold provocation tests (CPTs) for assessing peripheral vascular function. Many results have been reported since the ISO recommendation, but findings are no...|$|E
40|$|Background: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the principal}} clinical disorders in workers with <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> syndrome. Electrophysiological studies aimed at defining the nature of the injury have provided conflicting results. One reason for this lack of consistency might be the sparsity of published longitudinal etiological studies with both good assessment of exposure and a well-defined measure of disease. Against this background we measured conduction velocities in the hand after having assessed vibration exposure over 21 years in a cohort of manual workers. Methods: The study group consisted of 155 male office and manual workers at an engineering plant that manufactured pulp and paper machinery. The study has a longitudinal design regarding exposure assessment and a cross-sectional design regarding the outcome of nerve conduction. <b>Hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> dose was calculated as the product of self-reported occupational exposure, collected by questionnaire and interviews, and the measured or estimated <b>hand-arm</b> <b>vibration</b> exposure in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2008. Distal motor latencies in median and ulnar nerves and sensory nerve conduction over the carpal tunnel and the finger-palm segments in the median nerve were measured in 2008. Before the nerve conduction measurement, the subjects were systemically warmed by a bicycle ergometer test...|$|E
