40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a fixation device for internally fixing fractures. The fixation device has an elongated support plate and a transverse plate and a fin member extending transversely from the elongated support plate. The elongated support plate and the transverse plate define {{a plurality of}} holes for receiving <b>fixing</b> <b>elements</b> to mount the fixation device onto a bone. The holes can be so located that the <b>fixing</b> <b>elements</b> can prevent the fixation device from rotating relatively to the bone after the fixation device is mounted onto the bone. Additionally, the fin member is formed to be more flexible than the transverse plate. Thereby, the fin member can be bent {{to conform to the}} contour of the bone for fixing or stabilizing a fractured fragment. As a result, the fixation device can both support the injured bone and fix/stabilize the fractured fragment. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Extracortical Clamp Device (ECD) {{is a tool}} that, unlike {{conventional}} {{wires and}} pins, does not perforate long bone cortex. Therefore, its use simplifies methods of combined and consequtive use of internal and external fixation, osteosynthesis in periprosthetic fractures and deformities. Purpose of the study - to compare the rate of complications and their structure depending on extracortical clamp device application and conventional transosseous elements in combined external fixation of femur. Materials and methods. We analyzed the complications arising in treatment of 66 patients with frames where ECD were used (group «ECD»). The results were compared {{with the results of}} treatment 29 patients, when utilizing combination of external and internal fixation, external fixation device included conventional transosseous elements only (group «W-P»).

40|$|The Tore Supra tokamak {{is being}} {{transformed}} in an x-point divertor fusion device {{in the frame}} of the WEST (W-for tungsten-Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) project, launched in support to the ITER tungsten divertor strategy. The WEST project aims to test W monoblock Plasma Facing Units (PFU) under long plasma discharge (up to 1000 s), with thermal loads of the same magnitude as those expected for ITER. Therefore the divertor is a key component of the WEST project, and so is its support structure, which has to handle strong mechanical loads. The WEST upper and lower divertor are made of 12 30 ° sectors, each one composed of 38 PFU that can be made of tungsten, CuCrZr or graphite. A generic 316 L stainless steel 30 ° conic support plate is used to hold the 38 PFU together, regardless of their material. The PFUs are fixed on the support plate thanks to 152 Xm 19 stainless steel <b>fixing</b> <b>elements</b> (4 per PFU), and in each of this fixing element an Aluminium-Nickel-Bronze alloy (Al-Ni-Br) pin is engaged in a slotted hole, in order to allow thermal expansion in the length direction of the PFU. The support plate is fixed on the divertor coil casing thanks to 10 M 10 screws. Mechanicals loads which act on the PFUs are transmitted to the support plate through the <b>fixing</b> <b>elements.</b> These loads are due to Vertical Displacement Event (VDE), disruptions and thermal expansion of the PFU. First the different load cases, PFU configurations and scenario are presented. Then an ANSYS plastic mechanical simulation is performed in order to validate the number of cycles of the support plate for each scenario: 30 000 cycles in steady-state and 3000 cycles in VDE. Finally reactions forces from the previous ANSYS simulation are used in order to calculate the stress in the M 10 screws...|$|E
40|$|A new clasp to fix small saddle {{prostheses}} {{was designed}} {{to improve the quality}} of prosthetic unilateral free-end saddle restoration. Unlike the known ones, the clasp can be adapted for clinical crowns of any height (particularly useful for low crowns) as no standard elements are required to be fixed on prosthesis. Prosthesis retention is independent of the height of coronal part and the evidence of its survey line. Gentle preparation of abutment teeth allows grinding off hard tooth issues minimally. The combination of <b>fixing</b> <b>elements</b> of a single clasp provides sufficient fixation to achieve high masticatory efficiency and prosthesis spatial stabilization but at the same time only partially limits its lability in mastication.

40|$|There {{has been}} shown the {{efficiency}} of using attachments that can be adapted for clinical crowns of any height. The combination of <b>fixing</b> <b>elements</b> of an attachment determines sufficient fixation to provide high masticatory efficiency, and spatial stabilization of a denture, {{but at the same}} time it restricts partially, not completely, denture lability when functioning that is typical of rigid attachments and telescopic systems. The restricted lability determines a reduced load on parodontium of abutment teeth due to the redistribution of a part of masticating pressure on alveolar mucosa. This attachment provides the distribution of masticating pressure along the long axis of an abutment tooth; it is physiological, and significantly reduces the risk of traumatic occlusion, mobility, and displacement of abutment teeth. The reduced load on abutment teeth parodontium suggests expansion of indications for using small saddle dentures with this attachment in patients with periodontal diseases complicated by partial loss of teeth...|$|E

40|$|Road {{design is}} carried out by highway {{planning}} authorities and engineering offices and is still separated into three elements: the horizontal and vertical alignment plans and the cross-section. The three-dimensional picture of the road, which enables road users to adapt their driving style, is not obtained until these 3 design elements are superimposed on each other. In order to avoid any possible geometric design errors caused by separate processing and the subsequent superimposition of the plans, basic mathematical and design factors {{have been developed to}} allow a three-dimensional geometrical design methodology. The three-dimensional axis consists of a sequence of three-dimensional <b>elements</b> (<b>fixed</b> <b>elements,</b> dialogue elements and coupling <b>elements).</b> <b>Fixed</b> <b>elements</b> should always be selected if it is unnecessary to introduce any variation to the course of the axis based on the design conditions. However, if the idea is to adjust the design of the road to match existing geometrical constraints to an even better degree at individual points, dialogue elements must be used.

40|$|The article {{covers the}} problem of {{applicability}} of finite-element and engineering methods {{to the development of}} a model of interaction between pipeline structures and the environment in the complex conditions with a view to the simulation and projection of exogenous geological processes, trustworthy assessment of their impacts on the pipeline, and the testing of varied calculation methodologies. Pipelining in the areas that have a severe continental climate and permafrost soils is accompanied by cryogenic and exogenous processes and developments. It may also involve the development of karst and/or thermokarst. The adverse effect of the natural environment is intensified by the anthropogenic impact produced onto the natural state of the area, causing destruction of forests and other vegetation, changing the ratio of soils in the course of the site planning, changing the conditions that impact the surface and underground waters, and causing the thawing of the bedding in the course of the energy carrier pumping, etc. The aforementioned consequences are not covered by effective regulatory documents. The latter constitute general and incomplete recommendations in this respect. The appropriate mathematical description of physical processes in complex heterogeneous environments is a separate task to be addressed. The failure to consider the above consequences has repeatedly caused both minor damages (denudation of the pipeline, insulation stripping) and substantial accidents; the rectification of their consequences was utterly expensive. Pipelining produces a thermal impact on the environment; it may alter the mechanical properties of soils and de-frost the clay. The stress of the pipeline is one of the principal factors that determines its strength and safety. The pipeline stress exposure caused by loads and impacts (self-weight, internal pressure, etc.) may be calculated in advance, and the accuracy of these calculations is sufficient for practical implementation. Stress and strain caused by other factors (groundwater supports, anchors, <b>fixing</b> <b>elements)</b> may only be identified on location. The impact of other factors (temperature, permafrost thawing, karst phenomena and landslides, etc.) may be identified as approximate values.
