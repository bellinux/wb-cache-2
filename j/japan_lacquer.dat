5000|$|Japan black (also called simply japan) is a lacquer or varnish {{suitable}} for many substrates but known especially {{for its use}} on iron and steel. It is so named due {{to the history of}} black lacquer being associated in the West with products from Japan. Its high bitumen content provides a protective finish that is durable and dries quickly. This allowed japan black to be used extensively in the production of automobiles in the early 20th century in the United States. It can also be called <b>japan</b> <b>lacquer</b> and Brunswick black. Used as a verb, japan means [...] "to finish in japan black." [...] Thus japanning and japanned are terms describing the process and its products.|$|E

50|$|Gilsonite-brand uintahite's {{earliest}} applications included paints for buggies and emulsions for beer-vat lining. It {{was used}} by Ford Motor Company as a principal component of the <b>japan</b> black <b>lacquer</b> used {{on most of the}} Ford Model T cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} [...] "any drink" [...] methods using bottles {{were similar}} to Hocus Pocus, simply on a smaller scale. Most variations used {{what appeared to be}} a bottle but was actually a tin container <b>japanned</b> (<b>lacquered)</b> green to appear like glass. The internal area is divided into sections and each one empties into a tube that ends just short of the neck. Very small holes drilled into the bottle allow them to be selected in the same fashion as Hocus Pocus, with the magician's hand holding the bottle so their fingers cover the holes; lifting one starts the pour. The tea kettle varieties simply moved the holes to the handle. A slight variation on the theme is the Magic Funnel, which uses a two-walled funnel holding liquid between the walls. The magician pours a small amount of liquid through the funnel as normal, but it continues to pour when they lift their finger from a hole on the handle.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{machines}} {{in this model}} series are painted in <b>Japan</b> black <b>lacquer,</b> {{but some of the}} later variants (127-12, 127-14, 127-23, 128-8, 128-12, 128-14, and 128-18) were instead finished in the newly fashionable, low-glare [...] "black wrinkle" [...] (aka [...] "Godzilla" [...] or [...] "black crinkle") finish. [...] They were all then 'ornamented' with extensive eye-catching decals. [...] Common decal sets have names and are shown below; alternatively, many machines carry nondescript floral patterns.|$|R
5000|$|A lacquer-like coating {{material}} called kinshitsu (金漆) {{used to be}} made from the sap. The polyacetylenes in the plant sap were polymerised by sunlight to produce the hard resin varnish. Two {{other members of the}} Araliaceae, Dendropanax trifidus and Gamblea innovans, may also have been sources for this <b>lacquer</b> in <b>Japan.</b> The <b>lacquer</b> was used to prevent corrosion of suits of armour and helmets, with related species providing a similar lacquer used in China during the T'ang dynasty and in Korea.|$|R
50|$|The {{hand tools}} used to fashion the musical {{instrument}} parts are from Switzerland and the USA and the CNC machines are from <b>Japan.</b> The <b>lacquer</b> used is imported from Britain and the USA and the soldering powder is imported from Canada. All of the KHS manufacturing facilities in Taiwan and China are ISO 9001 certified. KHS has made musical instruments for other {{companies such as}} Buffet Crampon (Evette), Vito and Keilwerth ST-90 series IV saxophones, B&S trumpets and Courtois cornets. KHS has made Olds, Blessing, Riley and Arbiter Jazz saxophones.|$|R
5000|$|While most {{automobile}} producers limited {{themselves to}} a single color combination, and Ford relied exclusively on the fast-drying <b>Japan</b> Black <b>lacquer</b> which cured {{in a matter of}} hours, Jordan automobiles were available in no less than three colors of red - [...] "Apache Red", [...] "Mercedes Red", and [...] "Savage Red"- as well as [...] "Ocean Sand Gray", [...] "Venetian Green", [...] "Briarcliff Green", [...] "Egyptian Bronze", [...] "Liberty Blue", and [...] "Chinese Blue". Black was also available. The most flamboyant of color schemes was on the four-passenger Sport model which could be ordered in [...] "Submarine Gray", with khaki top and orange wheels.|$|R
50|$|The growing {{power of}} English East India Company {{resulted}} in increased imports of exotic commodities from China and Japan, including tea, porcelain and lacquer, and chintzes from India. This {{led to a}} craze for chinoiserie, reflected {{on the development of}} imitation <b>lacquer</b> (<b>Japanning),</b> blue and white decoration on ceramics, flat-chased scenes of Chinese-style figures and landscapes on silver and new forms of silver as teapots, as well as colourful Indian-style crewelwork bed-hangings and curtains.|$|R
25|$|Roofing {{shingles}} {{account for}} most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make <b>Japan</b> black, a <b>lacquer</b> known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker. Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.|$|R
5000|$|In French {{interior}} design, vernis Martin {{is a type}} (or {{a number}} of types) of <b>Japanning</b> or imitation <b>lacquer</b> named after the French Martin brothers: Guillaume, Etienne-Simon, Robert and Julien. They ran a leading factory from between about 1730 and 1770, and were vernisseurs du roi. But they did not invent the process, nor were they the only producers, nor does the term cover a single formula or technique. [...] It imitated Chinese lacquer and European subjects and was applied {{to a wide variety}} of items, from furniture to coaches. It is said to have been made by heating oil and copal and then adding Venetian turpentine.|$|R
40|$|Urushi is the Japanese {{term for}} the sap of the lacquer tree Toxicodendron vernicifluum, a natural {{crosslinking}} polymer {{that has been used}} for thousands of years as a durable decorative coating. Photodegradation combined with fluctuations in relative humidity cause the formation of microcracks that lead to a reduction in gloss and eventual loss of the surface. In <b>Japan,</b> historic <b>lacquer</b> objects are often conserved with urushi-based methods called urushi-gatame and suri urushi. This paper compares the potential effectiveness of these treatments for enhancing the long-term preservation of historic photodegraded Japanese lacquer surfaces. Images of naturally aged lacquer samples were made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) before they were treated using urushi-gatame and suri urushi. Samples were then artificially aged, imaged with the SEM, and assessed using a vertical scanning interferometry profilometer. The results indicated that urushi-based treatments may be problematic for export- type lacquers with a proteinaceous ground. While further work is required, this preliminary study suggests that, excluding the formation of new microcracking, three dilute urushi applications may represent the minimum urushi-based treatment required to enhance the long-term preservation of a photodegraded lacquer surface significantly...|$|R
5000|$|Oiran (...) , {{who were}} {{high-ranking}} courtesans of the feudal period in <b>Japan,</b> wore tall, <b>lacquered</b> koma-geta or mitsu-ashi (literally, [...] "three legs"). Unlike geisha and maiko, who only entertained by conversation, singing, and dancing, oiran and tayuu {{were the highest}} rank {{in the hierarchy of}} prostitution in the pleasure quarters. Whereas geisha and maiko wear tabi socks, the oiran and tayuu preferred not to do so (even in winter) and their toes can be seen poking out under many layers of kimono while wearing these tall geta. These shoes were most likely worn to ensure there was no confusion between geisha, maiko and oiran / tayuu. One sometimes sees maiko hobbling along in okobo, but the pace must have been even more arduous in these tall geta.|$|R
40|$|People of the Jomon period (currently dated {{from about}} 14, 000 B. C. {{to the first}} {{millennium}} B. C.) began to make lacquer ornaments as early as 7000 B. C. and by the fourth millennium B. C. were creating elaborately decorated, low-fired pottery vessels that {{appear to have been}} used for feasting. In the Final period of the Jomon, grave goods appear in a substantial percentage of burials. Without reliance on agriculture, Jomon people appear to have achieved a high level of social complexity. However, the evidence from a few case studies concerning lacquer, elaborate pottery, and burials seems to show that while part-time specialization provided a wealth of rich material culture, sustained hierarchy was not achieved and there was an emphasis on exchange and solidarity, as in other middle-range societies. This article reviews new material and debates. KEYWORDS: Jomon, <b>Japan,</b> social complexity, <b>lacquer,</b> ceramics, burials, craft production, complex hunter-gatherers...|$|R
50|$|Ireland was succeeded at the Golden Cross by Robert Ellis and then, in the 1840s, by the {{brothers}} James and William Creech. In 1849, James Creech got into financial difficulties and, after borrowing money against {{the contents of}} the pub, all the property’s goods were seized and sold by the Sheriff of Sussex to pay Creech's creditors. Thanks to the subsequent debt collector's record, we have {{a detailed description of the}} inn's interior and furnishings in 1849. The 20-room inn offered drink, food, lodgings and recreations to gentlemen of comfortable means. On the top floor were four bedrooms, furnished with <b>Japanned</b> (black <b>lacquered)</b> and mahogany bedsteads, dressing tables, wash stands and chests of drawers; white dimity, leather-covered armchairs; and Kidderminster or Brussels carpets. On the second floor were three slightly bigger rooms, with four-poster beds. On the first floor were four comfortable sitting rooms, with open fires, velvet-covered oak chairs and mahogany tables. The third sitting room had a piano in a mahogany case. The first floor also had a ballroom (where the current theatre is). Its fittings included a mahogany board for the game of Racehorse Balls and 20 brown ware spittoons. The ground floor featured the bar, plus a parlour (with 20 iron spittoons) and a coffee room, with a writing desk. The bar featured an 18 x 3 ft counter and a spirit fountain with eight brass taps. The kitchen was well equipped, with numerous pans, fish steamers and a five-foot kitchen range.|$|R
