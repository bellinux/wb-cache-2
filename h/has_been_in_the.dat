50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} <b>the</b> cultural adaption of Filipinos who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy. Three {{groups of}} Filipinos {{were compared to}} similarly composed groups of Americans: those who were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy between 1 and 10 years, and those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function of time spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 11-25 years).|$|R

5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
5|$|Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash (Italian: Dinamismo di un cane al guinzaglio), {{sometimes}} called Dog on a Leash or Leash in Motion, is a 1912 painting by Italian Futurist painter Giacomo Balla. It {{was influenced by}} the artist's fascination with chronophotograpic studies of animals in motion. It is considered one of his best-known works, {{and one of the most}} important works in Futurism, though it received mixed critical reviews. The painting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of the Albright–Knox Art Gallery since 1984.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, {{an organ}} by Gray & Davison of London was {{installed}} in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position {{at the front of}} the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> care of David Wells of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, {{two years}} after Poland regained independence, the {{painting}} was moved to Kraków, where from 1923 it was displayed {{in the building of}} the Polish Sejm. The painting was hidden by the Polish resistance during World War II, when Poland was occupied by the Germans. After the war the painting was transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw, and occasionally displayed in the Sejm building. Since 1984 the painting <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, where Matejko himself declared he would like the painting to be shown. The painting is displayed in the anteroom of the Chamber of Senators, where the Constitution was adopted. The painting was restored in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Keswick {{became a}} Local Government District in 1853 and an urban {{district}} with three wards in 1894, reflecting its {{growth in the}} latter part of the 19th century. The new urban district's northern boundary was extended from the Greta to the railway, taking in Great Crosthwaite and part of Underskiddaw in 1899. In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and Allerdale Borough Council. Since 2010 Keswick <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Copeland parliamentary constituency, having previously been part of Workington and before that Penrith and The Border.

5|$|Miran Pastourma is a famed pastourma and sujuk charcuterie {{business}} and market in Athens, Greece. The {{market has been}} in operation since 1922.

Miran is considered the largest company {{of its kind in the}} European Union. The flavour of pastourma coming from the historical enterprise permeates Euripides Street in the centre of Athens. Miran and its neighbor Arapian Cold Cuts are considered two of the historical establishments of Athens.

5|$|Private flying is most {{associated}} with the traditional form of factory-produced two and four-seater, single piston-engine training and touring aircraft. Examples of these are the Cessna 152, Cessna 172, and Piper PA28 Cherokee, all with their origins in the 1950s, and the more modern designs of Cirrus. The average cost per hour to fly such aircraft has been estimated to be £133, compared to an estimated £77 per hour for gliders, and a reported £35 per hour for microlights. Recent trends have seen {{an increase in the}} use of microlights, and also in recreational helicopter flying following the introduction of smaller and cheaper machines such as the Robinson R22 and R44. Another growth area in private flying in recent years <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of amateur built aircraft, such as the Van's Aircraft RV-4 and the Europa.|$|E
