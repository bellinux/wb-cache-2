500|$|In June 1972, {{the band}} reconvened in Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next album at the Record Plant. The {{recording}} process was plagued with problems, many {{as a result of}} substance abuse issues. While struggling to record the song [...] "Cornucopia" [...] after [...] "sitting {{in the middle of the}} room, just doing drugs", Ward was nearly fired from the band. [...] "I hated the song, there were some patterns that were just... horrible" [...] Ward said. [...] "I nailed it in the end, but the reaction I got was the cold shoulder from everybody. It was like 'Well, <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> you're not being of any use right now.' I felt like I'd blown it, I was about to get fired". The album was originally titled Snowblind after the song of the same name, which deals with cocaine abuse. The record company changed the title at the last minute to Black Sabbath Vol. 4, with Ward stating [...] "There was no Volume 1, 2 or 3, so it's a pretty stupid title really".|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I decided I would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve DeBerg won the {{starting}} quarterback job over Steve Young in the preseason, but lost it after throwing seven interceptions in the season opener against the San Francisco 49ers, and another two the next week against the Minnesota Vikings. Nose tackle Dave Logan summed up the team's condition after the 49ers game by saying, [...] "the teams we play do not respect us". [...] Players coming from winning teams to the Buccaneers, such as Marvin Powell and Tyrone Keys, found themselves shocked by the constant losing and discouraged by the team's easy acceptance of losses. Keys in particular thought that the Buccaneers were too used to losing, and not bothered by it. Young later criticized the team's will to win, saying that [...] "if they could hide for four quarters and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> they would be happy". Powell, one of the highest-paid offensive linemen in the league, was placed on injured reserve {{with a knee injury}} after only a few games. An embarrassing loss to the New Orleans Saints was followed by the release of Jimmie Giles and Kevin House, the top two receivers in Buccaneer history at the time, and former starting fullback Ron Springs. This upset several club veterans, and weakened an offense that already had to compensate for a defense that had allowed over 1,000 rushing yards in the previous four games. League perception was that the Buccaneers were replacing older veterans with younger players who were incapable of taking their places. Said an executive from another team of Giles' replacement, [...] "Calvin Magee runs a 5.2 40...We wouldn't even bring him into camp". Rumors, denied by Culverhouse, began to circulate that secret meetings were being held to arrange replacing Bennett with Steve Spurrier. Nathan Wonsley, the rookie free-agent running back whose play {{was one of the few}} bright spots in the season, was lost to the team after suffering dislocated neck vertebrae during a week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears. After the abnormally large number of injuries suffered during the Bears game, the Buccaneers ended their pattern of suffering fourth-quarter collapses in close games, instead losing their last seven games by an average of over 21 points. With Jerry Bell, a tight end who played a [...] "U-back" [...] position that was crucial to Tampa Bay's running game, suffering a broken ankle in the same game, the Buccaneers were forced to re-sign Ron Springs just to have enough runners in their backfield. Culverhouse, saying that he had made the decision only minutes prior, fired Bennett at a press conference on Dec. 29. Bennett, who had spoken to Culverhouse earlier the same morning, was unaware that he was to be let go. Culverhouse met with Ray Perkins and offered him the Tampa Bay coaching job only hours after firing Bennett. The firing was criticized by some, who felt that no steps were being taken to address the front-office problems that were the real root of the Buccaneers' woes. This criticism was echoed by safety David Greenwood, by then with the Packers, who pointed out the team's cheapness by recounting a 1985 incident in which he wanted to keep a football as a game ball after catching it for an interception. Executive Phil Krueger demanded that Greenwood pay $35 for the football.|$|E

[...] And sitting down, {{she began}} to play and sing a little French song, whose first line ran: [...] "Si on est jolie, jolie comme vous." [...] It was soft, gay, charming. If the girl cried, so much the better. But Noel did not cry. She seemed {{suddenly}} to have recovered all her self-possession. She spoke calmly, answered Leila's questions without emotion, and said she would go home. Leila went out with her, and walked some way {{in the direction of}} her home; distressed, but frankly at a loss. At the bottom of Portland Place Noel stopped and said: [...] "I'm quite all right now, Leila; thank you awfully. I shall <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and lie down. And I shall come to-morrow, the same as usual. Goodbye!" [...] Leila could only grasp the girl's hand, and say: [...] "My dear, that's splendid. There's many a slip--besides, it's war-time." ...|$|E

Aunt Beatrice has lots of {{children}} of her own and I don't believe she'll be a bit sorry when I go away. She's ashamed of my father 'cause he did a bad thing. But I'm not, no, sir.

6000|$|The {{old man was}} in a {{great state}} of {{distress}} about his other son, and {{early in the morning}} went to examine the ground where the fight had been. It was only too easily found; the sod was trampled down and branches broken as though a score of men had been engaged. Then he found his eldest son's cap, and a little farther away a sleeve of his coat; shreds and rags were numerous on the bramble bushes, and by and by he came on a pool of blood. [...] "They've kill 'n!" [...] he cried in despair, [...] "they've killed my poor boy!" [...] and straight to Rollston House he went to inquire, and was met by Harbutt himself, who came out limping, one boot on, the other foot bound up with rags, one arm in a sling and a cloth tied round his head. He was told that his son was alive and safe indoors and that he would be taken to Salisbury later in the day. [...] "His clothes be all torn to pieces," [...] added the keeper. [...] "You can <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> at once and git him others before the constable comes to take him." ...|$|E

50|$|Editor Roy Thomas, {{in charge}} of {{reviving}} the X-Men for Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975), told the creative team to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and create some characters for the new team. Dave Cockrum recalled:I <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> and Colossus {{was one of the}} first ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character's armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as-is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we're going to show him armored up, the legs should be bare like the arms. But Len Wein didn't like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn't armored up, and that we'd see his legs when he was armored up, due to the unstable molecules of his costume.|$|R

He told Pearl Davies [...] "Well it's not that we broke up at all, we <b>just</b> <b>went</b> <b>home</b> after a show, started to do other projects and just never seemed to get back to it.
