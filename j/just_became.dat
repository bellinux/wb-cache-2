25|$|Concerning Jewish holy sites, Jordan {{breached}} {{its commitment}} to appoint a committee to discuss, among other topics, free access of Jews to the holy sites under its jurisdiction, mainly in the Western Wall and the important Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives, as provided in the Article 8.2 of the Cease Fire Agreement between it and Israel dated April 3, 1949. Jordan permitted the paving of new roads in the cemetery, and tombstones were used for paving in Jordanian army camps. The Cave of Shimon the <b>Just</b> <b>became</b> a stable.|$|E
25|$|When {{the forces}} of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos {{strengthened}} the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They <b>just</b> <b>became</b> mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch {{their way to the}} Church.|$|E
25|$|A rescue {{operation}} from Andrew Flintoff and Vikram Solanki followed, pairing up for 79 before Solanki was caught at midwicket off Brad Hogg. Then, Flintoff was nearly stumped off Hogg's bowling, only {{to give a}} catch at long on {{later on in the}} over for 44. With England at 94 for 5, they needed seven and a half runs an over, with Kevin Pietersen and Geraint Jones at the crease. However, even Pietersen couldn't save them this time, as he was caught in the deep off Symonds for 19, {{and the rest of the}} match <b>just</b> <b>became</b> a task to bat out 50 overs. Thanks to Darren Gough, who made 46 not out (ironically, the top score of the innings), and a level-headed 11 not out from Steve Harmison, England made that, but lost by 57 runs – thus also losing the bonus point.|$|E

25|$|How do you sum {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{remarkable}} endings any of us will ever be fortunate enough to see? How do you sum {{up one of the}} most exciting bowl games ever contested? And how do you sum up what will one day be viewed as one of the most significant moments in the history of college football? I’m not exaggerating....Boise State beating Oklahoma in a New Year’s Day bowl game is college football’s equivalent to George Mason reaching the Final Four, with one extremely significant difference: George Mason had its chance to compete for the national title; Boise State does not. Like it or not, Boise State 43, Oklahoma 42 <b>just</b> <b>became</b> the single biggest argument to date for a college football playoff....Not only did they get in the game, they made a major statement on behalf of their mid-major brethren that none of us will soon forget.|$|E

[...] "I didn't want to go to Yucca Flats every other episode and transform it into Bizarro World by making the sky orange", recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: [...] "I think in the end the feel was that we wound up using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it <b>just</b> <b>became</b> the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?" ...|$|E
500|$|Though, {{according}} to acquaintances, {{many of his}} friends had heard nothing from him since his departure for Tahiti, his will made provision for a scholarship at Magdalene and named the college as his residuary legatee. His literary assets at death were valued at £5,007. Though Keable received a Protestant burial in Papeete, some accounts suggest {{that in the last}} weeks of his life he formally converted to Catholicism. Other commentators suggest the pagan sentiments he expressed about the birth of his new son as a riposte to social convention tend to indicate otherwise. Hugh Cecil argues that, at his death, Keable most likely <b>just</b> <b>became</b> [...] "able to reconcile his two ideals, romantic-erotic and religious, and could die peacefully accepting the rituals he loved." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} years of the Clinton administration, Moran was {{critical}} of the President: In 1998, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. He told Time magazine that [...] "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that <b>just</b> <b>became</b> too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters." [...] Moran is also reported to have told First Lady Hillary Clinton that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for impeachment, explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of [...] "dishonest and illegal conduct" [...] surrounding his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.|$|E

500|$|With filming {{beginning}} on May 21, 2007, [...] "It's Alive!" [...] marked the permanent relocation of production from Miami to Los Angeles. Five episodes {{of the first}} season were shot on location in Miami, which Cerone said was [...] "a bigger hassle than it was worth". Showtime programming chief Robert Greenblatt said that [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>became</b> impossible, production-wise, to shoot the whole show [...] ", because of the overlap between Dexters production window and Florida's hurricane season, making property insurance costly. A small crew flew to Miami with Hall and filmed, according to producer Sara Colleton, [...] "a lot of pieces—not just Dexter walking {{in and out of}} his door or car, but also scenes that we know we'll need and can use", which the writers then worked into the episode and others. For the episode, Biscayne Bay was substituted with a set in Los Angeles, while most on location scenes were filmed in and around San Pedro and Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|Æthelwulf died on 13 January 858. According to the Annals of St Neots, he {{was buried}} at Steyning in Sussex, but his body was later {{transferred}} to Winchester, probably by Alfred. Æthelwulf was succeeded by Æthelbald in Wessex and Æthelberht in Kent and the south-east. The prestige conferred by a Frankish marriage {{was so great that}} Æthelbald then wedded his step-mother Judith, to Asser's retrospective horror; he described the marriage as a [...] "great disgrace", and [...] "against God's prohibition and Christian dignity". When Æthelbald died only two years later, Æthelberht became King of Wessex as well as Kent, and Æthelwulf's intention of dividing his kingdoms between his sons was thus set aside. In the view of Yorke and Abels this was because Æthelred and Alfred were too young to rule, and Æthelberht agreed in return that his younger brothers would inherit the whole kingdom on his death, whereas Kirby and Nelson think that Æthelberht <b>just</b> <b>became</b> the trustee for his younger brothers' share of the bookland.|$|E
500|$|Brand New {{have been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most beloved and important bands of the emo genre. Their enduring following, described as [...] "cult-like", is notable in that their fanbase and legacy have continuously remained strong throughout their entire career whereas other bands from the 2000s emo scene have faded into obscurity. They have been widely praised by critics for creating artistic statements with their music instead of aiming for mainstream success like many of their contemporaries did. Ian Cohen of Pitchfork remarked, [...] "popular guitar music in 2017 has been undeniably shaped by Brand New, a band who has served not just as damaged role models but as a formative musical influence." [...] Spin declared that [...] "Brand New didn’t <b>just</b> <b>became</b> a band, they became a lifeline and sanctuary for thousands upon thousands of messed-up kids." [...] Ryan Bassil of Noisey declared Brand New [...] "to be crowned the best band of a generation." [...] Music writers have credited the eight-year gap between 2009's Daisy and 2017's Science Fiction as essential for the growth of Brand New's legacy in the music world.|$|E

500|$|With {{the arrival}} of warmer weather, the disease began to take a firmer hold. In the week 2–9 May, there were three {{recorded}} deaths in the parish of St Giles, four in neighbouring St Clement Danes and one each in St Andrew, Holborn and St Mary Woolchurch Haw. Only the last was actually inside the city walls. A Privy Council committee was formed to investigate methods to best {{prevent the spread of}} plague, and measures were introduced to close some of the ale houses in affected areas and limit the number of lodgers allowed in a household. In the city, the Lord Mayor issued a proclamation that all householders must diligently clean the streets outside their property, which was a householder's responsibility, not a state one (the city employed scavengers and rakers to remove the worst of the mess). Matters <b>just</b> <b>became</b> worse, and Aldermen were instructed to find and punish those failing their duty. As cases in St. Giles began to rise, an attempt [...] was made to quarantine the area and constables were instructed to inspect everyone wishing to travel and [...] contain inside vagrants or suspect persons.|$|E
500|$|After Jacobs {{decided that}} Evans {{would no longer}} play Pam, he began searching for another actress to play the character. The role was {{eventually}} won by then 28-year-old actress, Victoria Principal. Principal won the role over another finalist, Judith Chapman, who was known famously for her work in daytime television. Shortly after Principal's role on Fantasy Island, a friend pointed her {{in the direction of}} Dallas and [...] "a part in it that was written for you". [...] Eventually, Principal received a copy of the script [...] "and read it and thought [...] was absolutely right". Acting as her own agent, she set up a meeting with the producers of Dallas. Lee Rich, an executive producer in 1979, recounted: [...] "We had all heard rumors about Victoria. This is a small town. Victoria's background, her so-called past, was a plus. We felt that she had experienced life and could understand the part." [...] Jacobs later said, [...] "Victoria, of all the actors, went for the role the most aggressively. And that sort of determination <b>just</b> <b>became</b> part of the character." [...] Prior to being cast in Dallas, Principal had starred in a few small roles in movies and television specials. These works include Earthquake in 1974, and Fantasy Island in 1977.|$|E
500|$|When Ehrich first {{stepped into}} the role, he stated: [...] "There [...] so many places where they can go with this role. I have just gotten back into Genoa City. It’s such a {{vulnerable}} age, so really there [...] so many different paths I can go down. And there’s so much that can happen. I’m very, very curious to see where they go with it." [...] When asked how he would describe Fenmore, Ehrich said: [...] "He is definitely figuring himself out. You’re {{on the brink of}} adulthood. You have to start taking a bit of responsibility. [...] your hormones start kicking in hardcore. So he’s definitely going through some stuff." [...] In another interview, he described Fenmore as [...] "trying to find his place in the world", saying: [...] "When Fen first came back, I think he was at a very vulnerable age and was trying to find his place in the world; just really figure out who he is. He has such a strict dad, who <b>just</b> <b>became</b> D.A., so of course his morals are so strong and everything is black and white, right or wrong." [...] Luke Kerr of Zap2it wrote that the character had become [...] "creepy" [...] during his angst and acting out.|$|E

500|$|Sevigny {{was cast}} in the {{independent}} drama Boys Don't Cry (1999) after director Kimberly Peirce saw her performance in The Last Days of Disco. Sevigny's role in Boys Don't Cry—a biographical film of trans man Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska in 1993—was responsible for her rise to prominence and her mainstream success. Sevigny played Lana Tisdel, {{a young woman who}} fell in love with Teena, initially unaware {{of the fact that he}} was biologically female and continued the relationship despite learning about his birth gender. Boys Don't Cry received high praise from critics, and was a moderate box-office success. Sevigny's performance was singled out as one of the film's strong points and was widely embraced as one of the best acted films of that year: The Los Angeles Times stated that Sevigny [...] "plays the role with haunting immediacy", Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times stated that [...] "it is Sevigny who provides our entrance into the story" [...] and Rolling Stone wrote that Sevigny gives a [...] "performance that burns into the memory". Director Kimberly Peirce echoed the same feelings of the critics: [...] "Chloë just surrendered to the part. She watched videos of Lana. She <b>just</b> <b>became</b> her very naturally. She's not one of those Hollywood actresses who diets and gets plastic surgery. You never catch her acting." [...] The role earned Sevigny Best Supporting Actress nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Sevigny won an Independent Spirit Award, a Satellite Award, and a Sierra Award for her performance.|$|E

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{the news that}} his show was canceled in 2007, Lopez criticized president of ABC Entertainment Steve McPherson for using racially motivated reasons for his decision.

[...] {{in reference to the}} short-lived sitcom Cavemen, which was replacing George Lopez on the schedule. Cavemen garnered a sharply negative reception from critics and viewers, and was canceled after 13 episodes. Lopez blamed ABC for causing over a hundred of his show's staff to become jobless.|$|E
