There are two major atomisation techniques used in spray forming: centrifugal atomisation for the manufacture of near net shape rings and <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> for the manufacture of billets, tube and strip.|$|E

SEM {{results show that the}} film morphology becomes much smoother when the voltage is applied. By four probe measurement it was found that sheet resistance got reduced (from 400 Ω/□ to 75 Ω/□) and I-V measurement indicated conductivity enhancement due to the application of electric field. The process duration is only 2 - 3 min and the range of applied voltage is quite low as compared to other techniques...|$|R
40|$|A {{high speed}} digital {{analysis}} technique {{has been used}} to study the atomisation plume of a superheated sample of Ni–Al in a close coupled <b>gas</b> atomiser. The <b>atomisation,</b> incorporating a generic melt nozzle and die design was captured using a Kodak high speed digital analyser at a frame rate of 18 k frames per second. The resulting 65 536 frames were then analysed using a specially designed routine, which calculates values of optical brightness and position of the intensity maximum for all frames and performs Fourier analysis on the sequence. The data produced from this analysis show that the plume, pulses at low frequencies (< 25 Hz) and precesses at higher frequencies (∼ 360 Hz) around the atomiser's centreline. To aid investigation into the origins of this precession and other phenomena it was decided to conduct further experiments using an analogue system. The analogue atomiser reproduces the important features of the full atomiser but instead of atomising molten metal, the analogue system atomises water, providing a quick and easy way of testing the effects of changing parameters. Using this system {{it was found that the}} precession of the melt plume is independent of the atomiser's gas inlet pressure but strongly dependent on both the die and melt nozzle's geometry...|$|R
40|$|Particle size {{is a key}} quality {{parameter}} of {{a powder}} detergent as it determines its performance, the bulk density and {{the look and feel}} of the product. Consequently, it is essential that particle size is controlled to ensure the consistency of performance when comparing new formulations. The majority of study reported in the literature relating to particle size control, focuses on the spray produced by the atomisation technique. One approach advocated to achieve particle size control is the manipulation of the ratio of the mass slurry rate and mass flow rate of <b>gas</b> used for <b>atomisation.</b> Within this study, ratio control was compared with an automatic cascade loop approach using online measurements of the powder particle size on a small-scale pilot plant. It was concluded that cascade control of the mean particle size, based on manipulating the mass flow rate of gas, resulted in tighter, more responsive control. The effect of a ratio change varied with different formulations and different slurry rates. Furthermore, changes in slurry rate caused complications, as the impact on particle size growth in the dryer is non-linear and difficult to predict. The cascade loop enables further study into the effect of particle size on detergent performance...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of overspray (droplets missing the emerging billet), splashing of material from the billet surface, and material ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the overspray powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the overspray powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|E
50|$|Investigations {{show that}} in all cases <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> of molten metal yields {{a broad range of}} droplet diameters, {{typically}} in the range 10-600 µm diameter, with a mean diameter of ~100 µm. Droplet diameter governs the dynamic behaviour of the droplet in flight which in turn determines the time available for in-flight cooling which is critical in controlling the resulting billet microstructure. At a flight distance of 300-400 mm, predictions show droplet velocities of 40-90 ms−1 for droplet diameters in the range 20-150 µm respectively, compared to measured velocities of ~100 ms−1, and at distances of up to 180 mm from the atomiser, droplets were still being accelerated by the gas. Droplets cool in-flight predominantly by convection and radiation, and can experience undercooling of up to 300 C prior to nucleation. Models and experimental measurements show that small droplets (<50 µm) very rapidly become fully solid prior to deposition, 50-200 µm droplets will be typically semi-solid and droplets of diameters >200 µm will be liquid at deposition. The range of droplet dynamic and thermal histories result in a billet top surface of 0.3 to 0.6 solid fraction. Not all material that impacts the surface is incorporated into the billet: some solid droplets will bounce or splash-off the billet top surface or be directed out of the deposition region by turbulent gas movement in the chamber. The proportion of droplets that impact the surface compared to the proportion that are incorporated into the billet has been termed the sticking efficiency: dependent on the geometric sticking which {{is a function of the}} spray angle relative to substrate and the thermal sticking efficiency dependent on spray and billet solid/liquid fraction.|$|E
40|$|High-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> (HPGA) {{technology}} has been widely employed as an effective method to produce fine spherical metal powders. The physics of <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> is dominated by rapid momentum and heat transfer between the gas and melt phases, and further complicated by break-up and solidification. A numerical model is developed to simulate the critical droplet break-up during the atomisation. By integration of the droplet break-up model with the flow field generated high-pressure gas nozzle, this numerical model is able to provide quantitative assessment for atomisation process. To verify the model performance, the melt stream is initialized to large droplets varying from 1 to 5 mm diameters and injected into the gas flow field for further fragmentation and the break-up dynamics are described in details according to the droplet input parameters...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{equations}} governing droplet {{dynamic and}} thermal behaviour during spray forming have been analysed {{to give an}} approximate expression for the spray solid fraction {{as a function of}} the process parameters of the form fS = a 1 + a 2 Δ T + a 3 frac(υg i z 2 / 3, over(M, ̇) 1 / 2) where vgi is the initial <b>gas</b> velocity at <b>atomisation,</b> Ṁ is the molten alloy mass flow rate, ΔT is the molten alloy super heat above the liquidus, and z is the axial distance. This expression provides an extremely convenient relationship to indicate the variation of spray solid fraction during spray forming, which is a key variable controlling final as sprayed billet microstructure. Predicted N 2 atomised Al- 4 wt%Cu spray solid fractions based upon the analytical expression have been compared with equivalent results obtained from a detailed computer model described previously in Parts I and II under a wide range of conditions of vgi, Ṁ, ΔT and z and gave good agreement. Best-fit values of a 1, a 2 and a 3 were 1. 9 × 10 - 1, - 1. 4 × 10 - 3 and 1. 3 × 10 - 3 respectively, in good agreement with predicted values. © 1995 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|THIS DOCUMENT IS CLOSED ACCESS. Modern low {{emission}} combustion {{systems are}} more prone to combustion instabilities due to operation at lean conditions. The response of the airflow passing through the injector to incident acoustic waves is therefore of interest. Airflow fluctuations can initiate, for example, perturbations in stoichiometry and velocity that are subsequently delivered into the heat release region. In the case of liquid fuelled <b>gas</b> turbines the <b>atomisation</b> process will also be affected. Such effects can lead to further unsteady heat release and the generation of acoustic waves, thereby leading to combustion instability. This paper describes experimental measurements {{and the development of a}} numerical methodology by which the unsteady airflow response of complex, modern, low emission fuel injectors can be characterised. Single and two passage injector configurations have been investigated which broadly capture many of the features associated with modern fuel injectors. Although targeted at low emission (lean burn) liquid fuelled injector geometries, the methodology developed is thought applicable to a wide range of injector configurations. Initially experimental measurements were used to characterise the overall acoustic impedance of each injector design over a range of frequencies. Such information is also required for the low order thermo-acoustic network models, as typically used in the design process, to predict the stability of the combustion system. In addition to the experimental measurements a methodology was developed using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations in which acoustic boundary conditions were implemented to reproduce the experimental scenarios. Interrogation of the pressure field enabled similar data analysis techniques to be applied to the numerical data for determining the injector acoustic characteristics. Fidelity of the numerical simulations is confirmed by the excellent agreement between the experimental data and numerical simulations. Furthermore, the unsteady flow field within the passages is difficult to access experimentally, but can be examined in more detail from the simulation results. In this way an improved understanding of the passage flows and their individual responses to the incident acoustic pressure waves can be obtained. The numerical approach is aimed at providing a computationally efficient and economic tool for predicting the acoustic characteristics of the complex geometries typical of modern fuel injector designs. Using this tool injector designs with different acoustic response characteristics can be developed relatively quickly...|$|R
40|$|Black liquor {{gasification}} at {{high temperature}} is a promising {{alternative to the}} conventional recovery boiler process used in chemical pulping today. In the black liquor gasification process black liquor is atomised by a gas- assisted nozzle and sprayed into a reactor where it is directly gasified by an reaction with oxygen steam and carbon dioxide. A proper atomisation of black liquor {{is very important for}} the performance of the black liquor gasification process. The work presented in this report was performed to gain understanding and aid in optimisation of the atomisation process in the current black liquor gasification process. The method used was spray visualisations by shadowgraphy using intensive lighting and high speed photography. The experiments were carried out in the spray test rig at the Energy Technology Centre (ETC) in Piteå and performed at elevated ambient pressures and different operational conditions. The first part of the work was to improve the current spray test rig at ETC considering the window purging system to avoid droplets on the sight windows, the nitrogen delivering system used for atomisation and a black liquor heating and delivering system. The final setup of the spray test rig made it possible to keep the optical access windows clean, control the temperature of the <b>atomisation</b> <b>gas</b> and pump and heat the black liquor up to 115 °C. The second part of the current work was to perform visualisations of the black liquor atomisation process in the improved spray test rig. Variables like fluid temperatures, ambient pressure, nitrogen gas flow and black liquor flow were changed in order to see how these influence the gas- assisted atomisation process of black liquor. The nozzle used in this work was a standard coaxial gas-assisted nozzle, which is not an optimised nozzle for the black liquor gasification process. The visualisations of the resulting sprays from the current nozzle showed that black liquor does not behave like water when it is atomised. The black liquor mainly form thin ligament-shaped droplets and not spherical droplets. Based on the few result with varying black liquor temperature and dry solids content, the qualitative results showed only minor dependence from these variables in the atomisation process. Under the influence of elevated ambient pressure the black liquor spray looks more like a dense cloud of small droplets than larger more coarsely distributed droplets found in the atmospheric case.

40|$|In an {{atomisation}} {{process for}} powder production, metal droplets go through undercooling, recalescence, peritectic and segregated solidification before fully solidified. The cooling process is {{further complicated by}} droplet break-up during the atomisation. This paper describes a numerical model which combines both cooling and break-up in a single computation. The dynamic history of droplets is solved as discrete phase in an Eulerian gas flow. The coupling between droplet and gas flows are two-way, in which the heat and momentum exchanges affecting the gas flow are treated as source/sink terms in the fluid equations. The droplet models were employed a <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> process for metal powder production and good agreement is achieved with the results in open literature. The model results further confirm that thermal history of particles {{is strongly dependent on}} initial droplet size. Large droplets will not go through undercooling while small droplets have identifiable stages of undercooling, unclearation and recalescence. The predictions demonstrate that droplets have very similar profiles during <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> and the major factor influencing the atomisation and solidification process of droplets are in-flight distance...|$|E

Due to the high cooling rates the alloy composition of both alloys consists of hexagonal-close-packed α- and body-centred-cubic β-phase. The α-phase is dominant in the larger powder size fractions. Considerable amounts of the β phase were only found in the powder particle size fractions smaller than 32 μm for the Ti- 45 Al- 5 Nballoy and smaller than 45 μm for the Ti- 45 Al- 10 Nb. A pronounced dendritic cauliflower-like structure was observed in bigger powder particles of the Ti- 45 Al- 10 Nb alloy. This gives proof that diffusion took place during the initial β-grain formation, even though there is no orientation relation between the final grain and the dendrite structure in the powder particles. The presence of dendritic structures showed that the cooling rate during powder atomization was still too low to reach the critical growth rate for a planar solidification. The absence of preferred misorientation angles between α-grains indicates that α-grains are not formed out of already solidified β-grains by a solid state phase transformation...|$|E
40|$|Interest in {{aluminium}} alloy (Al-alloy) composites as wear resistant materials continues to grow. However, {{the use of}} the popular Al-alloy-SiC composite can be limited by the abrasive nature of the SiC, leading to increased counterface wear rates.

Aluminium alloy (2124, 5056) matrix composites reinforced by nominally 15 vol. % of Cr 3 Si, MoSi 2, Ni 3 Al and SiC particles were prepared by a powder metallurgy route. The {{aluminium alloy}} matrix was produced by <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation,</b> and the Cr 3 Si, MoSi 2 and Ni 3 Al were prepared by self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS), while the SiC was from a standard commercial supply.

Wear testing was undertaken using a pin-on-ring configuration against an M 2 steel counterface, with a commercial synthetic oil lubricant, at 0. 94 m/s and a normal load of 630 N, corresponding to initial Hertzian contact pressures of 750 – 890 MPa (the exact value depending on the material properties).

At 42 and 91 N, the composites offered superior wear resistance to the monoliths.

At the highest load (140 N), the monolith offered superior wear resistance to the composite. Gross plastic deformation was observed at the worn surface of the composite, resulting in severe fragmentation of the Ni 3 Al. A mechanically mixed layer (MML) was observed for both materials at all loads, the thickness of which increased from ∼ 25 μm at 42 N for both materials to ∼ 80 μm for the monolith and ∼ 40 μm for the composite at 140 N. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of MML identified a complex structure comprising an amorphous phase containing Al, O, a nanoscale Fe-, Al-, O-based phase, found mainly in the monolith, and in the composite, Ni 3 Al fragmented down to the nanometre scale. A linear relationship was found between the wear rate (mm 3 /m) and the depth of deformation, with a similar relationship being observed for both composite and monolith. The relationships between wear rate, surface structural changes and starting microstructure are discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{reports on}} the solidification studies in two alloy systems: the niobium bearing γ-TiAl, relevant for the automotive and aero-engine applications, and aluminium rich Raney-Ni, precursor alloys for catalyses used in the chemical industry. The time-resolved observations of equilibrium liquid-solid phase transformations, as well as non-equilibrium solidification from the undercooled melt, are performed by combination of in situ structural studies using high-energy X-rays at a synchrotron source and the electromagnetic levitation technique. Containerless processing assured the contamination-free environment leading to high undercooling levels even at moderate cooling rates. For the critical part of the Ti-Al-Nb phase diagram an equilibrium involving the liquid phase is deduced from the phase transformations gathered on heating periods of levitation experiment. New experimental data on the partial liquidus and solidus surfaces are delivered {{as well as the}} information {{on the nature of the}} reactions along the univariant lines. These data provide a valuable contribution to the reassessment of the thermodynamic description. The primary phase selection as function of undercooling is studied in ternary Ti-Al-Nb alloys. The metastable formation of the cubic β phase within the primary solidification region of the hexagonal α phase is observed with increasing melt undercooling. Furthermore, the microstructure evolution of the β solidifying Ti- 46 Al- 8 Nb alloy discloses the transition to the thermal growth mode for ∆T> 200 − 250 K, accompanied by complete solute trapping. Supplemented with the data on the solidification velocity determined as function of melt undercooling, this results are discussed within the local non-equilibrium model of the free dendrite growth. The in situ observations of the non-equilibrium solidification of the binary Al-Ni system give insight into multiple phase transformation sequence. The achieved undercooling levels up to 320 K for the aluminium alloys containing 18 – 31. 5 at. % Ni did not alter the primary phase selection. However, during further cooling of L+Al 3 Ni 2 semisolid samples the peritectic formation of a metastable decagonal quasicrystalline phase is observed providing a critical undercooling below the peritectic temperature of Al 3 Ni phase is reached. On further cooling the metastable phase subsequently transforms into the equilibrium Al 3 Ni. A similar solidification pathways are expected for the Raney-Ni alloys produced by <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation,</b> where the associated high cooling rates allowed to retain the metastable phase at room temperature...|$|E
40|$|The main aim {{has been}} to {{investigate}} the effect of process parameters on the spray forming of UDIMET 720 and in particular to understand the mechanism of grain size evolution in the deposit {{using a combination of}} experimental and computer modelling techniques. Samples of two spray formed Ni superalloys, MAR-M- 002 and UDIMET 720, have been re-heated into the solid/liquid region and the fully solid region just below the solidus temperature for a series of times to try and reproduce the situation of grain growth in a spray formed deposit. Grain growth in the solid/liquid region follows the equation: d 3 =d 0 3 +Kt, where d is the grain size, d 0 is the initial grain size, K is the coarsening rate constant and t is the time. Coarsening rate constants have been determined for temperatures in the solid/liquid region and they increase with increasing temperature/decreasing solid fraction. Existing spray forming equipment for Al alloys has been modified to manufacture UDIMET 720 deposits. Process conditions were monitored continually during spray forming, in particular the temperature of the deposit by embedded thermocouples and infra red thermal imaging of the deposit top surface. Above a deposit temperature of ≈ 1250 °C the microstructure consists of equiaxed fine grains (20 μm- 35 μm) and the porosity is low (< 1 %). Below this deposit temperature the microstructure consists of droplet "splats" and the porosity is higher (2 - 4 %). The measure grain size increases with increasing deposit temperature and solidification time and agrees reasonably well with the predicted grain size using the above equation. A commercial finite difference based fluid dynamics software program, FLUENT, has been used to model the 2 -dimensional dynamic and thermal behaviour of UDIMET 720 droplets during <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> and spray forming. The effect of atomising gas pressure, spray distance and melt mass flow rate on the equilibrated droplet spray temperature has been examined and shows similar variations with process parameters as the measured maximum deposit temperature. The predicted spray temperature at the substrate is always higher than the measured maximum deposit temperatures under all conditions, and increases with (i) decreasing gas pressure, (ii) decreasing spray distance and (iii) increasing MFR. Mean droplet temperatures and velocities are strongly dependent on droplet size, the mean droplet temperature decreases and mean droplet axial velocities increases with decreasing droplet size. </p...|$|E
40|$|Al 93 Fe 3 Cr 2 Nb 2 (at. %) nanoquasicrystalline alloys {{have been}} shown to have the {{potential}} to push the applications of aluminium alloys to more elevated temperatures, by maintaining a high strength. They also have more thermally stable microstructures than previous nanoquasicrystalline alloys from similar systems (the most studied of which is Al 93 Fe 3 Cr 2 Ti 2 (at. %)). Al 93 Fe 3 Cr 2 Nb 2 (at. %) alloys have never previously been produced in samples on a scale larger than melt-spun ribbon. This study examines the production parameters of bulk nanoquasicrystalline Al-Fe-Cr-Nb alloys. Firstly an attempt was made to reduce the melting temperatures of thermally stable nanoquasicrystalline alloys through additional alloying. The melting processes of binary, ternary, quaternary and quinary nanoquasicrystalline alloys was analysed though DTA, with endothermic reactions up to 1034 oC observed. Rapidly solidified Al-Fe-Cr-Nb alloys were then produced in kilogram quantities through <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation</b> at an industrial scale. The smallest atomised powder particles contained fine scale microstructures consisting of nano-scale quasicrystals embedded in an aluminium matrix. As the cooling rate of the powder particles decreased new phases, including the theta phase (Al 13 (Fe,Cr) 2 - 4) and Al 3 Nb were produced. 0 - 25 μm, 25 - 50 μm and 50 - 75 μm (diameter) size fractions of atomised powder were each consolidated through extrusion to produce nanoquasicrystalline Al-Fe-Cr-Nb bars. Composite bars of the nanoquasicrystalline alloy mixed with 10 (vol.) % and 20 (vol.) % pure aluminium were also produced. The consolidation of the nanoquasicrystalline atomised powders through extrusion led to precipitation of intermetallics including (Al 13 (Fe,Cr) 2 - 4) and Al 3 Nb, particularly in the smallest powder size fractions with the most metastable microstructures. Finally the effects of the atomisation and extrusion conditions on the microstructure and its mechanical properties were studied. Improved strength, coupled with reduced ductility was observed with decreases in the elemental aluminium composition of the Al-Fe-Cr-Nb bars and the powder size fraction they were produced from. There was however improvements in toughness of the extruded composite bars, over the nanoquasicrystalline alloy bars.

40|$|Powder Injection Moulding (PIM) is an {{attractive}} technique for producing complex components in large quantities my means of powder technology. The process includes mixing powder with a suitable binder, usually a thermoplastic polymer. Because of the large attractive forces between small particles the powder can be agglomerated in the binder. In order to avoid particle agglomeration in the powder-binder mixture, surface-active additives are used for enhancing the dispersion of the particles. To have a mixture free of agglomerates is important since agglomerates will affect the viscous behaviour of the mixture. Moreover, agglomerates that remain can cause defects in the final part. If the additive is to work properly as dispersant it must interact with the powder surface and ideally adsorb onto it. Thus, {{not only is the}} chemical character of the additive itself important, but also the chemical properties of the powder surface. Metal powder has a surface layer of one or more oxides. For some materials like atomised stainless steel powder, the fabrication process (water or <b>gas</b> <b>atomisation)</b> determines the type of oxides present on the powder surfaces. Thus, the process also impacts the way powder interacts with additives in PIM. This doctoral study combines controlled adsorption experiments with surface chemical analysis by means of primarily X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) as well as Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). The aim of this approach is to determine the interaction between the organic compounds and the powder surfaces. Furthermore, rheological characterisation of model feedstock materials provides information on how the additive acts during mixing and moulding. Powders used are ferrous PIM powder such as gas-atomised and water-atomised fine stainless steel powder and carbonyl iron powder. The model feedstock is composed of such powder and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) as a binder with possible addition of surfactant. Adsorption of both basic and acidic molecules on ferrous powder in organic liquids was investigated. Specific attention was paid to the surfactant stearic acid, as this is a common additive in PIM. By means of XPS analyses it was shown that the stearic acid, being an acidic molecule, is adsorbed on metal powders with basic oxides. By applying the Tougaard nano-structure analysis for thin film characterisation by XPS the thickness of the stearic acid layer was estimated at ~ 20 Å. From model experiments with flat oxidised samples of Fe, Cr and Mn, this interaction with their oxides was confirmed using angle-resolved XPS analysis. Also, it was indicated the XPS characterisation can provide information about the orientation of the adsorbed molecules on the surface. It was demonstrated for powder covered with Si oxide that this acidic oxide interacts with basic molecules (e. g. aniline) when the top surface is composed of hydroxide. Rheological testing showed that adding stearic acid to the model feedstock materials reduced the viscosity much more than if added to the binder alone. If enough stearic acid is added, the dispersion of particles is improved. This effect could also be achieved by lowering the mixing temperature (increased shear force) ...|$|E
