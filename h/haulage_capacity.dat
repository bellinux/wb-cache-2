500|$|The {{newly created}} Southern Railway, which had absorbed the SECR in the 1923 [...] "Grouping", {{undertook}} trials {{in the spring}} of 1924 to compare the performance of its freight locomotives. Because the Ns were designed to haul both freight and passenger traffic, Maunsell, as the newly appointed Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Southern Railway, decided to compare the design with the N1, LSWRS15 and LBK classes in trials that involved hauling trains of 65 loaded wagons. Although the S15 was superior in freight <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> and operational economy, the N class’ good all-round performance on passenger and freight meant that the type was adopted as the company's standard mixed-traffic design. The Southern Railway subsequently bought fifty [...] "Woolwich" [...] kits for assembly at Ashford between June 1924 and August 1925. These were identical to the SECR batch and were given numbers in the series A826A875. The Midland Great Western Railway of Ireland bought 12 kits prior to absorption by the Great Southern and Western Railway, which bought an extra 15. The latter 15 locomotives were divided into eight GSR Class 372 with [...] driving wheels and six GSR Class 393 with [...] driving wheels: the final kit was kept for spares.|$|E

40|$|Rotterdam is at {{the moment}} a very {{important}} harbour; it is the gateway to Europe. Because of {{that it is important}} to the Dutch and European economy. To maintain its position the government decided to improve the hinterland connections by building the Betuweroute. In the Netherlands the discussion strengthened if it is necessary to build the track. This report will deal with the question if the carriers will use the track, because the building of the track is only useful if the utility is good. Because the Betuweroute is a solution for a future problem the conclusion is based on forecasts. The Rotterdam Municipal Port Management expects the road haulage to and from the harbour to grow between 66 and 141 % between 1995 and 2020. This means that in the best case the traffic will increase with ''just" four truck loads per minute per direction plus the growth of the other industry of the Netherlands. The capacity of the road network is not high enough to deal with this demand. To prevent that the roads will congest, the government wants to achieve a shift of road haulage to rail transport and inland shipping. The government will do this by charging road transport, which will make inland shipping and rail more interesting for carriers. Rail transport and inland shipping are additional modes of transport. This means that not just one of the two can handle the demand shifted from road <b>haulage.</b> The <b>capacity</b> of inland shipping is high enough to deal in part with the extra demand, but the capacity of the rail network is not.

50|$|The {{complexity}} {{of this system}} was that the armature must now be free to {{move up and down}} relative to the field, as the suspension moves. With a contemporary four-pole motor, this would vary the pole gap at the upper and lower poles, probably {{to the extent that the}} armature hit the pole pieces (suspension travel being far larger than typical pole gaps). The solution was to return to the relatively antiquated bipolar motor. By placing the poles at the side of the armature and giving them flat vertical faces, the armature was free to move up and down between them. The motor design was relatively inefficient, even by the standards of the day, but these locomotives were designed for their power and <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> with a generous supply of cheap hydro-electricity, rather than designed for efficiency.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was a large}} fall in {{elevation}} {{from the}} mines to the ports, and to optimise the <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> available at the time, the line was laid out with generally moderate gradients, but with four inclines (sometimes referred to as inclined planes).

Generally locomotives were used to haul the trains to and from the ends of the inclines, and did not themselves travel with the train. However horse traction was used west of the Angarrack incline at first, but from 1843 locomotives worked over the incline, using the rope for traction and braking, and to from there Hayle.|$|E

50|$|The {{contractor}} {{responsible for}} the construction of the Fremantle-Guildford railway, John Robb, sold his locomotive to the WA government also in 1881, and it became Number 3. Number 3 became to prototype of the WAGR A class 2-6-0 tender locomotives. The A class locomotives were soon supplemented by the B class 4-6-0T tank engines which had twice the <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> of the A class. During this time the WAGR had been greatly expanded over the Darling Scarp and into the large agricultural strip to the East, specifically to the centers of Chidlow, Northam and Toodyay (then Newcastle). With the beginning of WA gold rushes in 1888 the railways required massive expansion and in 1889 the WAGR received a larger version of the A class which had been used {{in the construction of the}} private Great Southern Railway in Albany, on the southern coast of Western Australia. The new locomotives were a vast improvement over previous types and became the WAGR G Class, of which a total of 72 were eventually ordered, becoming the railways' most numerous type for its entire history. The G class existed in two forms - the initial 2-6-0 configuration and a later 4-6-0 type with improved running stability. The G class were immensely successful on a wide range of duties, and although phased out of mainline workings in the early 20th Century, they lingered until the very end of steam in WA, with two examples still working as shunters at Bunbury in August 1972.|$|E

40|$|Draw {{management}} {{is a critical}} part of the successful recovery of mineral reserves by cave mining. This thesis presents a draw control model that indirectly increases resource value by controlling production based on geotechnical constraints. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated as a goal programming model that includes seven general constraint types. These constraints model the mining system and drive the operation towards the dual strategic targets of total monthly production tonnage and cave shape. This approach increases value by ensuring that reserves are not lost due to poor draw practice. The model also allows any number of processing plants to feed from multiple sources (caves, stockpiles, and dumps). The ability to blend material allows the model to be included in strategic level studies that target corporate objectives while emphasising production control within each cave. There are three main production control constraints in the MILP. The first of these, the draw maturity rules, is designed to balance drawpoint production with cave propagation rates. The maturity rules are modelled using disjunctive constraints. The constraint regulates production based on drawpoint depletion. Drawpoint production increases from 100 mm/d to 404 mm/d once the drawpoint reaches 6. 5 % depletion. Draw can continue at this maximum rate until drawpoint ramp-down begins as 93. 5 % depletion. The maximum draw rate decreases to 100 mm/d at drawpoint closure in the three maturity rule systems included in the thesis. The maturity rule constraints combine with the minimum draw rate constraint to limit production based on the difference between the actual and ideal drawpoint depletion. Drawpoints which lag behind their ideal depletion are restricted by the maturity rules while those that exceeded the ideal depletion were forced to mine at their minimum rate to ensure that cave porosity was maintained. The third production control constraint, relative draw rate (RDR), prohibits isolated draw by ensuring that extraction is uniform across the cave. It does this by controlling the relative draw difference between adjacent drawpoints. It is apparent in this thesis that production from a drawpoint can have an indirect effect on remote drawpoints because the relative draw rate constraints pass from one neighbour to the next within the cave. Tightening the RDR constraint increases production variation during cave ramp-up. This variation occurs because the maturity rules dictate that new drawpoints must produce at a lower draw rate than mature drawpoints. As a result, newly opened drawpoints limit production from the mature drawpoints within their region of the cave (not just their immediate neighbours). The MILP is also used to quantify production changes caused by varying geotechnical constraints, limiting <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity,</b> and reversing mining direction. It has been shown that tightening the RDR constraint decreases total cave production. The ramp-up duration also increased by eighteen months compared to the control RDR scenario. Tighter relative draw also made it difficult to maintain cave shape during ramp-up. However, once ramp-up was complete, the tighter control produced a better depletion surface. The trial with limited <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> identified bottlenecks in the materials handling system. The main bottlenecks occur in the production drives with the greatest tonnage associated with their drawpoints. There also appears to be an average <b>haulage</b> <b>capacity</b> threshold for the extraction drives of 2000 tonnes per drawpoint. Only one drive with a capacity below this threshold achieves its target production in each period. Reversing the cave advance to initiate in the South-East shows the greatest potential for achieving total production and cave shape targets. The greater number of drawpoints available early in the schedule provides more production capacity. This ability to distribute production over a greater number of drawpoints reduces the total production lag during ramp-up. In addition to its role in feasibility studies, the MILP is well suited for use as a production guidance tool. It has been shown in three case studies that the model can be used to evaluate production performance and to establish long term production targets. The first of the studies shows the analysis of historical production data by comparison to the MILP optimised schedule. The second shows that the model produces an optimised production plan irrespective of the current cave state. The final case study emulates the draw control cycle used by the Premier Diamond Mine. The series of optimised production schedules mirror that of the life-of-mine schedule generated {{at the start of the}} iterative process. The results illustrate how the MILP can be used by a draw control engineer to analyse production data and to develop long term production targets both before and after a cave is brought into full production...|$|E
