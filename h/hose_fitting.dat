5000|$|The FZ {{came as a}} 4-stroke, four-cylinder, four-carburetor, {{naturally}} aspirated, {{air-cooled engine}} package mated with a six-gear constant mesh transmission, dropped into a rectangular tube frame that seemed pieced together from a modern standpoint, balanced upon a large rear mono shock hidden between the swingarm and subframe under the battery complementary to two smooth front forks. It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel petcock at the bottom left with an overflow <b>hose</b> <b>fitting</b> {{at the bottom of}} the front. The four Mikuni BS-30 carburetors utilize the [...] "Round-Slide" [...] design with the diaphragm assembly actuating the main needle jets, with plastic floats and brass slides. It uses two ignition coils (two cylinders each) controlled by a CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) printed circuit board unit, and timed by a two brush [...] "Pick-Up Coil" [...] mounted to the crank. The engine oil doubles as the transmission's lubricant, wetting the manual clutch. The FZ-600 was air-cooled however, with a radiator-looking oil cooler mounted on the front of the frame between the engine and front wheel. It also had a thundering four-into-one exhaust. It has a 4-fuse, fuse block providing for the headlights, turn signals, rectifier/regulator, etc.|$|E

50|$|To {{increase}} pressure resistance, metal hoses can {{be equipped}} with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the <b>hose</b> <b>fittings</b> on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure. Due to its inherent flexibility, the braid moulds itself perfectly to {{the movement of the}} hose. Hose braiding consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually {{the same as that of}} the corrugated hose. It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.|$|R

40|$|Soft Robotic ActuatorsByJuleon Taylor GodfreyMaster of Science in Mechanical and Aerospace EngineeringUniversity of California, Irvine, 2017 Dean Gregory N. Washington Irvine, ChairIn {{this thesis}} a survey on soft robotic {{actuators}} is conducted. The actuators are classified into three main categories: Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAM), Electronic Electroactive Polymers (Electric EAP), and Ionic Electroactive Polymers (Ionic EAP). Soft robots can have many degrees {{and are more}} compliant than hard robots. This makes them suitable for applications that are difficult for hard robots. For each actuator background history, build materials, how they operate, and modeling are presented. Multiple actuators in each class are reviewed highlighting both their use and their mathematical formulation. In addition to the survey the McKibben actuator was chosen for fabrication and in-depth experimental analysis. Four McKibben actuators were fabricated using mesh sleeve, barbed <b>hose</b> <b>fittings,</b> and different elastic bladders. All were actuated using compressed air. Tensile tests were performed for each actuator to measure the tension force as air pressure increased from 20 to 100 psi in 10 psi increments. To account for material relaxation properties eleven trials for each actuator were run for 2 - 3 days. In conclusion, the smallest outer diameter elastic bladder was capable of producing the highest force due to the larger gap between the bladder and the sleeve...|$|R
40|$|NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) {{recently}} {{entered into}} a nonexclusive license agreement with Applied Cryogenic Solutions (ACS), Inc. (Galveston, TX) to commercialize its Gas-Liquid Supersonic Cleaning and Cleaning Verification Spray System technology. This technology, developed by KSC, is {{a critical component of}} processes being developed and commercialized by ACS to replace current mechanical and chemical cleaning and descaling methods used by numerous industries. Pilot trials on heat exchanger tubing components have shown that the ACS technology provides for: Superior cleaning in a much shorter period of time. Lower energy and labor requirements for cleaning and de-scaling uper. ninih. Significant reductions in waste volumes by not using water, acidic or basic solutions, organic solvents, or nonvolatile solid abrasives as components in the cleaning process. Improved energy efficiency in post-cleaning heat exchanger operations. The ACS process consists of a spray head containing supersonic converging/diverging nozzles, a source of liquid gas; a novel, proprietary pumping system that permits pumping liquid nitrogen, liquid air, or supercritical carbon dioxide to pressures in the range of 20, 000 to 60, 000 psi; and various <b>hoses,</b> <b>fittings,</b> valves, and gauges. The size and number of nozzles can be varied so the system can be built in configurations ranging from small hand-held spray heads to large multinozzle cleaners. The system also can be used to verify if a part has been adequately cleaned...|$|R
