40|$|It {{is common}} wisdom to {{understand}} digital computing {{as the basis}} of an unprecedented intermediality, in which once distinct media forms find themselves reconstituted as the content (in McLuhan’s terms) of increasingly integrated and homogeneous devices of communication. Following N. Katherine Hayles’ definition of digitization as ‘the act of making something discrete rather than continuous’, however, I argue in this paper that {{in order to be able}} to understand the long history of digitization, we must attempt to think the period generally regarded as representing the origin of digital computing – from the 1694 completion of Leibniz’s Step Reckoner onward – as being only the most recent, and perhaps most technically and ideologically effective, instantiation of a surprisingly long-standing discourse network, which expressed itself as much in the universalization of writing as it does now through the discrete systems of modern computing. By tracing the way in which Plato utilizes discreteness and dualism as methods for ascertaining what he views as the true structure of the world, I will contend that digitization must be understood as forming the basis of an episteme that has enabled Western philosophy as a distinct practice. In his desire to reduce the noise of sensory input, Plato introduces a dualistic philosophy premised upon the abstraction of knowledge, reduced to a series of discrete symbols, and in doing so, he reveals the way in which the universalizing tendency of digitization as discursive practice is inherently reliant upon a third term - the mediator - that exists outside of the <b>digital</b> <b>codec</b> that it seeks to impose...|$|E

Her work unfolds in urban places and buildings and uncovers unexpected embedded narratives and traces of history. Klenz's recent works Beun (2015 - 16) and He Only Feels the Black and White of it (2016) explore the moment when a photographic image 'fails' to communicate as a document. Klenz's work suggest that navigating a terrain or building can disrupt and reveal the narrational and representational potential of the photographed place. The photographic series Beun begins with an Associated Press photograph of a concentration camp in Ohrdruf, East-Germany. By digitally corrupting the image file, the image becomes ruptured, deformed and disfigured into <b>digital</b> <b>codec</b> mismatch. Collapsing time and space, the resulting images re-emerge recognizable but strangely out of reach. Klenz's new video piece Beun (2016) refers to an unknown World Prison Camp gathered from the same collection. Klenz constructed a life-size model in her studio as well as photographic conditions such as lighting and camera position of the archive image. Klenz filmed this architectural replica and ruptured the imagery {{in a similar manner}} to the photographic images of the photographic series Beun. Klenz is interested in putting the viewer of Beun in the position of 'spiraling' or 'hovering', unable to literally finish or exhaust the piece.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. With the rapid {{expansion}} of Internet, it became feasible to have low-cost and secure telephone calls via internet. New digital speech compression standards were developed. <b>Digital</b> speech <b>codecs</b> can be used both in regular telephone networks and Internet based systems. Thereby, for a secure call, speech data are firstly compressed by <b>digital</b> speech <b>codecs,</b> and then, these compressed packages are sent in an encoded way through Data Encryption Standard (3 DES) [1], Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [2] encoding methods. Compressing and encoding processes require high processor performance and they may even require the use of high frequency processors and DSP’s to encode the binary speech data. Current speech coders are speaker independent, i. e., they don’t perform any speaker specific operations. They do not even distinguish between male and female speakers. An interesting way to solve this problem is to send speech after encoding it with a system that is based on a specific user. This system, which can be also called as speaker dependent speech encoding, provides a computationally efficient and relatively secure VoIP call, with high quality and without any encoding compared to the same bit rate standard speech codecs. Despite the disadvantages of requirement of acquiring all the speech characteristics of users and the need for extra data space, it has advantages such as providing secure communication because speech characteristics of the speaker is unknown to other users and the synthesized speech has higher quality compared to a same bit rate LPC compressed speech.

50|$|To ensure {{provision}} of audio description, broadcasters typically use the AAC codec. Hardware restrictions allow {{only a single}} type of audio decoder to operate at any one time, so the main audio and the audio description must use the same encoding family {{for them to be}} successfully combined at the receiver.

Neither AAC nor Dolby <b>Digital</b> Plus <b>codecs</b> are supported by most home AV equipment, which typically accept Dolby Digital or DTS, leaving owners with stereo, rather than surround sound, output. Transcoding from AAC to Dolby Digital or DTS and multi-channel output via HDMI was not originally necessary for Freeview HD certification.

40|$|Abstract—We propose in {{this paper}} a backward-compatible {{multichannel}} audio codec. This codec represents a multichannel audio input signal by a down mix and parametric data. In order to enable backward compatibility, {{it is necessary to}} have the possibility of exerting control over the down-mixing procedure. At the same time, in order to achieve a high coding efficiency, both signal and perceptual redundancies should be exploited. In this paper, we describe a codec that unifies the above-mentioned conditions: backward compatibility and exploitation of both signal and perceptual redundancies. The codec combines a high audio quality and a low parameter bit rate. Moreover, its design is flexible, examples of which are the scalability of the audio quality to (in principle) transparency and the possibility to preserve the correlation structure of the original input signals by using synthetic signals. A stereo backward compatible version of the proposed codec is used as a component of the recently standardized MPEG Surround multichannel audio codec.

40|$|The lack of {{available}} wideband digital links {{as well as}} the complexity of implementation of bandwidth efficient <b>digital</b> video <b>CODECs</b> (encoder/decoder) has worked to keep the cost of digital television transmission too high to compete with analog methods. Terrestrial and satellite video service providers, however, are now recognizing the potential gains that digital video compression offers and are proposing to incorporate compression systems to increase the number {{of available}} program channels. NASA is similarly recognizing the benefits of and trend toward digital video compression techniques for transmission of high quality video from space and therefore, has developed a digital television bandwidth compression algorithm to process standard National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) composite color television signals. The algorithm is based on differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), but additionally utilizes a non-adaptive predictor, non-uniform quantizer and multilevel Huffman coder to reduce the data rate substantially below that achievable with straight DPCM. The non-adaptive predictor and multilevel Huffman coder combine to set this technique apart from other DPCM encoding algorithms. All processing is done on a intra-field basis to prevent motion degradation and minimize hardware complexity. Computer simulations have shown the algorithm will produce broadcast quality reconstructed video at an average transmission rate of 1. 8 bits/pixel. Hardware implementation of the DPCM circuit, non-adaptive predictor and non-uniform quantizer has been completed, providing realtime demonstration of the image quality at full video rates. Video sampling/reconstruction circuits have also been constructed to accomplish the analog video processing necessary for the real-time demonstration. Performance results for the completed hardware compare favorably with simulation results. Hardware implementation of the multilevel Huffman encoder/decoder is currently under development along with implementation of a buffer control algorithm to accommodate the variable data rate output of the multilevel Huffman encoder. A video CODEC of this type could be used to compress NTSC color television signals where high quality reconstruction is desirable (e. g., Space Station video transmission, transmission direct-to-the-home via direct broadcast satellite systems or cable television distribution to system headends and direct-to-the-home) ...|$|R
