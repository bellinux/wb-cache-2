Many different spacecraft propulsion systems have been proposed to give spacecraft the required speeds, including nuclear propulsion, beam-powered propulsion, and methods based on speculative physics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physical and psychological damages resulting from rape, sexual violence {{in the context of}} war often disrupt the linkages between the rape victims and their communities. Thus, the phenomenon of war rape can structurally affect <b>entire</b> <b>societies,</b> which is closely linked to the logic underlying the strategic use of rape as an instrument in armed conflicts. Raping ‘enemy’ women also constitutes an act of abuse and humiliation against the men of the community the victims were representative of.|$|E
25|$|The United States has a {{very complex}} history with {{compulsory}} vaccination, particularly in enforcing compulsory vaccinations both domestically and abroad to protect American soldiers during times of war. There are {{hundreds of thousands of}} examples of soldier deaths that were not the result of combat wounds, but were instead from disease. Among wars with high death tolls from disease is the Civil War where an estimated 620,000 soldiers died from disease. American soldiers in other countries have spread diseases which ultimately disrupted <b>entire</b> <b>societies</b> and healthcare systems with famine and poverty.|$|E
50|$|A {{collective}} {{trauma is}} a traumatic psychological effect shared {{by a group}} of people of any size, up to and including an <b>entire</b> <b>society.</b> Traumatic events witnessed by an <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> can stir up collective sentiment, often resulting in a shift in that society's culture and mass actions.|$|R

25|$|Public {{international}} law deals extensively and increasingly with criminal conduct that is heinous and ghastly enough to affect <b>entire</b> <b>societies</b> and regions. The formative source of modern {{international criminal law}} was the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War in which the leaders of Nazism were prosecuted for their part in genocide and atrocities across Europe. The Nuremberg trials {{marked the beginning of}} criminal fault for individuals, where individuals acting on behalf of a government can be tried for violations of {{international law}} without the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1998 an International criminal court was established in the Rome Statute.|$|E
25|$|Effeminacy is {{the manifestation}} of traits in a boy or man that are more often {{associated}} with feminine nature, behavior, mannerism, style, or gender roles rather than with masculine nature, behavior, mannerisms, style or roles. It is a term frequently applied to womanly behavior, demeanor, style, clothing and appearance displayed by a boy or man, typically used implying criticism or ridicule of this behavior (as opposed to, for example, merely describing a man as feminine, which can be non-judgmental). The term effeminate is most often used by people who subscribe to the widespread view that males should display masculine traits and behaviors. Generally, the description is applied to individuals, but {{may be used to}} describe <b>entire</b> <b>societies</b> as an inflammatory allegation.|$|E
500|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{is a major problem}} in India. Domestic violence—acts of physical, psychological, and sexual violence against women—is found across the world and is currently viewed as a hidden epidemic by the World Health Organisation. [...] The effects of domestic violence go beyond the victim; generational and economic effects influence <b>entire</b> <b>societies.</b> Economies of countries where domestic {{violence is}} prevalent tend to have lower female labour participation rate, in addition to higher medical expenses and higher rates of disability.|$|E
5000|$|Standard {{consumer}} {{theory is}} developed {{for a single}} consumer. The consumer has a utility function, from which his demand curves can be calculated. Then, {{it is possible to}} predict the behavior of the consumer in certain conditions, price or income changes. But in reality, there are many different consumers, each with his own utility function and demand curve. How can we use consumer theory to predict the behavior of an <b>entire</b> <b>society?</b> One option is to represent an <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> as a single [...] "mega consumer", which has an aggregate utility function and aggregate demand curve. But in what cases is it indeed possible to represent an <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> as a single consumer? ...|$|R

2500|$|When first introduced, the Borg {{are said}} to be more {{interested}} in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and <b>entire</b> <b>societies</b> to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the Kazon, to be technologically inferior and not worthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard the first cube introduced (: [...] "Q Who?") shows that the Borg will even assimilate the children of a conquered race. However, the Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers, to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones that can be of use.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{article by}} Lemmon, {{published}} in The Atlantic in April 2013, the Hillary Doctrine is again elucidated. Lemmon cites a speech given by Clinton to the Women in the World Summit soon {{after leaving the}} State Department in which she reflects upon the case she made for women's rights {{in the past and}} argues that [...] "too many otherwise thoughtful people continue to see the fortunes of women and girls as somehow separate from society at large." [...] Further, Clinton explains how extremists rely upon this ignorance to keep women from being liberated, and, with that, also bar <b>entire</b> <b>societies</b> from liberation. However, rather than speaking in purely abstract terms of [...] "extremists" [...] and [...] "societies", Clinton concretely identifies some countries that she wants to see treat their women better, namely: Egypt, Pakistan, India, and at a different level, the United States itself. To conclude, Lemmon speculates whether the Hillary Doctrine will be transformed into a political platform upon which Clinton can run for President in 2015. However, regardless of speculation on Clinton's actions in the future, for now, the Hillary Doctrine stands as an important contribution to national security discussions around the world.|$|E
50|$|The novel {{places a}} major focus on war {{and its effects on}} individuals, families, and <b>entire</b> <b>societies.</b> Families have been torn apart because of the kidnappings or simply because of the stress of war that is too much of a burden. Some cannot handle the atrocities and instead opt for an easier alternative, suicide. Others, like Palipana, live secluded lives {{altogether}} alienating themselves from society. <b>Entire</b> <b>societies</b> choose to remain blind and deaf to war, merely hoping for peace.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} typologies of revolutions in social science and literature. For example, classical scholar Alexis de Tocqueville differentiated between political revolutions, sudden and violent revolutions that seek not only {{to establish a new}} political system but to transform an <b>entire</b> <b>society,</b> and slow but sweeping transformations of the <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> that take several generations to bring about (such as changes in religion). One of several different Marxist typologies divides revolutions into pre-capitalist, early bourgeois, bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic, early proletarian, and socialist revolutions.|$|R

50|$|Of course, {{diseases}} are not concrete objects like e.g. microorganisms that cause contagion. Since a {{disease is a}} reactive process, it cannot {{be separated from the}} body where it has appeared. It seems, however, that diseases have an existence that doesn't depend on their carriers. Such independence can be seen when many people get sick: the disease becomes an event. It shows the concrete existence of diseases as phenomena that strike at <b>entire</b> <b>societies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Behaviors {{commonly}} associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut shaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by some forms of sexual violence, {{or some combination of}} these.

50|$|Early {{results by}} Antonelli (1886) and Nataf (1953) had shown that, {{assuming}} all individuals {{face the same}} prices in a market, their income consumption curves and their Engel curves (expenditure {{as a function of}} income) should be parallel straight lines. This means that we can calculate an income-consumption curve of an <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> just by summing the curves of the consumers. In other words, suppose the <b>entire</b> <b>society</b> is given a certain income. This income is somehow distributed between the members of society, then each member selects his consumption according to his income-consumption curve. If the curves are all parallel straight lines, the aggregate demand of society will be independent of the distribution of income among the agents.|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} {{chapters}} gives the novel {{the feeling of}} an extremely long sentence. Instead of outright dialogue, there is subtle, poetic prose.

50|$|Structural abuse {{should not}} be {{confused}} with structural violence.
