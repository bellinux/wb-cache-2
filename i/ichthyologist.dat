5|$|As Taeniura meyeni, {{the round}} ribbontail ray was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle in their 1841 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, based on two syntypes collected from Mauritius. However, this species is better known under the name Taeniura melanospila (or melanospilos), which was applied by Dutch <b>ichthyologist</b> Pieter Bleeker to a juvenile specimen from Java, in a 1953 volume of the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indië.|$|E
5|$|British <b>ichthyologist</b> Charles Tate Regan {{described}} Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence {{argued that it was}} a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler was {{described}} by Australian <b>ichthyologist</b> Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1943 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. He assigned the new species to the subgenus Uranganops of the genus Galeolamna, and gave it the specific epithet fitzroyensis because the type specimen, a 1.2-m-long female, was collected from Connor's Creek in the Fitzroy River estuary. Subsequent authors have synonymized Galeolamna with Carcharhinus.|$|E

5|$|The {{fish was}} {{originally}} described as Raja laevis by Samuel Latham Mitchill in 1818. The scientific name was later changed to the currently valid name Dipturus laevis. It {{has also been}} misidentified as Raia granulata by Theodore Gill, an American <b>ichthyologist,</b> in 1879. The genus name, Dipturus, {{is derived from the}} Greek words di, meaning two, and pteryx, meaning wing. Raja, the original genus which was coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is still recognized as a valid subgenus.|$|E
5|$|The hardnose shark was {{described}} by German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. They named it Carcharias (Hypoprion) macloti in honour of Heinrich Christian Macklot, who collected the type specimen from New Guinea. In 1862, American <b>ichthyologist</b> Theodore Gill elevated Hypoprion {{to the rank of}} full genus, with C. macloti as the type species. In 1985, Jack Garrick synonymised Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. This species may also be called Maclot's shark.|$|E
5|$|Dutch <b>ichthyologist</b> Pieter Bleeker first {{described}} the {{grey reef shark}} in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, in the scientific journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The type specimen was a -long female from the Java Sea. Other common names used for this shark around the world include black-vee whaler, bronze whaler, Fowler's whaler shark, graceful shark, graceful whaler shark, grey shark, grey whaler shark, longnose blacktail shark, school shark, and shortnose blacktail shark. Some of these names are also applied to other species.|$|E

5|$|French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard {{originally}} {{described the}} cookiecutter shark during the 18171820 exploratory voyage of the corvette Uranie under Louis de Freycinet, {{giving it the}} name Scymnus brasiliensis because the type specimen was caught off Brazil. In 1824, their account was published as part of Voyage autour du monde...sur les corvettes de S.M. l'Uranie et la Physicienne, Louis de Freycinet's 13 volume report on the voyage. In 1865, American <b>ichthyologist</b> Theodore Nicholas Gill coined the new genus Isistius for this species, after Isis, the Egyptian goddess of light.|$|E
5|$|British <b>ichthyologist</b> Charles Tate Regan {{described}} the tiger catshark in a 1904 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Annals and Magazine of Natural History, based on two specimens presented to the British Museum by J. F. Queckett. He placed the species in the genus Scyllium (a synonym of Scyliorhinus) and gave it the specific epithet , because the type specimens were reportedly collected off the Natal coast of South Africa (though there is suspicion that they were mislabelled and actually came from Algoa Bay). Later authors reassigned this species to the genus Halaelurus. The lined catshark (Halaelurus lineatus) was once treated as conspecific to the tiger catshark, until it {{was described as a}} separate species in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Dutch <b>ichthyologist</b> Pieter Bleeker {{originally}} {{described the}} tasselled wobbegong in an 1867 volume of Archives Néerlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles. His account {{was based on}} two Indonesian specimens, one caught off Waigeo and the other off Aru. He gave it the name dasypogon, from the Greek dasys ("hairy") and pogon ("beard"), and assigned it to the genus Crossorhinus (a synonym of Orectolobus). In 1908, Charles Tate Regan created the new genus Eucrossorhinus for this species, derived from the Greek eu ("good"), krossoi ("tassel") and rhinos ("nose"). Regan subsequently reconsidered the main trait he used to separate Eucrossorhinus (the spacing of {{the fourth and fifth}} gill slits) and synonymized it with Orectolobus. Later authors have placed the tasselled wobbegong either in its own genus or in Orectolobus. Other common names for this species are bearded wobbegong and Ogilby's wobbegong.|$|E

5|$|Edward Drinker Cope (July 28, 1840 – April 12, 1897) was an American {{paleontologist}} {{and comparative}} anatomist, {{as well as}} a noted herpetologist and <b>ichthyologist.</b> He was a founder of the Neo-Lamarckism school of thought. Born to a wealthy Quaker family, Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science; he published his first scientific paper at the age of 19. Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer, he eventually acquiesced to his son's scientific aspirations. Cope married his cousin and had one child; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield, New Jersey, although Cope would maintain a residence and museum in Philadelphia in his later years.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray {{was described by}} American <b>ichthyologist</b> William Orville Ayres, the first Curator of Ichthyology at the California Academy of Sciences, who named it after the U.S. state where it was first discovered by science. Ayers published his account in 1855, in the inaugural volume of the Academy's Proceedings; no type specimens were designated. In 1861, Theodore Gill placed this species in his newly created genus Tetronarce, {{on the basis of}} its smooth-rimmed spiracles. Later authors have generally regarded Tetronarce as a subgenus of Torpedo. Closely similar {{electric ray}}s found off Peru, Chile, and Japan may be the same as this species. Other common names used for this ray include California torpedo ray, Pacific torpedo, or simply electric ray or torpedo ray. This species is placed in the genus Tetronarce.|$|E
5|$|The genus Carcharocles {{currently}} contains four species: C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, C. chubutensis, and C. megalodon. The genus {{was proposed}} by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal in 1923 to contain C. auriculatus. In the 1980s, megalodon {{was assigned to}} Carcharocles. Before this, in 1960, the genus Procarcharodon was erected by French <b>ichthyologist</b> Edgard Casier, which included those four sharks and was considered separate from the great white shark. It is now considered a junior synonym of Carcharocles. The genus Palaeocarcharodon was erected alongside Procarcharodon to represent {{the beginning of the}} lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the great white shark are closely related, their last common ancestor. However, it is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the Carcharocles sharks by authors who reject that model.|$|E

5|$|Scyllarides latus was {{originally}} {{classified in the}} genus Scyllarus, along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the <b>ichthyologist</b> Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold the species that De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides {{is placed in the}} subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.|$|E
