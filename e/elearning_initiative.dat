However, this {{learning and teaching}} approach is still relatively underused {{in the health care}} study programmes. Hence, the goal {{of this article is to}} present three e-learning best practices in health care, which were validated in our previous projects/studies. First best practice, e-learning practice contents for the development of critical thinking, presents the approach which resulted in significant (p< 0. 001) raise in the number of discussion posts (+ 12. 2 %) for which the opinions and conclusions of the participants were justified with valid arguments. Furthermore, also the survey results showed that students achieve critical thinking skills with these contents. Second best practice, inclusion of the health care students in the development of e-contents, also resulted as a valid approach for improving the use of e-learning in health care curricula, which was confirmed by the expert opinion and e-contents final users. Finally, third best practice, our approach for evaluation and comparison of e-learning and traditional pedagogical elements value by health care students and teachers, was confirmed in the interview with the management as a valid approach that helps the management to identify whether previous <b>elearning</b> <b>initiatives</b> and activities were successful. Best practices, presented in this paper, represent the evidence that the use of modern information and communication technologies should be considered in the future as a serious requisite in health care study programmes.

40|$|The {{potential}} for online education for adult learning {{have been well}} argued, and in recent times there have been <b>eLearning</b> <b>initiatives</b> to realise the potential offered by online education. Adult learning institutions, particularly Universities, have adopted and introduced infrastructure to support Learning Management Systems (LMS), Local Area Networks (LAN), Learning Management Content Systems (LMCS), and Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). Following discussion of those eLearning environments, this chapter will suggest that the limitations of those digital systems is leading to the next phase {{with the development of}} digital ecosystems conceptualised as learning platforms which keeps learning central, enables interoperability, and forms a base for building upon through use of new technologies and increased capabilities of educators to use information and communication technologies (ICT) for curriculum, pedagogy and assessment (Ingvarson & Gaffney, 2008). Digital ecosystems enable the integration of student administration, LAN (requiring teacher and student logins and passwords), VLE, content repository, community links, utilise Web 2. 0 (social networking) technologies, and can have the adult learner as the central focus of the design of the platform and its functionalities. Subsequently, the chapter draws upon the findings of a research project (Sun, Tsai, Finger, Chen, & Yeh, 2007) which identified the critical functionalities for eLearner satisfaction to provide suggestions that the architecture and design of an eLearning system should be informed by the adult learners' perceived usefulness of the system (Pitnuch & Lee, 2006). More recently, the presentation of face to face teaching and online learning as alternatives has been superseded by conceptualisations of blended learning. Through presenting these learning environments in terms of their possibilities and limitations, and the emergence of blended learning, implications for adult learning will be synthesised.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate what influences acceptance and resistance to a corporate <b>elearning</b> <b>initiative</b> provided by X Company to its dealer network to identify the factors affecting participation. The research used a survey design to gather both qualitative (interview instrument) and quantitative (questionnaire instrument) data to examine the factors affecting learner interest in, and resistance to, training and elearning. The results provided insight into the attitudes and perceptions of X Company employees about the training and identified areas for further attention to facilitate a ‘best practices’ approach for increasing participation. The research question explored was: “What barriers and enticers emerge regarding elearning in a group of employees offered an elearning training opportunity. ” Lewin’s Force Field Theory was used to examine the driving and restraining forces that influence an individual’s ‘fields’ and was used as the framework to apply the findings to gain a clearer understanding of the factors that supported or detracted from participation in this <b>elearning</b> <b>initiative.</b> Lewin suggests that consideration of what encourages learners to embrace new methods for learning is important but equally, the factors that cause resistance to learning must be thoroughly examined. If an employee, in this instance, is motivated to try new methods of learning then participation will be high however, if they are resistant to learning their level of participation will be low. Supporting factors for elearning in this study indicated appreciation for being provided with work related training, with increased product knowledge and stronger customer service skills that were formally recognized by the employer, being the others. Detractors which appeared to cause resistance were insufficient time to complete the lessons, insufficient coaching and support, incentives that did not hold meaning and, in some cases, lack of remuneration for lesson completion.

The shortages in the global nursing and midwifery workforce are undeniable and untenable. In the quest to scale up the production and deployment of nurses and midwives, various entities have undertaken major initiatives to increase access to learning opportunities, reform educational systems, re-align distribution with need, and bolster existing educational resources. The increasing availability of, and demand for, digital learning resources and opportunities (eLearning) as a potential tool for increasing the production of nurses and midwives is an area of growing interest and activity. Using eLearning as a mechanism for nursing and midwifery scale-up is accompanied by both challenges and opportunities. As global connectivity increases, new avenues for digital content access and learning object distribution escalate. Collaboration and knowledge exchange opportunities increase, creating new avenues to educate and train the cadres of nurses and midwives that are needed to support universal care. At the same time, misguided or uninformed <b>eLearning</b> <b>initiatives</b> can divert precious resources from vitally needed health services, and distract governments from the matter at hand. Increasing the quantity of nurses and midwives without a matching commitment to improving quality is a short-sighted solution. Short-term gains may result in long-term losses without strategic planning and deep understanding. As the pressures for digital innovation and workforce scale-up grow, so do the questions. In this regard, requests to the World Health Organization (WHO) for guidance are increasing. The complex interplay between policy, demographic and labour market changes, financing, emerging technologies, and critical nursing and midwifery workforce challenges drives national governments to the WHO. In response to this pattern of requests for assistance in planning investments and initiatives for nursing and midwifery scale-up, the WHO has commissioned this work by the University of Michigan...|$|R

The evaluative framework {{is based on}} a holistic behavioural taxonomic approach incorporating affective, cognitive, and physical domains. In this study the behavioural taxonomic approach was applied to the evaluation of a historical information literacy initiative, the IFYE (Integrated First Year Experience), developed by the Cape T echnikon in 1997, South Africa. The motivating factor behind the evaluation was to determine whether it would be suitable as an implementable initiative at other institutions in the Western Cape. This coincided with the aims of Infolit, who had invited institutions of Higher Education to submit pilot projects on information literacy in a drive to promote information literacy throughout the Western Cape. Although the IFYE initiative may not have realised its full potential, information literacy has drawn continued interest and other initiatives have since been developed. Application of two eXlsttng taxonomles, demonstrated distinct limitations in their application and a new taxonomy was developed within the South African educational context.

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} emerged several {{initiatives}} promoted by educational organizations to adapt Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) to <b>eLearning.</b> These <b>initiatives</b> commonly named <b>eLearning</b> Frameworks {{share a common}} goal: to create flexible learning environments by integrating heterogeneous systems already available in many educational institutions.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{imperative}} for Australian universities to deliver Higher Education through a range of approaches employing a diversity of established and emerging digital technologies. The imperative to attract and engage students and {{improve the quality of}} educational outcomes has seen an enormous penetration of information and communication technologies across the sector. An extensive body of literature has established the pedagogic potential of eLearning; however, supporting the integration of technologies in online and blended-mode settings remains a considerable challenge for universities, academic departments and lecturers with well-established approaches to teaching and learning. In response to the concern that <b>eLearning</b> <b>initiatives</b> have generally fallen short of their promise to transform teaching and learning in Higher Education, the study sought to explore the challenge of planning and teaching a blended-mode course {{from the perspective of a}} group of lecturers who were experienced university educators and disciplinary practitioners. In particular, the research sought to investigate the influence and interplay of individual, social and contextual structures on lecturers' pedagogical intentions, decisions and actions. The research is therefore driven by a primary research question: How do experienced university lecturers make decisions about teaching with technology in a contemporary blended learning environment? Sub-questions guiding the inquiry are: (a) How do the lecturers' individual beliefs about teaching and learning influence their decisions? (b) How do the contextual and social structures in their environment influence their decisions? and (c) What is the relationship between individual and contextual factors in the decision making process? Locating the study within the theoretical and interpretive framework of cultural-historical activity theory (Engeström, 1987, 2001) provided a means to describe the highly mediated yet dynamic nature of lecturers' participation in planning and teaching a blended-mode course, as well as a way to capture the social, cultural and historical factors influencing their decision-making in the local and broader context. To allow the nature of lecturers' participation in a complex activity to emerge over time, this exploratory research adopted a qualitative design and a multiple case study approach. Data were gathered over the course of a study period by way of individual and group semi-structured interviews, stimulated recall interviews, online observations and digital artifacts. Data interpretation was undertaken in two phases and employed Rogoff's (1995) notion of the three planes of sociocultural analysis to focus on the activity taking place on the personal, interpersonal and institutional-community levels. Interpretation began with the construction of pedagogical belief profiles for each participant and culminated with detailed accounts of the interactions and tensions in their work activity systems. A cross-case analysis was undertaken to synthesise and discuss the individual, contextual and technological influences on lecturers' participation in the activity of technology-mediated teaching. The four case studies presented in this inquiry provide an insider's perspective on how university teachers from different disciplines (Journalism, Health Science, Engineering, and Nursing) make decisions about teaching with technology in a contemporary blended learning context. In particular, the study offers an expanded view of teacher cognition that illuminates the complex interrelationships among lecturers' pedagogical and technological beliefs, their interpretation of the technology's 'affordances-in-use', their past experiences as teachers and practitioners, and the social and contextual structures in their local environment. The findings suggest that the relationship between the individual and the environment plays a significant role in determining how the latent affordances in the tool are activated (or suppressed) and become manifested through practice. In particular, the findings accentuate the highly personalised and contextualised nature of lecturers' personal practical theories of teaching and highlight the central role of the individual in the socially constructed activity of planning and teaching a blended-mode course. The findings also highlight the propensity of experienced lecturers to maintain the continuity of their established pedagogical beliefs by seeking alternative ways to actualise their pedagogical visions in the face of contradictory circumstances. This study has contributed to the growing body of research that has applied cultural-historical activity theory to eLearning and has a number of implications for both practice and research. The pedagogical belief profile developed in the methodological design phase of this research holds promise for assisting lecturers to engage in in-depth reflection on the conceptual stances and pedagogical orientations underpinning their espoused theories of teaching beyond the fundamental relationship between teacher, learner and content. Similarly a discussion or structured reflection drawing on the principles of cultural historical activity theory could provide opportunities for lecturers to reconcile the past and present forms of their practice by reflecting on the differences between the affordances of a traditional face-to-face teaching setting and a blended learning setting. Through surfacing some of the often-tacit individual and contextual factors at play and recognising their interrelatedness, there are opportunities to assist less experienced lecturers to discover their own pedagogical dispositions, vocalise their perceptions of the technology, and acknowledge the motivations and assumptions held by colleagues sharing the same activity. By engaging in such an exercise, lecturers may be better equipped to navigate the passage from the trial and error approach of the novice towards the self-aware and self-confident approach of an expert. An activity theory base for future research holds significant potential for a broader and deeper theorisation of the complexity of eLearning. This study has engaged with contextual complexity and the messiness of the human condition to illuminate the interrelationships among the individual, social, cultural and historical factors at play in a contemporary learning environment. Balancing the descriptive and interpretative elements with a degree of structure and organisation has enhanced explication of the findings. In doing so, this thesis represents a credible contribution to the field and offers a viable approach for future investigations...|$|R

Distance education normally occurs in a different place from teaching and as a result requires special techniques of course design, special instructional techniques, special methods of communication, as well as special organizational and administrative arrangements [1]. eLearning is the use of network technology, namely the Internet, to design, deliver, select, administer and extend learning [2]. In fact, eLearning is one buzzword in the world of Internet and distance education. For many specialists {{it has the potential to}} be a killer application of the Internet along with eCommerce. In the European Union, eLearning is being seen as a major opportunity to move Europe forward to a knowledge society. Supporting this view, the European Commission recently launched the <b>eLearning</b> <b>initiative</b> aiming the mobilization of the educational and cultural communities, as well as the economic and social players in Europe, in order to speed up changes in the education and training systems fostering Europe's move to a knowledge-based societ...|$|E
40|$|The Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) {{technique}} is a well-established “key tool” [1] for risk assessment and {{management in the}} field of engineering that has been ‘borrowed’ extensively in recent years by other areas such as the field of medicine, chemical process industries, and the automotive industry, where it has been utilised as a quality improvement tool. In a very structured way the FMEA enables a team of individuals to assess and manage risk by clarifying potential failures or problems with the product, service or process under review, highlighting the effects or consequences of those failures, and agreeing procedures to be put in place to either eliminate the occurrence of those effects or mitigate the severity of their consequences. In the absence of a standardised risk assessment strategy {{in the field of}} higher education (HE) and research, this paper details a study undertaken at a HE institute in Ireland that ‘borrowed’ the FMEA technique and modified it for use in the field of HE and research specifically, in order to evaluate its potential role and value for the field. Once modified in ways that supported the epistemological assumptions of the borrowing discipline, the technique was used to carry out a risk assessment of the strategies in place at the institute in question to implement its <b>elearning</b> <b>initiative.</b> Subsequently, how the research process itself ran, as well as the type and quality of the data the technique helped generate, were analysed in depth. The key finding of the study emerged as the high level of reflection that the modified FMEA technique encouraged unexpectedly amongst the participants. It provided them with a rare and invaluable opportunity to reflectively analyse the strategies in question, which led to significant outcomes for them. This in turn led to the design of the Failure Mode Effects Reflective Analysis (FMERA) qualitative research technique for the field of HE and research, which holds huge potential for the field in this era of great change and need for continuous quality improvement. This paper will introduce the technique and provide practical recommendations for its use...|$|E
