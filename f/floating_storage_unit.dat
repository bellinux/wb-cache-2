50|$|The main {{types of}} {{floating}} production systems are FPSO (floating production, storage, and offloading system). FPSOs consist of large monohull structures, generally (but not always) shipshaped, equipped with processing facilities. These platforms are moored to a location for extended periods, {{and do not}} actually drill for oil or gas. Some variants of these applications, called FSO (floating storage and offloading system) or FSU (<b>floating</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit),</b> are used exclusively for storage purposes, and host very little process equipment. This {{is one of the}} best sources for having floating production.|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{activity}} {{related to}} the search of energy in terms of hydrocarbons is taking place at increasing water depths. In deeper water, the effects on the floater motion from the mooring and riser systems increase significantly. Viscous damping, inertial mass, current loading and restoring effects from riser and mooring systems need to be adequately modeled in order to predict the system motion of response. Accurate prediction of the system response is vital {{in the context of}} design verification of the complete system. The recommended method to analyze the dynamics of a moored structure, especially in deep waters, is by a coupled analysis approach. This is recognized by the dynamics of the floater, mooring lines and risers being solved simultaneously. This thesis comprises a theoretical part, where key subjects {{related to the}} prediction of moored structure motion are addressed. In addition, coupled time domain analyses of a moored Sevan FSU (<b>Floating</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Unit)</b> were performed. The analyses were initiated by the establishment of a finite element model of the Sevan hull. This was used to conduct a diffraction analysis on FSU. The results obtained from the diffraction analysis were imported to OrcaFlex, where the mooring systems were also modeled. OrcaFlex is a fully 3 D non-linear time domain finite element program, which supports Newman?s approximation and a method based on Aranha?s approximation in order to predict the low frequency motion of moored structures. Model tests have been previously performed on the moored FSU, and results from these tests were used as the basis for comparison to the OrcaFlex results. In addition, time series of the wave elevation and wind velocities recorded during the FSU model tests were acquired through Sevan and Marintek, enabling these environmental conditions to be integrated in the OrcaFlex analyses. Hence time series results from the OrcaFlex analyses were directly comparable with the FSU model test time series. The drawback of this approach ultimately proved to be the CPU-cost and the duration of the numerical simulation of relatively short model test time series (scaled to real time). The results obtained from the OrcaFlex analyses show acceptable compliance to the model test results, but the amplitude of the low frequency motion seems to be slightly under predicted. In order to predict outcomes under specific scenarios e. g. extreme events of the system response, a longer real time simulation is required. </p...|$|E
40|$|Field A is a {{marginal}} oil field {{located in the}} North Sea, operated by Det norske oljeselskap ASA (hereby Det norske). Det norske are currently working on the maturation of the field development, and have identified three development options. 	Floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), with a bridge link to a well head platform (WHP). 	Subsea tie-back to a host facility. 	Jack-up with production facility (JUDP) and WHP. Produced oil will be stored in a <b>floating</b> <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> (FSU). The produced oil will be stabilized to the export specifications and offloaded to a shuttle tanker. The base case for gas export is to export wet gas to a platform on another field, Field B, {{where it will be}} dehydrated and conditioned to meet the export specifications in one of the export pipelines connected to the platform. There are however uncertainties concerning the processing suitability at Field B, and Det norske is therefore investigating the possibilities for installing dehydration and conditioning equipment on the Field A platform. In this thesis, different methods for dehydration and conditioning of the Field A gas is tested through process simulations in HYSYS. A mapping of the gas infrastructure in the Field A area reveals two dry gas export pipelines; Statpipe and Vesterled, and two rich gas export pipelines; FUKA and Sage. This thesis is mainly based on dry gas export, and therefore most of the work is put into export in Statpipe or Vesterled. A literature study concerning different methods to dehydrate and condition the gas is performed. The simulations later in the thesis are based on this study. To get a comparison basis for the different development alternatives in terms of weight, costs and complexity, a simulation of a basic Field A process with no dehydration or conditioning is first simulated. This will also be the Field A process if wet gas export to Field B is chosen as the solution for gas protraction at Field A. The basic process is then expanded with different equipment for dehydration of the gas, and the different dehydration processes are briefly evaluated. The dehydration processes are then varied and/or expanded to achieve both adequate dehydration and hydrocarbon dew point in the gas, based on the export specifications in Statpipe and Vesterled. The final processes, achieving both proper water- and hydrocarbon dew point in the export gas, are evaluated and compared to the basic process without dehydration and conditioning, in terms of weight, costs and complexity,. Based on the findings in this thesis it seems dry gas export from Field A is difficult to achieve. Based on the limited information available from the operating company of Field B, the Field B process is simulated in HYSYS to check the process suitability for the Field A gas. Finally, an alternative solution to achieve dry gas export from Field A, by bleeding off propane in the process, is briefly discussed. The solution of rich gas export in either FUKA or Sage is also briefly discussed. </p...|$|E
