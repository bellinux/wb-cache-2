Upon his return he vowed to fight the charges against him, but said that [...] "it's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> in the United States".

2500|$|Following her release, {{she signed}} with the Atco imprint Modern Records and {{released}} Dangerous, which started a slow resurgence for Cole in terms of record sales and chart success. In 1987, she changed to EMI-Manhattan Records and released the album Everlasting, which returned her {{to the top of}} the charts thanks to singles such as [...] "Jump Start (My Heart)", the top ten ballad, [...] "I Live For Your Love", and her dance-pop cover of Bruce Springsteen's [...] "Pink Cadillac". That success helped Everlasting reach one million in sales and become Cole's first platinum album in ten years. In 1989, she released her follow-up to Everlasting, <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Back,</b> which produced the number two hit [...] "Miss You Like Crazy"; it also achieved international success, reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{many other}} towns in Alberta, Athabasca predates the railway. It was the {{terminus}} of the Edmonton to Athabasca Landing trail. Athabasca lies on a southern protrusion of the Athabasca River. During the fur trade era, when rivers were the principal means of transportation, the Athabasca-Edmonton trail connected two different drainage basins. The Athabasca River flows north and {{is part of}} the Mackenzie River watershed, which leads to the Arctic Ocean. Edmonton lies across a height-of-land on the North Saskatchewan River in the Nelson River drainage basin, which empties into Hudson Bay. Edmonton was in Rupert's Land but not Athabasca. The trail allowed <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> portaged <b>back</b> and forth between river systems. Once agricultural settlement occurred, the trail served a similar purpose. Eventually, road and rail links would trace the same path.|$|R
60|$|Old Mother West Wind {{had just}} {{come down from the}} Purple Hills and turned loose her children, the Merry Little Breezes, from the big bag in which she had been {{carrying}} them. They were very lively and very merry as they danced and raced across the Green Meadows in all directions, for it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> there once more. Old Mother West Wind almost sighed as she watched them for a few minutes. She felt that she would like to join them. Always the springtime made her feel this way,--young, mad, carefree, and happy. But she had work to do. She had to turn the windmill to pump water for Farmer Brown's cows, and this was only one of many mills standing idle as they waited for her. So she puffed her cheeks out and started about her business.|$|E
6000|$|Late that afternoon, {{she reached}} Mildenham. Winton {{met her at}} the station. And on the drive up, they passed the cottage where Daphne Wing was staying. It {{stood in front of}} a small coppice, a creepered, plain-fronted, little brick house, with a garden still full of sunflowers, tenanted by the old jockey, Pettance, his widowed daughter, and her three small children. [...] "That talkative old scoundrel," [...] as Winton always called him, was still {{employed}} in the Mildenham stables, and his daughter was laundress to the establishment. Gyp had secured for Daphne Wing the same free, independent, economic agent who had watched over her own event; the same old doctor, too, was to be the presiding deity. There were no signs of life about the cottage, and she would not stop, too eager to be at home again, to see the old rooms, and smell the old savour of the house, to get to her old mare, and feel its nose nuzzling her for sugar. It was so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>back</b> once more, feeling strong and well and able to ride. The smile of the inscrutable Markey at the front door was a joy to her, even the darkness of the hall, where a gleam of last sunlight fell across the skin of Winton's first tiger, on which she had so often sunk down dead tired after hunting. Ah, it was nice to be at home! ...|$|E

60|$|Never a day now {{passed that}} {{one or both of}} the birds did not rest on my tent. When I put my head out, like a turtle out of his shell, in the early morning to look at the weather, Killooleet would look down from the {{projecting}} end of the ridgepole and sing good-morning. And when I had been out late on the lake, night-fishing, or following the inlet for beaver, or watching the grassy points for caribou, or just drifting along shore silently to catch the night sounds and smells of the woods, I would listen with childish anticipation for Killooleet's welcome as I approached the landing. He had learned to recognize the sounds of my coming, the rub of a careless paddle, the ripple of water under the bow, or the grating of pebbles on the beach; and with Simmo asleep, and the fire low, it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> welcomed <b>back</b> by a cheery little voice in the darkness; for he always sang when he heard me. Sometimes I would try to surprise him; but his sleep was too light and his ears too keen. The canoe would glide up to the old cedar and touch the shore noiselessly; but with the first crunch of gravel under my foot, or the rub of my canoe as I lifted it out, he would waken; and his song, all sweetness and cheer, I'm here, sweet Killooleet-lillooleet-lillooleet, would ripple out of the dark underbrush where his nest was.|$|R
40|$|The Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB) is an {{extension}} of the classical Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that includes both a set of customers <b>to</b> whom products <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered and a set of suppliers whose <b>goods</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the distribution center. In addition, on each route all deliveries have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made before any goods can <b>be</b> picked up <b>to</b> avoid rearranging the loads on the vehicle. The main objective for VRPB <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine the network route to minimize the total cost, distance or time. There are a few methods that can <b>be</b> identified <b>to</b> solve this VRPB. The objective of this research <b>is</b> <b>to</b> present a heuristic method, called Genetic Algorithm (GA), for the VRPB. In brief, GA is a system developing methods that use the natural principle of a genetic population and involved three main processes that is crossover, mutation and inversion. GA implementation on the 68 nodes problems taken from Goetschalckx and Jacobs- Blecha is done by using Microsoft C++ Programming. Solutions <b>to</b> the problem <b>are</b> presented and performance comparison is conducted with the existing best solution. Several parameters in GA will be tested such as population size, crossover point and also the choice of operators used. </p...|$|R

40|$|This article <b>is</b> a {{response}} <b>to</b> McLeod and Baylis (2007) who {{speculate on the}} dangers of requesting fresh ‘spare’ embryos from IVF patients for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research, particularly when those embryos <b>are</b> <b>good</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the woman. They argue that these embryos should be frozen instead. We explore what is meant by ‘spare’ embryos. We then provide empirical evidence, from a study of embryo donation and of embryo donors' views, to substantiate some of their speculations about the problems associated with requesting fresh embryos. However, we also question whether such problems are resolved by embryo freezing, since further empirical evidence suggests that this raises other social and ethical problems for patients. There is little evidence that the request for embryos for research, in itself, causes patients distress. We suggest, however, that no requests for fresh embryos should be made in the first cycle of IVF treatment. Deferring the request to a later cycle ensures that potential donors are better informed (by experience and reflection) about the possible destinations of their embryos and about the definition of ‘spare embryos’. Both this article, and that by McLeod and Baylis, emphasize the need to consider the views and experiences of embryo donors when evaluating the ethics of embryo donation for hESC research...|$|R
