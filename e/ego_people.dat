40|$|In a few words: A {{technique}} {{for changing the}} way you are thinking about any particular problem. In the early eighties Edward de Bono created the Six Thinking Hats method. The method is essentially a framework for thinking and can incorporate lateral and other forms of thinking. Valuable judgmental thinking has its place in the system but is not allowed to dominate as in conventional thinking. The six hats represent six modes of thinking and are directions to think rather than labels for thinking. In other words, the hats are used proactively rather than reactively. The method promotes fuller input from more people. In de Bono's words it "separates ego from performance". Everyone is able to contribute to the exploration without denting egos as they are just using the yellow hat, for example. The six hats system encourages performance rather than <b>ego</b> defence. <b>People</b> can contribute under any hat even though they initially support the opposite view. The key point is that a hat is a direction to think rather than a label for thinking. The key theoretical reasons to use the Six Thinking Hats are to...|$|R

5000|$|Freud {{argues that}} the [...] "oceanic feeling", if it exists, is the {{preserved}} [...] "primitive ego-feeling" [...] from infancy. The primitive ego-feeling precedes {{the creation of the}} ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it. Therefore, the infant has no concept of a [...] "self" [...] or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego-feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist. Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego-feeling to coexist along with the <b>ego</b> in some <b>people.</b> The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the [...] "oceanic feeling" [...] described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.|$|R

For Whites, more mature racial identity indirectly predicted mature ego identity, while exploratory racial identity positively predicted committed ego identity. Finally, the least mature racial identity predicted {{a number of different}} ego identity statuses for Whites. However, psychometric analysis of the WRIAS indicated that the instrument more accurately reflected a two factor model than the five factor status model originally examined.

His idea of the id {{explains}} why people act out in certain ways, when it is not in line with the ego or superego. [...] "Religion is an illusion and it derives its strength {{from the fact that it}} falls in with our instinctual desires." [...] Freud believed that people rely on religion to give explanations for anxieties and tension they do not want to consciously believe in. Freud argued that humanity created God in their image. This reverses the idea of any type of religion because he believed that it is constructed by the mind. The role of the mind is something that Freud repeatedly talked about because he believed that the mind is responsible for both conscious and unconscious decisions based on drives and forces. The idea that religion causes people to behave in a moral way is incorrect according to Freud because he believed that no other force has the power to control the ways in which people act. Unconscious desires motivate people to act accordingly.Freud did a significant amount of research studying how people act and interact in a group setting. He believed that people act in different ways according to the demands and constraints of the group as a whole. In his book Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego, Freud argued that the church and organized religion form an [...] "artificial group" [...] which requires an external force to keep it together. In this type of group, everything is dependent on that external force and without it, the group would no longer exist. Groups are necessary, according to Freud in order to decrease the narcissism in all people, by creating libidinal ties with others by placing everyone at an equal level. The commonness among different <b>people</b> with different <b>egos</b> allows <b>people</b> to identify with one another. This relates to the idea of religion because Freud believed that people created religion in order to create these group ties that they unconsciously seek for.|$|R

It is usually through experiences, when faced with certain situations, {{to be able to}} gain alternative and logical solutions which have more chance to better success and achievement. Experience is hard to gain and requires correct decisions made for success. Experiences recommend everyone to get lessons out of painful events. Lessons learned from experience via daily activities in life must provide benefit for life. We all learn from our mistakes and accordingly one should learn from their mistakes in life.

The writer uses the library research as the method of the study to find references for the thesis. In the method of approach, the writer uses mimetic to help the theory which is sociology literature. In the intrinsic aspects, the writer chose to discuss it per stanza. By using diction, imagery and symbol to analyze the intrinsic aspects, so it is easier to figure the meaning of the lyric. Based on the analysis, the writer finds that it is true if “Imagine” had many influences in John Lennon’s life background as a peace activist. There are also some parts of the lyric which are related to his social background. John Lennon had the ambition to stop the war, making peace, and helping one and another for a better place for living. He exploited his fame by using the media and used his lyric so the world could hear like “Imagine”.

40|$|In his Contributions to the Analysis of the Sensations (Mach 1885) the phenomenalist philosopher Ernst Mach confronts {{us with a}} difficulty: “If {{we regard}} the Ego as a real unity, we become {{involved}} in the following dilemma: either we must set over against the Ego a world of unknowable entities […] or we must regard the whole world, the <b>Egos</b> of other <b>people</b> included, as comprised in our own Ego. ” (Mach 1885 : 21) In other words, if we start from a phenomenalist viewpoint, i. e., if we believe that the manifold of sensations we are confronted with is ontologically fundamental —as Mach clearly does: “For us, colors, sounds, spaces, times,… are the ultimate ele-ments” (Mach 1885 : 23) —then we are in danger to end up in solipsism. Unless, that is, we assume that some underlying thing-in-itself substratum from which matter, we ourselves, and all the others emanate. The only other alter-native seems to be—and Mach advertises it vehemently for he denies any “mons-trous notion of a thing-in-itself” (Mach 1885 : 6) 1 —that we get rid of the Ego. For, if there is no Self in the first place, then the question whether there are others dissolves. To put it the other way round, it is ok that the others do not exist because, really, I do not exist either. If the Ego is a Myth solipsism is not just wrong but nonsense. There are two questions this paper wishes to address: first, do we need independent additional support for the denial of the Self or is the avoidance of solipsism reason enough to assume the Ego’s non-existence? I will argue that we do need additional reasons and I will evaluate those that Mach indeed gives to prove that “the primary fact is not the I, the Ego, but the elements (sensations) ” (Mach 1885 : 19). Second, is the deconstruction of the I, even if further sufficient support can be found, really adequate to stop us from worrying about solipsism? The doubt I will put forward is that the illusion of a Self might conjure up enough of an Ego—just like feeling a pain is having a pain, even if it is located in a phantom limb—to start us wondering whether it also occurs elsewhere. ...|$|R
40|$|All {{conclusions}} about some psychological characteristics or content must derive from relations of social, or better yet, epochal changes and structure they create. General agreement - admittedly biased and {{without access to}} a constant fact which is not close to any transitional movements - that the times are unstable - does not end with a precise understanding of how much would that instability reflect on {{the formation of a}} stable character. It could be said that this particular level of structuration, which connects 'the external' and 'the internal', is consistently absent in most theories. This especially applies to our central self, our consciousness, the authoritative part of us that sets standards and has been wrongly equated with universal truths, general principles and something that is considered to be common to all people. All complexity of formation of the super­ego, as the lastly formed instance that is also responsible for the sense of duty or the sense of moral obligation, has always been a result of the current form of structuration and has always been realized, more or less, as a distorted memory of certain, quite determined, events that a subject was overwhelmed with. If we listen to our own tendencies toward instability, we will not fall into the trap which is often present when describing ourselves, i. e. the belief that we have 'a real self', common to all human beings, whose requests are more important than requests of all others. However, outside of dynamic psychology, {{it would be difficult to}} understand how Lacan's 'split entity' could ever have 'a real self' whose requests are, especially concerning morality, more important than all other requests. Human nature has most easily been introduced into the norm by those ideals that had insisted on denial, and are located in the ego ideal. When 'ideals' moved, usually behind a screen of freedom and urge for individualization, the pleasure returned to nature in the form of ego ideals that knew the answer to the question, 'What is good for a man's life?' It is, as a reality principle, located in egocentric context, but no longer as an individual excess, but rather as a general, universal truth. Individualism, as the supreme value, has allowed different people to keep different views on what is a good life. While the <b>ego</b> ideal extolled <b>people</b> to make a compromise in which, of course, they had to forgo nature for the sake of culture, ideal ego approves all bypasses of the law if it is good for the subject. It could almost be said that the system of ego ideal, which is valued less and less, makes values as they are. There is no degradation whatsoever because cancelling of differences and boundaries leads to uniformity where the difference between the right and wrong is reduced to personal good. 'An inner voice' that dictates duties to the subject and indicates where good and evil are in opposition as pure or impure, was suspended. Ideal ego is not an ally of the law because it does not care for the subject's well-being. Unlike it, the ego ideal was giving satisfaction by its realization. No matter how strange it might seem, the highest value in a man (moral values) is most deeply associated with the lowest, with his pure nature. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question, 'What is my true self?' to a man who wonders what it is human nature. For psychoanalysis, it is hard to accept that naive 'clear understanding of self' and own values, which starts from Plato. And that was particularly difficult when, instead of compensated narcissism in the ego ideal, he continued his life in the ideal ego...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{cooperation}} of the incumbent leaders was {{a major cause of}} leadership succession failures of organizations reported. This investigation was carried out to determine the attitudes of Christian Senior Pastors and leaders (associate Pastors and Elders), for leadership continuity, toward leadership succession of Charismatic and Pentecostal Church organizations in Kumasi, Ghana; to find lasting {{solution to the problem of}} lack {{of cooperation}} of incumbent leaders towards leadership succession planning by determining the root cause of lack of cooperation of incumbent senior leader towards leadership succession. Using in-depth interview, qualitative data was collected and analyzed using inductive procedure of Structuring (Ordering) of Meanings Using Narrative for analysis. This work contends that even though best practices are necessary condition for leadership succession effectiveness, they are not sufficient to make the incumbent senior leader willing and cooperative enough to act in the best interest of the organization, let alone yield to leadership succession. It was found that the Christian Churches investigated have positive attitudes towards leadership succession because of character development adopted in the churches. It was found that apart from fear (Freeman, 2004; Zhang and Rajagopalan, 2006; 2010) and ego (Freeman, 2004; Beeson, 2006; Ciampa, 2005), unforgveness and self-centeredness were other causes, holding back the effectiveness of leadership succession due to lack of {{cooperation of the}} incumbents, with self-centeredness being the source of fear, ego and unforgiveness. It was concluded that self-centeredness was the root cause of lack of cooperation of Senior Pastors towards leadership succession. Because fear (Freeman, 2004; Zhang and Rajagopalan, 2006; 2010), ego (Freeman, 2004; Beeson, 2006; Ciampa, 2005), unforgiveness and self-centeredness produce insecurity, the incumbents were never willing and cooperative to subject themselves to anything they perceived as threat. On the basis of this, succession failures reported will rather increase in frequency. Nevertheless, self-centeredness could be resolved effectively by adopting character development focused on the following nine attributes: Faith, Peace, Joy, Humility, Patience, Self-control, Kindness, Goodness and Love (value, respect, approval, availability, attention, appreciation and service). The results suggest that the incumbent Pastors have the tendency to take actions, make choices and decisions that are in the best interest of their organization, and are favorably disposed towards leadership succession. The Christian Churches are well positioned to produce leaders who are cooperative and selfless enough to plan their own succession using best practices that yield desired outcomes. This work contributes to a better understanding of attitudes, character, relationship, motivation, highlights the invisible features (self-centeredness, fear, ego and unforgiveness) of leadership succession failures in the organization, and the transformation of character that results by simple change of attitudes consistently modified by love and its attributes so that the decisions, choices and actions of the incumbents can favor the organization, consequently, making them willing and cooperative enough to plan their own succession. Based on the results of the Christian Church organization, it serves as a basis for further research in the field. This work contends that even though best practices are necessary condition for leadership succession effectiveness, they are not sufficient to make the incumbent senior leader willing and cooperative enough to act in the best interest of the organization, let alone yield to leadership succession. Previous studies have shown that fear and ego were causes of the lack of cooperation of the incumbent leaders toward leadership succession. Having confirmed them by this work, self-centeredness and unforgivenness were found to be other causes of lack of cooperation of the incumbents, with self-centeredness being the root cause. The disposition of humans to seek their own interest or personal gain is guided by the set of values that form the character of the individual. These values describe self-centeredness of the people and clearly show up in their actions, choices and decisions. Generally, people are plagued with fear when they perceive threat against that to which they are consciously or unconsciously emotionally attached to. <b>Ego</b> results when <b>people</b> attempt to shield for protection against that which is perceived as a threat in fear of losing respect and power. Unforgiveness is the outcome of unresolved offences when a person’s ego is hurt (mainly due to disrespect; anything that undermined the person). Love (value, respect, approval, availability, attention, appreciation and service) and its attributes have values and virtues that directly oppose to that of self-centeredness; this describes the selfless nature of love. By love, I mean the human attribute that makes people value, approve, respect, give attention to, become available to, appreciate, and serve others irrespective of the person (background, social status etc.). Love seeks for the good and the welfare of the other, hence shifting focus from ‘self’ to the ‘other’. Even though, this work concerns leadership and administration, it touches on an area that is of immense social interest; relationship and conflict resolution. Self-centeredness, fear, ego and unforgiveness are human characteristics that are inevitable in almost every human endeavor. It was established that self-centeredness, fear, ego and unforgiveness cannot make anybody seek the good and the welfare of another. Therefore, effectively resolving them will cause our human interactions and relationships to thrive and blossom, consequently enhancing our social lives. Because attitudes shape character and character, attitudes; attitudes determine emotions, and emotions effect attitudes, the characteristics (emotions); self-centeredness, fear, ego, and the consequences of unforgiveness can be resolved by change of attitudes modified by love and its attributes. This work contributes to a better understanding of attitudes, character, self-centeredness, fear, ego and unforgiveness, and the transformation of character that results by simple change of attitudes consistently modified by love and its attributes so that the decisions, choices and actions of the incumbents can favor the organization, consequently, making them willing and cooperative enough to plan their own succession. + 233 243 677 41...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{functions}} of the literary works is to educate the public as well as producing aesthetic and artistic values. Every literary work gives a social message for its followers. Although most of the classical Turkish literature is valued within the aesthetic and artistic aspect, numerous works are directly related to social life. The fact that ghazals are counted as the starting point to evaluate the literary identity of poets led to the idea that this literature is a literature of dreams circling aroundsymbols and imagery. Except the experts of the subject, the general opinion tend to ignore the social content in the classical literature, apart from a few works such as Harname, Şikayetname and so on and the style “Hikemi” in which Nabi was the forerunner. In the evaluation of this literature that has continued for ages, the social value of the divans and the other products were unfortunately overshadowed. Especially in mystical works the poet puts forward suggestions for the development and purificationof human soul. These works are the texts in which the poet explained his interlocutors the methods of personal and social development according to the understanding he adopts. The Divan literature examined in this perspective renders a considerable number of materials about human education and countless materials worthy of examination for many sciences to its service. Behişti’s masnavi of “Hest Behişt” is a significant literary work which has advices viable in the present from many aspects. Heşt Behişt represents a good example to the direct relation of the classical Turkish literature with education and life. This work is the one that can be easily used in education. In Heşt Behişt, there are suggestions of solution to the matters of many modern sciences such as psychology, sociology and philosophy. In our study, there is a focus on the idea that similar kinds of works should be evaluated again within this perspective as seen in the analysis of Heşt Behişt. Behişti, who lived in the sixteenth century, is among the most significant poets of his period. Behişti’s masnavi called “Heşt Behişt”, which he wrote as a mystic text and in which he gives suggestions to his readers about being a good person throughout, is a nice example in Classical Turkish Literature in the context of education. His having ordered his work on classified chapters regarded as significant. The poet found it necessary to make a short introduction to stress the concepts he regarded as important in human education before starting the story hewill tell {{at the beginning of the}} chapters. Psychologically the “author” prepares the mind of readers to take recommendations by making evaluations on the transience of the world and time, the natureof human being in the chapter under the title “matla” before passing to the chapters in his work. He reminds people of both their end and the end of the world by making parallels between humans and the world. In the first part, he takes up with the subject of sincerity and good deeds. According to Behişti, gaining happiness in two worlds depends on praying with sincerity. While the person is praying, he should purify his mind and soul from the negative things he inhabits in his personality and avoid from showing-off and hypocrisy. In the second part, the main subject is decorum. By saying “the person who does a favour finds a favour and the person who behaves well is welcomed”, he implies that goodness does not only bring benefits to the person himself but also to society. The third part, in which generosity is the focus, the importance of donating for God’s sake is referred. It is indicated that the philanthropic donations and sacrifices are not to satisfy the <b>ego.</b> He reminds <b>people</b> of the temporariness of the world and the reality of death. It is announced to generous people that they will be granted peace and their riches will not decrease but on the contrary increase much more. In the fourth, he writes on God’s name, “Melik”(Meaning “sovereign, ruler, king” in reference to God), which means the real owner of the property, ruler and sultan. It is felt that all people who have been born since Adam are the servants of the AllMighty God. The material world is a temporary place that one should not trust and attach oneself to. Human beings should perform what the creator God commands by persevering with resignation and using their will. The fifth part explains what kind of manners human beings should assume in the face of problems and how they can overcome them. In the sixth part, it is mentioned that as immortality belongs only to God, that everything present outside Him is temporary. In the seventh part, it is told that reaching real happiness depends on obeying God’s orders and serving every order of Him. In the eighth and the last part, the main subject is the love of prophets and the importance of following them. The poet says that he does not give any importance to art and finery in his poems and the main purpose for writing his work is not fame but giving advice. He expresses that he gives more importance to meaning rather than form, that is, doing art in his works and he creates his work with the inspiration that he gets from God. The interdisciplinary studies about classical literature texts should gain much more interest and the texts should be criticized within references to the relevant disciplines. The literary works which reflect the social, economic and political atmosphere of societies are to be regarded as important resources. When we consider the centuries-long history of our classical literature and its various genres, we will understand the nature of this richness and content better. When the interdisciplinary perspective is applied to the classical literature texts, these studies that reflect the riches of the past will also enable the new generation to gain selfconfidence in the name of the culture they belong to...|$|R
