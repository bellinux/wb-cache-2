5000|$|The Augmented <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> or Advanced <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle,</b> {{also known}} as ASLV, was a five-stage solid-fuel rocket {{developed}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to place 150 kg satellites into LEO. This project was started by India during the early 1980s to develop technologies needed for a payload to be placed into a geostationary orbit. [...] Its design was based on <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> ISRO did not have sufficient funds for both the Polar <b>Satellite</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle</b> programme and the ASLV programme {{at the same time}} and the ASLV programme was terminated after the initial developmental flights. The payloads of ASLV were Stretched Rohini Satellites.|$|R
