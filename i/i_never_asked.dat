25|$|Alessandro Lessona (Minister of Mussolini's government), {{a friend}} of mine at the time, paid to you more than 4 million English Pounds from 1925 to 1931. Even I had the right to act, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for my part. That money, as anyone in Albania knows, have been washed by the blood of patriots as Bajram Curri, Hasan Prishtina, Luigj Gurakuqi, and {{thousand}} of them.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} and commercial success {{of her two}} previous albums, Jackson continued to receive numerous comparisons to her brother Michael, often with doubts that she held staying power in the music industry. When Edna Gundersen of USA Today questioned her about the subject, she responded: [...] "Certain people feel I'm just riding on my last name... That's why I just put my first name on janet. and why <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> my brothers to write or produce music for me." [...] Virgin Records expressed the album title [...] "punctuates the declaration of strength the singer, songwriter and producer boldly expresses on this moving collection of songs which explore love, sensuality, the power of sisterhood and her own evolving self-identity." [...] Thomas Harrison, author of Music of the 1990s (2011) wrote that [...] "he conscious decision was made, by the company and/or Jackson, to put her into the same league as other one-named artists, such as Madonna, Bono, and Prince, {{or at least to}} put her on the same standing as others in the industry who are often called by one name, such as Whitney, Mariah, Diana, Dolly, and Garth among others. Jackson could now, in a sense, stand on her own and not be seen as a product of the family entertainment machine." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant magazine recounted the title of the album ultimately [...] "announced the singer as completely independent of her male-dominated family [...] it positioned her as the person in charge of her sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ron Paul then {{clashed with}} Santorum and Gingrich. He called Santorum a [...] "big government, big {{spending}} individual", citing Santorum's votes {{to raise the}} debt ceiling, for the No Child Left Behind Act, for the Medicare Modernization Act and against Right-to-work. Santorum replied, [...] "I'm a conservative. I'm not a libertarian. I believe in some government. I do believe that... as a senator from Pennsylvania that I had a responsibility {{to go out there}} and represent the interests of my state." [...] Moderator Josh McElveen asked Paul if he stood by comments that Gingrich was a [...] "chicken hawk" [...] for not serving in the military. When Paul said that he did, Gingrich said, [...] "Dr. Paul has a long history of saying things that are inaccurate and false. The fact is, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for deferment. I was married with a child. It was never a question." [...] Paul replied, [...] "When I was drafted, I was married and had two kids, and I went", which was greeted with applause.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know." [...] Mrs Davidson {{took off}} her {{pince-nez}} and wiped them. [...] "When {{he is on the}} Lord's work <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> him questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> shall <b>ask</b> her. What's the use {{of beating}} about the bush, aunt? <b>I</b> <b>never</b> shall <b>ask</b> her; and if I did, she wouldn't have me. If {{you want to make}} Sophie Mellerby your niece, Jack's your game." ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame Munster {{looked at}} him again; and then, smiling: [...] "And I have {{certainly}} had time, since I got here, to ask myself why I came. However, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> myself idle questions. Here I am, {{and it seems to}} me you ought only to thank me." ...|$|R
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
60|$|ALICE (with bravado). All right; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> you for anything.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [holding her]. Nobody {{asked you}} to, ma'am. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> any woman {{to marry me}} before.|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. [with sad gaiety] At {{all events}} I promise you <b>I</b> shall <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> anyone else.|$|R
6000|$|... "What needs ye be aye speering then at folk?" [...] {{retorted}} Effie. [...] "I'm sure, if ye'll ask nae questions, I'll tell ye nae lees. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> {{what brings}} the Laird of Dumbiedikes glowering here like a wull-cat (only his een's greener, and no sae gleg), day after day, till we are a' like to gaunt our charts aft." ...|$|R
50|$|Mr Praline: <b>I</b> thought you'd <b>never</b> <b>ask.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And last, how to [...] "act": {{for some}} mysterious reason <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> any {{theatrical}} celebrity, male or female, {{how to do}} that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, speak, Emlyn," [...] said Cicely, [...] "for though <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> before, fearing my own weakness, I am curious. None {{can hear}} us here." ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. [aside to Tavy] <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> her. It is a trap for me. [He goes up {{the lawn}} towards the garden. Octavius remains petrified].|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON (touching her {{shoulder}} affectionately, soothed even by a gibe from her). My dear Dolly: {{if you only}} knew how glad I am that it {{is nothing but a}} joke to you, though it is such bitter earnest to me. (More resolutely, turning to Philip.) Phil, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> you questions about your private concerns. You are not going to question me, are you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will do me {{the justice}} to {{remember}} that <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> you for anything," [...] said Ferrand. [...] "Thank you a thousand times. Good-bye!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} what you say, and know how true it is. But believe me--you will soon, if you cannot now--there is no one on this earth less {{qualified}} to set it right or help you, Florence, than <b>I.</b> <b>Never</b> <b>ask</b> me why, or speak {{to me about it}} or of my husband, more. There should be, so far, a division, and a silence between us two, like the grave itself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him to come. If he comes, let him face us both. I {{have not}} made much of my {{dealings}} with him alone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{it is my}} {{pleasure}} to do so, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> you to walk with me. You are wanted in the drawing-room, you had better go back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't," [...] she repeated. [...] "Indeed I don't. He {{never told}} me and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him. I {{understood}} {{that he had made}} it in South Africa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Captain, you're {{the only}} Protestant among us; show these Catholics of mine a liberal example--show {{them what they}} ought to do for their priest,"--here Captain Ussher put a couple of half-crowns in the plate. [...] "There, boys, see what a Protestant does for me. Well, Feemy, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> the ladies, you know, but I shan't let Thady off; though he ain't here, I shall settle that in the rent." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>Never</b> Even <b>Asked</b> for Light is {{the second}} studio album by Lullaby for the Working Class. It was {{released}} October 21, 1997 on Bar/None Records.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have asked}} that girl {{to marry me}} three times, and <b>I</b> shall <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> her again. There is a point beyond which a man shouldn't go. There are many reasons why {{it would be a}} good marriage. In the first place, her money would be serviceable. Then it would heal matters in our family, for my father is as prejudiced in her favour as he is against me. And I love her dearly. I've loved her all my life,--since I used to buy cakes for her. But <b>I</b> shall <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> her again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, uncle, I {{never did}} {{ask you to}} give me a new ribbon. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> you to give me {{anything}} for myself; nor do I ask this for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Somebody said Denver. Some {{one else}} said Kansas City. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> dad, because I knew Jack {{had been sent}} away. I've {{supposed}} he was working--making a man of himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{and that}} was the way you worried him; you made him tired of my very name! I wish you had never spoken of me to him; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> your help!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] said Mrs. Conant. [...] "Peter never {{tells me}} {{anything}} about the private affairs of his clients, and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> him. But of one thing I am sure, my dear, {{and that is that}} Peter Conant would not act as Colonel Weatherby's lawyer, and try to shield him, unless he believed him innocent of any crime. Peter is a little odd, in some ways, but he's honest to the backbone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! <b>I</b> had <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> after him. <b>I</b> {{suppose he}} is as pretty as ever,' said Annaple, who {{secretly}} thought his beauty too girlish compared with her sturdy Billy.|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [conscience stricken] You {{might go}} on {{to point out that}} <b>I</b> myself <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> where the money I spent came from. I believe I am just as bad as you.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} it. I'm certain <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him to tea. Or Dunstable either. Yet {{they came}} in as if I had. I didn't like to hurt their feelings by telling them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take them away, M. Paul," [...] I said, [...] "and {{teach me}} no more. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> {{to be made}} learned, and you compel me to feel very profoundly that {{learning}} is not happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|SYKES. Well, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> {{my mother}} to shew me her {{marriage}} lines, if thats what you mean. What man ever has? I never suspected--I never knew--Are you joking? Or have we all gone mad? ...|$|E
60|$|But, as <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> {{anybody to}} believe me; {{the more so}} as I was once an {{absolute}} sceptic myself. As I see it now, I was prejudiced. The mere fact that spiritual seances and {{the services of a}} medium involved the payment of money condemned the whole thing in my eyes. I did not realize, as I do now, that these medii, like anybody else, have got to live; otherwise they would die and become spirits.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I have," [...] said Madeline {{with a sort}} {{of harsh}} sadness in her tone, which seemed to say--"What is it to you if I am sad? <b>I</b> have <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> your sympathy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will <b>never</b> be, however, <b>I</b> {{can assure}} you. Miss Fairfax, I dare say, {{would not have}} me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure <b>I</b> shall <b>never</b> <b>ask</b> her." ...|$|R
