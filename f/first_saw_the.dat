5|$|Producers Graham Broadbent and Peter Czernin <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} for a film in Deborah Moggach's novel {{with the idea of}} exploring the lives of the elderly beyond what one would expect of their age group. With the assistance of screenwriter Ol Parker, they came up with a script in which they take the older characters completely out of their element and involve them in a romantic comedy.|$|E
5|$|At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened {{his room}} and focused the rays of {{sunlight}} coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely. At his location in Much Hoole (the latitude of which he determined to be 53° 35'), he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3:00pm on Sunday the 24th, but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate. On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise, the weather was cloudy, but he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3:15pm, and observed {{for half an hour}} until sunset at 3:53pm.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Mask of the Lunar Eclipse came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Wii hardware. Kikuchi and series co-creator Makoto Shibata {{returned}} as respective producer and director, while Grasshopper Manufacture's Goichi Suda acted as co-director, co-writer and designer. The gameplay concept {{was making the}} player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team to reconsider the standard formula, although {{it proved to be}} a chaotic experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano. When released, it became the best-selling entry in the series to that date, and received mixed to positive from Japanese and Western critics.|$|E

5|$|Alan Pegler, who <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{locomotive}} at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924, in 1961 received £70,000 for {{his share}} holding when Northern Rubber {{was sold to}} Pegler's Valves, a company started by his grandfather. When Flying Scotsman was due to be scrapped, Pegler stepped in and bought it outright, with the political support of Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He spent {{large amounts of money}} {{over the next few years}} having the locomotive restored at Doncaster Works as closely as possible to its LNER condition: the smoke deflectors were removed; the double chimney was replaced by a single chimney; and the tender was replaced by one of the corridor type with which the locomotive had run between 1928 and 1936. It was also repainted in LNER livery.|$|E
5|$|Babbit {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. Babbit says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. Babbit briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E
5|$|Peter Jackson {{was nine}} years old when he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> 1933 film, and was in tears in front of the TV when Kong slipped off the Empire State Building. At age 12, he {{attempted}} to recreate the film using his parents' Super 8 mm film camera and a model of Kong made of wire and rubber with his mother's fur coat for the hair, but eventually gave up on the project. King Kong eventually became his favorite film and was the primary inspiration for his decision to become a filmmaker as a teenager. He read books about the making of King Kong and collected memorabilia, as well as articles from Famous Monsters of Filmland. Jackson paid tribute to the 1933 film by including Skull Island as the origin of the zombie plague in his 1992 film Braindead.|$|E

5|$|Saw 3D had preview {{screenings}} on October 28, 2010, in 2,000 {{locations and}} made $1.7 million. It opened in wide release {{the following day}} in 2,808 locations playing on 3,500 screens, the second smallest release behind the <b>first</b> <b>Saw.</b> <b>The</b> film earned $8,976,000 on its opening day, taking the number one spot from Paranormal Activity 2. It grossed $22,530,123 its opening Halloween weekend, with 92% of tickets coming from more than 2,100 3D-equipped locations and 57% of the audience being {{under the age of}} 25. It had the fifth best opening weekend in the Saw series. After only four days of wide release, Saw 3D had out-grossed Saw VIs $27.7 million final domestic gross. On its second weekend, the film dropped 66% in ticket sales and made $7.7 million, moving to the number five spot with Megamind taking its number one spot. Saw 3D closed on December 2, 2010, after 35 days of release in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{stones and}} pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his {{first day in}} California. He arrived that day in San Francisco {{to serve as a}} new monk in Vina, California, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{planned to}} launch the {{invasion}} on 1 May 1944. The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the Quebec Conference in August 1943. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). General Bernard Montgomery was named as commander of the 21st Army Group, which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion. On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three divisions with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that {{the scale of the}} initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and speed up the capture of Cherbourg. The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June. Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two American, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops all under overall British command.|$|E

5|$|The British public <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} {{production was}} supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured by outside concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E

Having experienced two previous tours of lifeguarding, Trepangs men expected a series of long dull days, spent moving in circles, squares, or triangles to break the monotony.|$|E
25|$|In 1620, at the {{instigation}} of George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham, van Dyck went to England for {{the first}} time where he worked for King James I of England, receiving £100. It was in London {{in the collection of the}} Earl of Arundel that he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> work of Titian, whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the female}} faces {{that can be seen}} in Giger's early work are based on Li's face. Arguably the most famous {{paintings}} depicting Li (and the only ones doing so explicitly) are two eponymous paintings, that is, Li I and Li II both 1974, two of Giger's most well-known and recognizable works. Allegedly, Li was shocked when she <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> painting (Li I) that was supposed to represent her and proceeded to break the frame and tear its fabric. Giger consequently reconstructed the torn painting.|$|E
