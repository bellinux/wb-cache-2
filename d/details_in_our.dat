Every one who lives any semblance of an inner life thinks more nobly and profoundly than he speaks; {{and the best of}} teachers can impart only broken images of the truth which they perceive. Speech which goes from one to another between two natures, and, what is worse, between two experiences, is doubly relative. The speaker buries his meaning; it is for the hearer to dig it up again; and all speech, written or spoken, is in a dead language until it finds a willing and prepared hearer. Such, moreover, is the complexity of life, that when we condescend upon <b>details</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> advice, we may be sure we condescend on error; and the best {{of education is}} to throw out some magnanimous hints. No man was ever so poor that he could express all he has in him by words, looks, or actions; his true knowledge is eternally incommunicable, for it is a knowledge of himself; and his best wisdom comes to him by no process of the mind, but in a supreme self-dictation, which keeps varying from hour to hour in its dictates with the variation of events and circumstances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recently {{coarse-grained}} reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs) {{have drawn}} increasing attention {{due to their}} efficiency and flexibility.

Existing CGRA compilers do not model {{the details of the}} CGRA architecture, due to which they are, i) unable to map applications, even though a mapping exists, and ii) use too many PEs to map an application. In this paper, we model several CGRA <b>details</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> compiler and develop a graph mapping based approach (SPKM) for mapping applications onto CGRAs. On randomly generated graphs our technique can map on average 4. 5 X more applications than the previous approaches, while using fewer CGRA rows 62 % times, without any penalty in mapping time. We observe similar results on a suite of benchmarks collected from Livermore Loops, Multimedia and DSPStone benchmarks. I...|$|E

40|$|University of Technology The {{following}} assertion—for {{the specific}} theory PA {{in the formulation}} of Kleene—is known as Kreisel’s conjecture. If there exists k such that the formal system T proves A(s n (0)) in ≤ k steps for every n, then T proves ∀x A(x). This conjecture is connected with a number of investigations concerning different formal systems T. As an example we name only the well-known result by Parikh [Par 73] which shows that the conjecture holds for a formalization of PA which used ternary predicates to axiomatize +, ·.
