40|$|Opioid-induced glial {{activation}} and its proinflammatory consequences {{have been}} associated with both reduced acute opioid analgesia and the enhanced development of tolerance, hyperalgesia and allodynia following chronic opioid administration. Intriguingly, recent evidence demonstrates that these effects can result independently from the activation of classical, stereoselective opioid receptors. Here, a structurally disparate range of opioids cause activation of signaling by the innate immune receptor toll like receptor 4 (TLR 4), resulting in proinflammatory glial activation. In the present series of studies, we demonstrate that the (+) -isomers of methadone and morphine, which bind with negligible affinity to classical opioid receptors, induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in rat isolated dorsal spinal cord. Chronic intrathecal (+) -methadone produced hyperalgesia and allodynia, which were associated with significantly increased spinal glial activation (TLR 4 mRNA and protein) and the expression of multiple chemokines and cytokines. Statistical analysis suggests that a cluster of cytokines and chemokines may contribute to these nociceptive behavioral changes. Acute intrathecal (+) -methadone and (+) -morphine were also found to induce microglial, interleukin- 1 and TLR 4 /myeloid differentiation factor- 2 (MD- 2) dependent enhancement of pain responsivity. In silico docking analysis demonstrated (+) -naloxone sensitive docking of (+) -methadone and (+) -morphine to human MD- 2. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence of the pro-nociceptive consequences of small molecule xenobiotic activation of spinal TLR 4 signaling independent of classical opioid receptor involvement.

40|$|A better {{understanding}} of the factors influencing tooth eruption is important given the association between altered eruption patterns and crowded or decayed teeth. Hence, the aims of this study were to quantify the extent of asymmetry in tooth eruption and to determine whether eruption asymmetry was significantly influenced by sex, tooth position or timing of emergence. Additionally, directionality of asymmetry and variation between ethnic groups were also explored. Data collection was based on the examination of serial dental casts from a sample of 90 Aborigines (50 male, 40 female) aged 6 to 18 years from the Yuendumu settlement in the Northern Territory of Australia. These casts were obtained at yearly intervals from the 1950 s to the early 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Tooth</b> antimeres on each cast were compared using a 4 -grade eruption score. Relatively high (> 70 %) interand intra-observer concordances confirmed reliability of the recording system.

Grant number 2002 - 33 of the Ohio University Research Council (GSS); De Beers Africa ExplorationPotholes carved into streambeds can be important components of channel incision, {{but they have}} received little quantitative attention. Here empirical evidence is presented from three sites along the Orange River, Republic of South Africa that demonstrates that the pothole dimensions of radius and depth are strongly correlated using a simple power law. Where radius is the dependent variable, the exponent of the power law describes {{the rate of increase}} in radius with increasing depth. Erosion within potholes is complexly related to erosion on the adjacent bed. Erosion efficiencies within small, hemispherical potholes must be high if the potholes are to survive in the face of bed translation (incision). As potholes deepen, however, the necessary efficiencies decline rapidly. Increasing concavity associated with growth imposes stricter constraints; comparatively deep potholes must erode orders of magnitude larger volumes of substrate than shallower potholes in the face of bed retreat. Hemispherical potholes are eventually converted to cylindrical potholes, the geometries of which favor enlargement while they are small. Geometric models constructed using the power law show unambiguously that more substrate is eroded by volume from cylindrical pothole walls during growth than from cylindrical pothole floors. Grinders thus play a secondary role to suspended sediment entrained within the vortices that occur in potholes. Continued growth leads to coalescence with other potholes or destruction through block detachment depending on local geology. The combination of geology and erosion mechanisms may determine whether a strath or inner channel develops {{as a consequence of the}} process. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Progress in Physical Geography, 29 (3), 337 - 361 Lakes and reservoirs act as sinks for both catchment and atmospherically derived particulates and so their sediments can provide valuable information on temporal changes in these inputs. While {{the use of}} lake sediments as environmental archives is well established, reservoir sediments have less frequently been used as temporal records. Yet, for investigating pollution histories, reservoirs are ostensibly of greater interest: they are generally located close to urban and industrial sources of pollution and accumulate sediment rapidly and over similar time periods to major emissions of pollutants. The {{lack of interest in}} reservoir sediments stems from the perception that fluctuating water levels are likely to result in significant sediment disturbance. This perception is sustained, perhaps mistakenly, by a lack of research into reservoir sedimentary systems. There is, therefore, a need to review the available published research on reservoir sedimentation processes and patterns, the relatively few studies that have used reservoir sediments and relevant studies from the lake-sediment literature, and thus critically evaluate the potential and problems of using reservoir sediments as temporal records of pollution. Current understanding of the processes of sedimentation and resulting distributions are reviewed. Some significant differences between sedimentation in lakes and reservoirs are highlighted and the implications for sampling and interpretation of sedimentary records discussed. It is suggested that, at present, a valuable resource is being underutilized and it is demonstrated that, where sediment deposition patterns are taken into account, reservoir sedimentary records can provide important data for reconstructing past atmospheric and catchment pollutant inputs.
