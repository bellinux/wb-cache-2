2500|$|When the {{university}} opened in February 1954, many students wanted a bear symbol {{in keeping with}} the traditional ursine mascots at UC Berkeley and UCLA.

2500|$|Alstat {{lived in}} a JTS {{dormitory}} for forty-three years, serving as a counselor and mentor for generations of rabbinical students. [...] He would share both his knowledge of Jewish subjects, and the practical techniques he had developed over the years for filing {{bits and pieces of}} information that later helped him with his columns, and could help rabbis with their articles and sermons. He was well known <b>for</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> rabbinic students upon their return from student pulpit positions during the Jewish High Holy Days, greeting them with the question, [...] "How was your success?" [...] This question would lead to serious discussions about the difference between success during a short visit and a successful rabbinic career that would span years. When rabbinical students were having a hard time putting together a eulogy for a funeral, he would advise them to ask the relatives, [...] "What kind of a report card do you think this person would have received from God?" [...] In his talks and even in the eulogies he delivered, he would teach that the way to [...] "appraise and evaluate the life achievements of a rabbi" [...] come from the Talmudic verse, where it is taught that we will be asked two questions: the second, whether we engaged in studies that were [...] "Jewishly cultural and creative?"; but the very first, whether we dealt with others faithfully—with integrity. In Alstat's own eulogy, he was called [...] "the friend, confidant and adviser to several generations of rabbinical students.

60|$|Here I also soon {{understood}} {{that he was at}} the last extremity, which made me almost at the last extremity too, to have a true account. One night I had the curiosity to disguise myself like a servant-maid, in a round cap and straw hat, and went to the door, as sent by a lady of his neighbourhood, where he lived before, and giving master and mistress's service, I said I was sent to know how Mr. ---- did, and how he had rested that night. In delivering this message I got the opportunity I desired; <b>for,</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> one of the maids, I held a long gossip's tale with her, and had all the particulars of his illness, which I found was a pleurisy, attended with a cough and a fever. She told me also who was in the house, and how his wife was, who, by her relation, they were in some hopes might recover her understanding; but as to the gentleman himself, in short she told me the doctors said there was very little hopes of him, that in the morning they thought he had been dying, and that he was but little better then, for they did not expect that he could live over the next night.|$|E
60|$|The same prepossessions led him {{to think}} that all the true things had been said, and one could do no better than hunt them up again for new uses. Our {{business}} was, like Old Mortality, to clear out and cut afresh inscriptions {{that had been made}} illegible by time and storm. At least this delivered him from the senseless vanity of originality and personal appropriation. We feel sure that if he found that a thought which he had believed to be new had been expressed in literature before, he would have been pleased and not mortified. No reflection of his own could give him half as much satisfaction as an apt citation from some one else. He once complained of the writer of the article on Comte in the Encyclopædia <b>for</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> too much deference as to Comte's personality. 'That overweening French vanity and egotism not only overshadows great gifts, but impoverishes the character which nourished such a sentiment. It {{is not one of the}} weaknesses which we overlook in great men, and which are to go for nothing.' Of overweening egotism Pattison himself at any rate had none. This was partly due to his theory of history, and partly, too, no doubt, to his inborn discouragement of spirit. He always professed to be greatly relieved when an editor assured him that his work was of the quality that might have been expected from him. 'Having lived to be sixty-three,' he wrote on one of these occasions, 'without finding out why the public embrace or reject what is written for their benefit, I presume I shall now never make the discovery.' And this was perfectly sincere.|$|E

6000|$|From an English {{point of}} view {{there has not been}} the least attempt at grading those hills, and indeed you might as well try to grade the {{hillocks}} of Sind. The cable-cars have for all practical purposes made San Francisco a dead level. They take no count of rise or fall, but slide equably on their appointed courses {{from one end to the}} other of a six-mile street. They turn corners almost at right angles; cross other lines, and, for aught I know, may run up the sides of houses. There is no visible agency of their flight; but once in a while you shall pass a five-storied building, humming with machinery that winds up an everlasting wire-cable, and the initiated will tell you that here is the mechanism. I gave up asking questions. If it pleases Providence to make a car run up and down a slit in the ground for many miles, and if for twopence-halfpenny I can ride in that car, why shall I seek the reasons of the miracle? Rather let me look out of the windows till the shops give place to thousands and thousands of little houses made of wood--each house just big enough for a man and his family. Let me watch the people in the cars, and try to find out in what manner they differ from us, their ancestors. They delude themselves into the belief that they talk English,--the English,--and I have already been pitied <b>for</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>with</b> [...] "an English accent." [...] The man who pitied me spoke, so far as I was concerned, the language of thieves. And they all do. Where we put the accent forward, they throw it back, and vice versa; where we use the long a, they use the short; and words so simple as to be past mistaking, they pronounce somewhere up in the dome of their heads. How do these things happen? Oliver Wendell Holmes says that Yankee schoolmarms, the cider, and the salt codfish of the Eastern States are responsible for what he calls a nasal accent. A Hindu is a Hindu, and a brother to the man who knows his vernacular; and a Frenchman is French because he speaks his own language; but the American has no language. He is dialect, slang, provincialism, accent, and so forth. Now that I have heard their voices, all the beauty of Bret Harte is being ruined for me, because I find myself catching through the roll of his rhythmical prose the cadence of his peculiar fatherland. Get an American lady to read to you [...] "How Santa Claus came to Simpson's Bar," [...] and see how much is, under her tongue, left of the beauty of the original.|$|E
