5|$|Santosh {{is shocked}} knowing that Hasini has {{revealed}} all his mischievous activities and berates her often for being childish. Hasini worries {{and decides to}} leave Santosh’s home even before the one-week time given to her. She apologises to everyone in Santosh’s home and says that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> fit {{for him and his}} family. Santosh is worried seeing this but has no option rather than staying calm as even Subramaniam did not like Hasini.|$|E
25|$|The group {{enters the}} Matrix {{to visit the}} Oracle, a prophet who {{predicted}} {{the emergence of the}} One. She implies that Neo <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> and warns Neo that he will soon have to choose between his life and Morpheus' life. Before they can leave the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo {{and the rest of the}} crew can escape. However, their getaway is hindered by Cypher, a crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Agent Smith in exchange for a comfortable life within the Matrix. Cypher disconnects from the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. He prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity as well, but Tank, a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him.|$|E
25|$|The next day, at the Simpson house, Marge {{tells the}} {{children}} that the new phone books are here, and they have Bart and Lisa's picture on the front cover. Bart and Lisa come down, only {{to realize that the}} picture on one of the phone books <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> of the fire on Mt. Springfield; it is actually a photo of baby Bart and Lisa naked on the toilet, causing them to scream in horror. Marge says that the shot was actually in the film on the camera, and that since she had taken it, she won the prize for them. Bart and Lisa, after accepting that they will be the laughingstock of the entire town, happily hug their mother. Meanwhile, Barney's confidence and his relationship with Homer are restored, and he looks forward to an alcohol-free future, although he is now addicted to double-tall mocha lattes.|$|E

25|$|Bobby {{receives}} and rejects {{an unexpected}} job offer from a firm in Buenos Aires. Soon afterwards Bobby nearly dies after drinking from a poisoned bottle of beer. The local police do not pursue this. Frankie thinks Bobby is targeted for murder. Bobby agrees {{when he sees}} the issue of the local paper with the photograph used to find Pritchard's sister. Bobby sees that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> he found in the dead man's pocket. He and Frankie realise that Bassington-ffrench swapped the photographs and that Mrs Cayman is not related to the dead man at all. Bobby and Frankie search for Bassington-ffrench. They trace him to Merroway Court in Hampshire, owned by Roger's brother and sister-in-law, Henry and Sylvia. They stage a car accident outside the house {{with the help of a}} doctor friend so that Frankie, feigning injury, will be invited to stay to recover. Frankie produces a newspaper cutting about the mysterious dead man; Sylvia remarks that he looks like Alan Carstairs, a traveller and big-game hunter who was a friend of John Savage, a millionaire who had killed himself after learning he had terminal cancer.|$|E
25|$|In the Matrix, the Agents {{interrogate}} Morpheus in {{an attempt}} to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, the rebel humans' last refuge in the real world. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, who believes that he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>One,</b> resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists on accompanying him. They rescue Morpheus, and in so doing, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith thwarts Neo's escape. Now surer of himself, Neo fights Smith as a near equal and defeats him, but Smith's nature as an Agent allows him to survive. Neo flees the converging Agents and locates an exit in the hotel from which Trinity had escaped earlier, but Smith shoots him dead. In the real world, machines known as Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, while Trinity whispers to Neo that the Oracle told her that she would {{fall in love with the}} One, and that Neo cannot be dead because she loves him. She kisses Neo, and he revives, this time with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix in time for the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon to disable the attacking Sentinels.|$|E
500|$|Selman {{was pleased}} with the {{finished}} result of the episode. He noted in the interview with Grub Street that Marge starting to blog about food [...] "does not sound inherently exciting, but the episode itself is actually very exciting, and I'm super thrilled with the way it's turned out." [...] Selman thinks a strong thing about the episode is the fact that, despite Homer's love for food, Homer <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that becomes a foodie as one might expect. He explained that this is because although Homer loves eating, [...] "he's kind of a blue-collar kind of guy who doesn't like foreign food, weird food, savoring food, intellectualizing food, blogging about it, photographing it – he just wants to be stuffed all the time." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{prevailing}} scholarly {{view is that}} Joshua <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{a factual}} account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua is the 13th century BCE, a time of widespread city-destruction, but {{with a few exceptions}} (Hazor, Lachish) <b>the</b> destroyed cities <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>the</b> Bible associates with Joshua, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time.|$|R

500|$|There {{are special}} cases, {{particularly}} {{when dealing with}} copying by third parties. If the person doing the copying <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> doing the research, different rules apply; a publisher cannot use it to justify printing parts of other publishers works, as in Sillitoe v McGraw Hill, {{but in order to}} uphold the exception's justification, the courts do recognise that it can cover a research assistant making photocopies on behalf of a student or researcher. However, as a limitation, Section 29(3)(b) provides that the copying cannot be fair dealing if the person doing it knows that it will result in [...] "copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose". In other words, an academic cannot print off multiple copies of a work for students and then rely on the fair dealings exception.|$|E
500|$|Conceivably, Olga was {{initially}} either {{open to the}} possibility that Anderson was Anastasia or unable to make up her mind. Anderson's biographer and supporter Peter Kurth claimed that Olga wrote to the Danish ambassador, Herluf Zahle, at the end of October 1925: [...] "My feeling is that she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> she believes—but one can't say she is not as a fact". However, within a month she had made up her mind. She wrote to a friend, [...] "There is no resemblance, and she is undoubtedly not A." [...] Olga sent Anderson a scarf and five letters, which were used by Anderson's supporters to claim that Olga recognized Anderson as Anastasia. Olga later said she sent the gift and letters [...] "out of pity", and called the claims [...] "a complete fabrication". When Olga refused to recognize Anderson as Anastasia publicly and published a statement denying any resemblance in a Danish newspaper, Anderson's supporters, Harriet von Rathlef and Gleb Botkin, claimed that Olga was acting on instructions received from her sister Xenia by telegram, which Olga denied in private letters and sworn testimony. She told her official biographer, [...] "I never received any such telegram." [...] The supposed telegram was never produced by Anderson's supporters, and it has never been found among any of the papers relating to the case. Xenia said, ...|$|E

50|$|As the 1930s progressed, Liberty Music Shop in New York City made mini albums {{of songs}} from the Ethel Merman musical comedies Red Hot and Blue and Stars in Your Eyes.

2500|$|Dürckheim did not {{practice}} psychotherapy {{in the traditional}} sense, rather, he tried to teach his clients a process by which they could move towards spiritual self-understanding. He viewed the therapist as a spiritual guide: [...] "A therapy which {{does not take into}} account the spirituality of man is doomed to failure...The therapist <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who heals, that is, who intervenes with his own skills; he is a therapist in the original meaning of the word: a companion on the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|... is a young, {{beautiful}} swordswoman who wields a black katana. She {{has a large}} X-shaped scar on her chest, {{a remnant}} of events years ago in which she and her parents were slashed down by an unknown assailant. Clinging to her life, the trauma of watching her parents brutally murdered {{in front of her}} eyes has left her amnesic. That same night, she is taken in, raised and trained by the swordsman Fuyumine, whom she believed murdered her parents. Because of her amnesia, she was given the name [...] "Naoto" [...] and would train with Fuyumine for years. After Naoto finds that Magato, another pupil [...] "senior" [...] to Naoto, has killed Fuyumine, she learns that Fuyumine <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who killed her parents, and that the real murderer is a [...] "Naoto from below". Realizing her mistake, she would come to acknowledge her mentor as a father figure from then on, and in his honor would take his name into her own, as Naoto Fuyumine, along with inheriting his coat and black katana. She then begins a search for the [...] "original Naoto" [...] to exact revenge for her parents and teacher, which leads to her meeting with Heine, Badou, and Mihai.|$|E
