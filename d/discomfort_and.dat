5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the urban centres, reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Eye <b>discomforts</b> <b>and</b> {{headache}} are {{prevalent among}} computer users. The aim of {{present study was}} to determine eye <b>discomforts</b> <b>and</b> headache associated with computer use among dormitory students of Tehran University of Medical Sciences.. Material and Method: In this cross – sectional study, data were collected using MIRTH (Musculo skeletal Injury Reduction Tools for Health and Safety) questionnaire. The results were Analyzed using SPSS Software and with descriptive statistical indexes as well as correlation test.. Result: of the 744 distributed questionnaires, 631 students completed the questionnaire (84. 4 %). The mean age for the studied population was 22. 72 ± 3. 6 years. The relative frequency of eye discomforts for the female and male student was 76. 38 % and 70. 11 % respectively. The correlation test showed significant relationship between eye discomforts as well as headache with gender, work hours’ with a computer per day and glass use (P-V < 0. 05). Also, the correlation between eye <b>discomforts</b> <b>and</b> headache was statistically significant (P-V < 0. 01).. Conclusion: Eye <b>discomforts</b> <b>and</b> headache relating to the computer uses are prevalent among students. The condition is more prevalent among females and prolonged computer users. Interventional and training programs should be considered to prevent and reduction of related problems...|$|R

5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war they were in a piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and <b>discomfort,</b> <b>and</b> their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E

5|$|Relatively speaking, bites {{from this}} species are not highly dangerous. In Britain {{there have been}} only 14 known {{fatalities}} since 1876—the last a 5-year-old child in 1975—and one near fatal bite of a 39-year-old woman in Essex in 1998. An 82-year-old woman died following a bite in Germany in 2004, although {{it is not clear whether}} her death was due to the effect of the venom. Even so, professional medical help should always be sought as soon as possible after any bite. Very occasionally bites can be life-threatening, particularly in small children, while adults may experience <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> disability long after the bite. The length of recovery varies, but may take up to a year.|$|E

She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on {{in any number of}} hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and <b>discomfort,</b> <b>and</b> promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} aspects of narcosis are the impairment of judgement, multi-tasking and coordination, {{and the loss}} of decision-making ability and focus. Other effects include vertigo and visual or auditory disturbances. The syndrome may cause exhilaration, giddiness, extreme anxiety, depression, or paranoia, depending on the individual diver and the diver's medical or personal history. When more serious, the diver may feel overconfident, disregarding normal safe diving practices. Slowed mental activity, as indicated by increased reaction time and increased errors in cognitive function, are effects which increase the risk of a diver mismanaging an incident. Narcosis reduces both the perception of cold <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> shivering and thereby affects the production of body heat and consequently allows a faster drop in the core temperature in cold water, with reduced awareness of the developing problem.|$|E

5|$|Writing for the Star Tribune, Alexis McKinnis {{recommended}} the device {{for a woman}} having difficulty achieving orgasm. She wrote that for thirty-years a multitude of females had {{found it to be}} an assured way to reach orgasm. McKinnis {{recommended the}} Magic Wand again in a subsequent column as a Valentine's Day gift, and wrote that it faced little competition due to its basic construction, efficiency, intensity, and reliability. Author Robert J. Rubel wrote that the device was among the highest-demanded vibrators in the United States. Rubel stated that approximately ninety-percent of females are able to achieve orgasm with the Magic Wand. A panel of users arranged by Good Housekeeping tried the Magic Wand for relief of lumbar <b>discomfort</b> <b>and</b> were unimpressed with the results. Self Magazine observed in 2010 that the device's appreciation had become a cultural phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of {{respiratory protective equipment}} is unstable and unpredictable. Respirators cannot substitute other measures, that reduce the impact of air pollution on the staff (sealing equipment, ventilation and so on), but only supplement them.
