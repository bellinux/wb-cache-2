5|$|Verbal <b>endings</b> convey {{information}} about grammatical person, number and voice. The imperative mood {{has its own}} set of <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Different <b>endings</b> are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The <b>endings</b> all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all <b>endings</b> but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional <b>endings</b> and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb <b>endings</b> (I have, he has), but Old English had case <b>endings</b> in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|The player assumes {{control of}} the protagonist, a teenage human girl. As the game follows a {{branching}} plot line with multiple <b>endings,</b> at various points during gameplay the player is allowed to make choices that determine which character's romance route the player will encounter. On weekdays, the player can also choose which classes to attend, which changes one of the protagonist's three stats depending on the activity chosen. Having certain stat values are required to obtain the good <b>endings</b> for each love interest and to otherwise advance along certain routes. There are thirteen (fourteen in the 2014 remake) <b>endings</b> in total: one ending {{for each of the}} main love interests, three extended <b>endings</b> for three of the love interests based on stat values, one ending for the gaiden-esque Torimi Café storyline, and one ending attained if the player fails to romance any character.|$|E
5|$|The player's choices {{throughout}} the game {{may result in}} alternate <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve <b>endings,</b> the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve <b>endings</b> found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve <b>endings</b> in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve <b>endings,</b> other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve <b>endings</b> as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the players}} actions and the {{strength}} of Aeron's relationship with Elena, the game has six possible <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eros International {{released}} the DVD of Ra.One on 13 December 2011 across all regions in one-disc and two-disc packs {{complying with the}} NTSC format. The DVD of the film contained alternate <b>endings.</b> Initially, Khan had wanted to add alternate <b>endings</b> to the theatrical release itself, but later deemed it risky. The DVD version was made interactive as well. VCD and Blu-Ray versions of the film were also released.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve <b>endings</b> at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Here {{the plural}} suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, {{but none of}} the case <b>endings</b> on the nouns are present.|$|E
5|$|Marvel {{worked closely}} with Capcom to include {{dialogue}} quips and mid-match events between the companies' characters. Comic book writer Frank Tieri was assigned to write the character dialogue and <b>endings</b> for the game. Marvel also gave Tieri full use of their library of characters for storyline purposes. As a result, several unplayable characters from the Marvel and Capcom universes, such as the Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, Daredevil, MegaMan Volnutt, Nemesis, and Phoenix Wright, make cameo appearances in the campaign stages and Arcade Mode <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neurotoxic {{effect of}} {{mephedrone}} on serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA nerve <b>endings</b> in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic nerve <b>endings</b> at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve <b>endings</b> and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve <b>endings</b> in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|The two {{chemical}} <b>endings</b> {{are combined}} for an ending of anol indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mortal Kombat series' canon, Liu Kang {{won this}} tournament as well, {{defeating}} Shao Kahn and his bodyguard Kintaro. The game's story mode can be also finished using any other playable character, resulting in different non-canonical <b>endings</b> {{for each of}} them.|$|E
5|$|Depression Quest is an {{interactive}} fiction game, which presents descriptions of various situations and prompts the player {{to choose their}} response. In addition, most pages feature a set of still images and atmospheric music. The game has over 40,000 words of text, and multiple possible <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the game's loading points, Isaac {{is shown}} {{curled up in}} a ball, crying. His {{thoughts}} are visible, ranging among rejection from his mother and humiliation from his peers to a scenario involving his own death. The game features 13 possible <b>endings,</b> one after each major boss fight.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve <b>endings,</b> and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer nerve <b>endings</b> than the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|Rhyme {{consists}} of identical ("hard-rhyme") or similar ("soft-rhyme") sounds {{placed at the}} ends of lines or at predictable locations within lines ("internal rhyme"). Languages vary in the richness of their rhyming structures; Italian, for example, has a rich rhyming structure permitting maintenance of a limited set of rhymes throughout a lengthy poem. The richness results from word <b>endings</b> that follow regular forms. English, with its irregular word <b>endings</b> adopted from other languages, is less rich in rhyme. The degree of richness of a language's rhyming structures plays a substantial role in determining what poetic forms are commonly used in that language.|$|E
5|$|The Story Mode, {{reveals the}} game's plot through battles {{interleaved}} with conversations between the player character and its enemies. It {{vary depending on}} the player's choice and performance in the battles; there is a total of 60 possible <b>endings.</b> The Training Mode allows the player to learn attacks by fighting a customizable CPU enemy. Two players can play in the Versus 2P, and on the Versus CPU the player fight against an AI-controlled character. In addition to those modes, there is a gallery with artworks, character <b>endings,</b> and cut scenes that are unlocked by playing Arcade, Mission and Story Mode.|$|E
5|$|The event drew 197,000 {{pay-per-view}} buys, and {{was attended}} live by 11,000 people. Reviews {{for the event}} were generally negative, with reviewers criticizing the <b>endings</b> of the matches, stoppages for blood, and predictable match results. Five wrestlers sustained legitimate injuries {{during the course of}} the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible <b>endings.</b> The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities {{of a small group of}} protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story. Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple <b>endings</b> have become a staple of the series. Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga.|$|E
5|$|A Team D.A.D.D.Y. {{directed}} {{music video}} {{was made to}} accompany the track's release as a single. The video features a spoilt child being showered with Christmas presents while poorer children are shown in tears due to their lack of gifts. Two different <b>endings</b> for the video were produced - in one Santa Claus is shown crucified on a cross while another sees Santa laid {{on the floor with}} an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was planned}} that some key {{scenes of the}} episode would be filmed without an {{audience}} {{in order to avoid}} leaks of plot spoilers, the producers decided not to worry about the issue and filmed it all in front of the live studio audience. The producers also instigated the rumor that multiple <b>endings</b> would be filmed; in fact, only one was planned and shot.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} parts of Quenya grammar, the pronominal system was subject to many {{revisions}} throughout Tolkien's life, and the available corpus was not systematic until a list of <b>endings</b> was published in Vinyar Tengwar No. 49 in 2007. In late Quenya, pronouns have both separate or independent forms, and suffix forms.|$|E
5|$|Fifty Give Yourself Goosebumps {{books were}} {{published}} from 1995 to 2000, starting with Escape from the Carnival of Horrors. The books {{in this series}} were written as gamebooks, featuring multiple <b>endings.</b> The books in this series were ghostwritten by several authors, including Kathryn Lance and Stine's sister-in-law Megan Stine. Many of the cover illustrations for this series were done by Mark Nagata.|$|E
5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Dark Forces II, {{the player}} has {{the option of}} a third-person view, plus an option to switch {{automatically}} to third-person when the lightsaber is the selected weapon. Three types of Force powers are introduced in this game: Light powers provide non violent advantages, Dark powers provide violent ones, while Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities. The game has two <b>endings,</b> {{depending on whether the}} player chooses to focus on the Light Side or the Dark Side.|$|E
5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional <b>endings.</b> Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E
5|$|In Swedish orthography, {{the colon}} {{is used in}} a similar manner as in English, with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as 3:e for tredje ("third") and S:t for Sankt ("Saint"), and for all types of <b>endings</b> that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as a:et ("the a") and CD:n ("the CD"), or the genitive form USA:s ("USA's").|$|E
5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a hyphen that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular <b>endings</b> across the entire pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E
5|$|Kanon is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Kanon follows a branching plot line with multiple <b>endings,</b> and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.|$|E
5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case <b>endings.</b> Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General word order is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} postmodern novels, Fowles uses {{multiple}} different stylistic and structural techniques to highlight his thematic interests in The French Lieutenant's Woman. When discussing these stylistic concerns, many literary critics {{comment on the}} importance of the narrator and the narration, the intertextual references to other literary works, and the multiple <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moon is a {{drama and}} horror visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Ikumi Amasawa. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Moon follows a branching plot line with multiple <b>endings,</b> and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by nerve <b>endings</b> to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the nerve <b>endings</b> would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
