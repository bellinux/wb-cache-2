Since the continental shelf is usually less than 200 metres deep, it follows that pelagic coastal fish are generally epipelagic fish, <b>inhabiting</b> <b>the</b> sunlit epipelagic zone. Coastal fish can be contrasted with oceanic fish or offshore fish, which <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> deep seas beyond the continental shelves.|$|R
