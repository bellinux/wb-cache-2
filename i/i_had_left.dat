5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War <b>I)</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. Writing on the Wall, her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E

The Duke had assumed that he would settle in Britain after a year or two of exile in France. King George VI (with the support of Queen Mary and his wife Queen Elizabeth) threatened to cut off Edward's allowance if he returned to Britain without an invitation. Edward became embittered against his mother, Queen Mary, writing to her in 1939: [...] " [...] destroy the last vestige of feeling <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> for you... made further normal correspondence between us impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|Matthews' autobiography, The Way It Was, was {{released}} by Headline in 2000. The book is dedicated to his wife Mila, who died the year before its publication. Matthews, then 84, collaborated with Les Scott, his friend of 10 years, {{in the writing of}} the book over an 18-month period on an almost daily basis. [...] "Stan, as he had been all his life, was an early riser," [...] wrote Scott in the epilogue. [...] "Our collaborations were over by eleven in the morning and, without fail, took place in his den. He loved working on his book and, after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> him, he would give the morning's session more applied thought — more often than not ringing me at home to provide additional thoughts or anecdotes." ...|$|E

I knew that all of me that had been seen on earth was reducing there to its ultimates — I was distilled there by degrees.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the number of women in cabinet, Fletcher was left out of cabinet in the July 15, 2013 Cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Fletcher stated on Twitter [...] "I am Conservative. I am a traditionalist. I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> Cabinet in the traditional way--- with a sex scandal." [...] Although not officially in Cabinet, he continued to sit on the treasury board cabinet committee. Fletcher was defeated in the federal election of 2015, but was elected six months later to the riding of Assiniboia in Manitoba's 2016 provincial election.|$|E

Muhammad had left ‘Ali {{to look after}} his family, but the hypocrites of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found ‘Ali a burden and was relieved {{to be rid of}} his presence. ‘Ali, grieved at hearing this wicked taunt, told Muhammad what the local people were saying. In reply, the Prophet said: [...] "They lie, I bade thee remain for the sake of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> behind me. So return and represent me in my family and in thine. Art thou not content, O ‘Ali, that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses, save that after me there is no prophet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1992, {{two months}} prior to the {{production}} of season 1 of Rocko's Modern Life, Murray's first wife committed suicide. Murray had often blamed his wife's suicide on the show being picked up. He said [...] "It was always an awful connection because I look at Rocko as such a positive in my life." [...] Murray felt that he had emotional and physical [...] "unresolved issues" [...] when he moved to Los Angeles. He describes the experience as like participating in [...] "marathon with my pants around my ankles". Murray initially believed that he would create one season, move back to the San Francisco Bay Area, and [...] "clean up the loose ends <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> hanging". Murray said that he felt surprised when Nickelodeon approved new seasons; Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in December 1993.|$|E

War, the country disintegrated, I lost the job that I worked for so many years, the only thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> was raising my children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go there every day to get the paper and read it cover to cover. I was well informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E

2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station {{in front of me and}} could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} in March 1993 as a 12" [...] vinyl single on Bong Load, with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that [...] "Loser" [...] was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. [...] "Loser" [...] unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU {{was the first}} to play it, followed by modern rock station KROQ-FM. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. By the time stations in New York were requesting copies of [...] "Loser", Bong Load had already run out. Beck was soon beset with offers to sign with major labels. Convinced that the song was a potential hit, Rothrock gave a vinyl pressing of the single to his friend Tony Berg, who had been working in the A department for Geffen Records. Berg said, [...] "I just lost my mind when I heard it. He left my office, and I swear, {{by the time he got}} home, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>left</b> a message asking him to introduce me to [...] ". Beck, in spite of his hesitance to be on any major label, signed with Geffen subsidiary DGC. He explained, [...] "I wasn't going to do anything for a long time, but Bong Load didn't have the means to make as many copies as people wanted. Geffen were involved and they wanted to make it to more of an organized place, one with a bigger budget and better distribution." ...|$|E
