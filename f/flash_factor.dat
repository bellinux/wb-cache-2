40|$|Section 14. 3 of the AP- 42 {{addresses}} {{nitrous oxide}} (N 2 O) emissions from lightning flashes. Since the troposphere consists of approximately 78 % N 2 and 21 % O 2, {{a significant amount}} of nitrogen oxides can be produced {{as a result of the}} heating and/or shock wave from a lightning channel. 1 However, the production of N 2 O by lightning is relatively small compared to other biological and anthropogenic sources. One method of determining the production of N 2 O from lightning is to multiply the amount of N 2 O produced per lightning flash by the number of <b>flashes.</b> The following <b>factors</b> are considered in the N 2 O emission factor: C Number of molecules of N 2 O produced per lightning stroke; C Total flash energy in relation to the first return stroke; and C Number of lightning strokes in a lightning <b>flash.</b> Together, these <b>factors</b> can be combined to create an emission factor that can be applied to a...|$|R
40|$|For equal {{flows of}} hot water wells, the {{electric}} power which can be generated increases with feed water temperature. However, high temperature wells discharge greater flows than that of lower temperature wells of similar permeability, with the result of enhanced power potential. In fact, where fluids are exploited utilizing two-stage <b>flash,</b> these <b>factors</b> combine to give a power potential which {{is proportional to the}} cube of the feed water temperature in degrees celsius. Hence a feed of 315 C would generate twice the power of that of water at 250 C for wells of good permeability and where the reservoir exists under conditions of boiling point with depth. Higher temperature water (exceeding 300 C) has, however, a commensurate higher tendency to mineral deposition in reinjection water lines and this disposes design to single-stage flash with slightly reduced power, compared with the two-stage alternative...|$|R

Several <b>factors</b> that are relied upon conventionally do not occur in mobile telephones. This paper presents an approach for recovering deleted files in general and video files in particular from NAND flash data files: starting with rebuilding the FAT partition, through recovering files from lost cluster chains and culminating in a methodology for enhanced extraction of deleted and corrupted video files by using the MPEG- 4 meta data.

Further, many peri- and post-menopausal women report sleep concerns, depression, and hot <b>flashes,</b> and these <b>factors</b> may contribute to cognitive decline.

Mind–body medicine {{has been shown to}} have beneficial effects on sleep, mood, and hot flashes, among post-menopausal women. Further, mind–body medicine holds potential in addressing symptoms of cognitive decline post-menopause. This study proposes an initial framework for how mind–body interventions may improve cognitive performance and inform future research seeking to identify the common and specific factors associated with mind–body medicine for addressing memory decline in peri- and post-menopausal women.

40|$|A {{study of}} the thermal {{conductivity}} of a commercial PWR fuel with an average pellet burn-up of 102 MWd/kgHM is described. The thermal conductivity data reported were derived from the thermal diffusivity measured by the laser <b>flash</b> method. The <b>factors</b> determining the fuel thermal conductivity at high burn-up were elucidated by investigating the recovery that occurred during thermal annealing. It {{was found that the}} thermal conductivity in the outer region of the fuel was much higher {{than it would have been}} if the high burn-up structure were not present. The increase in thermal conductivity is a consequence of the removal of fission products and radiation defects from the fuel lattice during recrystallisation of the fuel grains (an integral part of the formation process of the high burn-up structure). The gas porosity in the high burn-up structure lowered the increase in thermal conductivity caused by recrystallisation. JRC. E. 2 -Hot cell...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} here investigated two methods of improving productivity in microalgal photobioreactors: applying temperature cycles intended to maximize photosynthesis and minimize respiration, {{and development of}} a mathematical model that predicts improvements in photon utilization using temporal light dilution (flashing). The experiments conducted on diurnal temperature cycles with Dunaliella tertiolecta in 30 -L outdoor photobioreactors showed that a properly chosen temperature cycle can improve mass and energy productivity by 18 % over an identical photobioreactor with a constant temperature. However, excessively large temperature cycle amplitudes reduced productivity. A 4 - 7 % increase in energy content was observed in microalgae exposed to temperature cycles. The physiological reason for this could not be established. A relationship similar to the Bush Equation was obtained that related photon utilization efficiency to <b>flashing</b> frequency, load <b>factor,</b> Photosystem II (PSII) concentration and reaction frequency, and chlorophyll content.

40|$|Hot flashes {{have been}} {{postulated}} {{to be linked}} to systemic inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between hot <b>flashes,</b> pro-inflammatory <b>factors,</b> and leukocytes in healthy, non-obese postmenopausal women. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 202 women aged 45 - 60 years were stratified into one of four groups according to their hot-flash status: never experienced hot flashes (Group N), mild hot flashes (Group m), moderate hot flashes (Group M), and severe hot flashes (Group S). Variables measured in this study included clinical parameters, hot flash experience, leukocytes, and fasting plasma levels of nine circulating cytokines/chemokines measured by using multiplex assays. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the associations of hot flashes with these pro-inflammatory factors. The study was performed in a hospital medical center. The mean values of leukocyte number were not different between these four groups. The hot flash status had a positive tendency toward increased levels of circulating IL- 6 (P-trend = 0. 049), IL- 8 (P-trend < 0. 001), TNF-α (P-trend = 0. 008), and MIP 1 β (P-trend = 0. 04). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that hot-flash severity was significantly associated with IL- 8 (P-trend < 0. 001) and TNFα (P-trend = 0. 007) among these nine cytokines/chemokines after adjustment for age, menopausal duration, BMI and FSH. Multivariate analysis further revealed that severe hot flashes were strongly associated with a higher IL- 8 (% difference, 37. 19 %; 95 % confidence interval, 14. 98, 63. 69; P < 0. 001) and TNFα (51. 27 %; 6. 64, 114. 57; P < 0. 05). The present study provides evidence that hot flashes are associated with circulating IL- 8 and TNF-α in healthy postmenopausal women. It suggests that hot flashes might be related to low-grade systemic inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Lightning in {{the solar}} nebula is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} probable sources for producing the chondrules that are found in meteorites. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide a large flux of gamma-rays that Compton scatter and create a charge separation in the gas because the electrons are displaced from the positive ions. The electric field easily exceeds the breakdown value of ~ 1 V m^- 1 over distances of order 0. 1 AU. The energy in a giant lightning discharge exceeds a terrestrial lightning <b>flash</b> by a <b>factor</b> of ~ 10 ^ 12. The predicted post-burst emission of gamma-rays from accretion into the newly formed black hole or spin-down of the magnetar is sufficiently intense to cause a lightning storm in the nebula that lasts for days and is more probable than the GRB because the radiation is beamed into a larger solid angle. The giant outbursts from nearby soft gamma-ray repeater sources (SGRs) are also capable of causing giant lightning discharges. The total amount of chondrules produced is in reasonable agreement with the observations of meteorites. Furthermore in the case of GRBs most chondrules were produced in a few major melting events by nearby GRBs and lightning occurred at effectively the same time over the whole nebula, and provide accurate time markers to the formation of chondrules and evolution of the solar nebula. This model provides a reasonable explanation for the delay between the formation of calcium aluminium inclusions (CAIs) and chondrules...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of NOx by lightning over the contiguous United States has been evaluated by using combined ground-based and satellite lightning measurements. The lightning {{data from the}} National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) over the period of 1995 - 1999, along with a ratio of intracloud (IC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes derived in conjunction with satellite lightning measurements from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD), are analyzed to obtain the number of CG and IC flashes. The average annual lightning counts over the 5 -year period are about 23 million for CG flashes and 55 million for IC flashes. The resulting lightning distributions are employed to calculate the {{production of}} NOx assuming a NO production rate of 6. 7 x 10 (26) molecules for each CG flash and 6. 7 x 10 (21) molecules for each IC flash. NOx production by lightning varies seasonally {{in accordance with the}} lightning distribution, with the maximum production occurring in the summer (June, July, and August) and in the Southeast. CG flashes produce more NOx than IC flashes despite fewer CG <b>flashes</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 2 or more. The geographical and seasonal production of NOx by lightning is compared to NOx emissions from other sources (i. e., from anthropogenic, soil, and biomass-burning emissions). The results indicate that regional emissions of NOx by lightning can be significant in the summertime and may {{play a critical role in}} ozone formation in the free troposphere. Our estimate of NOx emission by lightning over the United States would decrease by an order of magnitude if we use the production rates from a recent laboratory study [Wang et al., 1998] that are significantly lower than previous estimates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of the lightning-induced nitrogen oxides (LNO x) source is important for understanding and predicting the nitrogen oxides and ozone distributions in the troposphere and their trends, the oxidising capacity of the atmosphere, and the lifetime of trace gases destroyed by reactions with OH. This knowledge is further required {{for the assessment of}} other important NO x sources, in particular from aviation emissions, the stratosphere, and from surface sources, and for understanding the possible feedback between climate changes and lightning. This paper reviews more than 3 decades of research. The review includes laboratory studies as well as surface, airborne and satellite-based observations of lightning and of NO x and related species in the atmosphere. Relevant data available from measurements in regions with strong LNO x influence are identified, including recent observations at midlatitudes and over tropical continents where most lightning occurs. Various methods to model LNO x at cloud scales or globally are described. Previous estimates are re-evaluated using the global annual mean flash frequency of 44 ± 5 s ? 1 reported from OTD satellite data. From the review, mainly of airborne measurements near thunderstorms and cloud-resolving models, we conclude that a "typical" thunderstorm flash produces 15 (2 ? 40) × 10 25 NO molecules per flash, equivalent to 250 mol NO x or 3. 5 kg of N mass per <b>flash</b> with uncertainty <b>factor</b> from 0. 13 to 2. 7. Mainly as a result of global model studies for various LNO x parameterisations tested with related observations, the best estimate of the annual global LNO x nitrogen mass source and its uncertainty range is (5 ± 3) Tg a ? 1 in this study. In spite of a smaller global flash rate, the best estimate is essentially the same as in some earlier reviews, implying larger flash-specific NO x emissions. The paper estimates the LNO x accuracy required for various applications and lays out strategies for improving estimates in the future. An accuracy of about 1 Tg a ? 1 or 20 %, as necessary in particular for understanding tropical tropospheric chemistry, is still a challenging goal...|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{retinitis}} is {{the most}} common and most devastating ocular opportunistic infection among patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The lifetime cumulative incidence of this infection in patients with AIDS ranges from 25 % to 40 %. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in 1996, the incidence of CMV retinitis is declining in industrialized nations. However, at least 20 % of patients do not respond to HAART. Furthermore, it is possible that more resistance to HAART may develop in the not too distant future, with an explosive increase in the incidence of CMV retinitis. In developing and mixed-economy countries, the incidence is actually increasing. No other ocular opportunistic infection among patients with AIDS has a lifetime cumulative incidence over 1 [...] 2 %. Without treatment, blindness occurs in 100 % of patients within 6 months. When treatment is undertaken; it is expensive, not always effective and exhausting for the patient. Among the clinical risk <b>factors,</b> <b>flashing</b> lights and floaters (OR 11. 42, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 43 [...] 38. 01), retinal microinfarction (cotton-wool spots) (OR 2. 90, 95 % CI 1. 01 [...] 8. 29), number of previous opportunistic infections (OR I. 81, 95 % CI 1. 24 [...] 2. 64), nonocular CMV infections (OR 82. 99, 95 % CI 6. 86 [...] 1004. 58) and homosexual acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus (OR 2. 83, 95 % CI 1. 13 [...] 7. 12) were significant predictors of CMV retinitis. From the laboratory model, a high CMV viral load {{was a significant predictor of}} CMV retinitis (OR 33. 03, 95 % CI 2. 32 [...] 469. 39), as was a low hemoglobin concentration (OR 0. 96, 95 % CI 0. 94 [...] 0. 98). Among the HLA types, HLA-Bw 4 (OR 11. 68, 95 % CI 1. 29 [...] 105. 82) and HLA-DRBI 15 (OR 9. 34, 95 % CI 1. 14 [...] 76. 41) were significant predictors of CMV retinitis, whereas HLA-Cw 7 was protective against CMV retinitis (OR 0. 09, 95 % CI 0. 01 [...] 0. 67). From the iatrogenic model, steroid use was predictive of CMV retinitis (OR 6. 41, 95 % CI 2. 35 [...] 17. 51). Based on this study, the use of steroids systemically elevated the risk of CMV retinitis. Other clinical and laboratory variables were found to elevate the risk of (or protect against) this disease. These findings may be useful to clinicians and health policy experts in developing rational guidelines for screening, examination frequency and targeted prophylaxis for patients with AIDS...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Identificar os fatores associados à intensidade das ondas de calor em mulheres climatéricas em Campinas, São Paulo. MÉTODOS: Análise secundária de banco de dados de estudo descritivo de coorte transversal, de base populacional. Foram selecionadas 334 mulheres com ondas de calor, por amostragem, entre 45 - 60 anos. Os dados foram coletados por meio de entrevistas domiciliares, com questionários estruturados e pré-testados, fornecidos pela Fundação Internacional de Saúde/Sociedade Internacional de Menopausa, Sociedade Norte-Americana de Menopausa, e adaptados pelos autores, e a intensidade das ondas de calor mensurada por meio do índice circulatório. Avaliou-se a idade, uso de métodos anticoncepcionais, terapia hormonal, laqueadura tubária, índice de massa corpórea, estado menopausal, tempo de menopausa, antecedente de histerectomia, ooforectomia {{bilateral}} e tabagismo. Calculou-se a mediana e as freqüências absolutas e relativas, de acordo com o tipo de variável. A medida de associação foi a razão de prevalência (RP). Realizou-se análise bivariada e de regressão múltipla para identificação dos fatores associados à intensidade das ondas de calor, com intervalo de confiança de 95 % (IC 95 %). RESULTADOS: Mulheres com tempo de menopausa superior a 61 meses (RP: 0, 59; IC 95 %: 0, 39 - 0, 88) apresentaram chance significativamente menor de referir ondas de calor intensas enquanto o antecedente de ooforectomia bilateral (RP: 1, 95; IC 95 %: 1, 08 - 3, 50) associou-se significativamente à intensidade das ondas de calor. CONCLUSÃO: Os fatores associados às ondas de calor de maior intensidade, tempo de menopausa e ooforectomia bilateral sugerem o hipoestrogenismo como causa comum para as ondas de calor intensas. Mulheres com esses fatores devem receber atenção especializada, minimizando as repercussões negativas das ondas de calor. OBJECTIVE: To identify {{factors associated}} with the intensity of hot flashes in 334 climacteric women living in Campinas, São Paulo, Brasil. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a data bank of a descriptive cross-sectional population-based study. Selection of 334 women reporting hot flashes aged 45 - 60 years was carried out through cluster sampling. Data were collected by home interviews using a structured, pre-tested questionnaire provided by the International Health Foundation/International Menopause Society and by the North American Menopause Society and adapted by the authors. Intensity of hot flashes was measured using the circulatory index. The variables analyzed were age, use of contraceptive methods and hormonal therapy, tubal ligation, body mass index, menopausal status, time since menopause, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy and smoking. Statistical analysis was performed by using the median, absolute and relative frequencies according {{to the type of}} variable. The prevalence ratio (PR) was used to measure association. Bivariate analysis and multiple logistic regression with a 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) were used to identify the {{factors associated with}} the intensity of hot flashes. RESULTS: Women with time since menopause of over 61 months (PR: 0. 59; IC 95 %: 0. 39 - 0. 88) had a significantly lower chance of presenting intense hot flashes while the antecedent of bilateral oophorectomy (PR: 1. 95; IC 95 %: 1. 08 - 3. 50) was significantly associated with the intensity of hot <b>flashes.</b> CONCLUSION: Both <b>factors,</b> time since menopause and bilateral oophorectomy, suggest hypoestrogenism as a common cause of more intense hot flashes.
