25|$|The Toledo {{administration}} was unusually active in foreign policy. Its major goals were promoting democracy outside Peru, addressing {{the struggle against}} poverty, encouraging economic development in the borderlands, reducing arms spending in the region, strengthening relations with Asia-Pacific countries, and integrating with the Andean Community of Nations. Peru also became an associate member of MERCOSUR, a free trade zone that would be established gradually. The objective was for signing nations to gradually build up an infrastructure that would ease trade with one another, to cooperate in the improvement of energy efficiency, and to commit to <b>future</b> <b>agreements</b> that would increase cross border investment by eliminating double taxation.|$|E

40|$|Ranking {{infinite}} utility streams {{includes many}} impossibility results, most involving certain Pareto, anonymity, or continuity requirements. We introduce {{the concept of}} the <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> extension, a method that explicitly extends orderings on finite time horizon to an infinite time horizon. The <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> extension of given orderings is quasi-transitive, complete, and pairwisely continuous. Furthermore, it is a subrelation of any other pairwisely continuous extension of the orderings. In case of anonymous and strongly Paretian orderings, their <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> extension is variable step anonymous and strongly Paretian. Characterizations of the <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> extensions of the utilitarian and leximin orderings are obtained as applications. <b>Future</b> <b>agreement</b> extension, Variable step anonymity, Intergenerational equity, Infinite generations, Diamond's impossibility theorem...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore and explain in detail the {{problems}} of the <b>Agreement</b> on the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> according to its basics in the Czech Commercial Code. The thesis is based on the valid legal regulations of the <b>Agreement</b> on the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> and explains the essential issues concerning its interpretation and application. The thesis is following the characteristics of the legal indicia of the <b>Agreement</b> on the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> together with its content, parties to the Agreement and its template. Other explored issues are rights and duties of the parties to the Agreement as well as variability of the contracting requirements. The thesis also deals with the fundamentals and purposes of the process between the <b>Agreement</b> on the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> and the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> and enables us to understand similar legal institutes. Regarding the recent dual legal regulation provided by the Czech Commercial Code as well as the Czech Civil Code, the aim of the thesis is to compare similarities and differences of these two types of regulation and to indicate advantages and disadvantages of the application of each one during the different stages of the contracting process. The thesis is concerned with the compulsory requirements of the <b>Agreement</b> on the <b>Future</b> <b>Agreement</b> according to the peremptory rules of [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Following a {{decision}} by European Union (EU) foreign ministers in December 2012 stating that [...] "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967," [...] the European Commission issued guidelines for the 2014 to 2020 financial framework covering all areas of co-operation between the EU and Israel, including economics, science, culture, sports and academia but excluding trade on 30 June 2013. According to the directive all <b>future</b> <b>agreements</b> between the EU and Israel must explicitly exclude Jewish settlements and Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line – including the Golan Heights, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships will only be granted if a settlement exclusion clause is included, forcing the Israeli government to concede in writing that settlements {{in the occupied territories}} are outside the state of Israel to secure agreements with the EU.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunflower protesters {{perceived}} the trade {{pact with the}} People's Republic of China (China; PRC) would hurt Taiwan's economy and leave it vulnerable to political pressure from Beijing, while advocates of the treaty argued that increased Chinese investment would provide a necessary boost to Taiwan’s economy, that the still-unspecified details of the treaty’s implementation could be worked out favorably for Taiwan, and that to “pull out” of the treaty by not ratifying it would damage Taiwan’s international credibility. The protesters initially demanded the clause-by-clause review of the agreement be reinstated, later changing their demands toward {{the rejection of the}} trade pact, the passing of legislation allowing close monitoring of <b>future</b> <b>agreements</b> with China, and citizen conferences discussing constitutional amendment. While the Kuomintang was open to a line-by-line review at a second reading of the agreement, the party rejected the possibility that the pact be returned for a committee review. The KMT backed down later, saying that a joint review committee could be formed if the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) did not boycott the proceedings. This offer was rejected by the DPP. The party asked for a review committee on all accords with China, citing [...] "mainstream public opinion." [...] In turn, the DPP proposal was turned down by the KMT.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{test the}} impact of several self-regulatory {{strategies}} on an integrative bargaining task. Design/methodology/approach – Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} dyads and negotiated over the sale of a car. Before negotiating, participants were prompted to engage in one of three self-regulation strategies, based upon fantasy realization theory (FRT) : to mentally contrast a successful <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> with the reality of bargaining, to exclusively elaborate on successful <b>future</b> <b>agreement,</b> or to exclusively elaborate on the reality of bargaining. Those in the control condition merely began the negotiation. Findings – Mentally contrasting a successful <b>future</b> <b>agreement</b> with the reality of bargaining leads dyads to reach the largest and most equitable joint agreements, compared to dyads that elaborate only on successful <b>future</b> <b>agreement,</b> or on the reality of bargaining. Research limitations/implications – Since it was found that mental contrasting promotes integrative agreement, it is important {{to learn more about the}} psychological processes that mediate and moderate this effect. Another related line of research would examine the application of the findings to other bargaining scenarios. One further future line of research should combine mental contrasting with planning strategies. Originality/value – The findings of the paper have implications for both self-regulation and negotiation research. The result that mental contrasting fosters integrative solutions reflects its potential to help negotiators effectively discriminate among feasible and unfeasible components of a multi-faceted goal (integrative agreement). For negotiation research, the paper identifies an effective self-regulatory strategy for producing high-quality agreements...|$|R

2500|$|In 2013 the EU {{adopted a}} binding {{directive}} {{according to which}} the Israeli government {{will be required to}} state in any <b>future</b> <b>agreements</b> with the EU that settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem are outside the state of Israel. The directive partially implements an earlier EU foreign ministers' declaration [...] that [...] "all agreements between the state of Israel and the EU must unequivocally and explicitly indicate their inapplicability to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967". The guidelines prohibit the issuing of EU grants, funding, prizes or scholarships to Israeli entities unless a settlement exclusion clause is included. Israeli institutions and bodies situated across the pre-1967 Green Line will be automatically ineligible. The EU directive is similar to the one signed between the United States and Israel in 1972 whereby Israel undertook, in exchange for science funding, to restrict the projects within the 1967 borders. The guidelines do not restrict grants issued by individual EU member states. In advance of the publication of the Guidelines, there was, in Israel, a political and media storm. News Media have suggested Israel will take some action against the EU. Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, has said: [...] "The EU is concerned by reports in the Israeli media that the Israeli Minister of Defense has announced a number of restrictions affecting EU activities supporting the Palestinian people. We have not received any official communication from the Israeli authorities. Our delegations on the spot are seeking urgent clarifications".|$|E
