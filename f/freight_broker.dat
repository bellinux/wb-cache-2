50|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> {{called for an}} increase in financial integrity and liability of these companies, which has led to the passing of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). In order to obtain a license to <b>broker</b> <b>freight,</b> a freight brokerage must purchase a surety bond or trust agreement with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Prior to June 2012 when the bill was signed by President Obama, the surety bond coverage required to hold a broker license was $10,000. Effective October 1, 2013, the surety bond requirement increased to $75,000. On December 12, 2015 the FMCSA brought into effect, the United Registration System. Existing <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> with a USDOT, MC, or FF number can continue to do business until April 14, 2017 before they must switch to the new electronic online URS system.|$|R

50|$|Often, an LTL shipper may realize savings by {{utilizing}} a <b>freight</b> <b>broker,</b> online marketplace or other intermediary, instead of contracting directly with a trucking company. Brokers can shop {{the marketplace and}} obtain lower rates than most smaller shippers can obtain directly. In the LTL marketplace, intermediaries typically receive 50% to 80% discounts from published rates, where a small shipper may only be offered a 5% to 30% discount by the carrier. Intermediaries are licensed by the DOT and have requirements to provide proof of insurance.|$|E

40|$|Most {{brokerage}} {{problems are}} traceable to the troubled history of <b>freight</b> <b>brokers,</b> {{which has been}} a constant struggle between regulation and deregulation. Arguably, brokers have been subjected to more extremist regulation than any other industry during the last fifty years. The pattern of extremism began when Congress imposed massive regulations on <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> as part of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. The 1935 regulations completely stifled the U. S. brokerage industry. Forty-five years later, Congress moved to the other regulatory extreme when it passed the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, 6 which virtually deregulated the brokerage industry The eased entry controls of the 1980 Act have led to considerable broker abuse. 8 Since deregulation, the industry has been inundated with undercapitalized, fly-by-night brokers who are preying on unsuspecting carriers and shippers. 9 While the strict entry controls of the 1935 Act stifled the brokerage industry 2 ̆ 7 s development, the eased entry controls of the 1980 Act resulted in higher prices, financial instability, protracted litigation 12 ̆ 7 and an increase in bankruptcies. 2 ̆ 21 Due to this regulatorypandemonium, brokers present an exemplary microcosm of the intrinsic struggle between the forces of regulation and deregulation...|$|R
50|$|Shipping experts {{optimize}} {{their service}} and costs by sampling rates from several carriers, brokers and online marketplaces. When obtaining rates from different providers, shippers {{may find a}} wide range in the pricing offered. If a shipper in the United States uses a <b>broker,</b> <b>freight</b> forwarder or other transportation intermediary, {{it is common for}} the shipper to receive a copy of the carrier's Federal Operating Authority. <b>Freight</b> <b>brokers</b> and intermediaries are also required by Federal Law to be licensed by the Federal Highway Administration. Experienced shippers avoid unlicensed brokers and forwarders because if brokers are working outside the law by not having a Federal Operating License, the shipper has no protection {{in the event of a}} problem. Also, shippers normally ask for a copy of the broker's insurance certificate and any specific insurance that applies to the shipment.|$|R
50|$|Consolidators, customs <b>brokers,</b> <b>freight</b> forwarders, and NVOCC’s can be {{a factor}} in {{determining}} freight rate because of their experience, business relationships, and the volume at which they operate. These factors help keep the freight rate down for small businesses and the individual with a shipping need. In the commercial trucking industry, many shippers tender loads to <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> {{whose job it is to}} find qualified carriers to move the freight at an acceptable price for all parties. Brokers have access to a suite of technological tools to help determine the most cost-effective way to move cargo, including access to load boards. The best load boards provide rate analysis tools based on actual transactions on every lane in North America, since their databases hold a wealth of pricing information. For example, DAT Solutions offers RateView for carriers, brokers and shippers, providing access to shippers’ contract rates and spot market (broker buy) rates. This allows brokers to analyze market demand and capacity to assure competitive pricing.|$|R
50|$|Other {{logistics}} companies include 3rd-Party Logistics Providers. They offer {{a variety}} of supply chain and distribution-related practices and techniques in order to improve in-house logistics. The main difference between a traditional <b>freight</b> <b>broker</b> and most 3rd-Party Logistics Providers is that freight brokers do not actually touch (fingerprint) the freight, whereas 3rd-Party Logistics providers often do. This can happen, for example, when the 3rd-Party Logistics company handles outsourced manufacturing and/or warehousing. Such companies include the likes of Access America Transport, BAX Global, Murphy Warehouse Company, Schenker Logistics, United Parcel Service Logistics Division.|$|E

50|$|In 1958, Monroe 'Moe' Jubitz, opened Fleet Leasing, Inc., {{a full-service}} truck leasing and {{maintenance}} company in Portland, Oregon. Moe expanded to provide fuel, food, and accommodations to truckers on the road, {{the origin of}} Jubitz Truck Stop. The trucking industry was deregulated in the 1970s, encouraging independent truck drivers and small companies to find extra loads rather than returning empty. Mr. Jubitz noticed drivers hanging around his truck stop after the usual meal and shower, {{hoping to find a}} load. So he decided to start signing up brokers and shippers who needed freight hauled from Portland. Before the service, truck drivers seeking loads left handwritten notes on a bulletin board at the Jubitz Truck Stop in Portland, Oregon, U.S. for shippers and <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> seeking truckers to move their freight. Jubitz began posting the loads on a monitor at the truck stop and charging drivers a fee for the phone number of the company wanting to move freight.|$|R

50|$|In Schramm, the Courts {{opened the}} door for freight brokers to be held legally liable {{in the case of a}} {{trucking}} accident, involving a carrier whom they hired to carry freight, that resulted in injury to a person. Many guidelines, most under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's SAFER System, are available to freight brokers to screen potential carrier safety and, if it is proven that the broker did not utilize these government provided tools, liability can be transferred to or shared with them in the result of an injury accident. Another regulation that protects carriers and shippers is the <b>freight</b> <b>broker</b> bond - freight brokers must get bonded in order to operate legally. If a carrier file a claim, the bond would cover it.|$|E

40|$|A <b>freight</b> <b>broker</b> is an {{intermediary}} acting between {{a provider of}} a transport service and a shipper who has goods that they want transported. With the increase of shippers outsourcing the logistics components of their businesses, third party logistics (3 PL) service providers have become evident, and the <b>freight</b> <b>broker</b> is a third party logistics provider. Since deregulation of road transport in New Zealand, shippers' expectations of transport has changed. Freight brokers worldwide now use {{the internet as a}} tool to bring carriers and shippers together. This benefits the carrier by adding visibility to freight that can help to reduce empty mileage and the shipper by reducing transportation costs and resource requirements. A questionnaire was distributed to 90 randomly selected carriers throughout New Zealand. This research reveals that the benefits for the carrier and shipper when working with a <b>freight</b> <b>broker</b> are fundamentally the same as identified in the literature, but highlights disadvantages for both the carrier and the shipper that are not listed in the literature. The low opinion that carriers hold of freight brokers was evident in the results from the questionnaires. This research makes several significant contributions to the literature. Firstly, it identifies {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} freight brokerage for the carrier and the shipper from the carriers' perspective in New Zealand. Secondly, it provides freight brokers with some ideas, again from the perspective of the carrier, that could make freight brokerage operate more efficiently and in many cases, gain respect from the carriers. Lastly, this research identifies areas concerning freight brokerage in New Zealand that could provide a base for future research...|$|E

40|$|The freight {{brokerage}} {{industry in}} North America {{was born of}} the deregulation of the trucking industry in 1982. In the two decades since, the industry has grown from nothing to $ 50 Billion in revenue. In the beginning, <b>freight</b> <b>brokers</b> used T-card systems to record, track, and bill orders. Technology advances over those two decades have driven many of the operational changes throughout the freight transportation industry as a whole, with shipment data visibility, asset utilization, and supply chain planning leading the way. The use of optimization tools in transportation and supply chain management has proliferated. Network analysis, inventory planning and deployment, fleet routing, and warehouse planning are important examples of areas in which these tools have had a major impact. However, the freight brokerage sub-industry itself has largely ignored {{the use of these}} tools. This research proposes pragmatic uses for optimization techniques in the freight brokerage industry. Three tools are proposed, with justifications for need, mathematical formulations, and exemplary situations and savings described. The three tools are: 1) optimal truckload freight tenders to multiple carriers, 2) optimal LTL consolidation, and 3) optimal matching of loads and trucks. by Jeffrey L. Silver. Thesis (M.
