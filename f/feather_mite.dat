40|$|<b>Feather</b> <b>mites</b> (Astigmata) are {{distributed}} around the world, {{living on the}} feathers of birds, but their mechanisms for transmission among hosts are not fully understood. There is anecdotal evidence of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> attached to louseflies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), suggesting that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> may use these flies {{as a mode of}} phoretic transmission among birds. Two bird-lousefly associations (alpine swift Apus melbaCrataerina melbae and feral pigeon Columba livia-Pseudolynchia canariensis) were inspected to test the hypothesis that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> use hippoboscid flies as major mode of transmission. Both bird species showed a high prevalence and abundance of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> and louseflies. However, no <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> were found attached to the 405 louseflies inspected, although skin mites (Epidermoptidae and Cheyletiellidae) were found on louseflies collected from feral pigeons. This study suggests that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> do not use hippoboscid flies as a major mode of transmission among birds. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The moult {{of birds}} could greatly perturb {{the life cycle}} of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> (Astigmata). These mites live on the surface of {{feathers}} and are unlikely to survive if they are on one when it is moulted. Therefore, we hypothesized that they would escape to other feathers to avoid this risk of mortality. We analysed the distribution of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> on the wings of 63 moulting individuals of 13 species of passerine birds. We used generalized linear mixed models to test whether the distribution of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> depends on the stage of moult of <b>feathers.</b> <b>Feather</b> <b>mites</b> were significantly less abundant on the next feather to fall out than on the other feathers. This ability to escape seems to be higher on primaries and secondaries than on tertials. At least on primaries, <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> avoided not only the next feather to be moulted but also the second one. For primaries and secondaries the new full-grown feathers harboured more <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> than those still growing. This study shows that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> have an escape behaviour from moulting wing feathers in passerine birds that is consistent with a model of adaptive behaviourPeer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it {{is perceived as a}} potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the <b>feather</b> <b>mite</b> Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the pattern of}} distribution {{and the effect of}} molting on the escape behavior of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> on the wing feathers during the nonmolting and molting season of the barn swallow Hirundo rustica. <b>Feather</b> <b>mites</b> showed consistent preference for the second outermost primary, with a steady decrease in proximal distance and avoidance of the outermost primary. Several explanations are suggested to explain this unusual distribution. Further, analyzing the escape behavior of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> on molting primaries, we show that <b>mites</b> avoid the <b>feathers</b> destined to be dropped next on molting barn swallows, {{and in the case of}} the outermost primary, mites use the "last moment" strategy, namely, leaving feathers shortly before it is dropped. Next, we performed an experiment in which we simulated shedding feathers or feathers about to be shed on nonmolting barn swallows, in order to test cues used by <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> in avoiding molting primaries. Both the vibration of the incised feather and the gap of the pulled <b>feather</b> induced <b>mites</b> to leave primaries situated distally, at two-feathers distance from the manipulated primary, related to the control group. Our results show that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> have the ability to perceive the signal produced by the feather that will drop next and by the gap of the missing feather. It remains to be demonstrated, whether <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> have the ability to perceive the vibration of the feather per se or they perceive the altered airflow caused by the vibrating feathers.

40|$|<b>Feather</b> <b>mites</b> (suborder Astigmata, superfamilies Analgoidea, Pterolichoidea and Freyaniidae) {{are among}} the commonest ectosymbionts of birds.

5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a <b>feather</b> <b>mite</b> that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity {{and the fact that}} it is the only one of its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can also}} carry mites, but {{a study of}} the <b>feather</b> <b>mite</b> Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and antingâ€”rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> (Astigmata) along {{the wing of}} passerine birds could change dramatically within minutes because of the rapid movement of <b>mites</b> between <b>feathers.</b> However, no rigorous study has answered how fine-tuned is the pattern of {{distribution of}} <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> at a given time. Here we present a multiscale study {{of the distribution of}} <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> on the wing of non-moulting blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla in a short time period and at a single locality. We found that the number and distribution of mites differed among birds, but it was extremely similar between the wings of each bird. Moreover, mites consistently avoided the first secondary feather, despite that it is placed at the centre of the feathers most used by them. Thus, our results suggest that <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> do precise, feather-level decisions on where to live, contradicting the current view that mites perform â€˜â€˜massâ€™â€™, or â€˜â€˜blindâ€™â€™ movements across wing feathers. Moreover, our findings indicate that â€˜â€˜rareâ€™â€™ distributions are not spurious data or sampling errors, but each distribution of mites on the wing of each bird is the outcome of the particular conditions operating on each ambient-bird-feather mite system at a given time. This study indicates that {{we need to focus on}} the distribution of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> at the level of the individual bird and at the feather level to improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of mites on the wings of birds.

5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of <b>feather</b> <b>mite,</b> which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E
500|$|A {{species of}} {{parasitic}} phtilopterid louse, Rallicola extinctus, was only known {{to live on}} the huia, and apparently became extinct with its host. In 2008, a new species of <b>feather</b> <b>mite,</b> Coraciacarus muellermotzfeldi, was described from dried corpses found in the feathers of a huia skin held by a European museum. While the genus Coraciacarus has a wide range of hosts globally, the presence of a representative of the genus on a passerine bird was an [...] "enigmatic phenomenon". The discoverers suggested the mite could have been horizontally transferred from one of the two native, migratory species of cuckoo (Cuculiformes).|$|E

40|$|Understanding why {{host species}} differ {{so much in}} {{symbiont}} loads and how this depends on ecological host and symbiont traits is {{a major issue in}} the ecology of symbiosis. A first step in this inquiry is to know whether observed differences among host species are species-specific traits or more related with host-symbiont environmental conditions. Here we analysed the repeatability (R) of the intensity and the prevalence of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> to partition within- and among-host species variance components. We compiled the largest dataset so far available: 119 Paleartic passerine bird species, 75, 944 individual birds, ca. 1. 8 million mites, seven countries, 23 study years. Several analyses and approaches were made to estimate R and adjusted repeatability (R(adj)) after controlling for potential confounding factors (breeding period, weather, habitat, spatial autocorrelation and researcher identity). The prevalence of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> was moderately repeatable (R = 0. 26 - 0. 53; R(adj) = 0. 32 - 0. 57); smaller values were found for intensity (R = 0. 19 - 0. 30; R(adjâ€Š) = 0. 18 - 0. 30). These moderate repeatabilities show that prevalence and intensity of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> differ among species, but also that the high variation within species leads to considerable overlap among bird species. Differences in the prevalence and intensity of <b>feather</b> <b>mites</b> within bird species were small among habitats, suggesting that local factors are playing a secondary role. However, effects of local climatic conditions were partially observed for intensity...|$|R
