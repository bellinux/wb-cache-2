5|$|Once, {{while working}} at the Sanitarium, Beilhart was called to the bedside {{of a young girl}} for whom doctors had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope.</b> When Beilhart prayed for her, she {{experienced}} a quick and complete recovery. Beilhart's conviction that faith-healing was the remedy for illness put him in disfavor with the sanitarium officials and he was asked to resign.|$|E
5|$|Melvin served out {{his term}} until October 31, 1906, when he {{suffered}} a stroke while holding a session of the circuit court in Wellsburg. He was paralyzed and lost consciousness {{as a result of}} the stroke, and was assisted from the bench and taken to Wheeling City Hospital in Ward5. By the following day physicians had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> for his recovery. Melvin died at 16:00 on November 9, 1906, at the hospital as a result of apoplexy. His body was taken to the McLure Hotel on November 10, where it lay in state until November 12. Melvin was interred next to his father and mother in his family's graveyard at United Methodist Cemetery in his hometown of Fairview (present-day New Manchester) in Hancock County.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E

5|$|There was {{no clear}} {{solution}} to combating Britain from the air. Göring had not <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> {{of winning a}} victory by airborne assault. He discussed the possibility of invading Ireland (Fall Grün, or Operation Green) with Kurt Student in January 1941, in order to surround Britain by land, sea and air. The operation was shelved. Instead, the Luftwaffe, {{with varying degrees of}} success, carried out the strategic bombardment of British industrial cities. The lack of RAF night defences in this stage of the war enabled the German bombers to inflict extensive damage without suffering the heavy losses of the daylight campaign. It is estimated that the Luftwaffe lost around 500 aircrews during the Blitz in comparison to the Battle of Britain in which it lost around 2,800 killed, 340 wounded, 750 captured. Overall losses were cut by one-third of daylight operations.|$|E
5|$|D. Michael Harris and Jack Grimm {{had failed}} to find Titanic but their expeditions did succeed in {{producing}} fairly detailed mapping of {{the area in which}} the ship had sunk. It was clear that the position given in Titanics distress signals was inaccurate, which was a major expedition difficulty because it increased the search area's already-massive size. Despite the failure of his 1977 expedition, Robert Ballard had not <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> and devised new technologies and a new search strategy to tackle the problem. The new technology was a system called Argo / Jason. This consisted of a remotely controlled deep-sea vehicle called Argo, equipped with sonar and cameras and towed behind a ship, with a robot called Jason tethered to it that could roam the sea floor, take close-up images and gather specimens. The images from the system would be transmitted back to a control room on the towing vessel where they could be assessed immediately. Although it was designed for scientific purposes, it also had important military applications and the United States Navy agreed to sponsor the system's development, on condition that it was to be used to carry out a number of programmes – many still classified – for the Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{search was}} cancelled {{soon after the}} storm and newspapers reported the children as dead.

Dick-a-Dick took two other Wotjobaluk men, Jerry and Fred, with him and within hours had rediscovered the children's trail and hours later had found the children near death.|$|E

One day later, Ullrich canceled his licence of the Swiss Cycling Federation, and was looking for a different federation for a licence of 2007. Ullrich claimed that the Swiss Cycling Federation had to stop their doping investigation, but the Swiss federation continued the investigation. On 25 October 2006, a document from the Spanish court on Ullrich's website stated that no charges would be filed.|$|E

They had reached 204/4 when Jim Parks missed a stumping chance off Peter Burge when Australia were only four runs ahead. Burge made 120, his fourth and final Test century, all made against England in times of crisis, and Doug Walters 115 in his second Test. Mike Smith had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> when the {{part-time}} bowler Geoff Boycott (2/32) had Burge out after a stand of 198 and with Ken Barrington (2/47) surprisingly cleared up the tail to have Australia out for 426.|$|E
25|$|A coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses {{a threat}} to vampires when they {{discover}} the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though for her she was away for only a few minutes in Faerie) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of finding her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia/Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} 2nd NZ Division were now {{concentrated}} near Zaafran, five {{miles east of}} Belhamed and slightly further north-east of Sidi Rezegh. During the morning of 1 December, Freyberg, commanding 2nd New Zealand Division, saw a signal from Eighth Army indicating that the South African Brigade were now to be under command of 7th Armoured Division. He drew the inference that Army HQ had <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of holding the Tobruk corridor and signalled mid-morning that without the South Africans his position would be untenable {{and that he was}} planning a withdrawal. Orders were issued by Freyberg to be ready to move east at 17.30. 15th Panzer, which had been resupplying, renewed its attack at 16.30 and the Trieste cut the tenuous link established with Tobruk. The New Zealanders became involved in a desperate fighting withdrawal from its western positions. Nevertheless, the division, showing admirable discipline, was formed up by 17.30 and having paused an hour for the tanks and artillery to join them from the west, set off at 18.45. They reached the XXX Corps lines with little further interruption and in the early hours the 3,500 men and 700 vehicles which had emerged were heading back to Egypt.|$|E

500|$|However, as {{the last}} year of the war dawned, the Germans regained some ground in the {{technology}} battle. Grand Admiral Dönitz had not yet <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of achieving strategic effect in the U-boat war. The Types XXI, XXII, and XXIII were becoming available, and in an attempt to impose some effect, he ordered operations in British home waters. These designs were faster, and more difficult to detect. German operations with five Type XXIIIs in British waters sank seven ships without loss, two of these on 7 May 1945. By the end of April, 12 Type XXIs had completed trials and 99 more were on trials, but only one Type XXI became operational before the surrender. Their introduction came too late. The bulk of operations were continued by older, Type VII submarines. The type suffered heavy losses to Allied aircraft, losing 23 in British waters in the last five weeks of the war. Now experiencing a [...] "Happy Time" [...] in reverse, submarines in the Baltic Sea lost 50 of their number, and 83 in total to Allied aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1604 Robert Catesby, a Catholic convert who {{had lost}} {{patience}} with King James I's lack of toleration of Catholics, invited his cousin Thomas Wintour to a meeting at which John was also present.

[...] A fifth conspirator, Thomas Percy, joined them several weeks later. [...] Percy was related to the Wright family by marriage, having wed John's sister, Martha. [...] The group met on 20 May 1604 at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London. [...] After the meeting they swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book and celebrated Mass in another room with Father John Gerard, who was ignorant of their purpose.|$|E

500|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts late in February 1604 Thomas's cousin, Robert Catesby, {{invited him to}} his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. [...] Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. [...] Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. [...] As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would [...] "breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations". He also offered a warning {{of the price of}} failure: [...] "the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as not only our enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us." [...] He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>hope</b> of foreign support—"because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried"—Thomas returned to the continent.|$|E
500|$|The {{ordeal of}} Captain Luce, {{and others who}} survived on {{assorted}} wreckage, lasted for two days. Around noon on September 29, the sailing ship Cambria, out of Glasgow and heading for Quebec, spotted François Jassonet, the Vesta fisherman who had been rescued by the Arctic after the collision. In the following few hours, Cambria picked up nine more survivors; these included Luce and two companions, the only survivors of the eleven who had found refuge on {{the remains of the}} paddlebox. [...] The last to be picked up by Cambria was James Smith, a businessman from Scotland, who had survived on a raft constructed from planking and a tin-lined wicker basket.
