40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} Musa {{paradisiaca}} stem kernel juice {{was investigated in}} experimental urolithiatic rats. Stone forming rats exhibited a significant elevation {{in the activities of}} two oxalate synthesizing enzymes- <b>Glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> oxidase and Lactate dehydrogenase. Deposition and excretion of stone forming constituents in kidney and urine were also increased in these rats. The enzyme activities and the level of crystalline components were lowered with the extract treatment. The extract also reduced the activities of urinary alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, r-glutamyl transferase, inorganic pyrophosphatase and β-glucuronidase in calculogenic rats. No appreciable changes were noticed with leucine amino peptidase activity in treated rats...|$|E
40|$|A {{solution}} of <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> {{in a mixture}} of benzyl alcohol and hexamethylphosphoric triamide is proposed to replace acetic acid in the glucose determination with 0 -toluidine as applied directly to blood plasma. The new reagent is non-volatile, odourless, colourless, of low viscosity and stable for weeks at room temperature. It does not precipitate serum proteins. The method is particularly suited to discrete mechanization. Its sensitivity and overall reliability are higher than that of the acetic-acid method.

The addition of D-ribose 5 -phosphate decreased the amount of hydroxamic acid that was produced.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown by McKenzie and his school that when {{optically}} active esters of alpha-keto-acids and a Grignard reagent (RgX) interact the diastereo-isomerides are produced in unequal amounts. The substituted <b>glycollic</b> <b>acids,</b> obtained by hydrolysis, were optically active, although not optically pure. The analogous reactions using optically active esters of gamma-, delta-, epsilon- [...] . keto-acids had virtually not been studied. In the present investigation the interaction of (-) -menthyl esters of o-acetyl fatty acids and phenyl magnesium bromide has been studied {{with a view to}} obtaining asymmetric synthesis and to relating this to the length of the chain intervening between the carbonyl and carbomenthoxy groups. The investigation has entailed the preparation of the above type of esters when n = 0, 2, 3, 4 and 8, and their treatment with phenyl magnesium bromide. The hydroxy-acids or (with n = 2 and 3) lactones, obtained after hydrolysis of the resulting esters, were opticallyactive, except in the case of n = 8. With n = 2 or 3, the degree of asymmetric synthesis was dependent on reaction conditions. The addition of a Grignard reagent to a carbonyl group has previously been found to occur asymmetrically only when the carbonyl group is in a molecule containing, a "fixed centre of asymmetry". It has now been found that an asymmetric reaction occurs when an optically active organo-metallic compound adds to a ketone. This type of reaction has been studied using (-) -menthyl bromoacetate, acetophenone and zinc. The B -hydroxy acid obtained on hydrolysis was optically active. The extent of the asymmetric synthesis was found to be remarkably constant, irrespective of a wide variation in reaction conditions. Theories of asymmetric synthesis are discussed and a theory involving energy differences of two transition states is proposed as an explanation of the results obtained in this investigation. Hydroxy-V-phenyl-n-valeric acid (n = 2) has been prepared and resolved. <p...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} fate of [1 - 14 -C]hexadecylsulphate and hexadecyl[35 -S]sulphate, administered intravenously as the sodium and trimethylammonium salt to dogs and orally as the erythromycin salt to dogs, rats and humans, was studied. Studies with rats {{indicated that the}} compounds were well absorbed and rapidly excreted in the urine. However, after oral administration of the 14 -C-and 35 -S-labelled hexadecyl sulphate erythromycin salt to dogs, considerable amounts of radioactivity were excreted in the faeces as unmetabolized hexadecyl sulphate. Studies with two humans showed that orally administered erythromycin salt of [1 - 14 C]hexadecyl sulphate was well absorbed in one person but poorly absorbed in the other. Radioactive metabolites in urine were separated by t. l. c. in two solvent systems. The main metabolite of hexadecyl sulphate in the dog, rat and human was identified as the sulphate ester of 4 -hydroxybutyric acid. In addition, psi-[14 -C]butyrolactone as a minor metabolic product of [1 - 14 -C]hexadecyl sulphate was also isolated from the urine of rat, dog and man. However, there was still another metabolite in dog urine, which comprised about 20 % of the total urinary radioactivity and carried both 14 -C and 35 -S labels. This metabolite was absent from rat urine. The metabolite in dog urine was isolated and subsequently identified by t. l. c. and g. l. c. and by isotope-dilution experiments as the sulphate ester of <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid.</b> Small amounts (about 5 % of the total recovered radioactivity in excreta) of labelled <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> sulphate were also found in human urine after ingestion of erythromycin [1 - 14 -C]hexadecyl sulphate...|$|E
40|$|The {{possible}} extracted {{species of}} {{rare earth elements}} (REE) in bis(1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethylbutyl) phosphinic acid (Hmbp) /cyclohexane-HNO 3 system was proposed by a log-log plot analysis and a saturated extraction method as being [M(mbp) (3) (Hmbp) (3) ] (M = REE). It was also verified by IR, H- 1 NMR spectra and element analysis of lutetium-Hmbp extracted species. The effective mutual separation of REEs was achieved on the Hmbp modified C- 18 column by a pH gradient elution. Moreover, the degree of the mutual separation of europium(III) from gadolinium(III) was remarkably improved by adding <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> in the mobile phase.

40|$|The {{transport}} of organic acids across the membrane of resealed haemoglobin-containing erythrocyte 'ghosts' prepared by a dialysis technique has been studied. The present work forms part of studies directed towards {{the use of}} erythrocyte cellular carriers in enzyme-replacement therapy of inherited metabolic diseases. Oxalic acid, <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> and glyoxylic acid were taken as representative of aliphatic acids of low molecular mass and benzoic and cinnamic acids as representative of unsubstituted aromatic acids. These selected acids are important in the diseases with which the present work is concerned. Comparison of influx and efflux transport characteristics showed that erythrocyte 'ghosts' retain transport properties closely {{similar to those of}} normal erythrocytes. Rapid transport was observed with all organic acids studied and there was a linear relationship between initial amount of influx and external concentration of aliphatic acid. Saturation of the transport system was not observed up to 1 mM external concentration, and the presence of plasma in the external medium had no effect on transport characteristics. Transport in intact erythrocytes and prepared erythrocyte 'ghosts' from patients with hyperoxaluria was also studied...|$|E
40|$|These {{investigations}} {{have been concerned}} with the biosynthesis of a well-defined mucin fraction obtained by papain digestion from sheep colonic mucosal scrapings. This mucin fraction which accounted for 12. 2 % of the total dry weight of the tissue contained 3 anionic components. The major constituent was an electrophoretically slow-moving component (fraction H), a minor mucoprotein constituent (fraction L) was also present, and nucleic acid the fastest electrophoretically moving constituent. Fraction H, separated from other components by preparative ultracentrifugation {{is known to have}} a structure similar to that of other epithelial mucins. This is considered to consist of a central protein core (rich in serine and threonine, together 32 % of the total amino acids) carrying carbohydrate side-branches (Kent and Marsden, 1963). In the carbohydrate side branches fucose (3. 8 %) and sialic acids (N-glycollyl- and N-acetylneuraminic acids 8. 5 and 5. 2 % respectively) are located as terminal residues. These are attached to galactose (13. 0 %) and in turn to amino sugar residues (N-Hacetylglucosamine and N-acetyl- galactosamine 18. 1 % and 7. 9 % respectively as the free hexosamines). Ester sulphate (3. 5 %) is mainly attached to the hexosamine residues. Fraction L is apparently also a mucoprotein but different from H in that it is rich in fucose and ester sulphate and contains no sialic acid residues. Scrapings of sheep colonic tissue incubated at 37 ° in an atmosphere of O 2 in modified Krebs III medium (D-glucose omitted but with L-glutamine added) are metabolically active (Qo 2 - 3. 75). When incubated for 2 ½ hr. under these conditions with radioactive substrates, the tissue readily incorporates radioactivity into the carbohydrate and peptide moieties of fraction H (fraction L and nucleic acid remaining unlabelled). [U- 14 C] -D-glucose and [2 - 14 C] -D-glucose are incorporated into mucin, 16. 7 % and 22. 9 % respectively of the total counts added being incorporated. Analysis of a typical sample of mucin isolated from incubation with [2 - 14 C] -D-glucose (specific activity of mucin formed, 11. 950 counts/min. /mg.) gave the following distribution of counts: N-acetylneuraminic acid 8. 34 %, N-glycollylneuraminic acid O. 95 %, fucose 10. 2 %, galactose 14. 5 %, glucosamine 28. 9 % galactosamine 9. 6 %, and less than 0. 001 % labelling in the amino acids. Similarly sodium [1 - 14 C] and [2 - 14 C] acetate are incorporated into mucin (l 2. 8 % of total added counts from [2 - 14 C] acetate incorporated) into both the monosaccharide constituents and into the N-acyl substituents. [U- 14 C] -L-threonine (mucin 1. 52 % of total added counts) leads to labelling only in the peptide portion of fraction H and solely at threonine. Moreover 35 SO 4 2 - (1. 29 % of total added counts incorporated) is incorporated only as ester sulphate. The incorporation of radioactivity from a variety of radioactive precursors suggests that biosynthesis of fraction H Is occurring, in contrast to the mere exchange of residues in the preformed mucoprotein. A main aspect of the investigation has been concerned with the biochemical origin of the glycollyl residues in this mammalian tissue, Radioactivity from [2 - 14 C] -D-glucose is incorporated by the whole tissue into both the N-glycollyl substituent and the central sugar moiety of N-glycollylneuraminic acid of mucin. However despite N-glycollylneuraminic acid being quantitatively the predominant sialic acid (N-glycollyl- to N-acetylneuraminic acid 5 : 3 by wt.), the ratio of radioactive labelling is 10. 8 : 1 (as specific activities in favour of N-acetylneuraminic acid). The labelling in N-acetylneuraminic acid being comparable to that in the other monosaccharide constituents. Similar low labelling of N-glycollylneuraminic acid occurred on incubation of tissue with [2 - 14 C] acetate, ratio of labelling of N-acetyl- to N-glycollyl- 6. 6 : 1 (as specific activities). This low level of labelling in the N-glycollylneuraminic acid is especially evident in its main monosaccharide moiety when [2 - 14 C]-D-glucose was used. This may be a genuine reflection of the differences in the metabolic pathways leading to these sialic acids. Alternatively it may reflect differences in pool sizes or a lower rate of biosynthesis of N-glycollylneuraminic acid. Investigations of other possible biochemical sources of the N-glycollyl- substituent, suggest that the commonly accepted pathways of <b>glycollic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis postulated for mammals, are insufficient to account for the present results. Cell-free preparations quantitatively accomplished enzyme biosynthesis of N~glycollyl- and N-acetylneuraminic acids from added N-glycollyl- and N-acetylglucosamine respectively. However, while such enzyme preparations also catalysed the formation of N-acetylglucosamine from glucosamine and acetate (or acetyl-CoA) N-glycollylation of glucosamine with a wide a variety of N-glycollyl precursors was not brought about. Fructose- 6 -phosphate, hydroxy- pyruvate, glycollate and chemically synthesized glycollyl-CoA all were inactive in cell-free preparations as N-glycollyl donors. In intact cells, evidence does not support the operation of these substrates as N-glycollyl- precursors, The labelling pattern of N~glycollylneuraminyl residues from [2 - 14 C]-D-glucose and [2 - 14 C]-acetate experiments is not compatible with fructose- 6 -phosphate or any other transketolase substrate being an N-glycollyl precursor. While [3 - 14 C]-hydroxypyruvate lead to radioactivity being incorporated into galactose, fucose {{and to a lesser extent}} into hexosamines and N-acetylneuraminic acid (mucin 3. 5 and 0. 76 % incorporation of total added counts for two experiments respectively), no incorporation into the N-glycollylneuraminic acid occurred. [U- 14 C] Glycine is incorporated (mucin 0. 14 and 0. 13 % of total added counts) as glycine (or glutamic acid) and serine residues but not into the N-glycollyl residue. It is suggested that these results do not role out other possibilities such as hydroxylation of an acetyl moiety being the N-glycollyl source. A further aspect of the work has been concerned with the inhibition of mucoprotein biosynthesis by salicylate. Salicylate (15 mM) inhibited the incorporation of [2 - 14 C]-D-glucose (83. 9 %), [U- 14 C] -L- threonine (82 %) and 35 SO 4 2 - (79 %) into mucin and simultaneously reduced the oxygen uptake by the tissue (595). Lower inhibitory concentrations of salicylate (3. 75 mM) while little effecting [U- 14 C] -L-threonine incorporation into mucin (3 and 6 % inhibition) substantially decreased the incorporation of [2 - 14 C]-D-glucose (48 and 41 % inhibition) and 35 SO 4 2 - (59 and 4 O% inhibition). Analysis of mucin from inhibitions with [2 - 14 C]-D-glucose in the presence of 3. 75 mM salicylate showed that there was a large reduction in the labelling of the sialic acids (of N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-glycollylneuraminic acid 57 and 34 % inhibition respectively) and hexosamines (e. g. glucosmine and galactosamine 55 and 33 % inhibition respectively) while the neutral sugars were relatively unaffected (fucose and galactose 9 and 11 % inhibition respectively). While fructose- 6 -phosphate transaminase and glucosamine- 6 -phosphate acetylase activities In the particle-free supernatant are relatively unaffected by salicylate, acetyl-CoA synthetase activity is markedly inhibited at salicylate levels as low as 0. 235 mM (49 % inhibition with 0. 05 mM CoA). In light of the above effects of salicylate on mucin biosynthesis it is suggested that the known disruptive effect of aspirin on the gastric mucosa of humans and experimental animals maybe in part due to inhibition by the drug (or its active principal salicylate) of biosynthesis of the protective mucin lining of the gut. This concept is further supported by experiments showing inhibition by 15 mM aspirin of the incorporation of [U- 14 C]-D-glucose into mucin (73 % inhibition). Furthermore human gastric mucosa inoubated under identical conditions to the sheep mucosal tissue above, has a Qo 2 of - 9. 9 and incorporates [U- 14 C]-D-glucose (15. 8 % of total added counts) into bound:hexosamines (20. 6 %), hexoses (glucose and galactose 5. 7 %) and facose (l 4. 2 %). 15 mM salicylate in the incubation medium produced little observable change on the oxygen uptake by the human gastric mucosal tissue, but reduced the incorporation of [U- 14 C]-D-glucose into the bound sugars by 74 % and this decrease was also reflected in the labelling of all the radioactive sugar constituents. Puromyoin (0. 01 %) a specific inhibitor of protein biosynthesis at the ribosomal level, was found to inhibit the incorporation of L-threonine into fraction H (93. 3 and 81. 5 % inhibition). [U- 14 C]-D-glucose (52. 0 and 68. 4 % inhibition) and 35 SO 4 2 - (78. 9 and 76. 2 % inhibition) incorporation was also inhibited by puromycin but to a lesser extent than with L-threonine. The oxygen uptake of the tissue over the first 3 hours of incubation was unaffected by puromycin. Analysis of the distribution of labelling of [U- 14 C]-D-glucose in the puromycin samples showed that in contrast to salicylate the reduction in [U- 14 C]-D-glucose was reflected non-specifically in all the monosaccharide constituents e. g. for a mucoprotein sample where the decrease was 52 % of total incorporation of [U- 14 C]-D-glucose relative to the control these were:- 56 % N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-glycollylneuraminic acid 39 % hexosamines 54 %, fucose 42 % and galactose 66 %. Assuming the only effect of puromycin is on inhibition of protein synthesis in this system then these results suggest that the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate and ester sulphate moieties are closely dependant on the prior formation of a peptide precursor, and in particular sulphate incorporation is closely connected with the biosynthesis of the rest of the molecule.
