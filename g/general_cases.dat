25|$|Sonorants voiced /m/ and /n/ {{have three}} allophones: w and l intervocalically, b and d word {{initially}} and following an obstruent, and m and n {{in all other}} conditions. In conservative speech, l is realized as a tapped r, however in <b>general</b> <b>cases</b> it is realized as l, perhaps in due part {{to the influence of}} English. Word initially, b is optional for /m/, though b is more commonly realized. The glottal sonorant /h/ assimilates to the nasality of the following segment, but retains its voicelessness. When following i or e or preceding ch, /h/ may be realized as an alveopalatal fricative.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so we have only {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in <b>general</b> <b>cases.</b> On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sinusoid}} {{is defined}} for {{all times and}} distances, whereas in physical situations we usually deal with waves that exist for a limited span in space and duration in time. Fortunately, an arbitrary wave shape can be decomposed into an infinite set of sinusoidal waves {{by the use of}} Fourier analysis. As a result, the simple case of a single sinusoidal wave can be applied to more <b>general</b> <b>cases.</b> In particular, many media are linear, or nearly so, so the calculation of arbitrary wave behavior can be found by adding up responses to individual sinusoidal waves using the superposition principle to find the solution for a general waveform. [...] When a medium is nonlinear, the response to complex waves cannot be determined from a sine-wave decomposition.|$|E

60|$|I return, however, to the {{question}} of the conduct of the Boers to their white opponents. So long as they were fighting as an army under the eyes of the honourable men who led them, their conduct was on the whole good, but guerilla warfare brought with it the demoralisation which it always does bring, and there was a rapid falling away from the ordinary humanity between civilised opponents. I do not mean by this to assert that the Boer guerillas behaved as did the Spanish guerillas in 1810, or the Mexican in 1866. Such an assertion would be absurd. The Boers gave quarter and they received it. But several isolated instances, and several <b>general</b> <b>cases</b> have shown the demoralisation of their ranks. Of the former I might quote the circumstances of the death of Lieutenant Miers.|$|E
