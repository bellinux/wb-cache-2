Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E
5|$|During 1938 and 1939, {{with war}} anticipated, an {{increasing}} part of Pick's {{time was spent}} in planning for the approaching conflict. The Railway Executive Committee was reconstituted in 1938 {{to act as a}} central coordinating body for the country's railways with Pick as the LPTB's representative. This role absorbed most of his time after the committee took over control of the railways on 1 September 1939. Following a disagreement {{with other members of the}} LPTB board over the government's proposals to limit the dividend that it could pay to its shareholders, Pick stated his intention to retire from the board at the end of his seven-year appointment in May 1940. Pick had previously suggested a reorganisation of the LPTB's senior management structure and hoped to be able to continue with the organisation <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of joint general manager position. Ashfield chose not to find such a continuing role for Pick and, on 18 May 1940, to the surprise of many within the organisation, Pick retired from the LPTB board, officially due to failing health. Pick's post of chief executive was abolished and replaced with a group of six heads of department.|$|E

Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a DVD player {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E

MRAPs are to be superseded by the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle when it enters service in 2016. It still may be used until 2022, when the JLTV is in use in sufficient numbers.|$|E
25|$|The energy {{problem has}} also been {{considered}} {{in relation to the}} idea of mass accretion in connection with the Expanding Earth theory. Among the early theorists to link mass increase <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of push gravity model to Earth expansion were Yarkovsky and Hilgenberg. The idea of mass accretion and the expanding earth theory are not currently considered to be viable by mainstream scientists. This is because, among other reasons, according to the principle of mass-energy equivalence, if the Earth was absorbing the energy of the ultramundane flux at the rate necessary to produce the observed force of gravity (i.e. by using the values calculated by Poincaré), its mass would be doubling in each fraction of a second.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 {{documentary}} film maker Nick Broomfield made Juvenile Liaison about a juvenile liaison {{project in the}} town. The film examines a series of children and their run-ins with the law, over minor wrongdoings such as theft, truancy and being abusive to parents. After its production, the film was banned by the BFI for many years; Juvenile Liaison revolved mainly around the activities of Sergeant Ray, whose preventative measures when dealing with young trouble makers fell mainly in the strong-arm category of approach. In 1990 Nick Broomfield returned to Blackburn to film a follow up.

We detect an anomaly only if both scan are coherent on the anomaly detection output. The same procedure can be repeated three times.

25|$|As well as {{sharing the}} same seven actors, the trilogy was also written {{to use the same}} set: a flat in the London Docklands, where Ayckbourn himself owns a flat. Beyond that, there was no {{intentional}} link between the plays, and the only reason the name Damsels in Distress was chosen was that the plays all happened to include a female character <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of trouble. However, there were nonetheless a number of common themes that arose from the plays' settings: flats owned by well-to-do Londoners who know little of who their neighbours are or what they do; and seedy vices left behind from London's old East End coming back to haunt them. The plays also shared themes common to most Ayckbourn plays.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of Act One {{is set in}} the local preacher Reverend Samuel Parris's attic. His ten-year-old daughter, Betty Parris, lies motionless. The previous evening, Reverend Parris discovered Betty, some other girls, and his Barbadian slave, Tituba, engaged <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of pagan ritual in the forest. The village is rife with rumors of witchcraft and a crowd gathers outside Rev. Parris' house. Parris becomes concerned that the event will cause him to be removed from his position as the town's reverend. He questions the girls' apparent ringleader, his niece Abigail Williams, whom Parris has been forced to adopt after her parents were brutally killed in the Pequot War. Abigail denies they were engaged in witchcraft, claiming that they had been dancing. Afterwards, the wealthy and influential Thomas Putnam and his wife, Ann arrive. At the Putnams' urgence, Parris reluctantly decides to invite Reverend John Hale, an expert in witchcraft and demonology, to investigate and leaves to address the crowd.|$|E

25|$|The first kingdom {{known to}} have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, with its capital at Yeha, where a Sabaean style temple was built around 700 BC. It rose to power around the 10th century BC. The D'mt kingdom was {{influenced}} by the Sabaeans in Yemen, however it is not known to what extent. While it was once believed that D'mt was a Sabaean colony, it is now believed that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of Dʿmt or some other proto-Aksumite state. Few inscriptions by or about this kingdom survive and very little archaeological work has taken place. As a result, it is not known whether Dʿmt ended as a civilization before Aksum's early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the Aksumite kingdom possibly around the beginning of the 1st century.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Girls {{was shot}} on {{videotape}} {{in front of}} a live studio audience. Many episodes of the series followed a similar format or theme.

At some point, they would gather around the kitchen table and discuss the problem, sometimes late at night and often while eating cheesecake or some other dessert. One of the other girls then told a story from her own life, which somehow related to the problem (though Rose occasionally regaled a nonsense story that had nothing to do with the situation, and Sophia told outrageous made-up stories). Some episodes featured flashbacks to previous episodes, flashbacks to events not shown in previous episodes, or to events that occurred before the series began. Though the writing was mostly comical, dramatic moments and sentimental endings were included in several episodes. One of the actresses on the show, Bea Arthur, actually hated cheesecake.|$|E
25|$|Earl Richard {{was one of}} the Lords Appellant, {{the leaders}} of the baronial {{opposition}} to Richard II, and was executed in 1397. Burley's activities during these momentous events seems to have been entirely routine. In July 1397, immediately after Arundel's arrest, Burley was involved <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> of deal with John Eyton that required a reciprocal agreement to pay each other a substantial £200 the next Michaelmas. Later in the year he is recorded taking recognizances as usual, including an undertaking from William Glover of Ludlow for £60. Business continued, with other smaller clients employing him, along with his usual colleagues. On 7 March 1398 he and Thomas Young were among the feoffees appointed by Isabel de Eylesford to deal with her manors of Brimfield, Herefordshire, and Buildwas, Shropshire: a licence to complete the business by reciprocally enfeoffing Isabel was not issued until April 1402, long after the looming power struggle had reached conclusion, and problems at Brimfield delayed completion until February 1403, by which time Isabel was remarried. Such legal complexities unfolded to an entirely different rhythm from politics. An almost adjacent entry in the Patent rolls for show of 4 Februarys how delicately the king, evidently worried by spreading disaffection, was handling Shropshire people affected by Arundel's attainder. In this case, in an issue that might have been initiated by Burley, the king ensured that an Oswestry brewer would not be out of pocket, as he had invested heavily in premises granted by Arundel. Burley's own position with the régime seems to have been little affected and he was reappointed as a justice of the peace on 16 September 1398, after a lapse of little more than a year: {{more or less the same}} interval as previously.|$|E
