50|$|Uniforms in 1891 {{consisted}} of a dark blue jersey with sleeves, a porkpie cap and an <b>Eton</b> <b>collar</b> worn on Sundays and special occasions. Discipline was maintained {{at this time in}} medieval fashion by use of the birch and the headmaster also carried a knuckle duster. Later this was replaced with a slim bamboo cane administered by both lay staff and Brothers and used liberally well into the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Freshfield died at Wych Cross Place, Forest Row, Sussex. He {{is buried}} at Brookwood Cemetery {{in front of}} the {{memorial}} to his son Henry Douglas Freshfield (1877-1891), which was carved by Edward Onslow Ford. This memorial consists of a pediment displaying a relief of Apollo in his chariot below which is a bas-relief group of two naked putti with inverted torches, emblems of death, above which is a profile portrait of the young Henry Freshfield wearing an <b>Eton</b> <b>collar.</b> The monument has been Grade II listed since 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Despite any {{negative}} stereotypes associated with his incredible wealth, Richie Rich {{is portrayed as}} kind and charitable. (In fact, his moniker is [...] "the poor little rich boy.") He lives in an expensive mansion and owns {{at least two of}} everything money can buy. Richie appears to be around seven to ten years old and wears a waistcoat, a white shirt with an <b>Eton</b> <b>collar</b> (which is obscured by a giant red bow tie), and blue shorts. He occasionally attends school in his hometown of Harveyville. Other times he's classmates with Little Dot and Little Lotta in Bonnie Dell.|$|E
50|$|The smaller boys, up to 8-9 years old, {{were given}} a cotton smock, blue serge shorts and strap shoes for {{everyday}} use. For special occasions, they wore Norfolk suits with broad <b>Eton</b> <b>collars,</b> and the same caps as their elders.|$|R
50|$|As {{he arrives}} (still {{trying to learn}} the native {{language}} via recordings), Professor Tibbetts is tricked into sneaking a gin still into the country by Prince M'Bapi, half-brother of Bosambo, chief of the Ochori tribe. The steamer that brings him takes Commissioner Sanders on leave, with Captain Hamilton taking over his duties. Later, Tibbetts {{makes his way to}} Kombooli High, where his students wear <b>Eton</b> <b>collars</b> alongside their native garb. Tibbetts dons a mortarboard and safari shorts due to the heat.|$|R
60|$|The {{hall was}} gaily {{decorated}} with flags and coloured paper, and the eye was further refreshed by {{the spectacle of}} a mixed drove of boys, parents, and what not, the former running a good deal to shiny faces and <b>Eton</b> <b>collars,</b> the latter stressing the black-satin note rather when female, and looking as if their coats were too tight, if male. And presently there was some applause--sporadic, Jeeves has since told me it was--and I saw Gussie being steered by a bearded bloke in a gown to {{a seat in the}} middle of the platform.|$|R
5000|$|The society's motto, quoting Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, 4.13.87, was [...] "What's brave, what's noble, let's do it". This motto {{appeared}} on the logo together with a woodcut likeness of Maidy in an <b>Eton</b> <b>collar.</b> Its rules were [...] "Gentleness, Honour and Love"; and its stated object was [...] "to bind together, with the threefold cord of gentleness, honour and love, children belonging to every sphere of life, so that by kind words and deeds passing betwixt one and the other, more especially from the rich to the poor, a spirit of sympathy and large-heartedness may be encouraged in early life." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hergé created Tintin as an ethnically white Belgian who was {{a native}} of Brussels, aged 14-15 years old. Assouline deemed Tintin to be middle-class, which he {{considered}} one of the few traits that the character had in common with Hergé. In his first appearance, Tintin is dressed in a long travelling coat and hat, a few pages later adopting his familiar plus fours, check suit, black socks, and <b>Eton</b> <b>collar.</b> (Hergé remembers a Canadian student at his college who was teased for wearing plus fours and Argyll socks; certainly an inspiration.) At first, the famous quiff is plastered to Tintin's forehead, but during a particularly vigorous car chase, his quiff is out and remains so. By the time he arrives in Chicago for his third adventure, both Hergé and his readers feel they know Tintin well, and he was to change little in either appearance or dress. Hergé was once asked by interviewer Numa Sadoul how the character Tintin developed; he replied, [...] "He practically did not evolve. Graphically, he remained an outline. Look at his features: his face is a sketch, a formula." [...] This view was echoed by Assouline, who commented that graphically, Tintin was [...] "as uncomplicated as the story line".|$|E
50|$|In the 1890s mortar boards were {{introduced}} but this innovation was soon abandoned. <b>Eton</b> <b>collars</b> were worn until the 1920s {{together with a}} blue cap surmounted by the arms of St Edmund or a bowler hat. For daily use, boys wore a morning suit. In the summer, the uniform consisted of an Oxford grey suit and a boater. Uniform gradually became more casual and, after 1945, a variety of grey suits was recognised uniform, with blazers worn in the summer. In the early years, members of the Douai cricket XI would wear full ties around the waist and half ties from their collars.|$|R
6000|$|For example, {{there were}} numbers of boys {{at my school}} besides myself who took a private {{pleasure}} in poetry; but red-hot iron would not have induced most of us to admit this to the masters, or to repeat poetry with the faintest inflection of rhythm or intelligence. That would have been anti-social egoism; we called it [...] "showing off." [...] I myself remember running to school (an extraordinary thing to do) with mere internal ecstasy in repeating lines of Walter Scott about the taunts of Marmion or the boasts of Roderick Dhu, and then repeating the same lines in class with the colourless decorum of a hurdy-gurdy. We all wished to be invisible in our uniformity; a mere pattern of <b>Eton</b> <b>collars</b> and coats.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1909, Alice, wanting her sons to have an English education, {{accompanied}} them to England and enrolled them in Dunstable Grammar School in Bedfordshire, where Cooper was educated from 1910 to 1912. At Dunstable, Cooper studied Latin and French, and took several courses in English history. While he managed {{to adapt to the}} discipline of an English school and learned the requisite social graces, he never adjusted to the rigid class structure and formal <b>Eton</b> <b>collars</b> he was forced to wear. After completing confirmation classes, Cooper was baptized into the Anglican Church on December 3, 1911, at the Church of All Saints in Houghton Regis. Cooper's mother accompanied her sons back to the United States in August 1912, and Cooper resumed his education at Johnson Grammar School in Helena.|$|R
6000|$|The biographical {{circumstances}} will not, of course, be forgotten. The life of Dickens {{had been}} a curious one. Brought {{up in a family}} just poor enough to be painfully conscious of its prosperity and its respectability, he had been suddenly flung by a financial calamity into a social condition far below his own. For men on that exact edge of the educated class such a transition is really tragic. A duke may become a navvy for a joke, but a clerk cannot become a navvy for a joke. Dickens's parents went to a debtors' prison; Dickens himself went to a far more unpleasant place. The debtors' prison had about it at least that element of amiable compromise and kindly decay which belonged (and belongs still) to all the official institutions of England. But Dickens was doomed to see the very blackest aspect of nineteenth-century England, something far blacker than any mere bad government. He went not to a prison but to a factory. In the musty traditionalism of the Marshalsea old John Dickens could easily remain optimistic. In the ferocious efficiency of the modern factory young Charles Dickens narrowly escaped being a pessimist. He did escape this danger; finally he even escaped the factory itself. His next step in life was, if possible, even more eccentric. He was sent to school; he was sent off like an innocent little boy in <b>Eton</b> <b>collars</b> to learn the rudiments of Latin grammar, without any reference {{to the fact that he}} had already taken his part in the horrible competition and actuality of the age of manufactures. It was like giving a sacked bank manager a satchel and sending him to a dame's school. Nor was the third stage of this career unconnected with the oddity of the others. On leaving the school he was made a clerk in a lawyer's office, as if henceforward this child of ridiculous changes was to settle down into a silent assistant for a quiet solicitor. It was exactly at this moment that his fundamental rebellion began to seethe; it seethed more against the quiet finality of his legal occupation than it had seethed against the squalor and slavery of his days of poverty. There must have been in his mind, I think, a dim feeling: [...] "Did all my dark crises mean only this; was I crucified only that I might become a solicitor's clerk?" [...] Whatever be the truth about this conjecture there can be no question about the facts themselves. It was about this time that he began to burst and bubble over, to insist upon his own intellect, to claim a career. It was about this time that he put together a loose pile of papers, satires on institutions, pictures of private persons, fairy tales of the vulgarity of his world, odds and ends such as come out of the facility and the fierce vanity of youth. It was about this time at any rate that he decided to publish them, and gave them the name of Sketches by Boz.|$|R
