40|$|Abstract — Block {{transmission}} {{systems are}} used for high data rate transmissions over wireless channels. The block structure {{can be obtained by}} inserting <b>guard</b> <b>periods,</b> which are used to avoid inter block interference between the transmitted data blocks. However, these <b>guard</b> <b>periods</b> produce a transmission overhead and therefore reduce the throughput of the transmission system. By using so-called overlapping techniques, a block processing structure can be realized without inserting <b>guard</b> <b>periods.</b> In this paper we will use these techniques for two major processing tasks, the data estimation and the error correction Viterbi decoding. By avoiding the overhead in terms of <b>guard</b> <b>periods</b> and initialization/termination sequences for convolutional coding, the throughput of the system can be increased significantly, while the bit error performance is only slightly decreased. Furthermore the overlapping approaches enable a block-wise parallel implementation of the receiver’s processing tasks.

Hence, the precoder-equalizer pairs obtained can achieve minimal transmit redundancy ISI-free communications for complex-valued signals. This greatly enhances the spectral efficiency for wide-band communications. The proposed algorithm is performed in an iterative basis. Sufficient conditions and convergence analysis of this algorithm are presented. The resultant precoder and equalizer are proved to be a least-square (LS) optimal solution for each other.

As a consequence, guaranteeing bandwidth and allocating bandwidth are both challenging issues. In this paper, we address these difficult issues.
