25|$|Urban areas. Institutional {{arrangements}} for {{water supply and}} sanitation in Indian cities vary greatly. Typically, a state-level agency is in charge of planning and investment, while the local government (Urban Local Bodies) is in charge of operation and maintenance. Some of the largest cities have created municipal water and sanitation utilities that are legally and financially separated from the local government. However, these utilities remain weak in terms of financial capacity. In spite of decentralisation, ULBs remain dependent on capital subsidies from state governments. Tariffs are also set by state governments, which often even subsidise operating costs. Furthermore, when no separate utility exists, there is no separation of accounts for different activities within a municipality. Some states and cities have non-typical institutional arrangements. For example, in Rajasthan the sector is more centralised and the state government is also in charge of operation and maintenance, while in Mumbai the sector is more decentralised and local government is also in charge of planning and investment. In 2012 the Delhi Jal Board contracted out operations and management in three zones of the city to private companies under performance-based contracts to reduce non-revenue water. The Vasant Vihar-Mehrauli zone is operated by SMPL Infrastructure of India, Malviya Nagar by Suez <b>Environnement</b> and the Nangloi zone by Veolia <b>Environnement.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003 the {{municipality}} of Tripoli signed {{the first and}} so far only management contract for water supply in Lebanon. This was done {{after four years of}} preparation that required passing a new law (Law 401) to allow public-private partnerships in water supply. The contract was awarded to the French company Ondéo‐Liban, a subsidiary of Suez <b>Environnement,</b> after a competitive bidding process. The cost of 20 million Euro was financed by the French Development Agency. The contract included the operation, maintenance, and installation of equipment, the organization of the billing system and collection of water tariffs, the management of human and financial resources, and the supervision of the construction of a tertiary water supply network and the expansion of a water treatment plant. The private company increased the billing efficiency from 30% to 60%, reduced water rationing, mapped the network, updated the customer inventory, computerized the accounting system and trained staff. Non-revenue water was reduced from 65% to 45% and the 10-year-long water rationing in the areas of Qalamoun, Qobbe and Abi Samra was eliminated, making Tripoli the only city in Lebanon that receives water 24 hours per day. Water quality and the customer service were also improved. However, cost recovery was not achieved despite an increase in tariffs because bill collection efficiency remained low. The company was unable to introduce metering, although 40,000 meters were acquired. The contract faced a number of challenges: According {{to a study by the}} French Institute for Public-Private Partnerships, the supervisory committee was composed of former employees of the public water company who were not convinced of the usefulness of private sector participation. Despite its achievements, the management contract ended in 2007 without being extended.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the influx}} of {{refugees}} from Kuwait following the latter’s occupation by Iraq in 1990 and due to natural growth, Jordan’s population had increased to more than 3 million by 1990 and 4.8 million by 2000. This further worsened the already precarious water balance. It also led to the overloading of the wastewater treatment plant in As-Samra. The plant was unable to produce the required effluent quality, negatively affecting irrigation in the Jordan Valley. It was thus decided to replace the plant with a more modern technology, involving the private sector. In 2003, a [...] 25-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) contract was signed with a consortium including the French company Suez <b>Environnement.</b> The plant was commissioned in 2006, providing water of a considerably improved quality for irrigation. In terms of cooperation with Syria, in 1987 the two governments had signed a new water-sharing treaty that was more favorable to Syria compared to the 1953 treaty, acknowledging the increased water use for irrigation in the upper basin inside Syria. After much delay, it was decided in 2001 {{to reduce the size}} of the dam on the Yarmouk River compared to the originally planned Maqarin Dam. The dam, called Al-Wehda Dam (Unity Dam), was commissioned in 2011, but yielded much less water than anticipated due to Syrian abstractions upstream.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{disliked the}} German language, and literature, {{explaining}} that German authors [...] "pile parenthesis upon parenthesis, and often you find {{only at the}} end of an entire page the verb on which depends the meaning of the whole sentence". He discarded many baroque era authors as uncreative pedants and especially despised German theatre. Also, Frederick II was mostly indifferent to the revival of German culture in the later part of his reign, as he was unimpressed by the authors of the [...] "Sturm und Drang" [...] movement and remained of essentially classical taste. His main inspiration were ancient philosophers and poets as well as French authors of the 17th century. It should however be noted that interest in foreign cultures was by no means an exception in Germany at that time. The Habsburg court at Vienna was open to influences from Italy, Spain and France. Many German rulers sought to emulate the success of Louis XIV of France and adopted French tastes and manners, though often adapted to the German cultural context. In the case of Frederick II, it might also have been a reaction to the austerity of the familial <b>environnement</b> in which he grew up, as his father had a deep aversion for France and was not interested in the cultural development of his state.|$|E

The paper explores an online collaborative project which uses WebCT, {{one of a number of}} virtual learning environments which supports remote conferencing. Although increasingly communications technologies is used for open and distance learning in both academic and professional domains, this project has a distinctive perspective. It brings together disparate learning communities specifically to explore cultural differences online and to develop new communications skills in the process. The 100 students per year, representing over 70 nationalities, collaborate in small multicultural work teams to produce online reports critiquing culturally sensitive websites. For instance, sites reviewed include those on intercultural communication in the workplace, linguistic differences in foreign professional settings, in online expression and presentation, virtual team working and remote co-operation through negotiation. Along with developing multicultural communication skills, the materials themselves with which the teams engage, help to develop their cultural sensitivity, important in increasingly diverse face-to-face and virtual professional environments. All of these complex skills are vital in developing pro-active networks and building cultural bridges in the future.

Together they created the Joint Venture PT Garuda Dipta Semesta (now called Palyja). Salim, not wanting to confront the President, was at first cautious. But when Lyonnaise des Eaux managed to convince the government to split up the Jakarta concession in two halves, each of which would be awarded without competition to one of the two groups, Salim acquiesced. In 1995 the government issued letters of invitation to Lyonnaise des Eaux and Thames Water International to begin negotiations for concessions.
