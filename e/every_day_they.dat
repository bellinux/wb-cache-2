These fishermen used small boats and returned to shore <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>They</b> developed a system of light salting, washing and drying onshore which became very popular because the fish could remain edible for years.

A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its gleam from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>they</b> sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed.
