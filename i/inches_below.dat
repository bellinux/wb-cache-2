5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a few <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> his elbow. Mitchell can move the tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold and manipulate objects by gripping them in his elbow. He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E

50|$|A post tour officer {{wears the}} {{insignia}} {{on the left}} breast 1/4 <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> {{the top of the}} pocket/flap. If a warfare or qualification insignia is already occupying that position, it is then worn 1/4 <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> that insignia, or on uniforms with pocket flaps, 1/4 <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> the flap. Women in full dress will wear post tour command insignia 1/4 inch above the left pocket, medals or primary breast insignia. Only one post tour command insignia may be worn.|$|R

25|$|From their {{original}} data, Howlett and Majerus (1987) concluded that peppered moths generally rest in unexposed positions, using three main types of site. Firstly, a few <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> a branch-trunk joint {{on a tree}} trunk where the moth is in shadow; secondly, {{on the underside of}} branches and thirdly on foliate twigs. The above data would appear to support this.|$|E
25|$|In most {{passenger}} vehicles where manually adjustable head restraints are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, {{the height of}} the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 <b>inches)</b> <b>below</b> the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.|$|E

50|$|At halftime, NFL {{officials}} {{inspected the}} footballs. Former NFL referee Gerry Austin initially, and incorrectly, stated that 11 of the 12 balls {{used by the}} Patriots were measured to be two pounds per square <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> the minimum amount, but later reports refuted this allegation, citing only a single ball was two pounds per square <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> the minimum, while others were just a few ticks under the minimum.|$|R

25|$|Mosby had {{his closest}} brush with death on December 21, 1864, near Rector's Crossroads in Virginia. While dining {{with a local}} family, Mosby was fired on through a window, and the ball entered his abdomen two <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the navel. He managed to stagger {{into the bedroom and}} hide his coat, which had his only {{insignia}} of rank. The commander of the Union detachment, Maj. Douglas Frazar of the 13th New York Cavalry, entered the house and—not knowing Mosby's identity—inspected the wound and pronounced it mortal. Although left for dead, Mosby recovered and returned to the war effort once again two months later.|$|E
25|$|Ambulances took McCall and Irvin to Waterman Hospital in Eustis. McCall {{was treated}} for a {{concussion}} and facial injuries, and Irvin for his gunshot wounds. At the hospital Irvin met with NAACP lawyers and later told the press that McCall shot him and Shepherd without provocation, as did Yates. In the early 21st century, Gilbert King examined the unredacted FBI files from the case. He wrote in his book published in 2012 that the FBI had located {{a bullet in the}} soil ten <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the blood stain where Irvin had lain wounded, supporting Irvin's claim that Yates fired at him from near point blank range.|$|E
25|$|A {{trial was}} held at the Stirling Spring Circuit Court on 19 April 1823; however, Forrest had absconded and was absent from the hearings. He was assumed to be heading for Paris whilst McNab and Mitchel were held prisoners in the Stirling Tolbooth. The court {{documents}} do not mention Shiels however. The crime had been discovered when the grave of Mary Wotherspoon, who had been buried a week before, had been observed to be a couple of <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the surface. A rope was discovered near the surface and digging down to the coffin revealed it had been broken open and the body removed, however the clothes had been thrown back inside.|$|E

The subdued tab is worn 1/2 <b>inch</b> <b>below</b> the shoulder seam on the left sleeve of utility uniforms, field jackets and the desert battle dress uniform (DBDU). The full color tab is 2⅜ inches (6.03 cm) long, 11/16 inch (1.75 cm) wide, with a 1/8 inch (.32 cm) yellow border and the word [...] "RANGER" [...] inscribed in yellow letters 5/16 inch (.79 cm) high.

25|$|There was a {{clear-cut}} incision on the neck. It was six {{inches in length}} and commenced {{two and a half}} inches in a straight line below the angle of the jaw, one half inch in over an undivided muscle, and then becoming deeper, dividing the sheath. The cut was very clean and deviated only a little downwards. The arteries and other vessels contained in the sheath were all cut through. The cut through the tissues on the right side was more superficial, and tailed off to about two <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the right angle of the jaw. The deep vessels on that side were uninjured. From this it was evident that the hemorrhage was caused through the partial severance of the left cartoid artery.|$|E
25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather outer garment, the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E
25|$|At UFC 48 in June 2004, Sylvia {{returned}} to face Frank Mir for the vacant UFC Heavyweight Championship; he lost. Early {{on in the}} fight Mir trapped Sylvia's right arm in an armbar submission attempt. As Sylvia tried to escape the hold, Sylvia's right radius bone snapped about three <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> his elbow. Referee Herb Dean immediately stopped the fight and declared Sylvia unable to continue. Sylvia took exception to the decision and repeatedly claimed his arm was not broken (though the break could be explicitly seen on the slow-motion replay of the fight), even touching it and moving it around to demonstrate. Sylvia {{was taken to a}} local hospital where an x-ray revealed that his arm was in fact broken; he then took several months off to recuperate. Afterward, Sylvia said he was glad the referee stopped the fight, thereby saving his arm from further damage.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{some other}} places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), {{nearly all the}} rocks near Phoenix are small. For {{about as far as}} the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2–3 meters in {{diameter}} and are bounded by troughs that are 20cm to 50cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the surface {{in the middle of the}} polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8inches deep. When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates. Some dust devils were observed.|$|E
25|$|The French {{artillery}} train having arrived, Colonel James Grant {{proposed that}} the castle should be attacked from the classic direction of the town cemetery where the guns would be nearly level with the fortifications. However, Prince Charles was allegedly afraid that the return fire from the castle would wreck the town of Stirling and therefore opted for an alternative that was offered by the Franco-Scottish engineer Mirabelle de Gordon, who had arrived with Lord John Drummond. Mirablle de Gordon stated that an attack from the little Gowan Hill, which lay hard under the north-eastern side of the castle, which would be totally dominated by whatever cannon the besiegers might choose to fire against it. The bedrock at this location however, was only 15 <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> the surface {{making it difficult for}} the besiegers to throw up effective cover, and the ramparts of the castle on this side were {{at the top of a}} near vertical cliff which would make it impossible even for the agile Highlanders to scale. The Prince accepted Mirabelle de Gordon’s advice and in doing so is probably the tactical mistake that can be most firmly pinned on him.|$|E
25|$|The same report {{noted that}} the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer {{and a lack of}} a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 <b>inches</b> <b>below</b> its {{long-term}} average which is near the record lows of 1964. Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918. In 2012 Lake Michigan-Huron’s seasonal rise was about 4 inches where it usually is about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river {{for longer periods of time}} limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water which is the source of drinking water. Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013 Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days without at least one inch of snowfall. Water levels in the lake started to level off with the river and sewage was visible at the cusp of the locks, just a few hundred feet from Lake Michigan. David St. Pierre, executive director of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago warned the low lake levels were nearing a point of real concern. However, the District maintains that it is not possible for the River to reverse due to low lake level alone.|$|E
