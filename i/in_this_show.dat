500|$|Pinkner {{thought the}} added musical element {{improved}} the episode, {{because it gave}} insights into each of the characters' psyches.

Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's kind of what we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>show,</b> which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>show.</b> And I did!

[...] Series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>show.</b> And it's an amazing thing that we could get people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him".

[...] He continued, [...] "The depiction of Terri in the Family Guy episode on March 21 is not only inaccurate, it seems to take the position that certain people are simply not worthy of receiving medical care because they are viewed as burdens {{on the health care}} system." [...] In addition, Schindler has also stated that he hopes to soon enlist the aid of other advocacy groups to protest the episode, [...] "and perhaps see some sponsors end support of the show."
