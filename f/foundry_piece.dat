50|$|Additionally, a 6.4-inch (100-pounder) Parrott rifle {{which served}} on the Wabash survives in Danvers, Massachusetts. It is a West Point Foundry <b>foundry</b> <b>piece,</b> {{registry}} #116, cast in 1863.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to {{the long}} {{duration}} of the factory's life, and the wide distribution of their works, Saracen <b>Foundry</b> <b>pieces</b> {{can be seen in}} most part of the world. Those of note include: ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results {{obtained}} in a defect detection system for <b>foundry</b> <b>pieces,</b> with an industrial application using ultrasonic transducers. Several processing techniques of the echoes coming from the pieces are analysed {{in order to find}} the most efficient one. To make the system more reliable, furthermore, we have studied the influence of the conditions of the propagation medium when he environment is industrial with a high concentration of impurities in the atmosphere. We have found the effect on the propagation and its influence on the identification of defective pieces. The system has sufficient flexibility to operate in changing atmospheric conditions and it is an attractive alternative in certain production processes...|$|R
50|$|Artifacts of {{all types}} have been {{retained}} and/or discovered on the property. Most of the metal work and the glass work are colonial. Some of the metal work may have been from the family <b>foundry.</b> Various <b>pieces</b> of furniture {{are still in the}} family. Bullets, dishes, dolls, and farming equipment have also been preserved. A cattle type barn was built (and is still maintained) and has provided great insight as to the methods used through the years on the property for farming and animal boarding.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho tem como foco central a investigação de possibilidades de obtenção de peças metálicas, na forma de esculturas, por fundição, com vazamento por gravidade e que tenham como característica formal uma geometria complexa. Na {{interface}} interdisciplinar entre Arte e Engenharia, o estudo aborda a técnica de fundição por cera perdida e suas características, os materiais envolvidos nos processos de construção do modelo e do molde, e a realização prática de peças fundidas. Através do fazer, da aplicação das técnicas de fundição, da construção de um relato de experiências e das reflexões geradas a partir da análise dos resultados, o texto procura estabelecer a viabilidade da aplicação das técnicas de fundição por cera perdida, em atelier de escultura, com propósitos artísticos. The following {{work has}} as its central focus the investigation of possibilities in the attainment of metallic pieces, {{in the form of}} sculptures, through foundry with filling by gravity and a complex geometry as their formal characteristic. In the interdisciplinary interface between Art and Engineering, the study approaches the lost wax foundry technique and its characteristics, as well as the materials involved in the processes of construction of the model and the mold and the practical accomplishment of the <b>foundry</b> <b>pieces.</b> The text attempts to establish the viability of the employment of the foundry techniques of lost wax through the execution, the application of the foundry techniques, the elaboration of a report of experiences and the thoughts generated from the analysis of the results in a sculpture studio with artistic purposes...|$|R
2500|$|The same {{material}} {{of stainless steel}} {{was used for the}} statue of Kiepenkerl. After being rebuilt in the 1950s, the figure of the itinerant trader was replaced by Jeff Koons in 1987 for the decennial Skulptur Projekte exhibition. Standing on a central square in Münster, the statue retained a certain cultural power as a nostalgic symbol of the past. During the production process, the <b>foundry</b> where the <b>piece</b> was being made wanted to knock the ceramic shell off too soon, which resulted in the piece being bent and deformed. Koons decided to bring in a specialist and give the piece [...] "radical plastic surgery." [...] After this experience he felt liberated: [...] "I was now free to work with objects that did not necessarily pre-exist. I could create models." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1855 Haigh Foundry and Brock Mill Forge {{were offered}} for lease. They had {{manufactured}} some of [...] "the largest pumping engines {{and the most}} powerful factory engines in the kingdom" [...] in the previous decade. The iron works, {{on the bank of}} the River Douglas, consisted of a foundry, five cupola furnaces, three air furnaces for making the largest castings and another <b>foundry</b> for smaller <b>pieces.</b> Also on site were blacksmiths' and pattern-makers' shops, office, drawing shop, the foreman's house, boiler yard and iron warehouse. A water wheel driven by the river powered the machinery, line shafts and furnace blasts. The forge was powered by water and steam. Part of the works where spade making was carried out had Naysmyth steam hammers and a rolling mill. Also for lease was the firebrick and tile works which used fire clay from a nearby pit and had a kiln, drying sheds and a steam powered grinding wheels. The manager's house and cottages for workers were part of the lease. A railway line connecting it to the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London and North Western Railways was being built.|$|R
