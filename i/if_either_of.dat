Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
5|$|The club's top scorer in the 1981–82 {{season is}} unknown due to {{insufficient}} data. During that {{season in the}} third division the two top scorers were Bojan Krempl (9) and Milan Žurman (7). However, due to the lost archives it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the players were among goal scorers during the match against Ptuj, played on 4 April 1982 and won by Maribor with the score 5–1.|$|E
5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} <b>if</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older consoles without the ability to save a game, the player can write down an alphanumeric code for these checkpoints and re-enter it when restarting the game later. In any given scene, the game provides no clues {{as to what the}} player should do next, features no HUD except for an oxygen bar during the swimming sequences, and no on-screen text; and the characters the player meets speak in unintelligible alien language.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaii {{football}} team normally receives an automatic bid {{to the game}} unless the team is selected {{to participate in a}} BCS game or is not bowl eligible. <b>If</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> those events happen, the WAC selects its next-highest ranked team to compete in the game. In 2007, Hawaii was selected to play on January 1, 2008 in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia, marking just the second time since the creation of the Hawaii Bowl that Hawaii would not participate. The only previous time that Hawaii failed to make an appearance was in 2005, when the Warriors finished their season with a 5–7 record and were not eligible for a bowl game.|$|E
5|$|The local nurses' {{union for}} the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is on strike. Jeff, {{the husband of}} Deb (Chad Morgan), one of the nurses, collapses while walking the picket line. At the {{emergency}} room, House suspects Jeff's extreme niceness and inability to get angry is a major symptom of an underlying condition. After various tests, the team suspects his niceness is a personality change resulting from syphilis. Kutner (Kal Penn) asks the couple <b>if</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> them had an affair, {{which could lead to}} syphilis. Deb denies it, stating that it is just the way her husband behaves and that it is impossible for her to not love him.|$|E

He had ordered them to perform fellatio on him and then shot them both in the head before taking them to a garage and raping their dead bodies. He had then dumped their bodies near the Ventura Freeway where they were found the next day. Bundy was uneasy upon hearing this news and phoned the police, admitting to having some knowledge of the murders, but she refused to provide any clues as to Clark's identity.

[...] The first day of shooting had to take place outside the subway station, so all outside scenes were shot first. As a result, the final scenes of the film were shot on the first day. Among those scenes were Pembleton leaving the subway in a daze following Lange's death; Yoshimura deeply regretted that {{this was one of the}} first scenes shot because he felt that the performance would have been more moving if Braugher had some previous dramatic interaction with D'Onofrio.|$|E
500|$|Jerry, having reached {{tropical}} storm strength [...] {{east of the}} coast of Florida, moved to the northwest and hit Jupiter later on August 23.

It remained over waters briefly until moving inland in Dixie County on August 25. It continued slowly northward, entering Georgia on August 26. The weak depression turned to the east, and dissipated into a trough of low pressure on August 28 near the Georgia/South Carolina border. The trough developed two circulation centers, one of which moved eastward while the other moved southward. The latter drifted southwestward across Florida until dissipating in early September. It is unknown <b>if</b> <b>either</b> <b>of</b> the circulations {{are directly related to}} the original center of Jerry.|$|E
