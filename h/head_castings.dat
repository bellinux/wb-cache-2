50|$|The new 110 engine {{embodies the}} same {{advanced}} principles of high-speed, two-cycle design as the 71 series, of {{which more than}} 45,000,000 horsepower have been produced by Detroit Diesel since 1937. The horsepower rating of 275 at 1800 r.p.m. is attained with a b.m.e.p. of 92 pounds per square inch. Bore is 5 inches and stroke, 5.6 inches. Features include blower scavenging with a new and highly efficient gear-driven centrifugal blower furnishing considerably more air for the cylinders than is needed for combustion. GM unit injectors (one for each cylinder) pump, meter and atomize the fuel, and are easily removed for inspection or exchange. Cylinder block and <b>head</b> are one-piece <b>castings,</b> both being symmetrical about a vertical plane between the No. 3 and 4 cylinders. This symmetry allows the cylinder head and block to be reversed, giving a choice of rotational directions and making possible a variety of accessory locations to suit installation requirements.|$|R
2500|$|Numerous early {{improvements}} {{were aimed}} at increasing reliability and life, including a switch from the [...] "U" [...] shaped top (exhaust) well to a [...] "V" [...] shaped top well. This eliminated the cast top deck, which had {{been the source of}} some early-life failures, in favor of a top deck fabricated from plate steel."Much field difficulty was experienced, particularly in the weld of the stress plate to the cast steel top deck. This difficulty can be blamed on two things. First, we were attempting to weld to cast steel which in some cases contained burned-in sand. This made welding inadequate due to slag inclusions, etc. Second, we were attempting to automatically weld against a back-up strip which in some cases did not fuse properly, leaving a bad notch effect which, of course, increased stress beyond working limits and fatigue failures resulted. There were approximately 600 of these crankcases made, twelve of which were 16s. Only four of these twelve were placed in railroad service. They were retired after about three years of service. A retirement program is now in effect for all of these cast top deck crankcases. A new crankcase was developed and went into production in early 1940 using a fabricated top deck, and can be most readily identified by a change in the exhaust well of the engine, which lies between the V's from U shape to a V shape. This design simplified top deck machining, eliminated the studding of the cast top deck by replacing the studs with through bolts retained by crabs {{at the bottom of the}} pots and crabs at the top of the cylinder heads, using self-aligning spherical washers and nuts (See Figure 49)." [...] The 567 gave way to the 567A in 1941, which incorporated further top deck improvements and camshaft gear train changes."By 1941 it was desirable to further simplify the crankcase, and the flat top deck Model 567 A crankcase was developed. This crankcase was first used on the 12 cylinder LST engines which started in production early in 1942. The crankcase incorporated a flat tie plate the full length of the engine which provided a flat surface for mounting exhaust manifolds and lift hooks (See Figure 50)."It was at this time that the gear train was simplified from four to two idler gears as explained previously. The cast steel cylinder head retainers were simplified over the second 567 design." [...] The 567B followed in 1946 with minor improvements."In 1946 a new line of crankcases, designated as the 567B, were introduced which were basically the same as the 567A except for a change to permit the mounting of the auxiliary generator drive gear. About three or four months after the introduction of the [...] "B" [...] engine the cylinder <b>head</b> retainer <b>castings,</b> which had been a continuous source of production problems, were replaced with steel forgings." [...] The 567C was released to further improve reliability and manufacturability. Visually, the 567C may be distinguished from earlier models by the presence of round (instead of square) handholes."We are in the final stages of developing a new crankcase to be known as the Model 567C which will further improve our product. One premise of this design has been to eliminate water on any stressed member of the crankcase because of corrosion difficulties. In the earlier crankcases just described, cracks have occurred in the area of the cooling water which were caused by corrosion fatigue (See Fig. 52). [...] "The entire fabrication has been simplified through the use of heavy rolled sections to make up the main stress members. Complex forgings are used in the top deck in place of the many steel stampings, thereby reducing a tremendous amount of fitting and manual welding." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{front-mounted}} OHV air-cooled boxer motor of only 1688 cc had an advertised {{output of}} just 30 hp (22 kW).

50|$|With {{demand for}} the Austin-Healey 3000 still strong and {{development}} of {{what would become the}} Austin 3-Litre underway BMC carried out a thorough redesign of the C-Series with the aim of improving the power output and reducing both the engine's weight and its overall size. The engine was reworked to carry seven main bearings, steel ancillary castings were swapped for aluminium alloy ones where possible and the main block and cylinder <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> were redesigned to have slightly smaller external dimensions while retaining the same cylinder capacity of 2,912cc. The manifolds were altered for more efficient 'breathing', especially at high engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|Restricted to one, 4-cylinder, {{overhead}} cam, production-based automotive engine. Maximum displacement 2.8 liter (170.75 cid). Engine swaps permitted; engine must be from same manufacturer as body (For example, Rover K-series engine into Austin Mini or Austin 1100 or Citroën Saxo engine into Citroën 2CV). Redundant power adders, {{such as a}} {{dual stage}} nitrous system or twin turbos, will be counted as one power adder. All engine block and cylinder <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> must be, or have been, available in a production car or truck from a recognized OEM assembly line with a minimum production run of 5,000 units. Transverse orientation may be converted to longitudinal orientation.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the re-spacing of the {{cylinder}} bores, {{the cylinder}} <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> remained unchanged. As a result, the centrelines of the combustion chambers {{in the head}} no longer aligned precisely with the centrelines of the cylinders but this did not matter greatly as the combustion chamber diameters in the head were smaller than the cylinder diameters. The 3.8 and 4.2-litre cylinder heads and cams are therefore interchangeable. The 4.2-litre engine from the factory had unsmoothed steps between the inlet manifold and head, and the manifold gaskets were not a good match for the inlet ports. These engines therefore make excellent bases for some modification, achieving approx. [...] SAE net and increased torque merely by [...] "flowing" [...] the head.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being Holden's mainstream performance engine throughout its production run, {{it was also a}} popular powerplant for kit cars and specials as well as for motorsport in Holden's efforts in the Australian Touring Car Championship and the Bathurst 1000 until 1995.

50|$|The VG {{engine family}} {{consists}} of V6 piston engines designed and produced by Nissan for several {{vehicles in the}} Nissan lineup. The VG series started in 1983 becoming Japan's first mass-produced V6 engine. VG engines displace between 2.0 L and 3.3 L and feature an iron block and aluminum heads. The early VG engines featured a SOHC arrangement with 2 valves per cylinder. A later revision featured a slightly different block, and a DOHC arrangement which utilized 4 valves per cylinder and Nissan's own version of variable valve timing for a smoother idle and more torque at low to medium engine speeds. The block features a single piece main bearing cap. The production blocks and production <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> were used successfully in the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90 race cars which won the IMSA GT Championship {{three years in a}} row.|$|E

5000|$|Produced from 1968-1980, the Rocket 350 {{was entirely}} {{different}} from the other GM divisions' 350's. It used a 4.057 in bore and Oldsmobile small-block standard 3.385 in stroke for 350 CID L. Output ranged from 160-325 hp (119-242 kW). 1968-1974 350s were painted gold; 1975-1976 350s were metallic blue like the 455; 1977-1980 models were painted GM Corporate Blue. The [...] "Rocket" [...] name disappeared from the air cleaner decal in 1975, the same year that the catalytic converter was added to the emission control systems. The early Oldsmobile 350s made from 1968-1976 are more desirable engines with heavy castings, beefier crankshafts, and better flowing heads. The later 1977-1980 350 had the [...] "lightweight" [...] castings, including a thinner block with large [...] "windows" [...] in the main bearing bulkheads, crack-prone <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> which were actually manufactured by Pontiac Motor Division (castings are marked [...] "PMD"; these heads were also used on the 260), and a lightened crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, {{the engine}} {{continued}} in production from 1982 up to April 2000 {{for use in}} the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups. Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic fuel injection designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation - now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria's engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from [...] to [...] of the standard 3.0 version, and [...] for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to fuel economy. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders [...]040 of an inch or 1mm to 94.6mm and a new crankshaft with a stroke of 80.0mm giving a displacement of 3375cc, this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced [...] and 260 Nm. All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with 29 mm venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, {{to make way for the}} production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, [...]250" [...] smaller crank journals which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift,larger 43mm inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford's Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> with extra oil galleries, solid pushrods with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> also being unique to the 3.4 litre engine and an improved inlet manifold with larger runners and an improved plenum chamber. From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.|$|E
50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC was the DOHC {{variant of}} the FE. The {{official}} Mazda engine codes are FE-DE and FE-ZE, depending on output level. It is still commonly called the FE3 because of its <b>head</b> <b>castings.</b> The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square 86 mm bore × stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold-coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations, however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Despite this, the FE-DOHC is already built for turbo with large forged connecting rods, large journal dimensions, oil cooler, piston oilers, web-stiffened block with main girdles (and braceplate where equipped). This robust engine design is a favourite of tuners who are aware of its capability because it already has a high-power capacity perfect for custom turbo jobs. As much as 600 whp has been seen on a stock engine. The common FE-DOHC crankshaft is cast while the forged crankshaft is fitted to the aluminum sump engines with both the main bearing braces and the main bearing girdle plate. In European 10.0:1 compression, non-catalytic trim, the FE-DOHC produces 148 ps (108 kW) at 6000 rpm and 133 lb/ft (182 Nm) at 4000 rpm. The 9.2:1 compression, catalytic converter version produces 140 ps. The Japanese domestic market variants produce anywhere between 145 ps and 165 ps. The only vehicle with 165ps was the 96-97 Capellas Wagons, FX (MT or AT) or FX Cruising (Only exists in AT). They had different tail lights to the earlier wagons.|$|E
50|$|The Ford GT {{version of}} the 5.4 L is a highly {{specialized}} {{version of the}} Modular engine. It is an all-aluminum, dry-sump 5.4 L 4-valve DOHC with a Lysholm screw-type supercharger and showcases numerous technological features, such as dual fuel injectors per cylinder and oil squirters for the piston skirts, not found in other Ford Modular engines of the time. The GT 5.4 L benefits from an improved version of the high-flow 2000 Cobra R cylinder head and unique high-lift camshafts. The GT is rated at 550 hp (410 kW) and 500 lb·ft (678 N·m).The Shelby GT500 uses a 4-valve DOHC 5.4 L with an Eaton M122H Roots type supercharger and air-to-liquid intercooler. The GT500 5.4 L shares its high-flow cylinder <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> with the Ford GT, with only minor machining differences, and shares camshafts with the 2003 - 2004 Ford Mustang SVT Cobra; which have less lift and duration than the Ford GT camshafts. The 2007-2010 GT500 engine used an iron engine block, while the 2011 GT500 5.4 L receives a new aluminum engine block, with Ford's first production application of their patented Plasma Transferred Wire Arc (PTWA) cylinder coating, {{eliminating the need for}} pressed in cylinder liners. The PTWA spray apparatus was co-developed by Ford and Flame-Spray Industries of Long Island, New York, for which they received the 2009 IPO National Inventors of the Year Award. The 2011 GT500 engine weighs 102 lb. less than the previous iron-block version, {{thanks in part to the}} lack of cast iron cylinder liners. All of the 5.4 L 4-valve engines destined for use in SVT vehicles, such as the Ford GT and Shelby GT500, have been hand-built by technicians at Ford's Romeo, Michigan plant.|$|E
50|$|The 351W {{is often}} {{confused}} with the 351 Cleveland, which is a different engine of identical displacement.The 351 cuin L Windsor featured a 1.3 in (32.5 mm) taller deck height than the 302, allowing a stroke of 3.5 in (88.9 mm). Although very much related in general configuration to the 289-302 and sharing the same bell housing, motor mounts, and other small parts, the 351W had a unique, tall-deck block, larger main bearing caps, thicker, longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable 'noise' of the consecutive firing adjacent front cylinders to the more rigid rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some 25 lb (11 kg) to the engine's dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, so as to accommodate a larger oil pump shaft and larger oil pump. Some years had threaded dipstick tubes. It had a unique head which optimized torque over high-rpm breathing, frequently replaced by enthusiasts with aftermarket heads providing better performance. The early 1969 and 1970 heads had larger valves and ports for better performance. The <b>head</b> <b>castings</b> and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969-1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for 302, 1/2 inch for 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on bearing saddles 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings. Generally, the 1969 to 1974 blocks {{are considered to be}} far superior in strength than the later blocks, making these early units some of the strongest and most desirable in the entire SBF engine family including the 335-series. During the 1980s, a four-barrel version (intake manifold casting ID E6TE-9425-B) was reintroduced for use in light trucks and vans. In 1988, fuel injection replaced the four-barrel carburetor. Roller camshaft/lifters were introduced in this engine in 1994.|$|E
