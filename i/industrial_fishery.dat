50|$|Three broad {{categories}} of fishing in Denmark are <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery,</b> fishery {{for human consumption}} (also known as pelagic fishing), and demersal fishery. Industrial fishing is for industrial use of producing fish oil and fish meal. Initially, Industrial fishing using trawlers began in the 1940s with herring fishing in the North Sea. Over time, other fish species included sand eel, Norway pout, blue whiting and sprat (sprat in Skagerrak/Kattegat and in the Baltic Sea). By 1993, the percentage of sand eel was about 70%, when the total industrial fish catch was 1.2 million tons. However, in terms of cash value, cod fish was a better catch. This type of fishing is also found to be overall remunerative as it contributes to 27% in financial value from 77% of catch.|$|E

While local economies were devastated, the overall impact to the national economies was minor. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism. The impact on coastal fishing communities and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of income earners as well as boats and fishing gear. In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is {{an important source of}} fish for local markets; <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery</b> is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings.

40|$|Yellowfin tuna may sustain an <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery</b> indefinitely if {{managed by}} {{conventional}} models, but northern cod perhaps cannot. This {{may be a}} generality for tropical and cold-water fish. In their core habitat, yellowfin spawn continuously, year-round and from an early age, while northern cod mature only at middle-age and spawn only during a brief season. The resulting natural age structure of each species is well-adapted to the characteristic recruitment variability imposed by its habitat. Industrial fisheries managed by stock assessment models seem unavoidably to modify the age structure of cod so that very few spawning year-classes remain, though this {{does not seem to}} happen in yellowfin managed in a similar way. It is axiomatic that the natural age structure is that best fitted to the long-term survival of any species, and this fact implies that cold-water species exploited by an <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery</b> may be unable to sustain a viable population across periods when environmental stress is strong and recruitment weak: population collapses of cod and other cold-water fish under industria...|$|E
40|$|The present catch {{reconstruction}} for 1950 - 2005 {{refers to}} the three main fisheries operating {{in the waters of}} the Mauritanian Excusive Economic Zone (EEZ) : the artisanal fishery, the demersal <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery</b> and the pelagic <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery.</b> This reconstruction is based on all information available, including data coming from the national surveys system of the Institut Mauritanien de Recherches Océanographiques et des Pêches (IMROP) and from assessment working groups regularly held in the country since 1985. Additionally, approximate estimates of the unreported catch and by-catch of the two industrial fisheries are proposed, and the catches of the national Mauritanian fisheries were estimated. Here, we provide the first picture of long term catch trends by the various fisheries. The demersal fisheries, overwhelmingly dominated by the industrial sector, developed in the 1960 s, while artisanal fisheries remained under-developed until the 1990 s, followed by a very rapid increase. In the context of rapidly increasing fishing effort, landings were estimated around 160, 000 t·year- 1 over the last 40 years (including 40, 000 to 70, 000 t of unreported by-catch). While total landings remained rather stable, the composition in term of taxa significantly changed since the 1970 s, suggesting severe overexploitation and the harvest of an increasingly wider range of ecosystem compartments.

40|$|The lesser sandeel, Ammodytes marinus, {{is a key}} {{food for}} many seabirds and seals, and is also {{the target of the}} largest single-species fishery in the North Sea. Despite claims that sandeel fishing has harmed {{dependent}} predator populations, census data show that most seabirds and grey seals increased in numbers as the fishery grew and reached peak harvest. Generally high breeding success of black-legged kittiwakes at North Sea colonies also suggests that sandeel abundance has remained good for breeding seabirds at the broad scale, though local and small-scale effects of sandeel fishing should not be overlooked. VPA and CPUE data suggest that abundance increased as the fishery grew. A negative correlation between sandeel recruitment and total stock size preceding spawning suggests that there is now resource competition (bottom-up control). Bioenergetics modelling indicates that predatory fish take far more sandeel than taken by the <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery</b> or wildlife. Effects of decreases in predatory fish stocks have been greater than increases in the take by seabirds and seals and by the fishery. Thus, overall, there {{appears to have been a}} reduction in mortality during the last 30 years. Changes in predatory fish abundances, especially mackerel and whiting, may influence sandeel stocks more than changes in <b>industrial</b> <b>fishery,</b> at least at the scale of the North Sea as a whole. These interactions imply that seabird and seal food supply in terms of sandeel may be strongly dependent on decisions regarding management of stocks of mackerel and gadoids. The overwhelming influence of predation on "food-fish" by predatory fish may be a feature of many marine food webs worldwide, where "fishing down the food web" has occurred, and this has clear management implications if wildlife and fisheries are to coexist...|$|E

This paper examines and analyzes the problems relating to management of the conch fishery and speculates on its future. The main problems are overfishing by licensed fishers who take more than permitted, and serious poaching by industrial vessels mainly from Honduras, which exploit poor high seas enforcement by Jamaican authorities. For nearly two years the official fishery was closed due to legal issues. During closures, considerable foreign poaching occurred.
