25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} she had trouble convincing {{executives}} at Columbia Records to release the album. The singer recounted that it almost was not released: [...] "In 2003, I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> solo album. But when I played it through for my record label, they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right, I had five. [...] "Dangerously in Love", [...] "Naughty Girl", [...] "Me, Myself and I", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love"." [...] Since [...] "Dilemma" [...] was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100, Beyoncé's management released, [...] "Work It Out", one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in Goldmember, instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former.|$|E
500|$|... "Schoolin' Life" [...] is an uptempo R and funk song, which {{contains}} elements of disco and dance-pop. Built on a 1980s-inspired beat, the song's instrumentation includes old school synthesizers, 1980s-sounding drum kits wailing electric guitars, and horns. Music critics, including Jamie Peck of MTV noted that [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] {{was inspired by}} the prime work of Prince, particularly because of its lyrical content, the instruments used, and Knowles' style of singing on it. Lyrically, the song finds Knowles detailing her experiences as she was growing up. In the first verse, she employs guttural vocals to address many life lessons to [...] "20-somethings", [...] "30-somethings", [...] "40-somethings", and [...] "50-somethings". Knowles warns them against some consequences, affirming [...] "time really moves fast" [...] and that growing up fast will leave them wanting more. Knowles also talks about still excelling in a world where parents try to shield everything, [...] "Mom and dad tried to hide the world / Said the world's just too big for a little girl / Eyes wide open can't you see / I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> heels by the age of 13".|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{am quite}} {{composed}} again; I claim your promise. Examine me here. I must and will <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> look at Oscar in this room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dear," [...] Gavin {{answered}} resolutely, [...] "and now is {{the time}} for me to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> and last talk with him. Remain here, Babbie. Do not move till I come back." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the race, Alonso {{described}} the win as [...] "..a dream come true. I am 22 {{years old and}} I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> victory. I hope I have a long career with lots more victories". Jean Todt, the Ferrari team's manager, referred to their performance as [...] "disappointing".|$|R
500|$|The song is {{predominantly}} upbeat, featuring Bieber's R vocals over a backdrop containing a dance infused beat, full of keyboard and [...] "disco string" [...] synths. The song is composed {{in the key}} of E♭ major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of G3 to the high-note of C5. According to Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone, the song [...] "blends winks at Fifties doo-wop with hip-hop chants", comparing the style and the lyrics [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time/And I was like/Baby, baby, baby, ooooh/I thought you'd always be mine" [...] to fifties [...] ballads like [...] "Tears on My Pillow", [...] "Why Do Fools Fall in Love" [...] and [...] "Earth Angel". Lyrically, Bieber's lines explain his distress over his lost love, and promise to get it back, featured in lines like, [...] "And I wanna play it cool/But I'm losin' you…/I'm in pieces/So come and fix me…". The chorus features the distinct and repetitive [...] "baby, baby, baby, ohhhh (nooooo)" [...] hook. After the second verse, Ludacris comes in with the verse-rap, an anecdote of young love when he was thirteen, as it runs [...] "When I was 13/I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> love/She had me going crazy/Oh, I was star-struck/She woke me up daily/Don't need no Starbucks…".|$|E
2500|$|Steven D. Cuozzo {{was born}} on January 17, 1950, in Ocean Hill, Brooklyn, New York. [...] He and his brother, Joseph G. Cuozzo, were {{children}} of Lillian (February 19, 1922 - April 1970) and Joseph A. Cuozzo (November 14, 1916 [...] November 29, 1996), a Brooklyn electrical parts factory worker, and lived at 137 Hull St. In describing {{growing up in the}} Italian-Irish neighborhood of Ocean Hill near the J/Z line over Broadway, restaurant critic Cuozzo noted in 2009, [...] "I recall stoop sitting with neighbors and a happy blur of maternal grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins living in the building next door. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> pizza at a joint I recall as Jimmy's, on a corner lost to time a few blocks from home. The place boasted one big window, and the pies were a sublime fusion of gooey cheese and fragrant thyme, an herb I much prefer to oregano." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, with {{no prior}} {{modelling}} experience, Hurley was introduced as an Estée Lauder spokesmodel. She later recounted, [...] "I {{was far from}} an ingénue, having <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> modelling job at 29." [...] Hurley has since featured in ads for Lauder's 'Pleasures', 'Beautiful', 'Dazzling', 'Tuscany per Donna', and 'Sensuous' fragrances as well as participated in campaigns for the company's other cosmetics. She was replaced as the face of Estée Lauder by Carolyn Murphy in 2001. However, she continues {{to work with the}} company non-exclusively, signing a contract for the 16th year with Lauder in 2010. In 2005, she modelled for Saloni, Liverpool Department Stores of Mexico, and Lancel. She was part of the seasonal advertising campaigns for Jordache, Shiatzy Chen, Got Milk?, Patrick Cox, MQ Clothiers of Sweden, and Lancel in 2006 and Monsoon in 2007. In 2008, Hurley was unveiled as the seasonal campaign face for Blackglama mink. [...] Hurley has appeared three times on the cover of British Vogue. She is signed to TESS Management in London.|$|E

6000|$|By {{this turn}} I came {{necessarily}} on to Stratford, where I set out. And thus <b>having</b> finished <b>my</b> <b>first</b> circuit, I conclude <b>my</b> <b>first</b> letter, and am, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you know}} what I thought? I thought I would part company as soon as I could. I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> command all to myself. I wasn't going to sail in a {{squadron}} if there were a chance for independent cruising. I would make land by myself. I would beat the other boats. Youth! All youth! The silly, charming, beautiful youth.|$|R
60|$|When he was {{introduced}} I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> opportunity of admiring Leonora's extraordinary knowledge of native customs and etiquette.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a dozen, Francisco. It is owing to you {{we have taken}} these prisoners, and that I have <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> bit of {{excitement}} since I came out here.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{can hardly}} say,' I answered. 'Still, I {{should be able}} to think back. I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> sore throat this year the night I saw Mr. Irving at the Lyceum, and that was on my wife's birthday, the 3d of October. How long ago is that?' ...|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. I <b>had</b> scored <b>my</b> <b>first</b> point! For {{the first}} time, the smith wasn't up and ready. The company noticed it. Good effect.|$|R
5000|$|Dean was {{referenced}} in {{the classic}} TV sitcom The Honeymooners by the character Ed Norton, who justified mooching a second dinner off of Ralph Kramden by saying, [...] "Just like Dizzy Dean warms up in the bull pen before a game, I warm up by <b>having</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> dinner." [...] Later in the scene, when tensions rise, Kramden quips [...] "Shut up, Dizzy Dean, and eat your spaghetti!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Maureen Nicol, {{one such}} housewife, {{wrote a letter}} to the editor in {{response}} saying: “Since <b>having</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> baby I <b>have</b> been constantly surprised how women seem to go into voluntary exile in the home once they leave their outside work… Perhaps housebound wives with liberal interests and a desire to remain individuals could form a national register so that whenever one moves, one could contact like-minded friends.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{would teach}} him?" [...] he cried. [...] "Where could I leave him?" [...] he asked, with {{a drop in}} his voice; and I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of genuine despair. [...] "He steals, you know, alas! Par ta Madonne! I believe he would put poison in your food and mine--the viper!" ...|$|E
60|$|From here I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> view of {{the village}} of caves. A low bluff ran diagonally across {{one end of the}} mesa, and {{in the face of this}} bluff were the mouths of many caves. Zig-zag trails led up to them, and narrow ledges scooped from the face of the soft rock {{connected}} those upon the same level.|$|E
60|$|So {{we passed}} it by, and rode under the very walls {{by way of}} an avenue of {{flowering}} chestnuts, round to the northern side, until we emerged suddenly upon the sands of Po, and I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> view at close quarters of that mighty river flowing gently about the islands, all thick with willows, that seemed to float upon its gleaming waters.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, the Universal Press Syndicate {{approached}} {{me and asked}} if we could work together. That came {{at just the right}} time, as I was starting a more serious day job, and I was about to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> baby. I just didn't have the time and energy to devote to the selling of the strip. I decided that whatever job they did would be better than whatever I could put forth at that time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Worse and worse, Mike! Evidently, the {{governor}} is determined {{to get rid of}} all whose evidence might throw any light on this matter. After what has happened here, and these summary executions, I feel very uncomfortable as to Colonel Mendez. Will you go to the artillery barracks with a message from me that, as I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> report to write out, I shall not continue the investigations today? Take Pierre with you again." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{no sooner}} heard her name, but I {{was ready to}} swoon away, but I ordered the footman to call Isabel, and ask the gentlewoman to walk up with her into my dressing-room; which he {{immediately}} did, and there I went to <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> interview with her. She kissed me for joy when she saw me, and I sent Isabel downstairs, for I was in pain till I had some private conversation with my old confidante.|$|R
60|$|Monna Giuliana and I would linger {{together}} in talk after the painter had gone; {{and this would}} be at about the time that I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> lessons of Curial life from my Lord Gambara. You will remember that he mentioned Boccaccio to me, and I chanced to ask her was there in the library a copy of that author's tales.|$|E
60|$|I {{recall that}} when this sample came to me by express, I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> and only {{conviction}} that my financial worries were over. Even Zulime was impressed with my brother's smelter reports which gave the proportion of gold to the ton, precisely set down in bold black figures. All {{we had to do}} was to ship a sufficient number of car lots for the year and our income would rival that of Carnegie's.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{acted like}} a little man about it," [...] he {{reported}} to Ludlow. [...] "She'll do. When a girl can take a blow like that the way she does, she makes you wish that more fellows were girls. When I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> picture refused, it laid me up. But I'm {{not going to let}} this thing rest. I'm going to see if that picture can't be got into the American Artists'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{blooming}} fear of that, my boy. I'm {{going to}} <b>have</b> <b>my</b> fling <b>first</b> {{and see a}} bit {{of life and the}} world before I put my head in the sack--if I ever do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he continued, [...] "I am less to {{you than}} your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till I <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one's good looks, {{whatever}} they may be, one loses everything. Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth {{is the only thing}} worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Dear, I {{had just}} folded up your parcel for Miss Alexander {{that my brother}} George should take it to-morrow. It <b>has</b> been <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{opportunity}} for England--at least, for London. But now I will carry it back to you....|$|R
6000|$|That {{was the way}} of it, anyhow. I drank deep of {{talk that}} day; we went into theology, into philosophy; I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of {{socialism}}. I felt as though I had been silent in a silence since I and he had parted. At the thought of socialism Ewart's moods changed for a time {{to a sort of}} energy. [...] "After all, all this confounded vagueness might be altered. If you could get men to work together..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could only}} share the joke with some one!" [...] she thought. [...] "But I can't. Diana {{is the only}} one I'd want to tell, and, even if I hadn't sworn secrecy to Jane, I can't tell Diana things now. She tells {{everything}} to Fred--I know she does. Well, I've <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> proposal. I supposed it would come some day--but I certainly never thought it would be by proxy. It's awfully funny--and yet there's a sting in it, too, somehow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{tell you}} I did everything. I was a waitress, {{and a very}} bad one. I broke plates. I muddled orders. Finally I was very rude to a {{customer}} and I went on to try something else. I forget what came next. I {{think it was the}} stage. I travelled for a year with a touring company. That was hard work, too, but I liked it. After that came dressmaking, which was harder and which I hated. And then I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> stroke of real luck.' ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2001, when Missouri Democrats {{lined up}} against John Ashcroft to oppose his {{nomination}} for U.S. Attorney General, Danforth's name was invoked. Former U.S. Senator Tom Eagleton {{reacted to the}} nomination by saying: [...] "John Danforth would <b>have</b> been <b>my</b> <b>first</b> choice. John Ashcroft would <b>have</b> been <b>my</b> last choice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2002, {{he joined}} other Missouri Democrats {{to oppose the}} {{nomination}} of former governor and senator John Ashcroft for United States Attorney General.

5000|$|When Acey Slade {{was asked}} [...] Who {{is the best}} guitarist in rock right now? He replied: Andy McCoy. Period. When Dave Grohl met Andy McCoy he said [...] "I <b>have</b> met <b>my</b> <b>first</b> Rockstar." [...] That's a pretty good reason.|$|R
