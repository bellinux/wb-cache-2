Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>question</b> the assumption that smooth jazz is an unfortunate and unwelcomed evolutionary outcome of the jazz-fusion era. Instead, I argue that smooth jazz is a long-lived musical style that merits multi-disciplinary analyses of its origins, critical dialogues, performance practice, and reception.|$|E

These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages.

2500|$|Before {{the direct}} {{confrontation}} between Mackenzie’s rebels and Bond Head’s militia forces on December 7, there were various encounters between both sides {{which resulted in}} small skirmishes. [...] On December 4, Mackenzie and some fellow rebels encountered Alderman John Powell (Canadian politician) and Archibald McDonald when riding down Yonge Street to scout the city. Upon meeting them, Mackenzie took both men prisoner {{and sent them to}} Montgomery’s Tavern. Although there were concerns over whether Powell and McDonald possessed arms, Mackenzie accepted their denials and said, “well, gentlemen, as you are my townsmen, and men of honor, I would be ashamed to show that <b>I</b> <b>question</b> your words by ordering you to be searched.” Despite such assurances, Powell had hidden a pistol and shot rebel Captain Anthony Anderson before escaping back to Toronto, thereby dealing a large blow to the rebel’s military expertise.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the poet}} implores [...] "Sweet love" [...] (1) {{to conquer the}} lust that is ruining his union with the young man. This {{analysis}} of the sonnet relies upon two assumptions: 1) the young man is the poet's lover and 2) that when the poet refers to [...] "sad interim" [...] (9), he {{does not mean that}} the young man is away from London, but that he is separated from him emotionally - i.e., they are in a [...] "period of estrangement" [...] from one another due to the young man's promiscuity. Thus the poet is [...] "whipping up the young man's flagging affection. Behind lines 9-12 flickers a reminiscence of the situation of Hero and Leander" [...] (Rowse 115). The situation becomes even more clear when we read Sonnet 57, in which the poet, now very worried about the young man's lustful nature, asks him outright, [...] "Being your slave, what should I do but tend/Upon the hours and times of your desire?... dare <b>I</b> <b>question</b> with my jealous thought/Where you may be" [...] (1-2/9-10).|$|E

I did not, nor do <b>I,</b> <b>question</b> Barack Obama's patriotism... I {{did not say that}} Barack Obama is anti-American nor do I believe that Barack Obama is anti-American... I'm very concerned about Barack Obama's views. I don't believe that socialism is a good thing for America." [...] However, in March 2010, Bachmann said, [...] "I said I had very serious concerns that Barack Obama had anti-American views—and now I look like Nostradamus" [...] while speaking at a fund-raiser for the Susan B. Anthony List. A year later, in March 2011, Bachmann was asked on Meet the Press if she still believed that Obama held un-American views.

2500|$|Shakespeare's Sonnet 57, {{shows that}} [...] "his {{love for the}} fair youth is seen as pure and even heavenly…" [...] but in other sonnets he {{introduces}} new characters, one in particular the Dark Lady, [...] "his association with the dark lady leads to infection and madness of love". [...] He also uses a terminology about his love and how beautiful it appears, but when this love is being directed {{to a young man}} this might appear out of the norm at this time. In the line [...] "Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you" [...] the word [...] "sovereign" [...] implies that the youth is held at a higher degree and [...] "watch the clock for you" [...] implies that he will wait for something to happen because of the youth's age or because he is waiting for the youth to recognise his love. [...] The line [...] "nor dare <b>I</b> <b>question</b> with my jealous thought" [...] implies that he has considered that jealously will raise doubts in his head and might drive his love to madness. [...] That this could end up driving the poet to insanity is suggested in this line, [...] "but, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought." [...] The Speaker is referring to himself as the slave again and is diminishing himself by implying no one would love so low and asking the fair youth to clear his mind of all thoughts of him. [...] Although he is comparing himself to a slave, the poet's love has never once subsided. [...] The last two lines saying [...] "so true a fool is love, that in your will, though you do anything, he thinks no ill." [...] The word [...] "will" [...] could be seen as desire or possibly used as a pun on his name, Will. [...] Since he thinks no ill, he is admitting that his love for the youth has made him a fool: [...] "Ultimately Shakespeare provides space for the homoerotic but must eventually return to the perpetuating systems of heterosexual love". This critique states that Shakespeare's sonnets must seen as a continuation of love sonnets that play with different ideas of love. Love could imply economic interest or patronage. Another way of viewing the poet's intent could be a sexual or erotic attraction (as the critic Rudd emphasises) or a brotherly or platonic affection.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, critics {{focused on}} the {{technique}} of the poem and how {{it relates to the}} meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight claimed that [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] "needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition." [...] Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: [...] "The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great" [...] and that Coleridge's words [...] "convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse". Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, [...] "I sometimes think we overwork Coleridge's idea of 'the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.' I have to come back to it here, however, for the particular flavor of [...] "Kubla Khan", with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the 'reconciliation' does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of 'oscillation' itself." [...] Continuing, she claimed, [...] "The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation's very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning". She then concluded: [...] "Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the 'dream,' and the air of mysterious meaning of [...] "Kubla Khan". <b>I</b> <b>question</b> whether this effect was all deliberately [...] out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject ... What remains is the spirit of 'oscillation,' perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author." [...] Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: [...] "'Kubla Khan' the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult." [...] In responding to House, Beer claimed, [...] "That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type." ...|$|E
