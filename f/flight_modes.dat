5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, having been delayed two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive <b>flight</b> <b>modes</b> for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E

50|$|The 26th squadron, the {{operational}} battalion of the regiment, whose motto is “Numquam Periculum Sine Periclo Vincitur” (No danger {{can ever be}} overcome without risk), can perform several tasks, detaching Special Operations Air Task Units -SOATU- to conduct Special Air Operations supporting the other Italian Special Operations Forces units, in accordance to the NATO SOF doctrine. The SOATUs are therefore capable to conduct operational missions on short notice, in multiple environments, at day/night, in most weather conditions, opting for discreet, covert, or low prominence <b>flight</b> <b>modes,</b> with a time-on-target within +/- 1 minute.|$|E
50|$|Kamov {{designers}} {{believed that}} combining {{the duties of}} flying, navigation, target detection, and tracking could be automated {{to a degree that}} a single crew member could perform all functions. Further, it was not expected that this would cause an excessive psychological and physical strain on the pilot. By the late seventies, the sophistication level of the Soviet helicopter industry ensured the building of such automatic systems was possible; even the Ka-25 and Ka-27 featured an automatic submarine search capability, automatic navigation and <b>flight</b> <b>modes,</b> automatic data exchange among the helicopters operating in the same flight, etc. A single-person crew would provide the benefits of weight reduction, better flight performance, reduce training costs and reduce the number of possible combat casualties.|$|E
50|$|The SC.1 has {{its origins}} within a {{submission}} by Short Brothers {{to meet a}} Ministry of Supply (MoS) request for tender (ER.143T) for a vertical take-off research aircraft, which had been issued in September 1953. On 15 October 1954, the proposed design was accepted by the ministry and a contract was promptly placed {{for a pair of}} aircraft to conform with the requirements of Specification ER.143D. As envisioned, the aircraft was to be used for a series of flight tests to investigate its behaviour during the transition between vertical and horizontal <b>flight</b> <b>modes,</b> to determine the optimum and minimum level of assistance required from the auto-stabiliser during the transition process, to uncover likely operational issues, and to develop related support aids and equipment for the pilot to develop an all-weather approach and landing system.|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} {{performance of}} two exhaust system concepts applicable to single-engine short-take-off and vertical-landing tactical fighter configurations was investigated. These concepts involved blocking (or partially blocking) tailpipe {{flow to the}} rear (cruise) nozzle and diverting it through an opening to a ventral nozzle exit for vertical thrust. A set of variable angle vanes at the ventral nozzle exit were used to vary ventral nozzle thrust angle between 45 and 110 deg relative to the positive axial force direction. In the vertical <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> the rear nozzle (or tailpipe flow to it) was completely blocked. In the transition <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> flow in the tailpipe was split between the rear and ventral nozzles and the flow was vectored at both exits for aircraft control purposes through this flight regime. In the cruise <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> the ventral nozzle was sealed and all flow exited through the rear nozzle...|$|R

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 7 September, El Mundo suggested that during the flight preparation and takeoff attempts, the aircraft had some of its systems in <b>flight</b> <b>mode</b> rather than ground mode. If true, this might explain why de-icing of the Total Air Temperature probe activated on the ground, causing overheating, since in flight the heater would activate only {{when there was no}} air flow in the probe, a sign of icing. This might also explain why the flaps and slats alarm had not sounded, since this alarm is disabled in <b>flight</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|The aerial vehicle {{combines}} {{static and}} dynamic lift, mirror or symmetric rotation <b>flight</b> <b>modes</b> and consequently uses functions commonly known from Balloon (aeronautics), Airplanes and Helicopters. It has a gas cell and two wings with a symmetric profile {{which can be}} twisted by 180° and one Electric motor {{at the end of}} each wing. As usual with balloons, the static lift vector (buoyant gas) and the vector of payload with batteries are positioned opposed to each other. The cell does not resemble a cigar form but rather reminds of a rotation-symmetric Frisbee disc. The vectors of the carried components - unlike with airships - are not distributed over the total length of the body between prow, cabin and stern. Opposed to this hybrid universal aircraft shows high potentials to more efficient sustainable flight missions and therefore applications with longer abidance in the air.|$|E
50|$|On 2 September 2009, at an IDF {{exhibition}} {{held at the}} 3rd Latrun annual land warfare conference, the Israeli Defense Force {{unveiled a}} new member of the Spike family of missiles - the Mini Spike Anti-personnel guided weapon (APGW). Rafael claimed that this latest member of the Spike family of missile costs and weighed {{only a third of}} the Spike-LR at 4 kg, while offering a longer engagement range of 1.3-1.5 km when compared to the Spike-SR. It was to introduce new <b>flight</b> <b>modes</b> to enable precision strikes in urban areas, such as flying through an open windows or attacking a enemy hidden behind defilade or obstacles using non-line-of-sight engagement. Mini Spike would use the same launcher and sight system of the Spike-LR, loading the missile on a special adaptor. Eventually, by 2016 Mini-Spike development had been discontinued.|$|E
