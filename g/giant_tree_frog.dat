25|$|Australia and New Guinea are the {{two major}} land masses which make up the Australian continent. During its history, {{there have been many}} land {{connections}} between New Guinea and Australia. The most recent of which severed 10,000 years ago during the transition from a glacial period to the current interglacial period. The result of this recent land connection on the Australian amphibian fauna has been the swapping of species, and even families. The origin of the frog species found on both land masses can be determined by their distributions. It is likely that White's Tree Frog (Litoria caerulea) migrated from Australia to New Guinea, as it is widespread in Australia and only inhabits small areas within New Guinea. Whereas the <b>Giant</b> <b>Tree</b> <b>Frog</b> (Litoria infrafrenata) is likely from New Guinea, as it is widespread in New Guinea, and only inhabits the Cape York Peninsula in Australia. The single Nyctimystes species in Australia is another example of genus swapping that occurred between New Guinea and Australia.|$|E

60|$|The {{town had}} begun the tepid round of its nightly diversions. A few leisurely dandies, clad in white duck, with flowing neckties, and {{swinging}} slim bamboo canes, threaded the grassy by-ways toward the houses of their favoured señoritas. Those who wooed the art of music dragged tirelessly at whining concertinas, or fingered lugubrious guitars at doors and windows. An occasional soldier from the cuartel, with flapping straw hat, without coat or shoes, hurried by, balancing his long gun like a lance in one hand. From every density of the foliage the <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> sounded their loud and irritating clatter. Further out, where the by-ways perished at the brink of the jungle, the guttural cries of marauding baboons and the coughing of the alligators in the black estuaries fractured the vain silence of the wood.|$|R

50|$|The Australian green <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> simply green <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> in Australia, White's <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> or dumpy <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Litoria caerulea) is {{a species}} of <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> native to Australia and New Guinea, with {{introduced}} populations in the United States and New Zealand, though the latter {{is believed to have}} died out. The species belongs to the genus Litoria. It is morphologically similar to some other members of the genus, particularly the magnificent <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. splendida) and the white-lipped <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. infrafrenata).|$|R
50|$|Magnificent {{tree frogs}} are {{native to the}} Kimberley region of Western Australia, and enter caves and rock crevices during the day. Much like the other large tree frogs in Australia, White's tree frog and the <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> they inhabit areas near humans, {{and can be found}} around {{buildings}} and in toilets, showers, and water tanks. They are nocturnal, and will hunt and breed at night.|$|E
50|$|The species {{within the}} genus Litoria are {{extremely}} variable in appearance, behaviour, and habitat. The smallest species is the javelin frog (L. microbelos), reaching a maximum length of 1.6 cm, while the largest, the <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. infrafrenata), reaches a size of 13.5-14.0 cm. The appearance, behaviour, and habitat of each frog is usually linked. The small, darkly coloured frogs are generally terrestrial, and never, or infrequently, climb. The larger, green species are usually arboreal and some only venture {{to the ground}} to breed.|$|E
50|$|This frog {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the magnificent tree frog (L. splendida), which inhabits only north-western Australia. Older members of that species have very large parotoid glands, which cover the entire top of their heads and droop over their tympana. The parotoid gland of the green tree frog is much smaller, and it also lacks the yellow speckling {{on the back and}} the yellow markings on the hand, groin and thigh. It can be distinguished from the <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. infrafrenata) by the distinct white stripe that that species has {{along the edge of the}} lower jaw and extending to the shoulder, which is not present in the green tree frog.The tadpoles' appearance changes throughout their development. When newly hatched, they are 8 mm long and when fully developed, 44 mm. They are initially mottled with brown, and increase in pigmentation (to either green or brown) during development. Their underside is initially dark but later becomes lighter in hue. The eggs are brown and are wrapped in a clear jelly; they are 1.1 to 1.4 mm in diameter.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{frogs and toads}} inhabit the islands, {{including}} the well known huge marine or cane toad (Rhinella marina) locally known as the crapaud (pronounced crah-poh) on both islands, and the tiny colourful rare endemic species known as the El Tucuche golden tree frog (Phytotriades auratus) found only in the giant epiphitic bromeliads at the mist-shrouded summits of Trinidad's two highest peaks. The strangest of all Trinidad's frogs is the highly aquatic Suriname toad or pipa toad (Pipa pipa), the tadpoles of which develop in the skin tissue of the mother's back, before bursting out and emerging as miniature replicas of the adult frogs. The <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Hypsiboas boans) known locally as the giant flying frog is commonly heard calling after dusk from the vegetation along forest-lined streams in Trinidad. The two frog species of the genus Mannophryne found diurnally active in forests along fast flowing mountain streams (one of which is endemic to Trinidad and the other endemic to Tobago) both demonstrate a degree of parental care as the tadpoles are transported {{on the backs of}} the adult males before a suitable fairly predator-free body of water is found where they may be left to develop. The relatively recently introduced Grenadian 'tink' frog (Eleutherodactylus johnstonei) can be heard at night in loud metallic 'tinking' choruses in urban residential neighbourhood yards and parks from Diego Martin to Sangre Grande in Trinidad, and more recently in southwestern Tobago. The tungara frog or locally called the pung-la-la (Engystomops pustulosus) is commonly heard at night calling from wet grassy ditches in open habitats in both urban and rural areas on both islands and their foam nests are found even in small road and trail side puddles during the rainy season. The southwestern peninsula of Trinidad is home to a rather diverse community of frogs, with at least one (Leptodactylus nesiotus) being known only from that area (an endemic). Trinidad may also be home to a caecilian (Typhlonectes species) (a legless highly aquatic amphibian with an eel-like body that is rarely observed due to its habitat specifications) although only one specimen has ever been scientifically documented from Trinidad.|$|E

40|$|The {{granular}} dorsal glands of the <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> Litoria infrafrenata contain five peptides including caerulein (a known neuropeptide), {{and four}} new peptides named frenatins 1 (MH+ = 1140 Da), 2 (1423), 3 (2180) and 4 (2493).

40|$|The {{definitive}} version may {{be found}} at www. wiley. comThe peptide frenatin 3 is {{a major component of}} the skin secretion of the Australian <b>giant</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> Litoria infrafrenata. Frenatin 3 is 22 amino acids in length, and shows neither antimicrobial nor anticancer activity. It inhibits the production of nitric oxide by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase at a micromolar concentration by binding to its regulatory protein, Ca 2 + calmodulin, a protein known to recognize and bind amphipathic alpha-helices. The solution structure of frenatin 3 has been investigated using NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. In trifluoroethanol/water mixtures, the peptide forms an amphipathic alpha-helix over residues 1 - 14 while the C-terminal eight residues are more flexible and less structured. The flexible region may be responsible for the lack of antimicrobial activity. In water, frenatin 3 exhibits some alpha-helical character in its N-terminal region. Craig S. Brinkworth, John A. Carver, Kate L. Wegener, Jason Doyle, Lyndon E. Llewellyn and John H. Bowi...|$|E
