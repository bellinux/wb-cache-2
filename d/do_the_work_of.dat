25|$|Christian {{theology}} and political thinking {{until after the}} Enlightenment considered treason and blasphemy as synonymous, as it challenged {{both the state and}} the will of God.

25|$|Ammonia {{from plants}} built during World War II to make {{explosives}} became available for making fertilizers, {{leading to a}} permanent decline in real fertilizer prices. The early 1950s was the peak period for tractor sales in the U.S. as the few remaining horses and mules were phased out. The horsepower of farm machinery underwent a large expansion. A successful cotton picking machine was introduced in 1949. The machine could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> 50 men picking by hand.|$|E
25|$|The first {{farmers of}} Stratford {{resided in the}} village and went out to their farms, located one to three miles away, to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the farm. The Nichols and White Plains areas were the first to be {{cultivated}} and settled within the present-day bounds of Trumbull, due to the fertile soil, spring-fed ponds and natural meadows found there and their proximity to the main village located less than three miles away. In the mid-seventeenth century in the Colony of Connecticut, it was very common for freemen to establish a farm or several farms in the fertile upland or countryside while maintaining a substantial townhouse in the village or even back in England.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's Coppley Apparel Group {{is doing}} {{something}} rare in the Canadian clothing industry - adding jobs. The company plans to expand its employment by almost 200 jobs - about 30 per cent - starting with 50 additional jobs this year in 2007. Coppley's growth burst will bring its workforce to about 750 people, {{the majority of them}} in Hamilton. The new jobs follow exploding sales growth as the company uses computer-aided custom tailoring of suits that give struggling retailers a much-needed cash-flow boost. Coppley, which has been a fixture in downtown Hamilton for more than 150 years, pioneered a method of using a computer, a grid and a digital camera to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a master tailor, producing made-to-measure suits in as few as seven days - work that used to take six weeks.|$|E
25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting bit at the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> trimming.|$|E
25|$|Although the PSP/PLA and LCP/Popular Guard {{joined forces}} with Amal in {{defeating}} the Al-Mourabitoun, they remained militarily neutral {{in the fight against}} the PLO. Despite prodding from Syria, these political parties and their respective militias contributed nothing more than verbally expressing support for Amal and demanding that Arafat step down. The PSP/PLA even allowed the PLO to station their artillery on Druze-controlled areas. This left Amal to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> dislodging the Arafat loyalists, with some help from Syria's anti-Arafat Palestinian allies, such as As-Sa'iqa, PFLP-GC and Fatah al-Intifada. The alliance between Amal and most of the pro-Syrian Palestinian groups eventually soured however, and clashes would later break out between them. While some dissident Palestinian commanders such as Ahmed Jibril and Abu Musa still supported Amal against the PLO, many anti-Arafat fighters battled Amal in defense of the camps.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, Whitelands College, {{while they}} were based in Chelsea, {{commissioned}} Morris & Co. to make stained glass for their first chapel. This was moved with the college to Putney in 1930. In 2006, the stained glass was moved to Parkstead House. This commissioning of the work happened {{through the efforts of}} John Ruskin. In 1883, he wrote to Edward Burne-Jones, on behalf of the college, asking for him and William Morris to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> <b>Of</b> the fifteen windows the college received from Morris & Co., twelve were designed by Burne-Jones, and three he made with Morris. Burne-Jones used some of designs he had previously created for the windows showing saints Agnes, Celia, Catherine, Dorothy and Margaret. All of the others were made specifically for the college. In 1886, the reredos behind the altar in the chapel was installed. Although it was designed by William Morris, it was built by Kate Faulkner, sister of Charles Faulkner.|$|E
500|$|The Sabor has {{convened in}} Zagreb since the 13th century, {{but there was}} no special {{building}} for this until the 18th century. Previously, sessions of the Sabor had been held in private houses, in royal estates in Gradec and at the bishop's residence. During the Croatian-Ottoman Wars, which severely disrupted the functioning of the Croatian kingdom, the Sabor's sessions became so impractical that the 1685 session decided to have the ban appoint a six-member committee to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Sabor when sessions were not possible. This body became operational in 1689 and had its mandate extended through the entire 18th and into the 19th century. This [...] consisted of the ban, two high clerics and three or four noblemen, and it would bring forward numerous acts; it met in various places, usually Zagreb or Varaždin, but also in Čiče, Ludbreg, Kerestinec, Vienna, Želin, Bratislava, Klenovnik, Slunj, Glina, Petrinja, Rasinja, Ptuj and Budim.|$|E
500|$|The act {{authorizing the}} gold dollar and double eagle precipitated {{conflict}} at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] There the officers, including Chief Coiner Franklin Peale, were mostly {{the friends and}} relations of Director Patterson. [...] The outsider in their midst was Chief Engraver James B. Longacre, successor to Gobrecht (who had died in 1844). [...] A former copper-plate engraver, Longacre had been appointed through the political influence of South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. [...] Patterson despised Calhoun, and Longacre became a loner at the mint. [...] Most of Peale's formal duties were performed by his predecessor, Adam Eckfeldt, who continued to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> chief coiner despite his retirement. Peale spent the resulting free time running a private medal business taking commissions from the public and using the government's facilities, including its Contamin portrait lathe. [...] This machine, used in Peale's medal work, was needed to reduce models of new designs to coin-sized reductions from which working dies could be made. So long as no new coin designs were needed, dies could be reproduced mechanically, without using the Contamin device. Although it belonged to his department, Longacre {{did not use the}} Contamin lathe much until Congress ordered that the two new coins be struck.|$|E
50|$|Eurystheus {{discounted}} {{the success}} of this labour because the rushing waters had <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> cleaning <b>the</b> stables and because Heracles was paid. Stating that Heracles still had seven labours to do, Eurystheus then sent Heracles to defeat the Stymphalian Birds.|$|R
50|$|Another analogy {{sometimes}} cited {{is based}} upon Revelation chapter 3, in which Christ states that he stands {{at the door and}} knocks, and if anyone opens he will enter in. Arminians assert that Christ comes to each person with prevenient grace, and if they are willing for him to enter, he enters them. Therefore, no one <b>does</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>work</b> <b>of</b> saving themselves, because Christ <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> coming to them in the first place, and if they are willing to follow him, he <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> entering in, but whether he does so is dependent upon the will of the person (no one, however, could will for him to enter if He did not first knock).|$|R

500|$|The {{offensive}} got underway at 10:10 in the morning. Major Alois Lindmayr Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) of I./KG 76 led {{the entire}} formation. Lindmayr was an experienced combat veteran having won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his effective low-level attacks in France. III./Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) {{took off with}} 19 Do 17s from their base at Cormeilles-en-Vexin. At the same time, [...] to the north, I./KG 76 took off. Usually a Gruppe (Group) could field 27 bombers. After weeks of attrition, I./KG 76 could put up only eight Do 17s. The Geschwader had to field two Gruppen to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> one. Most of the Dorniers were in bad shape, worn down by intensive operations. The two groups rendezvoused at Amiens then proceeded to Cap Gris Nez {{to pick up their}} Bf 109 fighter escort. The attacks on Britain had caused heavy losses to the Luftwaffe, German crews and Geschwader experimented with innovative ways to defend themselves. One pilot, Feldwebel Rolf Heitsch, had his Dornier fitted with an infantry flame thrower in its tail. If it failed to down a fighter that got too close, it might drive the enemy off: if it worked, it could be fitted to other bombers. After take-off the formation broke up in cloud and was delayed for 10 minutes to allow reforming. Two bombers failed to do and returned to base.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{dogs for}} herding sheep makes good {{economic}} sense for many farmers.
