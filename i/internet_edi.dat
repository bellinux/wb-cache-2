40|$|In {{traditional}} business environments, many intercompany processes (such as {{buying and}} billing) are performed using paper documents, such as purchase orders and invoices. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) allows companies to exchange these documents in a structured and computer-processable format. This helps to automate and streamline business by eliminating or simplifying clerical tasks, speeding information transfer, reducing data errors, and eliminating business processes. Although EDI {{has been successfully}} employed in specific industries (such as retail) and in some large enterprises, {{it has not been}} widely adopted. The primary barriers to widespread acceptance of EDI are the costs of implementation and the costs of communication, which is frequently done using Value-Added Networks (VANs). These costs are generally too high for companies that do not conduct large numbers of EDI transactions.

40|$|For {{many large}} retail {{companies}} with many suppliers, the utopian vision of total paperless trading offered by traditional Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), with its attendant efficiencies, {{has not been}} realized. Many small, but operationally important suppliers, lack enthusiasm for traditional EDI because it is expensive, complicated and they stand to gain little from it. This non-compliance prevents the large organization from realizing {{some of the most}} significant tactical benefits of EDI such as advanced supply chain reforms. This paper presents a case study of a large retail organization which is approaching this problem by integrating Internet based EDI with its existing traditional EDI systems using an “intelligent gateway ” concept. This will allow them to leverage their considerable existing EDI investment by providing a relatively low cost data display and entry system tailored to the needs of small suppliers. In this way, greater benefits should accrue from existing investment as 100 % EDI compliance eliminates duplication, but more importantly, enables advanced supply chain reforms such as “cross docking”. We argue that this way of using the newly available <b>Internet</b> <b>EDI</b> products may have the greatest economic impact on the retailing supply chain at least in the near future...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. The Gartner Group (1996 c: 1) has {{recognised}} {{that the}} Internet has grown substantially since its inception. Recently, companies are "Internet enabling" their applications (The Gartner Group, 1997 : 1) {{and they are}} increasingly using the Internet to initiate transactions (The Gartner Group, 1996 b: 16). The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants requires that an auditor should assess the control environment for each material class of transactions (SAICA, SAAS 400. 18). Therefore the auditor {{may be required to}} review an Internet ordering system where this is the source of material sales transactions. With the increasing sophistication of computerised systems, computer auditors are being forced to treat computer systems as the target of their audits (Watne and Turne, 1994 : 14). The literature survey conducted did not reveal a suitable risk model which may be applied to Internet ordering systems. Therefore the objective of the research was to develop such a risk model. The research identified the technology involved in Internet ordering systems. A detailed literature review of these components was performed. Thereafter, the research defined risk and selected a risk model appropriate to Internet ordering systems. Risk was defined in relation to control objectives for computer systems, as defined by Watne and Turne (1990 : 308 - 309), and the risk model selected was the Access Model and the Path Context Model developed by Boshoff (1985, 1990). Four layers in the "access path" of an Internet ordering system were selected for review, namely the HTML electronic form, HTTP, TCP/IP and CGI scripts. Risk factors identified varied according to the layers in the access path of an Internet ordering system. In the HTML layer, risk was influenced by the design elements of the electronic form. At the HTTP level, message header fields and server HTTP response codes impacted on risk. TCP/IP was also found to have header fields which affected risk. Finally, CGI scripts were found to be different to the other layers. Risk factors at this level were found to be very dependent on the actual CGI scripts implemented. The short dissertation opened additional areas for research. Of the three types of <b>Internet</b> <b>EDI</b> systems identified by The Gartner Group (1996 b: 4), only one was selected for research in this short dissertation. Clearly, opportunity exists for similar research to be conducted on the other <b>Internet</b> <b>EDI</b> implementations. Another area opened for research was the evaluation of risk in system-specific CGI scripts. In conclusion, growth of electronic commerce on the Internet is being hampered by debate over taxation of goods and services sold over the Internet and by US government concerns over the exporting of encryption techniques (The Gartner Group, 1997 b: 1). However it appears that successful resolution of these issues is on the horizon (The Gartner Group, 1997 b: 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Electronic Data Interchange {{has been}} in use from the early 1960 s and has evolved over the last 50 years to include <b>Internet</b> <b>EDI.</b> Even though EDI has a long history, it {{is still very much}} in use today by major US and European {{automotive}} industry and the energy, healthcare, retail and manufacturing sectors. This is in spite of competing options from electronic procurement to enterprise resource systems. The main reason for its longevity is because it’s standards-based and its reliability has been proven through many years of commercial use. EDI has many benefits to offer its adopters. Notwithstanding this, businesses which adopt EDI has other imperatives to base their decisions. EDI has diffused from its early days in the United States, Europe and Japan {{to other parts of the}} world including South East Asia. Businesses which have to succeed in today’s competitive world have to resort to technology to improve their supply chain management. One of the dominant technologies which these businesses have to consider today is electronic data interchange. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) has been used mainly in the shipping and logistics industry in Malaysia through the mandatory government initiated SMK-Dagang*Net for over a decade. In the non-mandatory category, EDI has been adopted by banks in Malaysia, the bigger Malaysian-based retailers as well as manufacturers in Malaysia. Until today EDI is still not widely diffused to other businesses in Malaysia. This study is exploratory in nature and has two major objectives. The first objective is to determine the function, diversity and breadth of EDI usage in Malaysian manufacturing companies. The second objective is to identify the significant factors that influence EDI adoption decisions. The motivation for the first objective is that there is a lack of current information on EDI use in manufacturing companies. The motivation for the second objective is to provide insight into why companies adopt or do not adopt electronic data interchange.

We are monitoring the state of EDI usage in Denmark based on VANS, direct proprietary connections, and TCP/IP-based networks to evaluate the governmental actions within the area of EDI.

Moreover, forcing a specific communication technology upon all business partners is neither intended nor realistic in practice. At the same time, existing business document exchanges frequently only implement B 2 Bi scenarios partly. This paper focuses on a method for composing existing and new business document exchanges without replacing com-munication technology already in use. First, ebXML BPSS is proposed for describing the choreography of business document exchanges in a technology agnostic way. Second, ebXML CPPA is used to define messaging characteristics at the level of ebBP BusinessTransactions. Third, an integration architecture for performing ebXML BPSS choreographies using BPEL processes that execute each integration part-ner’s message exchanges is proposed. These BPEL processes assume Web service wrappers for reusing the functionality of messaging systems that are responsible for performing the actual business document exchanges and for providing sufficient status information to the caller.

40|$|In {{this article}} we theorize about the design of {{information}} infrastructures (II). We define an II as a shared, evolving, heterogeneous installed base of IT capabilities based on open and standardized interfaces. Such IIs, when appropriated by a community of users offer a shared resource for delivering and using information services in a (set of) community. Iis include complex socio-technical ensembles like the <b>Internet</b> or <b>EDI</b> networks. Increased integration of enterprise systems like ERP or CRM systems has produced similar features for intra-organizational systems. Our theorizing addresses the following challenge in designing information infrastructures: how to tackle their inherent complexity, scale and functional uncertainty? These systems are large, complex and heterogeneous. They never die and evolve {{over long periods of}} time while they adapt to needs unknown during design time. New infrastructures are designed as extensions to or improvements of existing ones in contrast to green field design. The installed base of the existing infrastructure and its scope and complexity influence how the new infrastructure can be designed. Infrastructure design needs to focus on installed base growth and flexibility as to avoid technological traps (lock-ins). These goals are achieved by enacting design principles of immediate usefulness, simplicity, utilization of existing installed base and modularization as shown by our analysis of the design of Internet and an II for health care in Norway. ...|$|R

40|$|Clearance of {{commercial}} import consignments {{can be arranged}} by an appointed Customs broker (agent) or by the owner. Private importers who wish to clear their own goods should contact the nearest Customs Service offi ce for advice on requirements and operating hours. ISSN 1175 - 396 X Why do I need a Customs clearance for imported goods? All imported goods arriving in New Zealand are {{required by law to}} be cleared through the New Zealand Customs Service. Imported goods are subject to security requirements and the payment of import duty and GST charges. Customs undertakes security screening and collects revenue charges on behalf of the New Zealand Government. What is a Customs clearance? A Customs import clearance refers to the procedure where the importer of the goods is required to lodge an electronic declaration (import entry) covering the particulars of their imported goods, the payment of any revenue charges due and subsequent formal release of those goods by Customs. What is the procedure for clearing commercial import consignments? An electronic entry must be lodged, either over the Internet at www. customsentry. govt. nz, or using EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) software. In some cases, importers may also be asked to provide additional information such as: • An airwaybill or bill of lading. • Invoices. • Other documents, such as packing lists, or insurance certificates. Importers may also need to contact shipping companies, airlines or freight forwarders for advice on their requirements, operating hours and/or location of the goods. How do I lodge a Customs import entry? Import entries may be lodged over the <b>Internet</b> or via <b>EDI.</b> Many importers use their freight forwarder or a Customs broker to lodge import clearances on their behalf, as they generally already have EDI software, and are familiar with Customs legal requirements. Using EDI EDI users are required to: • Develop or purchase EDI software which contains features necessary to transmit clearance messages and receive responses. • Test proper functionality with Customs prior to use. • Pay for the EDI link and associated messaging costs. Thus EDI is generally more suitable for higher-frequency users.
