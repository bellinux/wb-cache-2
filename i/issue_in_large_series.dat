40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite the {{significant}} survival benefit associated with successful reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction, global indices of outcome left ventricular function, such as ejection fraction, have often demonstrated {{little or no}} improvement. Although these measurements are confounded by numerous clinical, physiologic, and angiographic variables, no comprehensive analysis of this <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>series</b> of patients is available. We used the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-I) database to better understand this phenomenon by determining independent predictors of left ventricular function and their interplay with regard to outcome ventricular function and improvement in function during the initial postinfarction week. METHODS: Ninety-minute and 5 - to 7 -day posttreatment global and regional indices derived from left ventriculograms were analyzed from a population of 676 patients. These observations were combined with clinical data to describe independent determinants of ventricular function outcome. RESULTS: Clinical factors predictive of global and regional ventricular function as well as improvement in function between 90 minutes and 5 to 7 days included time to treatment, early infarct-related artery flow grade, and body mass index. These same factors contribute significantly to compensatory hyperkinesis of the noninfarct zone, which is critical to maintenance of global ventricular function during this time period. CONCLUSIONS: The ventricular function benefits of early complete reperfusion after myocardial infarction are readily demonstrable after adjustment for multiple covariables and include (1) maintenance of global ventricular function and (2) prevention or delay in ventricular dilatation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that patients with the DD genotype of the angiotensin I–converting enzyme (ACE) gene who are treated with ACE inhibitors are at {{a higher risk of}} restenosis after coronary stent placement than patients who do not receive ACE inhibitors. BackgroundTwo recent studies with a limited series of patients carrying the DD genotype suggested an unfavorable impact of the use of ACE inhibitors on the restenotic process after implantation of stents in coronary arteries. Because these findings may question the use of ACE inhibitors after coronary stenting, we examined this important <b>issue</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>series</b> of patients. MethodsWe determined the ACE gene I/D genotype of 2, 222 consecutive patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease who underwent stent implantation. The patients with the DD genotype (n = 612) constituted the study population. The primary end point was in-stent restenosis, which was assessed as angiographic restenosis (≥ 50 % diameter stenosis at six-month follow-up) and clinical restenosis (need for target vessel revascularization due to symptoms or signs of ischemia in the presence of angiographic restenosis over one year after the intervention). ResultsOf the 612 patients with the DD genotype, 403 (65. 8 %) were treated with ACE inhibitors and 209 (34. 2 %) did not receive ACE inhibitors. The angiographic and clinical restenosis rates were not significantly different between the group treated with ACE inhibitors and the group not receiving ACE inhibitors (p = 0. 55). Continuous measures of restenosis, minimal lumen diameter, diameter stenosis, late lumen loss, and loss index were also similar in both groups (p ≥ 0. 55). In addition, one-year survival free of myocardial infarction was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0. 27). ConclusionsIn contrast to previous reports, our study provides evidence that patients carrying the DD genotype are not exposed to an increased risk of restenosis after stent placement when treated with ACE inhibitors...|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{limitation of}} this study is the limited number of bodies studied, which {{can be explained by the}} low incidence of the disease and low autopsy rate in The Netherlands. Due to this small number of patients, it is possible that by chance we selected two patients in which many abnormalities were not seen on CT scans, while <b>in</b> <b>larger</b> <b>series</b> of patients this would not have been the case. Therefore, our findings need confirmation <b>in</b> a <b>larger</b> <b>series</b> of patients. Nevertheless, the findings in our patients during autopsy are comparable to those described in the literature. Furthermore, we did not study the eyes of the patients. However, most of the ocular findings in PXE (peau d’orange, angioid streaks, chorioretinal atrophies) can already be diagnosed in living patients using a variety of diagnostic techniques [20]. It is doubtful whether CT, with a relatively low resolution for a small organ such as the eye, can contribute to these diagnoses.|$|R
