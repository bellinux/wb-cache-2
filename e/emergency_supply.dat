5|$|Outside of Ormoc City, 159people {{were killed}} across Leyte and Negros Occidental. Throughout the country, at least 5,081people {{lost their lives}} while another 1,9413,084were missing and presumed dead. This made Thelma the deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Philippine history, surpassing a storm in 1867 that killed 1,800, until later surpassed by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 which killed at least 6,300people. A total of 4,446homes were destroyed while another 22,229were damaged. Total losses amounted to $27.67million. Initially, it took over 24hours for word of the disaster to reach officials due to a crippled communication network around Ormoc City. Within a few days, <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> centers were established and aid from various agencies under the United Nations and several countries flowed into the country. A total of $5.8million worth of grants and materials was provided collectively in the international relief effort.|$|E

The goal is to ensure a fast and effective response when the disaster strikes. Pre-positioning of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> is a strategic decision aimed at determining the number and location of local distribution centers as well as their inventory levels for <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies.</b> These decisions must be made in a highly disruption-prone environment where a timely response is vital and resources are scarce. We present and discuss a scenario-based model that integrates location, inventory and routing decisions...|$|R

25|$|A {{bailout bottle}} (BoB) or bailout {{cylinder}} is a scuba cylinder carried by an underwater diver {{for use as}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> of breathing gas {{in the event of}} a primary gas supply failure. A bailout cylinder may be carried by a scuba diver in addition to the primary scuba set, or by a surface supplied diver using either free-flow or demand systems. The bailout gas is not intended for use during the dive except in an emergency. The term may be used to refer to just the cylinder, or the bailout set or emergency gas supply (EGS), which is the cylinder with the gas delivery system attached.|$|E
25|$|Hematin (trade name Panhematin) and heme arginate (trade name NormoSang) are {{the drugs}} {{of choice in}} acute porphyria, in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. These drugs need to be given very early in an attack to be effective; {{effectiveness}} varies amongst individuals. They are not curative drugs but can shorten attacks and reduce the intensity of an attack. Side effects are rare but can be serious. These heme-like substances theoretically inhibit ALA synthase and hence the accumulation of toxic precursors. In the United Kingdom, supplies of NormoSang are kept at two national centers; <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> is available from St Thomas's Hospital, London. In the United States, Lundbeck manufactures and supplies Panhematin for infusion.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem, as an {{extension}} of Vehicle Routing Problem, is an important subject in emergency relief. In this paper, we focus on a specific kind of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem which considers the accessibility of vehicles and different vehicle types. In consideration of the actual conditions, the vehicle types may be various, and some emergency locations cannot be reached by certain types of vehicles due to the destruction of roads. Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is more practical. We build a mathematical model of the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem which includes multiple depots and emergency locations, multiple kinds of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> and multiple types of vehicles. Then we adopt genetic algorithm to solve an example based on the model. The effectiveness of the model has been proved by analyzing the computational results...|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{decision in}} choice of cylinders {{is whether the}} entire gas supply for the dive is to be carried in one set, or is to be divided into more than one set for {{different parts of the}} dive. Diving with a single cylinder is logistically simple, and makes all the gas available for breathing throughout the dive, but can not take advantage of optimising the breathing gas for decompression, or having an independent <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> that does not rely on the presence of a dive buddy where and when needed. A single cylinder puts the diver in a position of dependence on the buddy for alternative breathing gas {{in case of an emergency}} cutting off the main air supply, unless the option of a free ascent is acceptable.|$|E
500|$|People who climb {{mountains}} or fly in non-pressurized {{fixed-wing aircraft}} sometimes have supplemental [...] supplies. Pressurized commercial airplanes have an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> of [...] automatically supplied to the passengers {{in case of}} cabin depressurization. Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat, causing oxygen masks to drop. Pulling on the masks [...] "to start the flow of oxygen" [...] as cabin safety instructions dictate, forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister. A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.|$|E
500|$|Sling {{cylinders}} are a {{configuration of}} independent cylinders used for technical diving. [...] They are independent cylinders {{with their own}} regulators and are carried clipped to the harness {{at the side of}} the diver. [...] Their purpose may be to carry either stage, travel, decompression, or bailout gas while the back mounted cylinder(s) carry bottom gas. Stage cylinders carry gas to extend bottom time, travel gas is used to reach a depth where bottom gas may be safely used if it is hypoxic at the surface, and decompression gas is gas intended to be used during decompression to accelerate the elimination of inert gases. Bailout gas is an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> intended to be used to surface if the main gas supply is lost.|$|E

30|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} when coping with a disaster. The stockpiling and production of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> should depend on private manufacturers in some cases, and the government will offer the manufacturer a subsidy to encourage its investment on extra reserves. This study investigates the manufacturer’s optimal decision on reserve investment and the government’s optimal subsidy policy based on mathematical models. The results indicate that to gain maximum benefit, the manufacturer should allocate its funds on both physical material reserve and production capacity reserve according to the government’s subsidy policy, while the government should {{take note of the}} relation between subsidy policy and subsidy period to ensure the manufacturer’s provision level of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1973, Joseph Miller, Jr., {{a retired}} Portland physician, sued the Forest Service, {{claiming}} that its logging violated the Bull Run Trespass Act. In 1976, U.S. District Judge James M. Burns agreed, and logging was halted. Shortly thereafter, Congress rescinded the Bull Run Trespass Act {{and replaced it}} with the Bull Run Watershed Management Act of 1977, which created the Bull Run Watershed Management Unit (BRWMU) (replacing the Bull Run Reserve) and legalized further Bull Run logging unless it could be shown to reduce water quality. Logging and the debate about logging continued. In 1994 about 75percent of the BRWMU was made into a reserve for protecting the northern spotted owl and other species dependent on old-growth forests. In February 1996, runoff from unusually heavy rains in the watershed washed so much eroded soil into the Bull Run storage reservoirs that the City had to shut down the Bull Run supply and switch during the crisis to its <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> from a well field along the Columbia River. Later in 1996, Congress passed the Oregon Resources Conservation Act, which prohibited logging on all Forest Service lands within the Bull Run water supply drainage and another [...] of land that drained to the lower Bull Run River. In 2001, the Little Sandy Act extended the prohibitions to the entire BRWMU and public lands along the Little Sandy River.|$|E

6000|$|On the eventful day the Easter angel, {{really quite}} prettily and quaintly dressed, was a centre of kindly {{interest}} to the gala crowd marshalled to receive his Highness. The mother was unobtrusive and less fussy than most parents would have been under the circumstances, merely stipulating that she should place the Easter egg herself in the arms that had been carefully schooled how to hold the precious burden. Then Lady Barbara moved forward, the child marching stolidly and with grim determination at her side. It had been promised cakes and sweeties galore if it gave the egg well and truly to the kind old gentleman who was waiting to receive it. Lester had tried to convey to it privately that horrible smackings would attend any failure in {{its share of the}} proceedings, but it is doubtful if his German caused more than an immediate distress. Lady Barbara had thoughtfully provided herself with an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> of chocolate sweetmeats; children may sometimes be time-servers, but they do not encourage long accounts. As they approached nearer to the princely daïs Lady Barbara stood discreetly aside, and the stolid-faced infant walked forward alone, with staggering but steadfast gait, encouraged by a murmur of elderly approval. Lester, standing in the front row of the onlookers, turned to scan the crowd for the beaming faces of the happy parents. In a side-road which led to the railway station he saw a cab; entering the cab with every appearance of furtive haste were the dark-visaged couple who had been so plausibly eager for the [...] "pretty idea." [...] The sharpened instinct of cowardice lit up the situation to him in one swift flash. The blood roared and surged to his head as though thousands of floodgates had been opened in his veins and arteries, and his brain was the common sluice in which all the torrents met. He saw nothing but a blur around him. Then the blood ebbed away in quick waves, till his very heart seemed drained and empty, and he stood nervelessly, helplessly, dumbly watching the child, bearing its accursed burden with slow, relentless steps nearer and nearer to the group that waited sheep-like to receive him. A fascinated curiosity compelled Lester to turn his head towards the fugitives; the cab had started at hot pace {{in the direction of the}} station.|$|E
