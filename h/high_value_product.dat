A comparison was made between a conventional method with additional organic material added to the soil and a Backgrounding method where cattle are reared on the land. The best method, according to the financial model that was built, was the method of Backgrounding cattle on the rehabilitated land. The main reason for this outcome {{may be due to the}} fact that the meat that is produced is a <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>product.</b> It might not be practically applicable to mines at this stage, but the calculation provides an insight into the possibilities that reclaimed mine land holds for the agricultural industry...|$|E

40|$|A hendeca-peptide with {{angiotensin}} I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory {{activity was}} {{isolated from the}} pepsin hydrolysate of algae protein waste, a mass-produced industrial by-product of an algae essence from microalgae, Chlorella vulgaris. Edman degradation revealed its amino acid sequence to be Val-Glu-Cys-Tyr-Gly-Pro-Asn-Ai-g-Pro-Gln-Phe. Inhibitory kinetics revealed a non-competitive binding made with IC(50) Value against ACE of 29. 6 mu M, suggesting a potent amount of ACE inhibitory activity compared with other peptides from the microalgae protein hydrolysates which have a reported range between 11. 4 and 315. 3 mu M. In addition, the purified hendeca-peptide completely retained its ACE inhibitory activity at a pH range of 2 - 10, temperatures of 40 - 100 degrees C, as well as after treatments in vitro by a gastrointestinal enzyme, thus indicating its heat- and pH-stability.

The effect of channel configurations, flow conditions and catalyst properties on the heat transfer rate and pressure drop was investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Based on the CFD results, the optimal macro-micro channel reactor was manufactured and its performance was evaluated.

40|$|Abstract Washington State has a {{significant}} history of experimental seaweed aquaculture. Early experiments involved the carrageenophytes Mazzaella splendens and Chondracanthus exasperatus in both open water net culture and semi-closed tank sys-tems on land.
