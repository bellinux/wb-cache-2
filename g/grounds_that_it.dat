5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Old Court {{supporters}} again {{raised the}} issue of Sharp's seduction and abandonment of Anna Cooke. Old Court supporter John Upshaw Waring printed handbills that not only accused Sharp of fathering Cooke's child, but said that Sharp had denied paternity of the child on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a mulatto and the son of a Cooke family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been determined. Despite the allegations, Sharp won the election.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator {{to vote against the}} Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy. He was one of only five senators to vote against the Telecommunications Act of 1996, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> put the economic interests of corporations ahead of those of consumers.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Council of Ulemas, an Islamic body in Indonesia, {{passed a}} fatwa banning yoga on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{contains}} Hindu elements. These fatwas have, in turn, {{been criticized by}} Darul Uloom Deoband, a Deobandi Islamic seminary in India. Similar fatwas banning yoga, for its link to Hinduism, were issued by the Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa in Egypt in 2004, and by Islamic clerics in Singapore earlier.|$|E

5|$|In Kesselring's memoirs, he {{said that}} in Wolfsberg he was {{approached}} by a former SS major who had an escape plan prepared. According to Kesselring, he declined the offer on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be seen as a confession of guilt. Other senior Nazi figures did manage to escape from Wolfsberg to South America or Syria.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unfair {{due to the}} level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} by Russia was condemned by the United States, France, the {{secretary-general of the}} Council of Europe, {{the president of the}} Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, the OSCE chairman, NATO and the G7 on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> violated Georgia's territorial integrity, United Nations Security Council resolutions and the ceasefire agreement.

5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or {{the meaning of}} life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined {{to refer to the}} entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, four {{female athletes}} – Anette Sagen, Helena Olsson Smeby, Line Jahr, and Lindsey Van – {{were invited to}} perform test jumps prior to the men's 2004 Continental Cup event in Vikersund. However, this was {{initially}} blocked by Torbjørn Yggeseth, founder of the Ski Jumping World Cup {{and a member of}} the FIS technical committee at the time, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too dangerous to allow women on ski flying hills. Sagen challenged this and eventually won the right to jump from the hill, along with her fellow athletes. Both Sagen and Smeby jumped , which remains the third longest distance for women.|$|E

5|$|In October 2012, an ICSID {{tribunal}} {{awarded a}} judgment of $1.8 billion for Occidental Petroleum {{against the government}} of Ecuador. Additionally, Ecuador had to pay $589 million in backdated compound interest {{and half of the}} costs of the tribunal, making its total penalty around $2.4 billion. The South American country annulled a contract with the oil firm on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> violated a clause that the company would not sell its rights to another firm without permission. The tribunal agreed the violation took place but judged that the annulment was not fair and equitable treatment to the company.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the second investigation, a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle. In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, and Dingle with conspiracy. In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove's inquiry, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might help their clients; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had, in effect, confessed. The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded.|$|E
5|$|Most {{notably the}} Saigon junta opposed US {{proposals}} to escalate {{the war with}} a large-scale bombing campaign against North Vietnam, as advocated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. This plan called {{for the use of}} American resources badged as South Vietnamese. This was objected to on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would lose moral capital for Saigon as they promoted their cause as just and compatible with the physical safety of fellow Vietnamese, as well as fears that it would provoke a communist land invasion from the north.|$|E

5|$|Operation Dragoon was {{controversial}} {{from the}} time it was first proposed. The American military leadership and its British counterparts disagreed on the operation. Winston Churchill argued against it on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> diverted military resources that were better deployed for Allied operations in Italy; instead, he favored an invasion of the oil-producing regions of the Balkans. Churchill reasoned that by attacking the Balkans, the Western Allies could deny Germany petroleum, forestall the advance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union, and achieve a superior negotiating position in post-war Europe, all at a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Other {{conditions}} {{imposed on}} {{a speech at}} Speakers' Corner were {{that it had to}} take place only between 7:00a.m. and 7:00p.m. on the date notified by the person to the police, had to be in any of Singapore's four official languages (English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil) or any related dialects, and the use of sound amplification devices was prohibited. The latter restriction was justified on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would reduce noise pollution and prevent one speaker from drowning out another one, and that it also applied to Speakers' Corner in London.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{an update}} to the SEOC Act, the Child Protection Act of 1984, made {{it illegal to}} {{purchase}} pornographic materials depicting minors through the mail, or possess them, on the <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> encouraged child sexual abuse. While popular with voters, civil liberties advocates warned that the expanded scope of these laws could result in prosecutions of entirely innocent people who had {{little or nothing to}} do with the child-porn industry, such as parents taking photos or videos of their children in the nude. Nevertheless, investigators forged ahead and had, by the mid-1980s, shut down almost all domestic child-porn production. The government itself was thereafter the biggest marketer, in the form of materials it created to tempt buyers.|$|E
