40|$|Xenotransplantation using pig cells, {{tissues and}} organs may be {{associated}} with the transfer of porcine infectious agents, which may infect the human recipient and in the worst case induce a <b>disease</b> (<b>zoonosis).</b> To prevent this, a broad screening program of the donor animals for putative zoonotic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and others, using sensitive and specific detection methods has to be performed. As long as it is still unknown, which microorganism represents a real risk for the recipient, experience from allotransplantation should be brought in. Due to the fact that pigs can be screened long before the date of transplantation, xenotransplantation will become eventually safer compared with allotransplantation. Screening and selection of animals free of potential zoonotic microorganisms, Caesarean section, vaccination and/or treatment with chemotherapeutics are the strategies of choice to obtain donor animals not transmitting microorganisms. In the case of porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) which are integrated in the genome of all pigs and which cannot be eliminated this way, selection of animals with low virus expression and generation of genetically modified pigs suppressing PERV expressions may be performed...|$|E
40|$|Porcine {{endogenous}} retroviruses (PERVs) {{are integrated}} in the genome of all pigs; they are released as infectious particles, and {{under certain conditions}} they can infect human cells. Therefore, they represent a risk when pigs are used as sources of cells, tissues, or organs for xenotransplantation. Xenotransplantation is under development due to the increasing shortage of human transplants. Whereas most porcine microorganisms which {{may be able to}} induce a <b>disease</b> (<b>zoonosis)</b> in the transplant recipient can be eliminated, this is not possible in the case of PERVs. Antiretroviral drugs which had been developed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus- 1 (HIV- 1) infections have been tested in vitro for their efficacy in inhibiting PERV replication. Inhibitors of the viral reverse transcriptase and of the integrase have been found effective. The most effective inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase was azidothymidine (AZT); the integrase inhibitors were the most potent inhibitors of PERV. Although in the past PERV transmission has not been observed after experimental or clinical xenotransplantation of pig cells or organs, and although PERVs may one day be inactivated in pigs by genome editing using CRISPR/Cas, knowing which antiretroviral drugs can effectively restrict PERV infection will still be important...|$|E

40|$|Animal {{production}} systems provide nutritious food for humans, income and survivability for numerous smallholder farms and transform residues to valuable products. However, animal production is implicated in human health issues (diet-related <b>diseases,</b> <b>zoonosis,</b> antimicrobial resistance) and environmental burdens (ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication of surface waters, biodiversity loss). This paper reviews changes in global animal production and associated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows {{over the past}} 50 years, during which time total animal production roughly tripled. Cattle still dominate {{the world in terms}} of animal biomass, but the number and total production of pigs and poultry have increased faster. Animal {{production systems}} are highly diverse and respond to changes in markets. Specialised systems have become more dominant, especially in developed and rapidly developing countries. The annual production of N and P in manure is similar to the amounts of N and P in synthetic fertiliser produced annually, but manure nutrients are often not recycled effectively and used efficiently by plants. Nutrient losses greatly depend on the system, management and regulations. Nitrogen and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE respectively) at the animal level is in the range 5 - 45 %, depending on animal category, feeding and management. NUE of mixed crop-animal systems may range from 5 % to 65 % depending on NUE at the animal level, and the utilisation of manure nitrogen and new nitrogen inputs. Potentially, values for PUE are higher than those for NUE. Solutions for improving NUE and PUE in animal production are based on a coherent set of activities in the whole chain of 'feed production-animal production-manure management'. A high efficiency at the system level is achieved through combination of high NUE and PUE at the animal level and effective recycling and utilisation of manure N and P in crop production. Specific regional regulations (low-emission manure storage and application, proper application limits and timing) greatly contribute to high efficiency at a system level...|$|R
