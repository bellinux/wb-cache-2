25|$|A {{developing}} {{trend in}} the knitting world is interchangeable needles. These kits consist of pairs of needles with usually nylon cables or cords. The cables/cords are screwed into the needles, allowing the <b>knitter</b> to have both flexible straight needles or circular needles. This also allows the <b>knitter</b> to change the diameter and length of the needles as needed.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} history of {{knitting}} {{through the lens of}} modern knitters’ lives. Information about {{the history of}} knitting was gathered from various printed and online sources. A series of interviews were conducted with <b>knitters</b> of different ages, experience levels, professions, and socioeconomic circles. Among these were beginning <b>knitters,</b> casual <b>knitters,</b> semi-professional <b>knitters,</b> professional <b>knitters,</b> and a knitting celebrity. The interviewees were asked about their knitting lives, including personal history, motives, preferences, and habits. Using the research and the interviews to inform each other, the researcher compiled a report on each subject which included their responses and the historical context which was relevant to each. The research indicated that knitting history is kept alive and continually engaged with on a unique level as modern <b>knitters</b> practice the same techniques which <b>knitters</b> hundreds or thousands of years ago used. It also found some significant similarities among <b>knitters,</b> particularly in the area of motives for knitting. This work represents an acquisition of expertise, not only in the area of knitting history, but also in interview skills...|$|R

25|$|Insufficient gratitude.

25|$|In the 1920s to 1930s, various card {{counters}} {{were produced}} in the UK, including the Little Dorrit counter, and the schoolgirl counter. From around 2006 Maik Remmers designed and manufactured in Germany a series of 3D card counters {{in the shape of}} skeins of wool, animals and abstract designs. These are folded and printed on back and front, with a pair of rotatable number discs sandwiched between the layers of card. The discs can be rotated to reveal numerals through two windows in the front layer of card. The outer surface of the card can be written-on with water-soluble ink, and the back surface of the counter contains a form where the <b>knitter</b> can fill in current row numbers. This is necessary as there is not enough friction to prevent the number discs from moving during storage.|$|E

2500|$|For many <b>knitters,</b> {{making a}} hand-knit gift is an {{emotional}} experience, an extended affectionate meditation on the person receiving the gift. [...] A metaphor commonly used by <b>knitters</b> is, [...] "I knit my love into every stitch." [...] Since giving too significant a gift too early in a relationship can evoke apprehension, <b>knitters</b> have been advised to match the knitted gift to the stage in the relationship, beginning with hats, mittens, scarves, or socks before graduating to sweaters. [...] Many <b>knitters</b> wait until marriage before making a sweater for a significant other, or ask their affianced to sign a [...] "pre-knitual agreement".|$|R

25|$|One of {{the more}} obvious {{differences}} is that crochet uses one hook while much knitting uses two needles. In most crochet, the artisan usually has only one live stitch on the hook (with the exception being Tunisian crochet), while a <b>knitter</b> keeps an entire row of stitches active simultaneously. Dropped stitches, which can unravel a fabric, rarely interfere with crochet work, due to a second structural difference between knitting and crochet. In knitting, each stitch {{is supported by the}} corresponding stitch in the row above and it supports the corresponding stitch in the row below, whereas crochet stitches are only supported by and support the stitches on either side of it. If a stitch in a finished crocheted item breaks, the stitches above and below remain intact, and because of the complex looping of each stitch, the stitches on either side are unlikely to come loose unless heavily stressed.|$|E
25|$|Baker quickly {{made the}} part his own, viewing figures {{for his first}} few years {{returning}} to a level {{not seen since the}} height of 'Dalekmania' a decade earlier. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies), as well as his distinctive voice, made him an immediately recognisable figure and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the <b>knitter,</b> Begonia Pope, intending for her to choose a suitable colour. However, due to miscommunication Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened a bit to make it more manageable.|$|E

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The <b>knitter</b> holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls back the other way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the <b>knitter</b> and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the <b>knitter</b> rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E

40|$|Knitting {{today is}} a hobby {{activity}} that provides <b>knitters</b> {{with a sense of}} connectedness with their families' past and of participating in a fundamental element of their culture. Knitting's existence in contemporary popular culture demonstrates the widespread desire in Western society to make links with an idealized past. This thesis is based on interviews with ten <b>knitters,</b> in St. John's, Newfoundland, analysis of the objects they produce and observations of a regular gathering of <b>knitters.</b> [...] This study has found, <b>knitters</b> emphasize the importance of the act of knitting, as well as the importance of producing functional objects. Contemporary hobby <b>knitters</b> preserve tradition by continuing to use the same techniques as have a long tradition of use in their families and their communities. However, <b>knitters</b> strive to make hand knit objects functional for today's users by conforming to contemporary fashion trends and using modern materials. Migrating away from, and back to, Newfoundland has had the effect of solidifying some knitters' sense of knitting as symbolic of Newfoundland culture. Knitting also offers today's frequently migrating urbanites comfort by providing a sense of belonging to a universal culture that goes beyond the sense of belonging to a particular place or time. Furthermore, the contemporary phenomenon of knitting as a hobby reflects the strength of the knitting tradition in Newfoundland, despite the influence of external culture, such as printed patterns, and hobby <b>knitters</b> today contribute to the evolution of Newfoundland knitting. My aim is to discover how women today are using traditional knowledge as a force for social change...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "sweater curse" [...] or [...] "curse of {{the love}} sweater" [...] is a term used by knitters to {{describe}} the belief that if a <b>knitter</b> gives a hand-knit sweater to a significant other, {{it will lead to}} the recipient breaking up with the <b>knitter.</b> In an alternative formulation, the relationship will end before the sweater is even completed. The belief is widely discussed in knitting publications, and some knitters claim to have experienced it.

2500|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, in Europe and the United States, groups of {{localised}} professional hand knitters specialised {{in a few}} well-known patterns in which keeping a tally of rows was barely necessary, since the pattern and expected size of the work were known by heart. From the early 19th century, when printed patterns were introduced for the recreational <b>knitter,</b> and until the early 20th century, woollen yarn had clear stitch definition so that rows were easily seen and counted, and a mental tally could be kept. However knitters could tally by moving objects from one pocket to another, or bracelets from one wrist to the other. For lace knitting and complicated increases, a <b>knitter</b> could write five-bar gate tally marks around the margins of a printed pattern.|$|E
