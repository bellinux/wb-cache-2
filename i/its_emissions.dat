5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
25|$|By {{permitting}} allowances to {{be bought}} and sold, an operator can seek out the most cost-effective way of reducing <b>its</b> <b>emissions,</b> either by investing in 'cleaner' machinery and practices or by purchasing emissions from another operator who already has excess 'capacity'.|$|E
25|$|From a {{slow start}} in 1952, sulphur {{production}} from gas processing snowballed as plant construction boomed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Tough new regulations enacted by the Alberta government in 1960 forced the industry to reduce <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> of such sulphur compounds as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulphide.|$|E

25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} to fight global warming found more {{success at the}} international level than in Congress. Obama attended the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, which drafted the non-binding Copenhagen Accord as a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. The deal provided for the monitoring of carbon emissions among developing countries, but it did not include Obama's proposal to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. In 2014, Obama reached an agreement with China in which China pledged to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030, while the US pledged to cut <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> by 26-28 percent compared to its 2005 levels. The deal provided momentum for a potential multilateral global warming agreement among the world's largest carbon emitters. Many Republicans criticized Obama's climate goals as a potential drain on the economy. At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, nearly {{every country in the world}} agreed to a landmark climate deal in which each nation committed lowering their greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement created a universal accounting system for emissions, required each country to monitor <b>its</b> <b>emissions,</b> and required each country to create a plan to reduce <b>its</b> <b>emissions.</b> Several climate negotiators noted that the US-China climate deal and the EPA's emission limits helped make the deal possible. In 2016, the international community agreed to the Kigali accord, an amendment to the Montreal Protocol which sought to reduce the use of HFCs, organic compounds that contribute to global warming.|$|E
25|$|With new {{regulations}} {{in place in}} 1975, Saugbrugsforeningen initiated a process to reduce <b>its</b> <b>emissions.</b> NOK212 million were invested between 1975 and 1978, involving a collection system for sulfite waste, a new chemical treatment plant, two external sedimentation pools and two electric boilers. By 1980 the situation in Iddefjorden had improved, but by 1985 the improvements had stagnated and further measures were required.|$|E
25|$|Industry also causes {{pollution}} problems. A major offender is {{the production}} of nonferrous metals. One of Tajikistan's leading industrial sites, the aluminum plant at Tursunzoda (formerly known as Regar), west of Dushanbe near the border with Uzbekistan, generates large amounts of toxic waste gases that have been blamed for {{a sharp increase in}} the number of birth defects among people who live within range of <b>its</b> <b>emissions.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another seller {{may have}} already {{invested}} in new low-emission machinery and have a surplus of allowances as a result. The factory could make up for <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> by buying 20,000 tonnes of allowances from them. The cost of the seller's new machinery would be subsidized by the sale of allowances. Both the buyer and the seller would submit accounts for their emissions to prove that their allowances were met correctly.|$|E
25|$|Also {{shown are}} Mr and Mrs Tan, a fictional couple {{who live in}} an average Chinese suburb. At present, their energy usage is one seventh of that of the Carbons. However, this is set to change. As China becomes more industrialised, <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> are set to {{overtake}} those in the West. As of 2006, the country is planning to build a large, coal-fired power plant every week {{for the next seven}} years.|$|E
25|$|Incineration {{plants can}} {{generate}} {{electricity and heat}} that can substitute power plants powered by other fuels at the regional electric and district heating grid, and steam supply for industrial customers. Incinerators and other waste-to-energy plants generate at least partially biomass-based renewable energy that offsets greenhouse gas pollution from coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants. The E.U. considers energy generated from biogenic waste (waste with biological origin) by incinerators as non-fossil renewable energy under <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> caps. These greenhouse gas reductions are {{in addition to those}} generated by the avoidance of landfill methane.|$|E

50|$|Mercury Sensors (MS), {{a family}} of sensors that {{comprise}} complexes of fluorescien and napthofluorescien. The MS1 probe increases <b>its</b> <b>emission</b> upon binding of Hg(II), while maintaining great affinity for mercury over other heavy metal ions.|$|R
25|$|Emissions trading gives polluters an {{incentive}} to reduce their emissions. However, there are possible perverse incentives that can exist in emissions trading. Allocating permits {{on the basis of}} past emissions ("grandfathering") can result in firms having {{an incentive}} to maintain emissions. For example, a firm that reduced <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> would receive fewer permits in the future (IMF, 2008, pp.25â€“26). This problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds, since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). On the other hand, a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away, provides the government with revenues. These revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy, e.g., by funding reductions in distortionary taxes (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E
500|$|The average Canberran was {{responsible}} for 13.7 tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2005. [...] In 2012 the ACT Government legislated greenhouse gas targets to reduce <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> by 40percent from 1990 levels by 2020, 80percent by 2050, with no net emissions by2060. The government announced in 2013 a target for 90% of electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources by 2020, and in 2016 set an ambitious target target of 100% by 2020.|$|E
500|$|The {{proposal}} sparked {{protests from}} those who felt that the building would be too large and would be an eyesore, as well as worries about the pollution damaging local buildings, parks and even paintings in the nearby Tate Gallery. The company addressed the former concern by hiring Sir Giles Gilbert Scott to design the building's exterior. He was a noted architect and industrial designer, famous for his design of the red telephone box, and of Liverpool Anglican Cathedral. He {{would go on to}} design another London power station, Bankside, which now houses Tate Modern art gallery. The pollution issue was resolved by granting permission for the station on the condition that <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> were to be treated, to ensure they were [...] "clean and smokeless".|$|E
50|$|AE And has {{prominent}} allowed and forbidden FeII {{and hydrogen}} lines in <b>its</b> <b>emission</b> spectrum, {{as well as}} weaker HeI and NII lines. Some features suggest a B2-B3 spectral type but the emission and variability defy a normal classification.|$|R
40|$|The temporal-spatial {{structure}} of simple solar flares observed with the Ultraviolet Spectrometer and Polarimeter of the Solar Maximum mission satellite {{has been studied}} in order to investigate {{the relationships between the}} impulsive O V and the gradual Fe XXI emissions. The point-like flares are characterized by the cotemporal evolution of the O V and Fe XXI emissions. The simple loop flares have a much larger spatial extent and show two distinctive phases: an initial impulsive phase with <b>its</b> <b>emission</b> localized in loop footpoints, and a gradual phase with <b>its</b> <b>emission</b> distributed in the loop. The temporal evolution of the Fe XXI and O V emissions in a flare is found to be closely related to its spatial structure...|$|R
500|$|Rubidium was {{discovered}} in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, in Heidelberg, Germany, in the mineral lepidolite through spectroscopy. Because of the bright red lines in <b>its</b> <b>emission</b> spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning [...] "deep red".|$|R
500|$|That day, {{the city}} closed all 11 of its {{municipal}} garbage incinerators. Energy companies Consolidated Edison (called Con Ed for short) and Long Island Lighting Company {{were asked to}} burn natural gas rather than fuel oil to minimize the release of sulfur dioxide; both companies voluntarily cut back emissions, with Con Ed reducing <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> by 50 percent. The city told 18 inspectors [...] "to forget their turkey dinners and start looking for dirty air," [...] and they issued an [...] "unusually high" [...] number of citations for emissions violations, including two for Con Ed plants. Representative William Fitts Ryan of Manhattan sent a telegram to Secretary of Health and Human Services John W. Gardner to request an emergency meeting with New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, New Jersey Governor Richard J. Hughes, and other regional leaders.|$|E
500|$|Although he had {{initially}} {{stated that he}} would not do so, Livingstone's administration sought to phase out use of the Routemaster buses, the design for which dated to the 1950s. Although iconic, they were deemed hazardous and responsible for a high number of deaths and serious injuries as passengers climbed onto them, also being non-wheelchair accessible and thus not meeting the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The process was gradual, with the last Routemaster being decommissioned in December 2005. The Routemasters were replaced by a new fleet of 103 articulated buses, known colloquially as [...] "bendy buses", which were launched in June 2002. While the Routemasters fitted 80 people on at one time, the articulated buses fitted up to 140 passengers, however they were deemed dangerous for cyclists. Attempting to reduce London's environmental impact, Livingstone created the [...] London Hydrogen Partnership and the London Energy Partnership in his first term as Mayor of London. The Mayor's Energy Strategy, [...] "green light to clean power," [...] committed London to reducing <b>its</b> <b>emissions</b> of carbon dioxide by 20%, relative to the 1990 level, by 2010.|$|E
