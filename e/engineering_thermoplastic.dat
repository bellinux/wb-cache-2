40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation was the synthesis and modification of thermotropic liquid crystalline copolyesters to be blended with isotropic <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> such as PET. There {{has been a lot}} of interest in the last several years in the blending of thermotropic LCPs with <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> to form in situ composites. Yet, due to the typically high melt transitions of highly aromatic thermotropic LCPs, several methods have been studied in this dissertation to reduce the melt transitions of LCPs to within the processing window of <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics.</b> ^ Three series of thermotropic, aromatic copolyesters derived from EHQ, PHQ, HQ, EG, and TA were synthesized, and characterized by PLM, DSC, NMR, TGA, and solution viscometry. It was shown that the melt transition was effectively reduced through the copolymerization of the monomers. For melt blending with <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics,</b> such as PET, the transition temperatures for the Series III samples were too high, while some of the Series I and II copolymers with low amounts of PT units had thermal transitions in the range which would make them more favorable for blending. ^ Several different liquid crystalline copolyesters were thermally post-treated successfully to increase their degree of randomness. Both poly(ethoxyphenylene terephthalate-co-ethylene terephthalate) s and poly(phenylphenylene terephthalate-co-ethylene terephthalate) s were thermally randomized. It was found that increased randomness numbers caused decreased melt transition temperatures and crystallization temperatures. The more random sequence distributions also resulted in a decreased crystallinity of the copolyesters as observed by reduced enthalpies of fusion and crystallization. ^ Two different LC copolyesters, poly(EPT-co-ET) and poly(PPT-co-ET), were solution blended with PET using a mixture solvent of TFAA/Chloroform. Four different samples of each LC copolyester, with varying degrees of randomness, were used in the blends. The blends were characterized by DSC, polarized light microscopy, and rheological testing. It was observed that the melt viscosity of the blend had a strong dependence on the degree of randomness of the LC copolymer used. The copolyesters with high degrees of randomness caused a reduction of the melt viscosity. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{process has}} been {{developed}} in our laboratories in which the reinforce-ment of <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> is generated during melt processing. The process con-sists of blending thermotropic liquid crystalline polymers with <b>engineering</b> <b>thermoplastics</b> in an extruder.

The formation of fibrils depends on the presence of certain hydrodynamic conditions defined by the viscosity ratio, capil-lary number, and flow type. The sheets are then drawn to impart molecular orientation in the LCP phase. Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) sheets reinforced with several different LCP’s have been formed in which the properties are significantly enhanced.

The mechanical performance of rovings and single fibres of well-defined silane sized and water sized E-glass fibre samples was investigated at room temperature after thermal conditioning at temperatures up to 400 °C.

The tensile strength of silane coated fibres was relatively stable up to 300 °C but exhibited a precipitous drop at higher conditioning temperatures.

The strength distribution of the water sized fibres could be well represented by a unimodal three parameter Weibull distribution.
