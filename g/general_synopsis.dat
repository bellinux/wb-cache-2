The illustration {{was based on a}} drawing in Lady Impey's collection and Latham called it the gigantic crane and included observations by an African traveller named Smeathman who described a similar bird from western Africa. Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea argala for the Indian bird. Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species. This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species. The marabou stork of Africa looks somewhat similar but their disjunct distribution ranges, differences in bill structure, plumage, and display behaviour support their treatment as separate species.|$|E

500|$|Early {{scientific}} bird collections included those {{belonging to}} Pallas and Naumann in Germany, Latham and Tunstall in England and Adanson in France. Collections grew in size with increasing maritime activity, exploration and colonialism. For example, Charles Darwin collected over 400 bird specimens during his travels on the Beagle, {{and it was}} many years after his return to England that his bird collections from the Galapagos inspired (in part) his theory of evolution through natural selection. The Paris museum had 463 bird specimens in 1793 and this grew to 3411 in 1809; The Berlin museum had 2000 specimens in 1813 growing to 13,760 around 1850. In 1753 there were 1172 bird specimens in the museum established by Sir Hans Sloane but these appear to have perished before they moved to the British Museum. Early specimens from Captain Cook's voyages {{as well as those}} described by Latham in his <b>General</b> <b>Synopsis</b> of Birds (1781–1785) were also lost possibly due to poor preservation technique. The scale of collections grew {{to the point where they}} needed more space and full-time curators. In the earliest days of ornithology, collecting was the dominant method of bird observation and study. This approach has diminished with the growth of the discipline. The use of mist-netting and photography, blood sampling (for DNA, immunological and other studies), the development of optics and the use of other new techniques for studying birds have reduced the need to collect specimens for research, yet collections continue to act as a vital shared resource for science (particularly taxonomy) and conservation.

500|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was first {{mentioned}} and {{described by the}} English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work A <b>General</b> <b>Synopsis</b> of Birds. Latham stated {{that he had seen}} two specimens, in the collections of the British major Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks, but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections, and their provenance is unknown. Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer James Cook, and Davies received specimens from contacts in New South Wales, implying a location in the South Pacific Ocean, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. After Davies' death, his specimen was bought in 1812 by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, who kept it in Knowsley Hall. Smith-Stanley's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount (which had perhaps been taxidermised by Davies himself) into a study skin. This museum later became World Museum, where the specimen is housed today (numbered WML 3538), but Banks' specimen is now lost. Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of Ashton Lever, but it is unknown which specimen this was based on; it could have been either, or a third individual. Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work A General History of Birds, and though the basis for his illustration is unknown, it differs from Davies' specimen in some details. It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the Leverian collection, since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as [...] "deep ferruginous" [...] (rust-coloured), a feature also depicted in his own illustration.|$|E

The article, we will say, is written by a TYPICAL train hoister--one without your education and powers of expression (bouquet) but intelligent enough to convey his ideas from HIS STANDPOINT--not from John Wanamaker's. Yet, in order to please John, we will have to assume a virtue that we do not possess. Comment on the moral side of the proposition as little as possible. Do not claim that holding up trains is the only business a gentleman would engage in, and, on the contrary, do not depreciate a profession that is really only financiering with spurs on. Describe the FACTS and DETAILS--all that part of the proceedings that the passenger sitting with his hands up in a Pullman looking into the end of a tunnel in the hands of one of the performers does not see. Here is a rough draft of my idea: Begin abruptly, without any philosophizing, with your idea of the best times, places and conditions for the hold-up--compare your opinions of this with those of others--mention some poorly conceived attempts and failures of others, giving your opinion why--as far as possible refer to actual occurrences, and incidents--describe the manner of a hold-up, how many men is best, where they are stationed, how do they generally go into it, nervous? or joking? or solemnly. The details of stopping the train, the duties of each man of the gang--the behavior of the train crew and passengers (here give as many brief odd and humorous incidents as you can think of). Your opinions on going through the passengers, when is it done and when not done. How is the boodle gotten at? How does the express clerk generally take it? Anything done with the mail car? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL A TRAIN ROBBER SHOOT A PASSENGER OR A TRAIN MAN--suppose a man refuses to throw up his hands? Queer articles found on passengers (a chance here for some imaginative work)--queer and laughable incidents of any kind. Refer whenever apropos to actual hold-ups and facts concerning them of interest. What could two or three brave and determined passengers do if they were to try? Why don't they try? How long does it take to do the business. Does the train man ever stand in with the hold-up? Best means of getting away--how and when is the money divided. How is it mostly spent. Best way to manoeuvre afterward. How to get caught and how not to. Comment on the methods of officials who try to capture. (Here's your chance to get even.) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{chemical}} construction of functional nano-structures through spontaneous assembly of small molecular components. The author focuses his special attention on metal-directed self-assembly {{which has been}} recognized {{during the last decade}} as a promising way to the precise construction of well-defined nanometer-scale architectures. Of many target structures, the author is particularly interested in both challenging and functional architectures which have been never synthesized by conventional synthesis. In view of synthetic challenge, the author has studied the construction of topologically complex, interlocked molecules (catenanes) by self-assembly. The efficient synthetic methodologies obtaining [2] catenane by interlocking two macrocycles have been recently established. However, construction of their three-dimensional analog which is also a [2] catenane but composed of two macrobicyclic three-dimensional cages instead of two macrocycles has never been achieved. The author furnishes a surprisingly efficient method for the synthesis of such 3 D-interlocked compound using the self-assembly strategy. After the synthesis of the 3 D-catenane, the author 2 ̆ 7 s interest shifted towards systems which are challenging as well as functional. Thus a novel system was designed where porphyrin array is incorporated into a catenane structure. He synthesized a porphyrin catenane that constitutes multi-component, photo-induced electron transfer system where components are assembled and arrayed through catenation. Finally, he prepared a porphyrin-based hollow framework by self-assembly. The entity has a prism-like framework composed of three porphyrin units and six metal centers. Various organic molecules can be included in the large hydrophobic cavity where new photo- and electrochemistry, through host-guest interaction, are highly expected. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter 1 is an introduction and <b>general</b> summary whose <b>synopsis</b> has been mentioned above. Brief summaries of all other chapters are described as follows. Chapter 2 describes preparation of a three dimensionally interlocked compound by metal-mediated self-assembly. The framework of each cage us assembled from five components: two tridentate ligands held together with three metal ions. Because each cage framework can bind an aromatic ring, two cage units will bind one another during their assembly process through the formation of a quadruple aromatic stack, giving rise to the ten-component interlocked supermolecule. Both solution and solid state structures are characterized conclusively by NMR, ESI-MS and X-ray analysis. When the cage component does not possess C 3 v symmetry, the resulting 3 -D interlocked structure is obtained as a diastereomeric mixture which are shown to exchange rapidly on the NMR NOESY timescale. The 3 -D interlocked compound involves two different ligands, each of which gives its own assembly upon complexation with metal ions. Interestingly, two different assemblies preformed by treating the two ligands with metal ions independently are found to re-assemble into the combined 3 D-interlocked structure. Such a dynamic behavior of the multi-component assemblies is discussed in Chapter 3. Porphyrin assemblies take essential role in biological systems for oxygen transport, electron transfer, and energy migration and conversion. In this regard, designing molecular assemblies using porphyrin units is a promising approach for constructing artificial functional systems. Described in Chapter 4 is the construction of [2] catenane composed of Zn(II) and Au(III) porphyrin-incorporated macrocycles which is capable of intramolecular photo induced electron transfer between donor and acceptor components. As an extension of artificial porphyrin assemblies, making a porphyrin-based hollow framework is also expected to open a new porphyrin chemistry through host-guest interaction. Chapter 5 describes a construction of prism-like hollow structure composed of three porphyrin units and six cationic Pd(II) complex. All these components surround a large hydrophobic cavity where various organic compounds can be included in aqueous solution. Pyrene inclusion induces D 3 h → C 2 structural change in the assembly making it chiral. Upon the inclusion of optically active pyrene, chiral induction of the host structure is observed by CD spectrum. Even after guest exchange into achiral pyrene, C 2 chirality of the host retains with the lifetime of several hours. This memory storage ability of the porphyrin prism is discussed in Chapter 6...|$|R

Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species.

50|$|A <b>General</b> <b>Synopsis</b> of Birds was Latham's first ornithological {{work and}} {{contained}} 106 illustrations by the author. It described many new species which Latham had discovered in various museums and collections.

Later, Latham realised that only the use of the Linnean binomial system would give him the honour of originating the species' scientific names. Thus he published in 1790, a Index Ornithologicus where he specified a binomial name for all the species which he had previously described. However, it was too late, as Johann Friedrich Gmelin had already published his own version of Linnaeus' Systema Naturæ in which he gave a scientific name to Latham's species; taking into account the rules of nomenclature, Gmelin has priority. Nevertheless, there are around eighty bird species for which Latham's 1790 publication is cited as the authority.

The Paris museum had 463 bird specimens in 1793 and this grew to 3411 in 1809; The Berlin museum had 2000 specimens in 1813 growing to 13,760 around 1850. In 1753 there were 1172 bird specimens in the museum established by Sir Hans Sloane but these appear to have perished before they moved to the British Museum. Early specimens from Captain Cook's voyages {{as well as those}} described by Latham in his <b>General</b> <b>Synopsis</b> of Birds (1781-1785) were also lost possibly due to poor preservation technique. The scale of collections grew {{to the point where they}} needed more space and full-time curators. In the earliest days of ornithology, collecting was the dominant method of bird observation and study. This approach has diminished with the growth of the discipline. The use of mist-netting and photography, blood sampling (for DNA, immunological and other studies), the development of optics and the use of other new techniques for studying birds have reduced the need to collect specimens for research, yet collections continue to act as a vital shared resource for science (particularly taxonomy) and conservation. In an era of mass extinction, bird collections will evidence lost species.|$|E
5000|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} was first {{mentioned}} and {{described by the}} English ornithologist John Latham in his 1783 work A <b>General</b> <b>Synopsis</b> of Birds. Latham stated {{that he had seen}} two specimens, in the collections of the British major Thomas Davies and the naturalist Joseph Banks, but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections, and their provenance is unknown. Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer James Cook, and Davies received specimens from contacts in New South Wales, implying a location in the South Pacific Ocean, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. After Davies' death, his specimen was bought by Edward Smith-Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby in 1812, who kept it in Knowsley Hall. Smith-Stanley's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount (which had perhaps been taxidermised by Davies himself) into a study skin. This museum later became World Museum, Liverpool, where the specimen is housed today (numbered WML 3538), but Banks' specimen is now lost. Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of Ashton Lever, but it is unknown which specimen this was based on; it could have been either, or a third individual. Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work A General History of Birds, and though it is unknown what he based his illustration on, it differs from Davies' specimen in some details. It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the Leverian collection, since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as [...] "deep ferruginous" [...] (rust-coloured), a feature also depicted in his own illustration.The spotted green pigeon was scientifically named by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789, based on Latham's description. The original binomial name Columba maculata means [...] "spotted pigeon" [...] in Latin. Latham himself accepted this name, and used it in his 1790 work Index ornithologicus. Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the holotype specimen of the species. Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; James Francis Stephens suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus Ptilinopus in 1826, and Johann Georg Wagler instead suggested that it was a juvenile Nicobar pigeon (Caloenas nicobarica) in 1827. Tommaso Salvadori listed the bird in an appendix about [...] "doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified" [...] in 1893. In 1898, Henry Ogg Forbes supported the validity of the species, after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon, Caloenas. In 1901, Walter Rothschild and Ernst Hartert agreed that the pigeon belonged to Caloenas, but suggested that it was probably an [...] "abnormity", though more than one specimen had been recorded.|$|E
