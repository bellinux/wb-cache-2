5|$|The Vanaja petrol engines made by SAT and Tampella were {{outdated}} American engines built under licence. Customers wanted <b>diesel</b> <b>engines,</b> {{which were}} more powerful. The first Vanaja diesel models were powered by Kämper and Saurer engines. VAT also tested Südwerke's two-stroke <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> {{but only one}} such vehicle was built. Import licences for <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were difficult to obtain and this constrained vehicle sales. In some cases, customers provided their own enginesfor example Volvo or Mercedes-Benz, which were mounted to their ordered vehicles on the assembly line. In 1955, VAT bought two batches of 6-cylinder 90-hp Leyland 0.350 <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> These proved to be too inefficient, and the following year the company ordered a batch of 300 stronger Leylands made in the Netherlands by van Doorne's Automobilfabriek N.V.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units. VAT employed about 200 workers {{at the time and}} changed to a four-day working week. The company blamed the government's import licence bureaucracy for the problemit was difficult to get <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> from abroad. In the following month, over 30 Vanajas that were otherwise ready were awaiting <b>diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> The economy improved in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers {{with plans for}} improvements, the chief of which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the <b>diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, six {{aircraft}} without engines were {{fitted with}} Mikulin AM-35A engines, while VVS officials evaluated both the Charomskiy ACh-30 and Charomskiy M-40 aircraft <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines.</b> At least nine Pe-8s were fitted with <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> in 1941, {{but neither the}} ACh-30 nor the M-40 were entirely satisfactory, despite greatly increasing {{the range of the}} aircraft. All surviving Pe-8s were re-engined with AM-35As by the end of 1941. Production continued slowly at Factory No. 124; most of the factory's resources were devoted to the higher-priority Petlyakov Pe-2, a successful light bomber. At this time, most of these aircraft, re-designated as the Pe-8 after Petlyakov was killed in a Pe-2 crash on 12 January 1942, were built with out-of-production AM-35A engines.|$|E

50|$|After Diesel's death, the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> {{underwent}} much {{development and}} became a very important replacement for the steam piston engine in many applications. Because the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> required a heavier, more robust construction than a gasoline engine, it was not widely used in aviation (but see aircraft <b>diesel</b> <b>engine).</b> The <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> became widespread in many other applications, however, such as stationary engines, agricultural machines, submarines, ships, and much later, locomotives, trucks, and in modern automobiles.|$|R

5|$|Turbines {{were never}} {{replaced}} in battleship design. <b>Diesel</b> <b>engines</b> were eventually {{considered by some}} powers, as they offered very good endurance and an engineering space taking up less {{of the length of}} the ship.

40|$|Abstract. To {{counter the}} {{influencing}} emission of the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> by the EGR rate, the emission {{model of the}} <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> {{was set up by}} combining Radial Basis Function neural network with Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System. The model first draws on the nonlinear approaching capacity of the RBF network to forecast the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> emission which takes no account of the factor of the EGR rate, and then, based on influencing the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> emission by the EGR rate, the ANFIS system was used to modify the results of the <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> emission obtained by using the RBF network so as to acquire the EGR rate curve.

5|$|The Ilyushin Il-6 was a Soviet {{long-range}} bomber {{developed from}} the Ilyushin Il-4 during 1942.

In {{order to}} study the load pattern of {{crankshaft}} of hybrid ship main <b>diesel</b> <b>engine,</b> in this thesis, MAN B&W 5 S 60 MC <b>diesel</b> <b>engine</b> model has been established using ADAMS software.
