Despite the fact that married women were not generally welcome on university faculties (female professors were usually expected to resign when they married), Stieglitz agreed to write a recommendation letter for Morgan for a position at the University of Illinois. Stieglitz noted in his letter that the university should overlook Morgan's marital status because her husband was ill at the time.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015, {{there have}} been 28 laureates {{affiliated}} with the University of Pennsylvania, 6 alone in the last 10 years. The University of Pennsylvania considers laureates who attended the university as undergraduate students, graduate students or {{were members of the}} faculty as affiliated laureates. Otto Fritz Meyerhof, a research professor in physiological chemistry, was the first University of Pennsylvania laureate, winning the Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry</b> in 1922. Two Nobel Prizes were shared by University of Pennsylvania laureates; Ragnar Granit and Haldan Keffer Hartline won the 1967 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry,</b> and Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa won the 2000 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry.</b> Three laureates, Christian B. Anfinsen, Gerald Edelman, and John Robert Schrieffer, won different Nobel Prizes in 1972, and were awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1973. Nine University of Pennsylvania laureates have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, more than any other category.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Nobel Prizes {{have been}} awarded to 844 men, 48 women (Marie Curie won it twice), and 27 organizations.

The first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. Curie is also the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry.</b> Curie's daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry</b> in 1935, making the two the only mother-daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes. The most Nobel Prizes awarded to women {{in a single year}} was in 2009, when five women became laureates.

5|$|As the proton {{concentration}} {{increases in}} the intermembrane space, a strong electrochemical gradient is established across the inner membrane. The protons can return to the matrix through the ATP synthase complex, and their potential energy is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is called chemiosmosis, and was first described by Peter Mitchell who was awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry</b> for his work. Later, part of the 1997 Nobel Prize <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry</b> was awarded to Paul D. Boyer and John E. Walker for their clarification of the working mechanism of ATP synthase.|$|E
5|$|At least 25 laureates have {{received}} the Nobel Prize for contributions {{in the field of}} organic chemistry, more than any other field of chemistry. Two Nobel Prize laureates <b>in</b> <b>Chemistry,</b> Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded the Nobel prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen is the other and was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1956 and 1972. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one <b>in</b> <b>chemistry</b> and one in another subject: Maria Skłodowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962). As of 2017, the prize has been awarded to 177 individuals, including four women: Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Irène Joliot-Curie (1935), Dorothy Hodgkin (1964), and Ada Yonath (2009).
