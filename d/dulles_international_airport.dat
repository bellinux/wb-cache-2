5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at Washington <b>Dulles</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport.</b> At 07:15, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, {{arriving}} at the passenger security checkpoint {{a few minutes later}} at 07:18. Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening. Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a hand wand. The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35. Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket. Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as carry-on items.

40|$|In June 2014 Brazil {{hosted the}} FIFA World Cup and in August 2016 Rio de Janeiro hosts the Summer Olympics. These two seminal {{sporting}} events will draw {{tens of thousands}} of air travelers through Brazil’s airports, airports that are currently {{in the midst of a}} national modernization program to address years of infrastructure neglect and insufficient capacity. Raising Brazil’s major airports up to the standards air travelers experience at major airports elsewhere in the world is more than just a case of building or remodeling facilities, processes must also be examined and reworked to enhance traveler experience and satisfaction. This research paper examines the key interface between airports and airline passengers—airport check-in procedures—according to how much value and waste there is associated with them. In particular, the paper makes use of a value stream mapping construct for services proposed by Martins, Cantanhede, and Jardim (2010). The uniqueness of this construct is that it attributes each activity with a certain percentage and magnitude of value or waste which can then be ordered and prioritized for improvement. Working against a fairly commonly expressed notion in Brazil that Brazil’s airports are inferior to the airports of economically advanced countries, the paper examines Rio’s two major <b>airports,</b> Galeão <b>International</b> and Santos Dumont in comparison to Washington D. C. ’s Washington National and <b>Dulles</b> <b>International</b> <b>airports.</b> The paper seeks to accomplish three goals: - Determine whether there are differences in airport passenger check-in procedures between U. S. and Brazilian airports in terms of passenger value - Present options for Brazilian government or private sector authorities to consider adopting or implementing at Brazilian airports to maximize passenger value - Validate the Martins et al. construct for use in evaluating the airport check-in procedures Observations and analysis proved surprising in that all airports and service providers follow essentially the same check-in processes but execute them differently yet still result in similar overall performance in terms of value and waste. Although only a few activities are categorized as completely wasteful (and therefore removed in the revised value stream map of check-in activities), the weighting and categorization of individual activities according to their value (or waste) presents decision-makers a means to prioritize possible corrective actions. Various overall recommendations are presented based on this analysis. Most importantly, this paper demonstrates the viability of using the construct developed by Martins et al to examine airport operations, as well as its applicability to the study of other service industry processes...|$|R
50|$|Kansas City {{approved}} a $150 million bond {{issue for the}} TWA hub there. TWA vetoed plans for a <b>Dulles</b> <b>International</b> Airport-style hub-and-spoke gate structure.

TWA's gates, which were intended to be within 100 ft of the street, became obsolete because of security issues. Kansas City refused to rebuild its terminals as Dallas-Fort Worth <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> rebuilt its similar terminals, forcing TWA to look for a new hub.

40|$|A {{study to}} assess the noise-induced {{building}} vibrations associated with Concorde operations is presented. The approach is to record the levels of induced vibrations and associated indoor/outdoor noise levels in selected homes, historic and other buildings near <b>Dulles</b> and Kennedy <b>International</b> <b>Airports.</b> Presented is a small, representative sample of data recorded at Sully Plantation, Chantilly, Virginia {{during the period of}} May 20 through May 28, 1976. Recorded data provide relationships between the vibration levels of walls, floors, windows, and the noise associated with Concorde operations (2 landings and 3 takeoffs), other aircraft, nonaircraft sources, and normal household activities. Results suggest that building vibrations resulting from aircraft operations were proportional to the overall sound pressure levels and relatively insensitive to spectral differences associated with the different types of aircraft. Furthermore, the maximum levels of vibratory response resulting from Concorde operations were higher than those associated with conventional aircraft. The vibrations of nonaircraft events were observed in some cases to exceed the levels resulting from aircraft operations. These nonaircraft events are currently being analyzed in greater detail...|$|R
