There was no ferry in sight, and he rounded the lake, struck a brick pavement, rolled through rough woods, {{suburban}} villas, and petty business streets, to a region of factories and mills, with the <b>funnels</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> beyond.|$|R

50|$|As she {{approached}} the Taymyr coast, Litke again encountered ice. By the evening of 11 August, whilst she was manoeuvering among heavy floes, Litke spotted the masts and <b>funnels</b> <b>of</b> three trapped <b>ships</b> close to the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands. These were the Pravda, Volodarskiy and Tovarich Stalin. They appeared dead ahead, separated from Litke by 10 km of solid sea ice. After a week of breaking through the ice, Litke succeeded in rescuing the freighters {{at the cost of}} major damage to the structure of her hull. The freed freighters went their separate ways: Stalin followed Litke west to Arkhangelsk via Vilkitsky Strait while Volodarskiy headed east towards the mouths of the Lena and Pravda southwards to Nordvik.|$|R
5000|$|Up to 1913, {{names were}} {{allocated}} under no fixed system, {{leading to a}} heterogeneous array, although 2 groups were named systematically; after rivers and tribes (later the E and F classes, respectively). In 1913, with burgeoning numbers of TBDs, the Admiralty took the confusing situation in hand; Havock and her similar [...] "27 knotter" [...] sisters with 2 shafts were grouped as the A class, and similar groups of [...] "30 knotter" [...] TBDs were grouped as the B class (4 funneled ships), C class (3 funnels) and D class (2 <b>funnels).</b> Later classes <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> were grouped as the E to K classes, {{although there was no}} J class. These are ships that the observer would recognise as being the fore-runners of the modern destroyer, with the turtle back and low conning tower replaced by a forecastle and wheelhouse with a compass platform above.|$|R
60|$|Twenty-seven {{days out}} from San Francisco {{we arrived at}} the island of Oahu, Territory of Hawaii. In the early morning we drifted around Diamond Head into full view of Honolulu; and then the ocean burst {{suddenly}} into life. Flying fish cleaved the air in glittering squadrons. In five minutes we saw more of them than during the whole voyage. Other fish, large ones, of various sorts, leaped into the air. There was life everywhere, on sea and shore. We could see the masts and <b>funnels</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shipping</b> in the harbour, the hotels and bathers along the beach at Waikiki, the smoke rising from the dwelling-houses high up on the volcanic slopes of the Punch Bowl and Tantalus. The custom-house tug was racing toward us and a big school of porpoises got under our bow and began cutting the most ridiculous capers. The port doctor's launch came charging out at us, and a big sea turtle broke the surface with his back and took a look at us. Never was there such a burgeoning of life. Strange faces were on our decks, strange voices were speaking, and copies of that very morning's newspaper, with cable reports from all the world, were thrust before our eyes. Incidentally, we read that the Snark and all hands had been lost at sea, and that she had been a very unseaworthy craft anyway. And while we read this information a wireless message was being received by the congressional party on the summit of Haleakala announcing the safe arrival of the Snark.|$|R

2500|$|The hull {{shape of}} the Superspeed 1 has been {{designed}} for optimized speed performance and good sea-keeping characteristics.

In 2014, the steel seal was replaced with a painted one.|$|R
