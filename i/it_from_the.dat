5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R

5|$|A {{pattern of}} lake cycles {{becoming}} {{longer than the}} preceding one has been noted. Water from the lake {{may have contributed to}} increased oxygen-18 at Sajama around 14,300 years ago, possibly triggered by evaporation. As the lake level dropped, Lake Poopó would have been disconnected first; the sill separating <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rest of Lake Tauca is relatively shallow. Coipasa and Uyuni would have remained connected until later. Water levels in Lake Titicaca's Lake Huinaimarca were low by 14,200 BP.|$|E

5|$|After Vatondas, Negroponte {{seemed about}} to fall into Licario's hands too. The city, however, was quickly {{reinforced}} by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian bailo, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except {{for the city of}} Negroponte itself, and ruling <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario's ships raided the Peloponnese.|$|E
5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so that it means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so that it means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that <b>it</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R

5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill {{is not as}} {{dependent}} on its endowment for operating revenue as some of its international peers. The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues. Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's endowment is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E
