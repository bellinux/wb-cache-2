40|$|The {{destructive}} {{action of}} the chronic periodontitis on the periodontal tissues has provided a continuous challenge to the dental profession to develop better methods to achieve repair of the recession regions and even regeneration of post periodontal tissues. Aims: To assess the effect of periodontal muco-periostal flap surgery with gingival <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> technique on minimizing the post surgical recession. Materials and Methods: The sample for the study comprised of 20 patients. The criteria for selection included patients with moderate periodontitis, with minimum recession in the anterior teeth, with adequate width of the attached gingiva, and with no traumatic occlusion. Periodontal muco-periosteal flap surgery with gingival <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> technique {{was done in the}} experimental site with internal bevel incision, and in control site, muco periosteal flap surgery with crevicular incision was done. Thereafter, observation period was of one week, four weeks, and eight weeks were done for both the sites. Statistical Analysis Used: The results were subjected to statistical analysis using student′s t`-test. Results: The result of this study suggests that the periodontal flap surgery with gingival <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> technique has a beneficial effect on the anterior teeth, as it maintains the esthetics, recontours the gingiva with minimal recession. The area of recession was more on the control site as compared to experimental site at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Conclusions: Gingival <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> technique showed less post-surgical recession and also there was fall in values of plaque index, gingival index, and periodontal index scores, throughout the study...|$|E

40|$|Four {{basically}} {{different approaches}} were considered: gasification of <b>fibers,</b> <b>retention</b> in the matrix, clumping to prevent entrainment, and electrical insulation of fibers. The techniques used {{to achieve them}} are described in some detail. These involved surface treatment of fibers to improve the wettability of fibers and coating the fibers with the selected substances before laying them up for composite fabrication. Thermogravimetric analyses were performed on the plain and treated fibers in inert (nitrogen, argon) and reactive (air) atmospheres. The treated fibers embedded in epoxy were ignited in a Bunsen flame to determine the efficiency of these treatments. A simple apparatus was assembled to detect {{the time for the}} first short circuit (in a typical electrical circuit) when exposed to the combustion products from a graphite fiber composite fire.

In this study fluorescence microscopy was used to study fines from bleached kraft pulp which were labeled with fluorophores. When the fines exhibit fluorescence we can study their individual trajectories and understand more about the interactions between fibers, fines and additives in different chemical environments. Fines from bleached kraft pulp have no fluorescent properties and therefore it is necessary to bind a fluorophore to the material.

In this experiment 25 of ten weeks old chickens were used (20 chickens were fed experimental diets, and 5 chickens were used to measure endogenous energy). A Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 5 treatments and 4 replications was used in this experiment. The experimental diets were R 0 = basal diet without JCM; R 1 = the diet contained unprocess JCM 5 %; R 2 = the diet contained fermented JCM 5 %+ cellulase 20. 000 U/kg; R 3 = the diet contained 5 % of fermented JCM + phytase 1000 FTU/kg; R 4 = the diet contained 5 % of fermented JCM+ cellulase 20. 000 U/kg + phytase 1000 FTU/kg. The parameters measured were Metabolizable Energy (ME, Men, TME, TMEn) digestibility of crude <b>fiber</b> and <b>retention</b> of calcium, phosphorus and nitrogen. The result indicated that fermented JCM suplemented enzym phytase, cellulase as well as enzym combination increased metabolizable energy.

Animals were sacrificed at 1 hr, 1, 5, 31, 90, 180, 270, 365, and 545 days after exposure stopped. Fibers were recovered from digested lung tissue to determine changes in concentrations (fibers/mg dry lung) and <b>fiber</b> <b>retentions</b> (expressed as percent of day 1 retention [PR]) for selected dimension categories. One-day average concentrations of lung-retained MMVF and crocidolite fibers, of diameter > or = 0. 5 micron or > 20 microns in length, were nearly equal, permitting direct comparisons between MMVF and crocidolite. At 270 days average PR for MMVF > or = 0. 5 micron in diameter were from 3 to 6 +/- 2 % and 27 +/- 9 % for crocidolite. For fibers > 20 microns, PR were 1 to 4 +/- 4 % for MMVF and 37 +/- 20 % for crocidolite.

40|$|During the 1970 s, {{potential}} health {{risks associated with}} exposure to asbestos in drinking water became a national concern. One of the key questions that arose from debate over whether ingestion of mineral fibers could result in increased gastrointestinal cancer risk was whether fibers can penetrate the gastrointestinal mucosa and thus have some chance of residing in tissue.

Studies of the potential for fiber accumulation in tissues and body fluids following introduction of asbestos to the alimentary canal have provided seemingly contradictory observations.

However, most of the dual-cured cements present a reduced degree of conversion in the absence of light activation [9]. During the fiber post cementation into a root canal, only the exposed marginal areas of cement are directly irradiated by the light-curing unit. To compensate for this limitation of dual-cured resin cements, some manufacturers have developed primer and adhesive solutions containing co-initiators to enhance the polymerization of the cement [10 – 12]. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adhesive protocols on push-out bond strength of fiber posts to root canals.

40|$|The {{majority}} of whole grain flour is produced using modern milling techniques, usually with steel rollers, {{in which a}} batch of grain is separated into multiple millstreams, sifted, and recombined.

In {{a very small number}} of cases whole grain flours are stone-ground, with the grain kernels crushed between rotating stones. Data comparing single-stream milling and multiple-stream milling with recombination do not show any strong advantage for either milling method. The separation of millstreams, in fact, allows highly labile brans and germs to undergo a stabilization treatment to make them less susceptible to rancidity—the net result of which is greater safety, stability, and nutrient retention.

Clearance of these materials has to be operated by specifically trained workers wearing specific individual protection suits after containment of the contaminated area. Good work practices are, however, not always applied. We report the case of two workers hired for ∼ 1 week to remove sprayed-on amosite asbestos during the remodeling of a former industrial hall. Regulatory protective equipments were not used. A legal action was initiated after disclosure of the working conditions. Medical examinations were performed 18 and 22 months after exposure. Workers denied any other asbestos exposure. Lung function tests and chest computed tomography scans were normal. Very high levels of asbestos fibers and bodies were discovered on mineralogical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) by phase contrast light microscopy and analytical electron microscopy. All fibers were amosite. An extrapolation considering duration of exposure, breathing pattern, and BALF fiber content suggests that the workers were exposed to airborne fiber concentrations {{in the range from}} several tens to about a hundred World Health Organization fibers per milliliter air. In conclusion, exposures to historical airborne fiber levels prevailing half a century ago may still occur today when the work regulations are not applied. In these conditions, even very short exposures may result in considerable lung <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> in case of amphibole exposure with the subsequent risk for developing asbestos-related diseases.

Histopathology of rat lungs revealed fibrotic lesions of a greater extent and severity at 20 days in rats exposed to crocidolite, but fibrosis occurred in both asbestos-exposed groups after an additional 20 days in clean air (20 + 20).

A sensitive technique to quantify the retention of contaminants on the pulp is to follow the dynamics of retention of a concentration pulse generated at the entrance (breakthrough curve, BTC) of a packed bed of fibers.

Objective. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the influence of amphoteric polymer resins (APR) on the fiber content effectiveness on the fourdrinier wire and the pit water contamination degree. Methods. According to standard techniques, the degree of fiber content and water turbidity, which arises in the paper and cardboard production during the formation on the paper-making machine fourdrinier wire, is determined. Results. The graphs of the dependence of the pit water turbidity on the APR consumption for different milling degree for MS- 5 B- 2 and МС- 8 В- 3 waste paper grades have been constructed. The high efficiency of the APR influence on the fiber content degree on the PPM wire is confirmed. The optimal values of technological parameters (milling degree and APR consumption) for the estimation of the APR impact on the pit water quality have been established. It is shown that the most effective APR among the investigated chemical auxiliaries is UltraRez 200, and the optimum consumption of all APR is 4 kg/ton of paper. The investigated APR are located by the effectiveness increasing of the APR influence on the degree of fiber content and the pit water turbidity reduction in the following series: Luresin KS – Eka WS 325 – Kymene 25 X-Cel – UltraRez 200 – Fennostrengt PA 21. Conclusions. The use of APR allows achieving a high degree of <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> on the wire up to 97...|$|E
40|$|Published i. p. {{injection}} {{studies have}} shown different biological behavior of different sepiolite samples. There was no evidence for carcinogenic potential of sepiolite from Vicalvaro, Spain, whereas a high tumor incidence was reported for sepiolite from Finland. The low biological activity of the sepiolite from Vicalvaro, compared to the Finnish sample, could be caused by low in vivo persistence or by the short length of the fibers, or both. In this study a further sepiolite sample, obtained as a commercial sample originating from China, was investigated. This sample contained a higher fraction of fibers longer than 5 microns, comparable to the Finnish sepiolite sample. The fraction of fibers with a length > 5 microns was 0. 12 and 2. 2 % for the Vicalvaro and Chinese sepiolite, respectively. For the fiber fraction longer than 8 microns, the corresponding values were 0. 0045 and 0. 82 %. The in vivo persistence of the sepiolite samples from China and Vicalvaro was analyzed after intratracheal instillation of 2 mg in female Wistar rats. <b>Fiber</b> <b>retention</b> in the lungs was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy at different sacrifice dates up to 12 months after application. For the Vicalvaro sepiolite, a splitting of fiber bundles was found during retention time in the lung. Therefore, no half-time of the fiber clearance could be calculated {{from the number of}} fibers. The decrease of the calculated retained fiber mass was faster for the Vicalvaro sepiolite (T 1 / 2 = 89 days) compared to the Chinese sepiolite (T 1 / 2 = 129 days). For 2 or 3 rats per group, at sacrifice date 12 months after i. p. injection, the lung was investigated by histopathology. The main difference between both treatment groups was a more pronounced fibrotic response in the Chinese sepiolite-treated rats compared to those treated with Vicalvaro sepiolite. It is concluded that both the higher fraction of long sepiolite fibers and the slower elimination rate of the fiber mass in the Chinese sample were important factors for the different biological reaction in comparison with Vicalvaro sepiolite...|$|E
40|$|Hamsters breathed, nose-only, for 13 weeks, 5 days/week, 6 hr/day, either {{man-made}} vitreous fiber (MMVF) 10 a, MMVF 33, or long amosite asbestos {{at approximately}} 300 World Health Organization (WHO) fibers/cc or long amosite at 25 WHO fibers/cc. [World Health Organization fibers are longer than 5 microm and thicker than 3 microm, with aspect ratio > 3. ] After sacrifice, fiber burden was estimated (left lungs) by ashing and {{scanning electron microscopy}} (ashing/SEM) or (right middle lobes) by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in situ. In situ CLSM also provided three-dimensional views of fibers retained, undisturbed, in lung tissue. Fibers of each type were lodged in alveoli and small airways, especially at airway bifurcations, and were seen fully or partly engulfed by alveolar macrophages. Amosite fibers penetrated into and through alveolar septa. Length densities of fibers in parenchyma (total length of fiber per unit volume of lung) were estimated stereologically from fiber transsections counted on two-dimensional optical sections and were 30. 5, 25. 3, 20. 0, and 81. 6 mm/mm 3 for MMVF 10 a, MMVF 33, and low- and high-dose amosite, respectively. Lengths of individual fibers were measured in three dimensions by tracking individual fibers through series of optical sections. Length distributions of amosite fibers aerosolized, but before inhalation versus after retention in the lung were similar, whether determined by ashing/SEM or in situ CLSM. In contrast, the fraction of short MMVF 10 a and MMVF 33 fibers increased and the geometric mean fiber lengths of both MMVFs decreased by approximately 60 % during retention. Most likely due to fiber deposition pattern and differences in sampling, fiber burdens [MMVF 10 a, MMVF 33, and amosite (high dose; 269 WHO fibers/cc) ] determined by ashing/SEM were 1. 4, 1. 5, and 3. 5 times greater, respectively, than those calculated from in situ CLSM data. In situ CLSM is able to provide detailed information about the anatomic sites of <b>fiber</b> <b>retention</b> and also fiber lengths and burdens in good agreement with ashing/SEM results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This in vivo study {{examined}} the contribution of remaining coro-nal dentin and placement of a prefabri-cated (LP) or customized fiber post (ES) to the six-year survival of endodonti-cally treated premolars. A sample of 345 patients provided 6 groups of 60 premo-lars each in need of endodontic treat-ment. Groups were classified accord-ing {{to the number of}} remaining coronal walls before abutment build-up. Within each group, teeth were allocated to one of three subgroups: (A) no post reten-tion; (B) LP; or (C) ES (N = 20). All teeth were protected with a crown. Cox regression analysis revealed that <b>fiber</b> post <b>retention</b> significantly improved tooth survival (p < 0. 001). Failure risk was lower in teeth restored with prefab-ricated (p = 0. 001) than with custom-ized posts (p = 0. 009). Teeth with one (p = 0. 004), two (p < 0. 001), and three coronal walls (p < 0. 001) had signif-icantly lower failure risks than those without ferrule. Similar failure risks existed for teeth without coronal walls, regardless of the presence/absence of ferrule (p = 0. 151). Regardless of the restorative procedure, the preservation of at least one coronal wall significantly reduced failure risk (ClinicalTrials. gov number CT 01532947).

40|$|Bleached {{softwood}} {{kraft pulp}} fibers were treated using TEMPO oxidation at two different dosages of NaClO. A batch of non-oxidized reference pulp was also prepared with {{a concentration of}} the tracer (Na) similar to the oxidized batches. A total of 15 washing experiments were conducted and the dispersion model was used to characterize washing behavior. TEMPO oxidation resulted in a major increase {{in the amount of}} carboxylate groups in the pulps and a considerable decrease in fiber/particle size in relation to the reference pulp fibers. Oxidized fibers also had less fiber curl than reference <b>fibers.</b> Water <b>retention</b> values were greater in the oxidized pulps and the oxidized fibers exhibited major swelling during the washing operation, while reference fibers had only minor swelling. The amount of sodium in the filter cakes after washing corresponded to the amount of carboxylate groups in the pulps. Swelling of oxidized pulp fibers needs to be considered in order to describe filtration and washing. The average specific filtration resistance for all pulps in this study was in the order of 10 (10) - 10 (11) m/kg, i. e. moderately easy to filter. The most oxidized pulp had the highest average specific filtration resistance and the lowest value for the estimated effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient, in agreement with theory...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the <b>fiber</b> length <b>retention</b> {{capacity}} of extrusion and injection molding processes for short and long kenaf fiber reinforced polypropylene composites. The composites were manufactured by adding maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and an antioxidant (Irganox) using twin-screw extrusion and injection molding processes. A higher level of fiber attrition rate was observed during the twin-screw compounding compared to that in the injection molding. During high-temperature shear mixing, both processes caused a reduction in fiber length below the calculated critical fiber length along with considerable fiber damage. The mechanical and thermal properties of the resultant composites were subsequently characterized. Cone calorimeter tests demonstrated that the peak heat release rate for the kenaf fiber composites (30. wt. %) was reduced by 37 % compared to pure polypropylene (PP). In the UL- 94 V tests, the presence of lignin in kenaf reduced the dripping time considerably, which further led to the formation of char residue after burning. Although the fiber length obtained was below the critical fiber length under high shear processing (twin-screw compounding and injection molding), effective fiber dispersion, orientation and opening led to significantly improved mechanical performance of the PP/kenaf composites, irrespective of the initial fiber length...|$|R
