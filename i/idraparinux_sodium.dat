50|$|A phase III {{trial of}} <b>idraparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> for stroke {{prevention}} {{in patients with}} AF (AMADEUS) was halted prematurely due to excessive clinically relevant and intracranial bleeding. Bleedings were particularly increased in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Sanofi discontinued the development of <b>idraparinux</b> <b>sodium</b> in favour of a biotinylated formulation of the drug called idrabiotaparinux sodium.|$|E
50|$|Idrabiotaparinux sodium is also {{administered}} once-weekly. It has {{the same}} pentasaccharidic structure as <b>idraparinux</b> <b>sodium,</b> but with biotinattached, which allows its neutralisation with avidin, an egg-derived protein with low antigenicity.Sanofi conducted three phase III trials of idrabiotaparinux sodium between 2006 and 2008 in approximately 13,550 patients. In one phase III trial (the BOREALIS-AF study), idrabiotaparinux sodium was non-inferior to warfarin in preventing the recurrent venous thromboembolism at three months in patients with pulmonary embolism and the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding was lower in the idrabiotaparinux sodium arm. The drug {{was expected to be}} filed for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in 2011. The study was prematurely terminated, and the reason remains unclear. However, Sanofi has since discontinued its development. The company announced in May 2011 that the drug is available for licensing. A systematic review found that until now there is not sufficient evidence to clarify whether idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux are as effective and safe as the standard warfarin treatment for venous thromboembolism prevention. Idraparinux or idrabiotaparinux decreased major bleeding rate significantly but had a trend to increase the all-cause mortality compared with warfarin.|$|E
