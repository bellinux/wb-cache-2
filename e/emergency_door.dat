5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York. He watches another {{man on the}} plane {{who seems to be}} following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when he comes back out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that the plane is encountering a UFO. The <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1986, four ANO gunmen hijacked Pan Am Flight 73 at Karachi Airport on its {{way from}} Mumbai to New York, holding 389 {{passengers}} and crew for 16 hours in the plane on the tarmac before detonating grenades inside the cabin. Neerja Bhanot, the flight's senior purser, was able to open an <b>emergency</b> <b>door,</b> and most passengers escaped; 20 died, including Bhanot, and 120 were wounded. The London Times reported in March 2004 that Libya had been behind the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|Captains Scarlet and Brown are {{assigned}} to escort the President to the Spectrum Maximum Security Building in New York City. However, both officers are killed when the Mysterons use their powers over matter to engineer the crash of their Spectrum Patrol Car (SPC). From Scarlet and Brown's corpses, the Mysterons create two reconstructions, which are capable of perfectly imitating their biological templates and whose only programmed purpose is to execute the threat against the President. As a first assassination attempt, Brown's duplicate physically explodes after arriving with the President at the Maximum Security Building; although the tower is completely destroyed, the President escapes with his life by activating an <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> seconds before the detonation.|$|E

25|$|The Panorama Elite III was {{the last}} in the Elite series. Improvements {{continued}} to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> and subtle changes to the front grill. The rear <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The rear lights abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the {{back to the front}} just behind the front door.|$|E
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} a parallel, {{separate}} tunnel available, airtight but unlocked <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> are usually provided which allow trapped personnel to escape from a smoke-filled tunnel to the parallel tube.|$|R

50|$|Manila {{has many}} metrobus {{companies}} such as Erjohn & Almark, Baclaran Metro Link and AC Trans. These use Japanese buses (especially Isuzu or Nissan Diesel) converted to Left-hand drive. As such, the rear and <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> are swapped.|$|R
500|$|The video commences with Cyrus, in pajamas, {{turning off}} a nightlight and falling asleep. When she wakes up, Cyrus finds {{herself on her}} bed, in a skate ramp; {{she is wearing a}} white T-shirt, a black vest, red pants and black boots. Meanwhile, skaters are using the ramp, Cyrus stands and {{performs}} the song in a confused manner. She then enters a school bus, occupied by businessmen and businesswomen, which she exits through the back <b>emergency</b> <b>door.</b> Throughout the rest of the video Cyrus is seen exploring a [...] "carnival-like" [...] setting, while dancing. Several random figures make appearances, such as astronauts, scuba divers, middle school teachers, and cowboys. A large star pattern falls and reveals a concert stage where Cyrus performs the song along with a band. In the conclusion of the video, Cyrus is woken up by an alarm clock and a printer prints stills from what occurred throughout the music video. The music video to [...] "Start All Over" [...] was first seen on the Disney Channel on December 19, 2007. It became digitally available, via iTunes Store, on January 29, 2008. In 2008, the video received a MuchMusic Video nomination for Best International Artist Video, but lost to Rihanna's video for [...] "Don't Stop the Music." ...|$|E
2500|$|McDonnell Douglas {{developed}} the blended wing concept {{in the late}} 1990s, and Boeing presented it during an annual Joint AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEA Propulsion Conference in 2004. The McDonnell Douglas engineers believed their design had several advantages, but their concept, code named [...] "Project Redwood" [...] found little favor at Boeing after their 1997 merger. The most difficult problem they solved was that of ensuring passengers a safe and fast escape {{in case of an}} accident, since <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> locations were completely different from those in a conventional aircraft.|$|E
60|$|Steven {{slipped into}} the house through the <b>emergency</b> <b>door.</b> He {{made his way to}} the kitchen with great care, walking on tip-toe. He punched the kitchen {{controls}} at random, his heart beating excitedly. The stove began to whirr, purring into life. Meter readings came on, crossing toward the completion marks.|$|E
5000|$|On March 8, 2017 an Ameristar Jet Charter MD-83 (N786TW) {{slid off}} the runway at Willow Run Airport in high winds during an aborted takeoff. The {{passengers}} exited through <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> onto wings and slides without injures, but there was extensive damage to the aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} collision, {{the captain of}} Flight 954 {{received}} reports of a fire aboard the CV-880; he shut down the engines and ordered an immediate emergency evacuation. The crew opened the four <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> and deployed the emergency slides, and all aboard the plane were successfully evacuated in about five minutes without further incident.|$|R
50|$|The captain {{tried to}} land the plane on the sea, but the {{depressurising}} cabin and the failing circuits made that impossible. Additionally, smoke was seeping into the cockpit. Left with no other option, the crew issued life jackets and opened the <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> to ensure a quick escape as the plane plunged into the sea below.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the stove}} opened, sliding out {{a tray of}} {{steaming}} dishes. The mechanism clicked off, dying into silence. Steven grabbed up {{the contents of the}} tray, filling his arms. He carried everything down the hall, out the <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> and into the yard. The yard was dark. Steven felt his way carefully along.|$|E
50|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> {{initially}} {{remained behind}} the cab, but was subsequently repositioned {{close to the}} rear.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} of the train has a dual-colour colour scheme of dark blue and white. They feature the SBS Transit logo in white. The serial numbers of the trains are marked {{on the right side}} of the train at the front and rear. Both the windshield wipers and <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> were specially designed for the LRT.|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of the Montreal Children's Hospital at 2300 Tupper Street officially closed at 11:00 on May 24, 2015, after 68 patients were successfully transferred to the new Glen Site at 1001 DÃ©carie Boulevard. The new Glen Site Montreal Children's Hospital opened its <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> at 5 AM. The Glen Site is composed of different hospital centres.|$|R
25|$|Each bus is {{constructed}} with passengers' safety in mind. For example, the body frame {{is constructed}} using Galvanyl (Zn - Fe Alloy), {{a strong and}} rust-resistant metal. There are also eight or ten glass-shattering hammers mounted {{on some of the}} window frames, and three <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> for fast evacuation during an emergency. There are also two fire extinguishers at the front and back of the buses.|$|R

50|$|Dubbed the Classic 2000, the all-new {{conventional}} {{featured a}} structural redesign distinguished by a fully vertical rear body, enlarged rear <b>emergency</b> <b>doors,</b> entry doors, a redesigned windshield, and an all-new drivers area (sharing nearly all its controls with the Wayne Lifeguard). In {{place of the}} Crown FE was the Carpenter Chancellor. Initially introduced as a front-engine transit, the Spartan-chassis Chancellor featured all of the structural changes of the Classic 2000.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{evacuation}} slides {{do not use}} a slide bustle on {{the door}} as a container. Instead, the slide is [...] "fuselage mounted" [...] and {{is attached to a}} container located underneath or below the exit close to the aircraft exterior. This design of slide is found in the Airbus A321 aircraft at the <b>emergency</b> <b>doors,</b> and typically at all overwing evacuation slides other than the Boeing 747-400 series aircraft.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} the Valuk has been built with a rear ramp with an <b>emergency</b> <b>door</b> instead of two doors. The vehicle can also be {{equipped}} with a capstan type cable winch.|$|E

50|$|The stadium {{was built}} in 1978 and renovated in 2012, adding a new stand roof, new floodlights, new sounds system, {{sanitary}} installations and also ticket booths. After SC Fortuna KÃ¶ln promotion to 3. Liga, in 2014 it was renovated again by adding a partition between home and away fans, new <b>emergency</b> <b>doors,</b> wavebreakers, a video surveillance system and improvement of the security services. A plan to further renovate the stadium was projected for 2015.|$|R
50|$|ITS system {{software}} performs different scenarios {{based on data}} are gained from installed sensors and switches. For example, in a fire situation according to fire location which is identified by special cables, required jet fans would start to work, <b>emergency</b> <b>doors</b> would be opened at risk area and cameras would {{be focused on the}} incident place, then VMS would show escape ways. Other scenarios would be performed by ITS system in case of accident, flood, power outage etc.|$|R
