5000|$|One way to {{increase}} the temperature, and thus the specific impulse, is to isolate the nuclear fuel elements so {{they no longer have}} to be of the rigid fuel rod type. This is the basis of the particle-bed reactor, also known as the fluidized-bed, dust-bed, or rotating-bed design. In this design the fuel is placed in a number of (typically spherical) elements which [...] "float" [...] inside the hydrogen working <b>fluid.</b> <b>Spinning</b> the entire engine forces the fuel elements out to walls that are being cooled by the hydrogen. This design increases the specific impulse to about 1000 seconds (9.8 kN·s/kg), allowing for thrust-to-weight ratios greater than 1:1, although at the cost of increased complexity. Such a design could share design elements with a pebble-bed reactor, several of which are currently generating electricity.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to regions of bistability, the 3 m water experiments also revealed {{the presence of}} precession-driven flows (Triana et al. 2012). When {{the inner and outer}} spheres are locked together and spun up to some constant rotation rate, one might expect the flow to come to a state of solid body rotation with the spheres. However, the laboratory is not an inertial frame since the Earth is rotating. Thus, the axis of the experiment is precessing, completing one revolution a day. This precession of the experiment’s rotation axis drives the spin-over mode, which can be understood as the <b>fluid</b> <b>spinning</b> in a state of solid-body rotation but with an axis that lags that of the experiment itself. Effectively, the fluid retains some “memory” of the previous orientations of the rotation axis. The structure and strength of the observed flows were consistent with the presence of a spin-over mode driven by precession. Since many planetary bodies, including the Earth, exhibit significant amounts of precession of their rotation axes, analogous flows can be expected in their liquid cores. Precessional forcing has been proposed as an energy source for dynamos, including the geodynamo (Malkus 1968).|$|E
40|$|A {{vortex ring}} is a torus-shaped vortex {{consisting}} of a region of <b>fluid</b> <b>spinning</b> around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. It is an important phenomenon in animal kingdom and engineering applications. Birds and flying insects use buoyant vortex ring to glide higher altitudes; squid and jellyfish produce vortex rings during propulsion; vortex rings also participate in the blood flow through the human hearts. With {{the help of the}} vortex ring, animals can move fast and produce large thrust. In engineering, the Underwater Compressed Air Energy Storage (UWCAES) system uses surplus electricity to compress air into flexible accumulators (balloons) to store energy underwater. Balloons of stored compressed air may rupture when over-pressurized or pierced by a sharp object. This may generate a large-scale buoyant vortex ring, leading to water surface disruptions and undesirable waves. As a result, it is a necessity to study the hydrodynamics of a buoyant vortex ring. This work presents three papers to {{have a better understanding of}} the fluid dynamics of a buoyant vortex ring. The first two papers focus on the flow behavior of a buoyant vortex ring and the third paper studies the vortex rings’ influence on the ambient fluid (flow behind a buoyant vortex ring). The first paper characterized the formation conditions of a buoyant vortex ring and its transition behavior from a laminar to a turbulent vortex ring. It is followed by a paper investigating the flow characteristics of a buoyant vortex ring experimentally, including rising velocity, ring radius, relative core size, circulation and the energy development of a buoyant vortex ring. The final paper analyzed the wake of a vortex ring by simplifying that the core of a vortex ring is solid. This part of the work was conducted in a closed loop wind tunnel...|$|E
