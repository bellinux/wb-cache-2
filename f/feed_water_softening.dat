40|$|DE 19823670 A UPAB: 20000112 NOVELTY - In an {{electrochemical}} <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> process, {{the entire}} volume {{of water in}} the cathode chamber is saturated by oxygen from the anode chamber. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In an electrochemical <b>water</b> <b>softening</b> process, <b>water</b> is fed to a cathode chamber and an anode chamber. Gaseous oxygen is formed in the anode chamber, and the <b>water</b> is <b>softened</b> in the cathode chamber by electrochemical and chemical reactions. The <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> to the cathode chamber has a mixer which combines the water with oxygen from the anode chamber. The entire volume {{of water in the}} cathode chamber is saturated by oxygen from the anode chamber. USE - <b>Water</b> <b>softener</b> for use especially in power stations, industrial heat exchangers and refrigeration plant. ADVANTAGE - The process uses no environmentally harmful chemicals and requires less energy than prior art...|$|R

50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in <b>water</b> <b>softener</b> that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water.

The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the <b>water</b> <b>softener.</b> Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium.
