5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, it had {{accomplished}} the only <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> assigned to it: to hold the Liège–Albert Canal line {{long enough for the}} Allied units to reach friendly forces occupying the Namur–Antwerp–Givet line. For the remainder of the campaign, the Belgians would execute their operations in accordance with the overall Allied plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{support of}} missionary work {{was also a}} {{priority}} in the 19th century. The first General Assembly requested {{that each of the}} four synods appoint and support two missionaries. Presbyterians took leading roles in creating early local and <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> societies, including the New York Missionary Society (1796), the Northern Berkshire and Columbia Missionary Societies (1797), the Missionary Society of Connecticut (1798), the Massachusetts Missionary Society (1799), and the Boston Female Society for Missionary Purposes (1800). The first denominational missions agency was the Standing Committee on Mission, which was created in 1802 to coordinate efforts with individual presbyteries and the European missionary societies. The work of the committee was expanded in 1816, becoming the Board of Missions.|$|E
5|$|Now {{that the}} war in Europe was over, plans were made to form an {{airborne}} corps comprising the 6th Airborne Division and 44th Indian Airborne Division for service against Japanese forces in the Far East. The corps would be used in operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. The division's advance party, based partly on the 5th Parachute Brigade, arrived in India in July 1945. The brigade travelled ahead {{of the rest of the}} division as it had been intended to use them for Operation Zipper, an <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> in Burma. They would have landed in Malaya, between Singapore and the Japanese forces in Burma. Reinforcements would then arrive by sea and attack northwards and southwards, while the brigade carried out another airborne landing on Singapore itself. However, following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed, and the remainder of the 6th Airborne Division were sent to Palestine. Instead of carrying out an airborne landing, the 5th Parachute Brigade travelled by sea, leaving Bombay on 9 September and arriving at Morib in Malaya on 17 September. Only the 7th and 12th Parachute battalions landed, and they re-embarked the next day to sail for Singapore as part of Operation Tiderace; they arrived on 21 September. The brigade, now part of XV Corps, became the island's garrison. In December the 23rd Indian Infantry Division was sent from Seremban to Java, and the brigade was moved to replace them.|$|E

50|$|Disapproving of General Assembly's {{decision}} not to appoint a new slate of conservatives to the Board of Foreign Missions, J. Gresham Machen, along with H.

25|$|In {{the year}} 2009 JAXA {{plans to launch}} the first {{satellite}} of the Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a subsystem of the global positioning system (GPS). Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite {{will be in a}} zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010.|$|E
500|$|Following Northern Rhodesia's {{independence}} as Zambia in October 1964—Nyasaland {{had been}} independent Malawi since July—Southern Rhodesia began referring to itself simply as Rhodesia, but Whitehall rejected this change. Perceiving Smith {{to be on}} the verge of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), Wilson issued a statement in October 1964 warning of dire economic and political consequences, and wrote to Smith demanding [...] "a categorical assurance forthwith" [...] that no UDI would be attempted. Smith ignored this, expressing confusion as to what he had done to provoke it. The UK and Rhodesian governments exchanged often confrontational correspondence over the next year or so, each accusing the other of being unreasonable and intransigent. Little progress was made when two Prime Ministers met in person in January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill's funeral. The RF called a fresh election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 [...] "A"-roll seats (elected mostly by whites). Wilson's ministers deliberately stonewalled Smith during mid-1965, hoping to eventually break him down, but this only caused the Rhodesian hierarchy to feel yet more alienated. From June, a peripheral dispute concerned Rhodesia's unilateral and ultimately successful attempt to open an <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> in Lisbon; Portugal's acceptance of this in September 1965 prompted British outrage and Rhodesian delight.|$|E

2500|$|Father Antoine La Vallette, Superior of the Martinique missions, {{borrowed}} money {{to expand the}} large undeveloped resources of the colony. But on the outbreak of war with England, ships carrying goods of an estimated value of 2,000,000 livres were captured, and La Vallette suddenly went bankrupt for a very large sum. His creditors turned to the Jesuit procurator in Paris to demand payment, but he refused responsibility for the debts of an <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> – though he offered to negotiate for a settlement. The creditors went to the courts and received a favorable decision in 1760 obliging the Society to pay, and giving leave to [...] {{in the case of}} non-payment. The Jesuits, on the advice of their lawyers, appealed to the Parlement of Paris. This {{turned out to be an}} imprudent step for their interests. Not only did the Parlement support the lower court, May 8, 1761, but having once gotten the case into its hands, the Jesuits' opponents in that assembly determined to strike a blow at the Order.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{moved to}} the 90-gun ship-of-the-line [...] in 1796 and served under Lord Howe at the Battle of the Glorious First of June in June 1794. He {{transferred}} to the 74-gun [...] and served under Sir John Jervis at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797 and, having been promoted to midshipman, he served under Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 when a crushing defeat was inflicted on the French fleet commanded by François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers. He became second lieutenant of the sloop Bordelais in January 1800 and, while escorting a convoy to the West Indies, fought an action with three French brigs, capturing one in January 1801. In the Caribbean later that year Gordon, on an <b>independent</b> <b>mission,</b> was captured by the Haitian government of Toussaint Louverture and spent four months in prison before being released by cartel. He was made first lieutenant of the 18-gun brig [...] in 1802 {{and returned to the}} West Indies. Racoons capture of the French corvette Lodi in July 1803 led to Gordon's appointment as commanding officer of HMS Raccoon in October 1803 and his promotion to commander on 2 March 1804.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the insistence}} of Wolfe Tone another French {{expedition}} was sent to Ireland in 1798. On this expedition an <b>independent</b> <b>mission</b> was assigned to James Napper Tandy. He {{was put in charge}} of the Anacreon, one of the fastest sailing corvettes in the French navy, to rush stores to Jean Joseph Amable Humbert’s forces and those Irish expected to flock to his standard. [...] Tandy chose his staff from among those who sided with him in the split with Tone’s party. Preparations for the voyage frequently brought Tandy to Paris, and as he had no fixed abode in the city he frequented the house of Colonel James Blackwell. A warm friendship sprang up between Blackwell’s wife and Tandy. She is referred to in his correspondence as “my much esteemed and amiable Friend, Mrs. Blackwell.” [...] On one such visit in August Colonel Blackwell, Tandy’s adjutant-general, introduced a young Irishman, named Murphy to him. The man proved to be a spy. [...] Also on board the Anacreon was George Orr. Formerly a reporter of parliamentary debates for the Morning Post and a tailor by trade, he too was a spy, code name Smith. Dunkirk was a town known to be infested with spies, and the British Government were well informed on the expedition’s developments. At 4pm on Tuesday, 4 September 1798, the Anacreon left Dunkirk for Ireland.|$|E

50|$|In 1892 {{he became}} a house servant of Joseph Booth, a radical and independent-minded missionary. Booth had arrived in Africa in 1892 as a Baptist to {{establish}} the Zambezi Industrial Mission near Blantyre. Booth was critical of the reluctance of Scottish Presbyterian missions to admit Africans as full church members, and later founded seven more <b>independent</b> <b>missions</b> in Nyasaland which, like the Zambezi Industrial Mission, focused on the equality of all worshippers. In Booth's household and mission where he was closely associated with Booth, Chilembwe became acquainted with Booth's radical religious ideas and egalitarian feelings.|$|R

50|$|In the denominational {{politics}} of the following decade, Macartney often advocated a more moderate approach than that favored by J. Gresham Machen. Although he initially opposed founding Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929 when Princeton Theological Seminary was re-organized by the denomination along semi-modernist lines, he agreed to serve on Westminster's board. He opposed Machen's creation of an <b>independent</b> <b>missions</b> board, and, after Machen was censured for setting up this board, Macartney also opposed Machen's Presbyterian Constitutional Covenant Union. Ultimately Macartney resigned from Westminster's board rather than go along with these developments.|$|R
