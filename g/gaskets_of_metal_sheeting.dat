40|$|Erythemal UV {{exposure}} for individuals involved in outside activities are affected according to surrounding structures {{in an urban}} environment. Occupational UV exposure {{is likely to increase}} by the effects of surrounding structures. UV reflections from surrounding structures, in this case vertical metal walls, were investigated for their influence on erythemal UV exposure in the southern hemisphere. Multiple dosimeters were placed at specific features on head forms, for three different vertical wall conditions, measured at hourly intervals, providing a more detailed representation of the effect of nearby (north facing) reflective wall, non-reflective wall and no wall on UV {{exposure for}} a construction worker facing the wall direction. Two types <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> walls were investigated, with the first type (shiny and smooth in appearance) showing results that indicate the UV reflectance from this surface can increase the average erythemal UV exposure by at least 20 % and up to an average of 50 % for certain facial positions, compared to no wall and up to 300 % compared to a non reflective wall. A second <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> type coated with colour, does not show as much influence on UV exposure for larger solar zenith angles compared to the first type <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting,</b> but for smaller solar zenith angles provides an influence that approaches similar erythemal UV exposure to that when no wall is present. The time to reach the exposure limits defined by regulatory bodies for occupational UV exposure can be decreased if the first type <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> is in proximity to an outdoor worker. The experimental method of this study leads to discussion <b>of</b> how <b>metal</b> surfaces used in the construction industry physically reflect UV radiation. The conclusion is that albedo, which is traditionally used to measure UV reflection, is not an appropriate quantity to explore UV reflection from vertical metal surfaces. This {{may be due to the}} reason that metal surfaces seem to involve specular reflection as well as diffuse reflection...|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} the {{township}} are on land that slopes up gently {{to the south of}} the mill shed. Approached along a dirt track south of the mill office, the remnants include timber stumps, concrete slabs, pieces <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting,</b> small piles <b>of</b> debris, timber and barbed- wire fencing and three electrical poles, most lying to {{the west side of the}} track.

50|$|Traditional {{homes are}} {{constructed}} by first erecting a raffia-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass {{and cover the}} whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone. Nowadays, however, this type of construction is mostly reserved for barns, storage buildings, and gathering places for various traditional secret societies. Instead, modern Bamileke homes are made of bricks of either sun-dried mud or of concrete. Roofs are <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amara was {{initially}} expected to track {{directly over the}} island of Rodrigues, prompting widespread precautionary measures and resulting in the issuance of a Class4 warning– denoting a warning of highest urgency– by the Mauritius Meteorological Services. Though the tropical cyclone eventually passed {{to the east of}} the island, Amara was close enough to Rodrigues to severely effect the island. Strong winds, peaking at a measured 152km/h (94mph) in Pointe Canon, resulted in widespread infrastructural damage, including the tearing <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> and uprooting <b>of</b> trees. Widespread power outage cut power to 12,000homes and shut off communications to and from the island.

50|$|The area {{is served}} by two Anglican churches. St. Anne's has stood on Manchester Road since its {{completion}} in 1874. St. Thomas's on Delamere Avenue, off Rake Lane, was built in 1974 to replace an earlier building on Rake Lane opposite the junction with Whitehead Road. The earlier church was built in 1898 as a 'mission church' to serve a small community of outlying farms and cottages. Composed <b>of</b> corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting,</b> it became known affectionately as “Th'owd Tin Mission” rather than St. Thomas's.|$|R

5000|$|The most emblematic {{instrument}} of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither very similar in form {{to those used}} traditionally in Indonesia and the Philippines. The valiha is considered the national {{instrument of}} Madagascar. [...] It is typically tuned to a diatonic mode to produce complex music based on harmonic, parallel thirds accompanied by a melodic bass line. [...] The strings are traditionally cut and raised from the fibrous surface of the bamboo tube itself, although a contemporary form also exists that instead uses bicycle brake cables for strings to give the instrument a punchier sound. Strings may be plucked with the fingernails, which are allowed to grow longer for this purpose. The instrument was originally used for rituals and for creative artistic expression alike.

40|$|As shown previously, the {{conventional}} testing procedure for simulating long-term migration from the <b>gaskets</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> closures into oily foods does not adequately reflect reality. It {{appears to be}} impossible to accelerate migration {{to the extent that}} the situation at the end of the shelf life of a product can be anticipated in a few days or weeks. Therefore, we investigated whether long-term migration could be extrapolated from migration rates determined for new lids. Jars were kept in the normal upright position. Since heat treatment may have a strong temporary impact, migration during the initial heating for pasteurization or sterilization and storage at ambient temperature were determined using different lids. Commercial products were recalled from sales points throughout Europe to determine the real migration over extended periods of time and for jars with differing histories. This migration was compared with data from the short-term testing to investigate whether an empirical relationship could be derived. The results show that the short-term test enables the comparison of lids and plasticizers in the initial phase of migration, but that long-term extrapolation presupposes more complex kinetic modeling. The results also demonstrate that the legal relevance of ¿official¿ testing methods should be reconsidered to avoid conflict when food contact materials comply with migration limits in the test but not in actual application.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 76 - 77. Deep drawing <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> is {{a commercially}} {{significant}} manufacturing process and {{as with all}} metal forming processes is subject to geometric defects. One defect of particular concern, termed earing, is characterised by an uneven edge to the drawn article. This work covers {{the implementation of a}} suitable constitutive model in a general purpose finite element code ABAQUS Version 5. 4 to simulate this earing phenomenon in aluminium can body stock. Earing is caused by plastic anisotropy of the blank material and anisotropy induced during the drawing process. It is the result of crystallographic textures or preferred grain orientations that develop during the sheet rolling process. In polycrystalline materials it may be modelled via either crystallographic texture models or phenomenological yield surface models. Crystallographic models have the advantage over phenomenological ones in that they are able to describe both initial and evolving anisotropy. However, they are very demanding in terms of computational power and are reported to over predict the plastic strain ratios in anisotropic materials. A phenomenological yield surface model proposed by Karafillis and Boyce was consequently selected as a suitable constitutive model to investigate the earing phenomenon. This model can describe the elasto-plastic behaviour of both isotropic and anisotropic three dimensional polycrystalline materials. It is a pressure independent yield surface which is convex in stress space and assumes an associated flow rule. It was implemented in ABAQUS as a FORTRAN 77 User-Material Subroutine. An Euler Backward integration scheme was adopted and a consistent tangent modulus used. Four axisymmetric cupping operations were simulated: two with the model's parameters set to represent the aluminium alloy under consideration and two to investigate the effect of the yield surface on earing. For comparison purposes, a fifth case was run using the Hill (1948) anisotropic material model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Two Finite Element (FE) {{models are}} built to {{simulate}} diaphragm action on light weight roof elements made <b>of</b> plywood, <b>metal</b> <b>sheeting</b> and solid wood rows. One model {{is simple and}} one is complex. The scope {{of this study is}} to verify the FE-models by full scale tests previously done. To compare the model and the tests both global and local deformations on the elements will be considered. The models will form a foundation for further development of FE- analysis based calculations for practical and scientific proposes on Lett-Tak AS. The FE-models built has not fully been verified by the tests, but the model simulates and quantifies important effects observed in the test. Among these effects are increasing of shear capacity of the plywood diaphragm because large forces are transmitted to the edge-beams. And uplift forces because of eccentricity between the plywood panels and the support joint on the edge beam. It has been shown that the configuration used to model the fasteners in the gable support overestimates the stiffness and ultimate load of the fastener. The FE-model developed in this study, a foundation for further research on the stress and strain interactions between the material components and joints...|$|R
