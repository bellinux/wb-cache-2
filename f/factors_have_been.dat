5|$|It is {{not clear}} why some {{patients}} get PTE while others with very similar injuries do not. However, possible risk <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> identified, including severity and type of injury, presence of early seizures, and genetic factors.|$|E
5|$|Several risk <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{proposed}} {{and are the}} subject of ongoing research. Due to characteristic early onset many studies have focused on parental factors around conception and during gestation. Factors investigated have included occupation (i.e. exposure to chemicals in specific industries), smoking, alcohol consumption, use of medicinal drugs during pregnancy and birth factors; however, results have been inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of {{retinopathy of prematurity}} in infants is typically suggested by the clinical setting. Prematurity, low birth weight {{and a history of}} oxygen exposure are the principal indicators, while no hereditary <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shown to yield a pattern.|$|E
40|$|Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a frequent}} condition, affecting about 15 % of women of reproductive age. Because of its familial occurrence, a multifactorial model of susceptibility, including both genetic and environmental <b>factors,</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed. However, the identification of genetic <b>factors</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> elusive...|$|R

5|$|A few ASD {{cases have}} been linked to {{exposure}} to teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) during the first eight weeks from conception. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development. Many environmental <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Bijeljina truth {{commission}} was created with a four-year mandate. It held two public hearings in 2008, but by March 2009, {{although it was}} not formally disbanded, the {{commission was}} effectively dissolved when the majority of its members resigned. A number of <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> cited as contributing to its failure, such as the inclusion of the commander of the Batković concentration camp in its delegation, its limited legal standing, disputes over the commission's scope, and poor funding.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E

5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
5|$|The {{birds were}} hunted by {{settlers}} on Réunion, who also kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling {{was reported to}} be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorder}} and {{major depressive disorder}} {{are the most common}} conditions seen at the same time; comorbidity of these in persons with AS is estimated at 65%. Reports have associated AS with medical conditions such as aminoaciduria and ligamentous laxity, but these have been case reports or small studies and no <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> associated with AS across studies. One study of males with AS found an increased rate of epilepsy and a high rate (51%) of nonverbal learning disorder. AS is associated with tics, Tourette syndrome, and bipolar disorder, and the repetitive behaviors of AS have many similarities with the symptoms of obsessive–compulsive {{disorder and}} obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. However many of these studies are based on clinical samples or lack standardized measures; nonetheless, comorbid conditions are relatively common.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription <b>factors</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found to be deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies. For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
