5|$|After a tour in Vienna, Austria and Russian {{language}} {{training at the}} U.S. Army Russian Institute in Oberammergau, Matlock arrived in Moscow {{for the first time}} in 1961. Initially a Vice Consul, Matlock met with individuals seeking to visit or emigrate to the United States. His most famous case was Lee Harvey Oswald, who applied for a repatriation loan to return to the United States after having previously moved to the Soviet Union. Indeed, according to the records received by the Warren Commission, in May 1962, Jack Matlock conducted the <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> which enabled the Oswald family to leave the USSR and return to the USA.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{hatred of}} Toby has been {{transferred}} to the new human resources representative, Holly Flax (Amy Ryan), and he and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) plan to haze her. When she playfully affects disdain for Toby, Michael takes her seriously, and suddenly {{falls in love with}} her. Taking advice from Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Michael succeeds in warming Holly up with small talk and jokes, and even tempers Toby's <b>exit</b> <b>interview,</b> which he had originally planned to be brutally insulting, because Holly attends. Dwight, however, continues the hazing, telling Holly that Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) is mentally challenged, and putting a raccoon in her car. When Michael catches Dwight trying to release a raccoon into Holly's car, he loudly proclaims his esteem for Holly. Holly gives special attention to Kevin throughout the episode due to her belief that he is mentally challenged, but Kevin believes her attention is a sexual interest in him.|$|E

Shortly afterward, Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) and Jim find a video on YouTube of Ryan being arrested for fraud in the full presence of his peers who are all recording his arrest on their cell phones and interrupt Toby's <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> to show Michael, Toby, Pam, and Holly. It is revealed that Ryan's website was floundering, so he double-counted office sales as website sales, fraudulently inflating the firm's figures.

500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was going to be happening with Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show.

During CBS' <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> with Williams, he was consistently asked if he was taking the North Carolina job instead of his current Kansas team's effort, eventually inspiring him to say to the reporter [...] "I could give a shit about North Carolina right now" [...] to the live mic. Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor. Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of {{corporate}} amnesia in commerce and industry, some organizations are turning to new techniques to preserving their organizational memory and, in particular, their tacit knowledge. The latest capture tools to get attention are the traditional corporate history, usually produced once or twice every 100 years as a public relations medium; and oral debriefing, an augmentation of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic <b>exit</b> <b>interview.</b> Instead of hagiography, organizational memory is being produced as an induction and educational tool that transmits long-term information. Oral debriefing, which concentrates on short- and medium-term memory, targets exiting and key occupant employees, recurring corporate events, and important projects in detailed testimony of participants. Both are designed to extract tacit knowledge in an easily accessible format that also generates the [...] "lessons of history". Its permanent character also means that it {{does not have to be}} continually reproduced, just updated, and that its necessary re-interpretation alongside changing circumstances is predicated on a more reliable evidential base.|$|E

Megan appeared on all fourteen episodes of the first season and is featured {{at the center of}} the season one poster. On the first episode when she was asked what she would do with the money if she won the competition, she stated that she wants to help [...] "mentally challenged" [...] dogs, and that she adopted a mentally challenged dog, a chihuahua named Lily. She quit the competition in the thirteenth episode (the finale) when it was revealed that she would have to face a jury of former contestants whom she had a part in eliminating. She finished the competition in third place. Hauserman stated in her <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> that she was happy with her decision to quit not only because it stopped her contestants from getting the satisfaction of payback, but also that she was happy that she stopped everyone she didn't want to win the money and that she was satisfied with whoever won the money in the top three. Hauserman also stated that she never thought that she would win the money, and that she came simply to have fun and play the game to the best of her ability. On the I Love Money reunion special, Megan said that there were no rules opposing the way she played the game, so she used her brain to out-smart people, because it was her given talent.|$|E

It is vital to the reintegration process and quality of life of our veterans to assess their needs as a priority over the feedback and inquiry of potential changes the military can make in the future for active military members, considering many veterans suffer from mental and physical illnesses and combat injuries. These war acquired injuries leave many veterans without adequate resources, facing homelessness and utilizing unhealthy coping mechanisms. Which should concern and require action on the part of social workers in carrying out our professional values, fulfilling the needs that are not met and a potential role in a multidisciplinary team. This study seeks to explore the veteran’s perspective on the helpfulness of <b>exit</b> <b>interviews</b> and how these interviews may better serve the health and mental health needs of veterans returning to a civilian lifestyle. The research findings suggest that military exit interviewers are not as helpful as they could be in regard to veteran reintegration into society.

5000|$|An <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> is {{a survey}} {{conducted}} with an individual who is separating from an organization or relationship. Most commonly, this occurs between an employee and an organization, a student and an educational institution, or a member and an association. An organization can use the information gained from an <b>exit</b> <b>interview</b> to assess what should be improved, changed, or remain intact. More so, an organization can use the results from exit interviews to reduce employee, student, or member turnover and increase productivity and engagement, thus reducing the high costs associated with turnover.

40|$|HIV {{counseling}} and testing (HCT) has been prioritized {{as one of}} the prevention strategies for HIV/AIDS, and promoted as an essential tool in scaling up and improving access to treatment, care and support especially in community settings. Home-based HCT (HBHCT) is a model that has consistently been found to be highly acceptable and has improved HCT coverage and uptake in low- and middle-income countries since 2002. It involves trained lay counselors going door-todoor offering pre-test {{counseling and}} providing HCT services to consenting eligible household members. Currently, there are few studies reporting on the quality of HBHCT services offered by lay counselors especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa. This is a quantitative descriptive sub-study of a community randomized trial (Good Start HBHCT trial) which describes the quality of HBHCT provided by lay counselors. Quality of HBHCT was measured as scores comparing observed practice to prescribed protocols using direct observation. Data were collected through periodic observations of HCT sessions and <b>exit</b> <b>interviews</b> with clients. Counselor quality scores for pre-test counseling and post-test counseling sessions were created to determine the level of quality. For the client <b>exit</b> <b>interviews</b> a continuous score was created to assess how satisfied the clients were with the counseling session. A total of 196 (3 %) observational assessments and 406 (6 %) client <b>exit</b> <b>interviews</b> were completed. Overall, median scores for quality of counseling and testing were high for both HIV-negative and HIV-positive clients. For <b>exit</b> <b>interviews</b> all 406 (100 %) clients had overall satisfaction with the counseling and testing services they received, however 11 % were concerned about the counselor keeping their discussion confidential. Of all 406 clients, 393 (96. 8 %) intended to recommend the service to other people.
