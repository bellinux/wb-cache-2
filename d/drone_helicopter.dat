50|$|Slightly {{faster and}} {{larger than the}} escort destroyers they succeeded, the Dealey class were fitted with twin-mounted 3-inch guns, ASW rockets, a depth charge rack and 6 depth charge {{launchers}}. There were later modernisations that removed the ASW rockets and the depth charges in favor of nuclear-capable anti-submarine rocket launchers and torpedo mounts which fired lighter homing torpedoes. A large SQS 23 sonar was refitted in a bow sonar dome {{and most of the}} class were also fitted with a hangar and landing pad for DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopters</b> to deliver MK 44 and Mk 46 torpedoes. The <b>drone</b> <b>helicopters</b> proved very unreliable and their failure contributed to the relatively short life of the class.|$|R

50|$|The leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Skate Rat and Drone Hat. In Skate Rat, one team member must skate using an {{electric}} skateboard and complete a slalom course while carrying two trays of stacked cans. If they can complete the slalom course without falling down or disturbing {{the balance of the}} stacked cans, they would receive their next clue. In Drone Hat, one team member had to pilot a remote controlled <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> and land it on a helipad placed on a helmet worn by their teammate. Once the <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> had landed, they would receive their next clue.|$|E
50|$|In a 19 November 1996 demonstration, a Stinger (ATAS) Block-1 missile was {{launched}} from an OH-58D piloted by CPT Bob Blanchett at Yuma Proving Ground and successfully destroyed a QUH-1 <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> deploying countermeasures {{at a range}} greater than 4,500 meters.|$|E
50|$|In May 1963, {{she entered}} the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. Stickell {{surrendered}} her anti-aircraft warfare electronics equipment {{in return for the}} latest in ASW gear, including ASROC missiles and DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopters.</b> Early in 1964, she rejoined the Atlantic Fleet in Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 12 as a straight DD. Home ported at Newport, Rhode Island, she became the flagship of DesDiv 122. Following refresher training in April, she became a unit of the midshipman training squadron and made a cruise to northern European ports in June and July. From August to November, she served with the Atlantic Anti-submarine Warfare Forces; then she deployed to the Mediterranean until March 1965.|$|R

5000|$|... "Gyrodyne" [...] {{was granted}} as a {{trademark}} to the Gyrodyne Company of America in 1950. The company {{was not involved}} in gyrodyne development, but instead produced a turbine-engined, remotely piloted <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter,</b> with coaxial rotors, for the United States Navy, designated as the QH-50 DASH.|$|E
50|$|The Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH (Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter) is a small, <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{built by}} Gyrodyne Company of America {{for use as}} a {{long-range}} anti-submarine weapon on ships that would otherwise be too small to operate a full-sized helicopter. It remained in production until 1969. Several are still used today for various land-based roles.|$|E
5000|$|This class {{derived from}} its {{predecessor}} [...] to be fitted with the QH-50D DASH, the new anti-submarine <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{in return for}} the removal of the ASROC system. And similarly, it mainly tasked with Anti-submarine warfare. In 1969, after the production of the QH-50D ceased, this class was no longer built and construction of the Yamagumo-class resumed.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1967, the Noa {{received}} two QH-50 DASH <b>drone</b> antisubmarine <b>helicopters.</b> She then served as school ship for the Fleet Sonar School at Key West (28 January - 11 February). [...] "Operation Springboard" [...] {{took her to}} the Caribbean 3-11 March and she steamed in Mediterranean waters June through November.|$|R
50|$|The DC-130 {{program was}} {{eventually}} discontinued {{in the early}} 2000s, as it was deemed too expensive to support. Launching a single drone required the maintenance {{and support for the}} DC-130, the drones, and unless the drone was permanently expended during a live-fire missile shoot, the <b>drone</b> recovery <b>helicopters</b> (USN SH-3 and/or USAF CH-53/HH-53).|$|R
5000|$|Left-wing {{opposition}} MPs {{requested a}} vote regarding the continued presence of French forces in Afghanistan, which was reaffirmed by the National Assembly on 22 September. Prime Minister François Fillon {{claimed to have}} [...] "learnt {{the lessons of the}} ambush", and announced further military deployment, amounting to about 100 men with <b>drones</b> and <b>helicopters.</b>|$|R
50|$|SEAMOS owed much to DASH, {{and in fact}} a {{modified}} QH-50D {{was used as the}} SEAMOS demonstrator prototype. Like the original DASH, SEAMOS was a coaxial-rotor <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> with twin landing skids, though it was unsurprisingly a more refined system, and in particular even had a real fuselage. SEAMOS was powered by an Allison 250-C20W turboshaft engine with 315 kW (420 shp).|$|E
5000|$|This upgrade {{included}} {{rebuilding the}} ship's superstructure, engines, electronic systems, radar, sonar, and weapons. The No.2 twin 5-inch turret was removed, as were all World War II torpedo launchers and 3-inch twin mounts. Upgraded systems included SQS-23 sonar, SPS-40 air search radar, two triple Mk 32 torpedo launchers, 8-cell ASROC box launcher, and QH-50C DASH ASW <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter,</b> {{with its own}} landing pad and hangar. http://www.gyrodynehelicopters.com/fram.htm ...|$|E
50|$|This class {{comprised}} {{the second generation}} of post-World War II destroyer escorts. These ships can be considered developmental vessels as many new systems were installed to test for future use, such as a new hull design, larger bow-mounted AN/SQS-26AX sonar system, and ASW weaponry. This class was a new design from the keel up, incorporating the FRAM improvements, and was specifically designed to operate the DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter.</b> The sonar was later upgraded to the AN/SQS-26AX(R).|$|E
2500|$|By April 18, Coalition forces {{managed to}} take a quarter of Sadr City, which was made up mostly of the {{southern}} outskirts of the slum. However, {{they were not able}} to move in any further. For the next week, US <b>drones</b> and <b>helicopters</b> continued to attack Mahdi Army forces launching mortars or placing roadside bombs.|$|R
50|$|In December 1959, after 15 {{years of}} {{destroyer}} service, {{she entered the}} Norfolk Naval Shipyard where she underwent modernization (FRAM). Four years later, in April 1963, she put into Boston for further modernization, receiving this time a <b>Drone</b> Antisubmarine <b>Helicopter</b> deck. Following these yard periods she resumed her hunter-killer exercises in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.|$|R
25|$|Fighters for a Free North Korea has {{considered}} improving their GPS capabilities {{to better understand}} their balloons' movements. Since early 2015, <b>helicopter</b> <b>drones</b> {{have been used to}} distribute materials.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the class}} except Dealey, Cromwell and Courtney were {{upgraded}} in the 1960s by adding facilities for the DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter,</b> with a hangar and helicopter deck replacing the aft 3-inch gun mount and the longer-ranged SQS-23 sonar replaced the SQS-4. The three unmodified ships were fitted with a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). All ships had their Squid or Weapon Alpha launchers removed late in their US Navy career, while Mark 32 torpedo tubes for Mark 44 or Mark 46 anti-submarine torpedoes were fitted.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Hazelwood began {{extensive}} {{testing of}} helicopters for antisubmarine warfare both in Narragansett Bay {{and out of}} the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Maryland. Assigned to the Destroyer Development Division, she participated in tests on equipment used with radar and electronic counter-measure systems. Her primary research and development work involved the testing of the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH). Hazelwood provided on board testing facilities, and helped make possible the perfection of DASH, an advanced and vital ASW weapons system. In August 1963 alone, the <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> made 1,000 landings on the versatile destroyer's flight deck.|$|E
5000|$|In Hellenic Navy service, {{the ship}} was renamed Miaoulis after a 19th-century Greek naval hero. In Greek service, Miaoulis {{initially}} operated an Aérospatiale Alouette III helicopter instead of the DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> used by the US Navy. [...] She was modernized from November 1986, with the ship's variable-depth sonar removed, and an enlarged flight deck and a larger, telescoping hangar fitted to allow a Agusta-Bell AB-212 helicopter to be operated. {{was active in the}} Hellenic Navy until 1992, when she was decommissioned and struck from the active roster.|$|E
50|$|William R. Rush {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of 1966 on operations off the eastern seaboard, ranging from Newport to the Virginia Capes, pursuing a well-rounded slate of exercises including, among others, such areas as gunfire support and ASW. Early in 1967, the ship enhanced her capabilities as an ASW destroyer by receiving two <b>Drone</b> Antisubmarine <b>Helicopters</b> (DASH) and becoming fully qualified in DASH operations.|$|R
5000|$|Drydocked during August and September for {{hull and}} sonar dome repair, Wiltsie put to sea soon {{afterwards}} for tests and trials of her DASH (<b>drone</b> antisubmarine <b>helicopter)</b> qualification system which ended successfully on 3 November. The destroyer subsequently participated in Operation [...] "Union Square", an extensive fleet exercise, {{before returning to}} San Diego {{to prepare for the}} ship's 14th WestPac deployment.|$|R
25|$|This major {{overhaul}} {{was intended to}} extend a warships' service life and improve sensor and weapon systems. Begun on 28 May, Carpenter received <b>drone</b> antisubmarine <b>helicopter</b> (DASH) support equipment, anti-submarine rocket (ASROC) weapons, and, since the 3-inch/70s had proved a maintenance disaster, a dual 5-inch/38 mount forward. Communication, radar, and sonar upgrades were installed along with general equipment improvements and a helicopter refueling system.|$|R
50|$|The Air-to Air Stinger ATAS is an {{adaptation}} of the man portable Stinger System. It is a light weight missile designed to engage low altitude targets. A major milestone in {{the improvement of the}} Air-to-Air Stinger (ATAS) Block-1 missile was demonstrated on 19 November 1996 at Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. An OH-58D piloted by CPT Bob Blanchett, US Army Test and Evaluation Command (TECOM), successfully acquired, tracked, engaged, and destroyed a QUH-1 <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter</b> deploying countermeasures at a range greater than 4500 meters. This firing also demonstrated the capabilities of the improved missile to successfully engage a target without the requirement for super- elevation.|$|E
50|$|The 46 {{ships of}} the Knox class were the largest, last and most {{numerous}} of the US Navy’s second-generation ASW escorts. The lead ship {{of the class}} was , laid down 5 October 1965 and commissioned on 12 April 1969, at Todd Shipyards in Seattle. Planned as the follow-on to the twin 5-inch gun armed s and the Tartar missile-equipped s, their initial design incorporated the prior classes' pressure-fired boilers in a similar-sized hull designed around the massive bow-mounted AN/SQS-26 sonar, with increased endurance and reduced crew size. Anti-submarine armament was to consist of ASROC anti submarine missiles together with the DASH <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter,</b> while defensive armament {{was to be the}} RIM-46 Sea Mauler short range anti-aircraft missile backed up by a single 5-inch gun.|$|E
50|$|After {{her return}} from Europe in August 1958 she began 16 months of {{training}} and experimental work with the Destroyer Development Group designed to increase her fighting capacity for the modern navy. In March 1960 she entered Boston Naval Shipyard to begin a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul, which included extensive refitting and the installation of a helicopter landing deck and hangar aft. Emerging with a greatly increased life span, the ship took part in antisubmarine exercises in January 1961, {{including the use of}} the new DASH antisubmarine <b>drone</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Hugh Purvis then sailed 8 March for her sixth deployment to the Mediterranean. During this cruise the fleet stood by for any eventuality during a deepening of the Berlin Crisis. The ship returned to Newport 4 October 1961.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{completing}} FRAM in June 1962, {{the ship}} sailed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for refresher training. She {{was back in}} Newport, Rhode Island, for two weeks before hastily departing for the Cuban Quarantine Operations. In 1963, after a midshipmen cruise to Halifax, Nova Scotia, Charles H. Roan was the third ship in the Atlantic Fleet to qualify with DASH (<b>Drone</b> Anti-Submarine <b>Helicopters),</b> and the first ship to use these helicopters operationally.|$|R
50|$|As {{explained}} in the sixth episode, some of the birds were imprinted on a human and filmed from an ultralight plane; others were filmed with a <b>helicopter</b> <b>drone.</b> Some other footage resulted from tiny cameras being strapped to the backs of birds.|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} the {{following}} year, Meredith, reassigned to DesRon 14, was slated for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization). Entering the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, on 28 June 1960, she remained for a year and two days during which time her bridge was enclosed, her torpedo deck was modified to allow the installation of ASROC, and her seven-year-old 3 inch battery was replaced by a helicopter hangar and flight deck to accommodate the QH-50 DASH (<b>Drone</b> Anti-Submarine <b>Helicopter)</b> weapons system.|$|R
