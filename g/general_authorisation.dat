40|$|South Africa faces {{significant}} inequities {{in access}} to and use of water for productive purposes. The National Water Act seeks to address these inequities and introduced a public rights system where water {{is owned by the}} people of South Africa and held in custody by the state. This public trust doctrine forms the basis for the State to give effect to its constitutional obligation for redress. Compulsory licensing is a mechanism to proactively reallocate water on a catchment basis to achieve redress, {{while at the same time}} promoting economic efficiency and ecological sustainability. During compulsory licensing, all users are required to reapply for their water use entitlement, and a process is followed to allow for a fairer allocation of water between competing users and sectors. Some concerns have been raised that equity may not be achieved through compulsory licensing as historically disadvantaged individuals may not have the capacity to partake in the process. Similarly, the administrative burden of processing large numbers of licences from small scale users may cripple licensing authorities. Moreover, the compulsory licensing process, while encouraging Historically Disadvantaged Individuals (HDIs) to apply, may have little impact on poverty if the poorest are not able to participate in the process. <b>General</b> <b>authorisations</b> are proposed as a way of addressing these concerns by setting water aside for specific categories of users.

40|$|This article unravels {{the notions}} of justice in {{statutory}} water law in Sub-Saharan Africa in general and South Africa in particular. These laws, which allocate and regulate water resources, are licence (or permit) systems. Three forms of injustices are identified for small-scale water users who typically encompass all poor water users: the reinforcement of the historical injustices by which colonial powers captured ownership of water resources and undermined customary water law; administrative discrimination {{as a result of}} governments’ lack of capacity to license the large numbers of small-scale users; and discrimination of the smallest-scale users whose exemption from the obligation to apply for a licence relegates them to a second-class entitlement to water. Based on the texts and implementation experiences of the National Water Act (1998) and the pro-poor prioritisation rules in the National Water Resource Strategy- 2 (2013), the authors propose the transformative legal tool of priority <b>General</b> <b>Authorisations</b> for black small-scale users to overcome these injustices. Via this tool all black small-scale users, including the poor, would obtain equal access to minimum quantities of water needed to progressively achieve constitutional rights to water, food, and non-discrimination, while the remaining water resources would be allocated to high-impact users through licences with strict and enforceable conditions...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of recent {{technological}} developments, identical services can now be transmitted using telecommunication infrastructure and broadcast using the radio frequency spectrum. Traditional broadcasting and telecommunications services have evolved beyond that which was envisaged by the legislators of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth). Further, new hybrid services have emerged which do not comfortably fit within the existing regulatory framework. The July 2005 merger of the former Australian Broadcasting Authority (the “ABA”) and Australian Communications Authority (the “ACA”) to form the new Australian Communications and Media Authority (the “ACMA”) is a powerful acknowledgment of the convergence of the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. The ABA, formerly limited to the governance of the broadcasting sector, and the ACA, formerly limited to the governance of the telecommunications sector, have now {{been replaced by the}} ACMA which has been entrusted with the responsibility of regulating both these industries. In light of this merger of institutional governance, {{the purpose of this article}} is to consider whether the next necessary step is the replacement of the present sector-specific broadcasting and telecommunications laws with a common regulatory framework applicable to both industries. In this regard, the new scheme for the regulation of ‘electronic communications’ introduced in the European Union in 2003 provides some useful insights. The framework largely replaces sector-specific legislation with a system of <b>general</b> <b>authorisations</b> which applies both to the telecommunications and broadcasting. The purpose of the article is to: (1) Outline the present sector-specific regulatory framework applying to the Australian broadcasting and telecommunications industries; (2) Consider the regulatory problems associated with convergence; (3) Analyse the operation of the new European Union regulatory framework; (4) Analyse the Australian law reform discourse to date with respect to the effects of the convergence of the broadcasting and telecommunications industries; and (5) Consider the extent to which the European Union model offers insights on addressing the remaining identified problems flowing from the convergence of the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors. 27 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Marriage in Scotland is {{recognised}} in {{the form}} of both civil and religious unions between individuals. Historically, the law of marriage has developed differently in Scotland to other jurisdictions in the United Kingdom {{as a consequence of the}} differences in Scots law and role of the separate established Church of Scotland. These differences led to a tradition of couples from England and Wales eloping to Scotland, most famously to marry at border towns such as Gretna Green. The legal minimum age to enter into a marriage in Scotland is sixteen years and does not require parental consent at any age. There is a distinction between so called religious marriages, conducted by an authorised celebrant, and civil marriages, conducted by a state registrar but anyone over the age of 21 can apply to the Registrar <b>General</b> for <b>authorisation</b> to conduct a marriage under s12 of the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 and no form of religious ceremony is necessary.|$|R

The Society organises training, mentoring and performance reviews of celebrants, and submits names of celebrants to the Registrar <b>General</b> annually for <b>authorisation.</b> Prior to the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, the Society performed a similar role for celebrants to conduct same-sex commitment ceremonies and weddings, although formal authorisation by the Registrar is not required for these ceremonies since they {{had no effect on}} the legal status of individuals concerned. Since the legalisation of same-sex marriages, both sets of same-sex and opposite-sex marriages are treated the same way.|$|R

40|$|Dual-use {{items are}} goods and {{technologies}} that have both civil and military uses. In the European Union their export is controlled and governed by an EC regulation since the year 2000. Its implementation, {{in terms of}} legislation, export authorisations and customs controls, remains the responsibility {{of each of the}} 27 Member States. For reasons linked to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, competition in trade and free market rules, it is ‘desirable to achieve a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the EU in order to promote EU and international security and to provide a level playing field for EU exporters’ – as stated in the regulation. How far is the goal? Hard to say since no official data about the trade of dual-use items are shared among Member States, nor with the European Commission, Directorate General Trade, in charge of the dual-use regulation. This report presents sources of generic, statistical trade data and a methodology to create an approximate picture of extra-EU trade flows of dual-use items. The data stem from goods’ declarations made by exporters to customs authorities as part of the normal export process for any commodity. The data are collected at national level, aggregated by categories of goods, and made public in web data services on trade. The data are referred to a commodity classification system, the Combined Nomenclature (CN), in use for customs controls in the EU. However the CN is only indirectly related to dual-use items. Correspondence tables exist that map dual-use items to CN descriptors, but they introduce approximations in the description of the items traded. For this reason the CN trade data provide, in the general case, upper bounds to the real trade volume of dual-use items. Notwithstanding this limitation, the CN trade data may prove useful for a number of issues and assessments needed for export controls. One example is presented in this report. It concerns the estimation of extra-EU trade flows for dual-use chemicals under consideration for inclusion in a Union <b>General</b> Export <b>Authorisation</b> (EU GEA). EU GEAs define a framework valid in all EU Members States whereby the export of selected categories of dual-use items to specific destination countries with a low-risk of diversion is automatically authorised. An analysis of the volume of exports based on CN trade data allows estimating the impact expected for EU exporters by including given dual-use chemicals in an EU GEA. To facilitate the estimation of extra-EU trade flows, it is proposed to develop a dedicated Information Technology tool merging lists of export-controlled items with correspondence tables of CN items’ descriptors and export data. Such a tool can become a design and evaluation instrument to assess the economic impact of alternative policy options to regulate the European dual-use trade. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} and national programs classify substances that are persistent (P or very P), bioaccumulative (B or very B), toxic (T), {{or have the}} potential for long-range transport. The oldest of these programs is the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. More recent programs address persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) properties for chemicals in <b>general</b> (Registration, Evaluation, <b>Authorisation</b> and Restriction of Chemicals, REACH; EC 253 / 2011) and plant protection products (PPPs) (EC 1107 / 2009). However, these programs used different criteria for categorization. We critically assessed the criteria and process used in the categorization of PPPs and noted that EC 1107 / 2009, in contrast to the Stockholm Convention or REACH, offers no process for carrying out a further, more refined assessment of those pesticides that are identified as having PBT properties. Thus, in contrast to REACH, few basic screening criteria are used for final-step management decisions. Guidance on the selection of data is not provided, and the criteria used are unclear. For example, no guidance is given as to how the half-lives in soil, water, and sediment should be derived and the term ‘half-life’ is not clearly defined. Large amounts of useful data on environmental and toxicological properties are available for PPPs but most of this is not used in the categorization, for example, photolysis in water, water-sediment, and on soil, important environmental degradation processes particularly relevant to pesticides. The criteria for bioaccumulation and toxicity appear to be focused only on aquatic ecosystems and do not address the terrestrial compartment which is particularly relevant for pesticides and potentially relevant for PBT considerations. The categorization process under EC 1107 / 2009 could be made more efficient and reduce false negatives and positives if a formal weight of evidence approach was applied to multiple lines of evidence. This paper presents these ideas and how they can be incorporated into the framework for categorization to better classify plant protection products in terms of persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity.|$|R
40|$|Wheeler, Nicholas J., (2008) Operationalising the Responsibility to Protect. The Continuing Debate {{over where}} Authority should be Located for the Use of Force. NUPI Report. Oslo, NUPI. 27 sider. Responsibility to Protect no. 3. This report {{focuses on the}} {{question}} of where authority should be located for the use of force. This question has been a matter of considerable controversy since NATO unilaterally employed force to protect the Kosovars in March 1999. At the heart of this debate has been {{the question of whether the}} UN Security Council should be the only body that can authorise the use of force for humanitarian purposes. Or alternatively, are there substitutes for Security Council authority that can and should be invoked ? both legally and morally ? in cases where the Council is either unable (because of the power of the veto) or unwilling (because of the lack of majority support in the Council) to act to prevent or end mass atrocities. Restricting itself to a focus on the military dimension of R 2 P, this report identifies seven models of authority which span the boundary from consent to non-consensual action. These are: (1) consent freely given; (2) coerced and induced consent; (3) Security Council authorisation; (4) the Security Council as a global jury; (5) General Assembly authorisation; (6) Regional arrangements; and (7) coalitions of the willing. The level of controversy regarding the legitimacy and legality of using force for protection purposes increases as intervention moves into the non-consensual realm. Even if governments disagree about the efficacy of using force, it is recognised that sovereign states have the right to request such assistance. Indeed, the UN Secretary-General and his advisors have identified assisting (the military component is only one dimension here) states in fulfilling their responsibilities for protection as a key goal in operationalising the 2005 Outcome Document. However, as my report argues, the boundary between consent and non-consent is an imprecise one, and it is necessary to recognise that consent for military deployments is often secured through the threat of coercive pressures (as with the case of East Timor in September 1999) as well as inducements in the form of rewards. From the seven models of authority identified, five are ones that might be employed by governments in cases where a target state is ?manifestly failing? to protect its population from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity? (as set out in paragraph 139 of the Outcome Document). The least controversial here is Security Council authorisation, but the proclivity of the Council to interpret Article 39 of Chapter VII as permitting such uses of force is a recent normative development, and one that should not be underestimated when set against the Security Council?s narrow statist interpretation of Article 2 (7) during the Cold War. Nevertheless, the report points out that whilst the new norm of Security Council authorised protection has enabled interventions that were previously unthinkable, this has not ensured that action has been taken when it was most desperately needed such as in Rwanda, and more controversially in Darfur. There is also the possibility that future cases might see the Council reversing this expansive interpretation of Chapter VII, and many governments in the Non-Aligned Movement remain sensitive about the Council expanding its competence into matters that were previously covered by Article 2 (7) of the Charter. The report explores the potential of <b>General</b> Assembly <b>authorisation</b> when the Security Council is deadlocked (as could have happened if Western governments had sought a mandate for intervention in Darfur). However, this poses a host of problems that will caution governments, especially those with a vested interest in maintaining the authority of the veto from pressing their claims in this body. The legitimacy that would flow from an affirmative vote in the General Assembly is the strongest argument here, but critics of the Assembly who favour vesting authority in a ?concert of democracies? would reply that decisions on whether to save endangered peoples should not rest with an Assembly that is comprised of a large number of governments that do not have good human rights credentials in their own jurisdictions. The above criticism opens up the much larger question of UN reform but advocates of R 2 P have not been afraid to enter this terrain. The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty argued in 2001 that the five permanent members of the Security Council (P 5) should limit the exercise of the veto in cases where there was majority support for a resolution authorising intervention for human protection (unless vital interests were at stake). However, such a proposal would not resolve divisions between the P 5 such as those that arose over Kosovo because what was at stake in the latter case was not a capricious Russian and Chinese threat to veto NATO?s action but genuine differences of opinion over whether the use of force was warranted. Moreover, what made the Kosovo case such a difficult one for the Council was that NATO was seeking a mandate (though it never tabled a formal resolution) to use force to prevent what it argued was an impending humanitarian catastrophe. Justifying preventive or anticipatory intervention for protection purposes is extraordinary difficult because action will always lack the legitimacy that comes from media reports of mass atrocities. This seems an inescapable problem and certainly one that will not be resolved by any of the proposed reforms to the Security Council?s working methods or practices. Consequently, we are left with the prospect of future Kosovo-type situations where the permanent members (perhaps expanded beyond the P 5) are divided on the merits of military action. Yet the Security Council?s handling of the Kosovo case might also offer the best precedent for how the international community should cope with future cases of this kind. The lesson of Kosovo, and especially the abject defeat of the Russian draft resolution condemning the bombing, is that Council members are not ready to legally sanction armed intervention for humanitarian purposes that lacks express Council authorisation. But neither will they always condemn it. A majority of Council members were persuaded that NATO?s breach of the strict procedural rules of the UN Charter should be excused and in this sense it operated an international equivalent to mitigation in domestic law. By contrast with those liberal interventionists who wish to establish the principle that coalitions of the willing have the authority to consider using force in cases where the Security Council is paralysed from acting, the Kosovo model of the Security Council as a global jury has the virtue of not directly challenging the Council?s authority whilst also preserving an emergency exit when it is ?manifestly failing? to protect populations from genocide and mass killing...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of nitrification and denitrification in a two-stage biological filter in {{the removal of}} ammonia from sanitary landfill leachate, using plastic media, was investigated. A pilot-scale biological filter constituted of leachate from Weltevreden sanitary landfill was built. During the first 25 weeks of the investigation no external carbon source was added. To facilitate denitrification methanol {{was added to the}} pilot-scale. The first 9 weeks of the study was characterised by the raw leachate that had an average pH value of 8. 89 ± 0. 13, an ammonia-nitrogen concentration of 450 ± 20 mg N L - 1 and a COD concentration of 1600 ± 116 mg O 2 L - 1. The change in raw leachate characteristics resulted in the decrease of pH and alkalinity which necessitated the addition of soda-ash (Na 2 CO 3) to achieve complete nitrification in the first stage of the pilot-scale. A decrease in ammonia-nitrogen was noted from 200 ± 10 to 2 ± 2 mg N L - 1 and a 99 % ammonia removal was therefore recorded after Stage 1. In Stage 2, denitrification took place after the addition of the methanol at a methanol:nitrate ratio of 1. 23 : 1.
