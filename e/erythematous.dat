5|$|Seborrheic {{dermatitis}} is a chronic, superficial, {{inflammatory disease}} characterized by scaling on an <b>erythematous</b> base.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is a common, chronic, and {{recurrent}} {{inflammatory disease}} of the skin characterized by circumscribed, <b>erythematous,</b> dry, scaling plaques.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, <b>erythematous</b> plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with a spider bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general <b>erythematous</b> rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E
25|$|Fissured tongue with atrophy of the {{filiform}} papillae and a lobulated, <b>erythematous</b> {{appearance of}} the tongue.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} {{that can cause}} similar symptoms include: cellulitis, a sebaceous cyst and necrotising fasciitis. Cellulitis typically also has an <b>erythematous</b> reaction, but does not confer any purulent drainage.|$|E
25|$|Lupus erythematosus, with lesions more {{commonly}} {{occur on the}} palate and appear as centrally ulcerated or <b>erythematous</b> with radiating white striae. In contrast, OLP and lichenoid reactions rarely occur on the palate, and the striae are randomly arranged rather than radial.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of a rash may aid diagnosis; associated signs and symptoms are diagnostic of certain diseases. For example, the rash in measles is an <b>erythematous,</b> morbilliform, maculopapular rash that begins {{a few days after}} the fever starts. It classically starts at the head, and spreads downwards.|$|E
25|$|An <b>erythematous</b> rash in sun-exposed {{parts of}} the body has been {{reported}} to occur in 7.3–21.2% of persons taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. One study examined the tolerability of various malaria prophylactic regimens and found doxycycline did not cause a significantly higher percentage of all skin events (photosensitivity not specified) when compared with other antimalarials. The rash resolves upon discontinuation of the drug.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms may {{not appear}} until some {{days after the}} bites have occurred. Reactions often become more brisk after {{multiple}} bites due to possible sensitization to the salivary proteins of the bed bug. The skin reaction usually occurs {{in the area of}} the bite which is most commonly the arms, shoulders and legs as they are more frequently exposed at night. Numerous bites may lead to an <b>erythematous</b> rash or urticaria.|$|E
25|$|Neurological {{problems}} following tick bites {{were recognized}} {{starting in the}} 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A large, ring-shaped rash was also noted, although the doctors did not relate it to the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström {{was the first to}} propose EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by <b>erythematous</b> skin lesions.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} comes {{mostly from}} the history and examination, but the following special investigations may be involved: blood tests (vitamin deficiency, anemia, leukemia, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV infection, diabetes) microbiological swabs (infection), or urinalysis (diabetes). A biopsy (minor procedure to cut out {{a small sample of}} the ulcer to look at under a microscope) with or without immunofluorescence may be required, to rule out cancer, but also if a systemic disease is suspected. Ulcers caused by local trauma are painful to touch and sore. They usually have an irregular border with <b>erythematous</b> margins and the base is yellow. As healing progresses, a keratotic (thickened, white mucosa) halo may occur.|$|E
25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed denture sore mouth, denture stomatitis, chronic atrophic candidiasis, Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis, and denture-associated <b>erythematous</b> stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a denture. In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people. Denture-related stomatitis {{is the most common}} form of oral candidiasis (a yeast infection of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete upper denture (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw). Denture-related stomatitis is more likely to develop when the denture is left constantly in the mouth, rather than removing it during sleep, and when the denture is not cleaned regularly.|$|E
25|$|On 18 August, {{three more}} death cases were {{confirmed}} {{and brought the}} number of death cases in Malaysia to 67. A 33-year-old woman was transferred to ICU after her lungs disease began to deteriorate after 4 days of treatment in a private hospital. She showed symptoms on 31 July and antiviral drugs were started on 7 August. On 12 August, she died due to bronchopneumonia. Her result later came back and was positive for the flu. A 10-year-old school girl, who was diagnosed with Systemic lupus erythematosus was sent to ICU after she had breathing difficulty, chest pain and stomach ache. Antiviral drugs were given since 8 July. Despite on medicine, she died on 13 August due to Systemic lupus <b>erythematous</b> with severe pneumonia with renal impairment. A 71-year-old woman with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, Ischaemic heart disease and Diabetes mellitus type 2, showed symptoms of the flu and was hospitalised on 12 August. However, on 14 August, she died due to Ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy precipitated by pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|In health, the dorsal {{surface of}} the tongue is covered in tuft like {{projections}} called lingual papillae (some of which are associated with taste buds), which give the tongue an irregular surface texture and a white-pink color. Geographic tongue is characterized by areas of atrophy and depapillation (loss of papillae), leaving an <b>erythematous</b> (darker red) and smoother surface than the unaffected areas. The depapillated areas are usually well demarcated, and bordered by a slightly raised, white, yellow or grey, serpiginous (snaking) peripheral zone. A lesion of geographic tongue may start as a white patch before the depapillation occurs. In certain cases there may be only one lesion, but this is uncommon; the lesions will typically occur in multiple locations on the tongue and coalesce over time to form the typical map-like appearance. The lesions usually change in shape, size and migrate to other areas, sometimes within hours. The condition may affect {{only part of the}} tongue, with a predilection for the tip and the sides of the tongue, or the entire dorsal surface at any one time. The condition goes through periods of remission and relapse. Loss of the white peripheral zone is thought to signify periods of mucosal healing.|$|E

A reddish [...] "halo" [...] surrounds the ulcer. The size, number, location, healing time, and periodicity between episodes of ulcer formation are all dependent upon the subtype of aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
500|$|Periodontal abscesses {{are less}} common than apical abscesses, {{but are still}} frequent. [...] The key {{difference}} between the two is that the pulp of the tooth tends to be alive, and will respond normally to pulp tests. However, an untreated periodontal abscess may still cause the pulp to die if it reaches the tooth apex in a periodontic-endodontic lesion. A periodontal abscess can occur as the result of tooth fracture, food packing into a periodontal pocket (with poorly shaped fillings), calculus build-up, and lowered immune responses (such as in diabetes). [...] Periodontal abscess can also occur after periodontal scaling, which causes the gums to tighten around the teeth and trap debris in the pocket. Toothache caused by a periodontal abscess is generally deep and throbbing. The oral mucosa covering an early periodontal abscess appears <b>erythematous</b> (red), swollen, shiny, and painful to touch.|$|E

2500|$|Conditions {{defined as}} [...] "over-exposure" [...] to borax dust can cause {{respiratory}} irritation, while no skin irritation {{is known to}} exist due to borax. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal distress including nausea, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Effects on the vascular system and human brain include headaches and lethargy, but are less frequent.

2500|$|Antigens {{known as}} superantigens can induce toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS). [...] This group includes the toxins TSST-1, and enterotoxin type B, which causes TSS associated with tampon use. [...] Toxic shock syndrome {{is characterized by}} fever, <b>erythematous</b> rash, low blood pressure, shock, multiple organ failure, and skin peeling. [...] Lack of antibody to TSST-1 plays {{a part in the}} pathogenesis of TSS. Other strains of S. aureus can produce an enterotoxin that is the causative agent of a type of gastroenteritis. This form of gastroenteritis is self-limiting, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea one to six hours after ingestion of the toxin, with recovery in eight to 24 hours. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major abdominal pain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis includes oral lichen planus, <b>erythematous</b> candidiasis, leukoplakia, lupus erythematosus, glossitis, and chemical burns. Atrophic glossitis is usually distinguished from {{benign migratory glossitis}} {{on the basis of}} the migrating pattern of the lesions and the presence of a whitish border, features which are not present in atrophic glossitis, which instead shows lesions which enlarge rather than migrate. Rarely, blood tests may be required to distinguish from glossitis associated with anemia or other nutritional deficiencies. Since the appearance and the history of the condition (i.e. migrating areas of depapillation) are so striking, there is rarely any need for biopsy. When biopsy is taken, the histopathologic appearance is quite similar to psoriasis: ...|$|E
2500|$|Vancomycin is {{recommended}} {{to be administered}} in a dilute solution slowly, over at least 60 min (maximum rate of 10mg/min for doses >500mg) due to {{the high incidence of}} pain and thrombophlebitis and to avoid an infusion reaction known as the [...] "red man syndrome" [...] or [...] "red neck syndrome". This syndrome, usually appearing within 4 to 10min after the commencement or soon after the completion of an infusion, is characterized by flushing and/or an <b>erythematous</b> rash that affects the face, neck, and upper torso. These findings are due to interaction of vancomycin with MRGPRX2, a GPCR mediating IgE-independent mast cell degranulation. Less frequently, hypotension and angioedema may also occur. Symptoms may be treated or prevented with antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, and are less likely to occur with slow infusion.|$|E
2500|$|Linear {{arrangements}} of these papules is common (referred to as a Koebner phenomenon), {{especially on the}} forearms, but may occasionally be grouped, though not confluent, on flexural areas. [...] Generally, the initial lesions are localized, and remain so, to the chest, abdomen, glans penis, and flexor aspects of the upper extremities; however, less commonly, the disease process can (1) be strictly isolated to the palms and soles, presenting with many hyperkeratotic, yellow papules that may coalesce into plaques that fissure or “...sometimes a non-specific keratoderma resembling chronic eczema,” or (2) become more widespread, with papules widely distributed on the body—the extensor surfaces of the elbows, wrists, and hands, folds of the neck, submammary region in females, groin, thighs, ankles, and feet—and fusing into <b>erythematous,</b> minimally scaled plaques, with reddness that develops tints of violet, brown, and yellow.|$|E

It is present in over-the-counter topical acne treatments at 2% or less concentration, and in prescription treatments at higher concentrations. Weak, watery solutions of resorcinol (25 to 35 g/kg) are useful in allaying the itching in <b>erythematous</b> eczema. A 2% solution used as a spray has been used with marked effect in hay fever and in whooping cough. In the latter disease 0.6 mL of the 2% solution has been given internally. It can be included as an anti-dandruff agent in shampoo or in sunscreen cosmetics. It has also been employed {{in the treatment of}} gastric ulcers in doses of 125 to 250mg in pills, and is said to be analgesic and haemostatic in its ...|$|E
2500|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} (also termed recurrent aphthous stomatits, RAS, and {{commonly called}} [...] "canker sores") {{is a very}} common cause of oral ulceration. 10–25% {{of the general population}} suffer from this non-contagious condition. The appearance of aphthous stomatitis varies as there are 3 types, namely minor aphthous ulceration, major aphthous ulceration and herpetiform ulceration. Minor aphthous ulceration is the most common type, presenting with 1–6 small (2-4mm diameter), round/oval ulcers with a yellow-grey color and an <b>erythematous</b> (red) [...] "halo". These ulcers heal with no permanent scarring in about 7–10days. Ulcers recur at intervals of about 1–4months. Major aphthous ulceration is less common than the minor type, but produces more severe lesions and symptoms. Major aphthous ulceration presents with larger (>1cm diameter) ulcers that take much longer to heal (10–40days) and may leave scarring. The minor and major subtypes of aphthous stomatitis usually produce lesions on the non-keratinized oral mucosa (i.e. the inside of the cheeks, lips, underneath the tongue and the floor of mouth), but less commonly major aphthous ulcers may occur {{in other parts of the}} mouth on keratinized mucosal surfaces. The least common type is herpetiform ulceration, so named because the condition resembles primary herpetic gingivostomatitis. Herpetiform ulcers begin as small blisters (vesicles) which break down into 2-3mm sized ulcers. Herpetiform ulcers appear in [...] "crops" [...] sometimes hundreds in number, which can coalesce to form larger areas of ulceration. This subtype may cause extreme pain, heals with scarring and may recur frequently.|$|E
50|$|<b>Erythematous</b> (atrophic) {{candidiasis}} is {{when the}} condition appears as a red, raw-looking lesion. Some sources consider denture-related stomatitis, angular stomatitis, median rhombiod glossitis, and antiobiotic-induced stomatitis as subtypes of <b>erythematous</b> candidiasis, since these lesions are commonly erythematous/atrophic. It may precede {{the formation of a}} pseudomembrane, be left when the membrane is removed, or arise without prior pseudomembranes. Some sources state that <b>erythematous</b> candidiasis accounts for 60% of oral candidiasis cases. Where it is associated with inhalation steroids (often used for treatment of asthma), <b>erythematous</b> candidiasis commonly appears on the palate or the dorsum of the tongue. On the tongue, there is loss of the lingual papillae (depapillation), leaving a smooth area.|$|E
