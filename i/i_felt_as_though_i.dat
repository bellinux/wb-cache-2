2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don’t know," [...] {{said the}} mate awkwardly. [...] "Something {{seemed to come}} over me all of a sudden, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> MUST do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|While thus one spoke, {{the other}} spirit mourn'd [...] With wail so woful, that at his remorse [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should have died. I turned ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just think, Hugh, it's {{actually}} England!" [...] she cried, as {{we stood}} on the wet deck. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'd been there before.|$|R
60|$|For {{the moment}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> seven pounds of crushed ice had been neatly {{applied in the}} form of a {{compress}} to my lower stomach.|$|R
6000|$|Now when I, Hubert, {{heard these}} words, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> my heart would burst within my breast and knew not what to say. So to gain time I asked her: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{reached out}} my hand and took him by the collar. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{grasping}} some unclean insect, from whom the sting might shoot out at any moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first time}} I saw you," [...] he went on, [...] "the {{likeness}} struck me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were meeting some one whom I had known all my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The blind; it {{is quite}} up. When I got here it was half down, then someone pulled it up. That's what {{finished}} me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had been hit {{on the head with}} a stick." ...|$|E
6000|$|My heart {{suddenly}} seemed to stop beating. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{the end of}} the world had come. With the light of triumph ablaze in his narrow black eyes, Mr. Cullen was standing by our table! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{kissed her}} gently. But <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{she had gone}} to heaven, and that the face I beheld enshrouded were merely her effigy. Commonplace words were inappropriate, yet it was to these I resorted.|$|R
6000|$|Now, when I {{heard these}} words <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a spear had been thrust through me. [...] "Steinar! Oh! surely not {{with my brother}} Steinar," [...] I gasped, and {{staggered}} against the door-post, where I stood like {{one who has been}} struck helpless.|$|R
6000|$|While thus one spoke, {{the other}} spirit mourn'd [...] With wail so woful, that at his remorse [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should have died. I turn'd [...] Stone-stiff; {{and to the}} ground, fell like a corse.|$|E
60|$|There I {{stood and}} hesitated, {{trembling}} in every limb; I dared not open the door. No words of mine can convey {{the sense of}} utter desolation that overpowered me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were the only living man in the whole world.|$|E
6000|$|I {{walked over}} to the bedside, and leaned reverently over the still figure. Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were turned to stone. The blood in my veins ran cold, I {{staggered}} back. My gaze had been met with an upturned glassy stare from a pair of wide-opened, deep-set eyes! ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{as she did}} {{not seem}} to understand, I began to talk of other things, but from that moment <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a veil swung between me and Iduna. Her beauty held my flesh, but some other part in me turned away from her. We were different.|$|R
5000|$|Lustig {{considers}} Maniac Cop 2 to be {{his best}} film, saying, [...] "It was the film where <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> myself and my crew were really firing on all cylinders. And I think we made a terrific B-movie", and also thinks it's superior to the first Maniac Cop film.|$|R
5000|$|The theatre {{historian}} Nikolai Drizen (in his 1929 essay) quoted Alexey Pleshcheyev as saying: [...] "Reading Twilight, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Turgenev's aura was embracing me... The same placid {{poetry of}} prose, these wondrous descriptions of nature..." [...] The story that impressed him most was [...] "Easter Eve", according to Drizen.|$|R
60|$|I, who, {{in view of}} Schultz's psychology, {{knew how}} true that must be, admit that I was appalled. So this was how a perfidious destiny took {{advantage}} of a generous impulse! And <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were an accomplice in this perfidy, since I did {{to a certain extent}} encourage Jasper. Yet I had warned him as well.|$|E
6000|$|Here all prostrated themselves, save I alone, {{and prayed}} in silence. When they rose again, {{in a whisper}} I asked of Kari where was the god. To which he answered: [...] "Nowhere, yet everywhere." [...] This I thought a true saying, and indeed so solemn was that place that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{surrounded}} by that which is divine.|$|E
6000|$|I shrugged my {{shoulders}} and turned away. No one came to let me out, but I undid the bolts myself, and stepped into my taxicab with a little breath of relief. Somehow or other <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had escaped from a danger which I could not define, and yet which I had felt with every breath I had drawn in that damp, unwholesome-looking house! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{somebody}} was pouring funk {{out of a}} can {{down the back of}} my neck. My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of what the disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy--sky high! I was utterly left. There was the gold in the coffee-room--my only possession on earth. How would it all work out? The general effect was of a gigantic unmanageable confusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, love," [...] he said, [...] "don't fret; I {{feel quite}} myself again. I fear I made {{a fool of}} myself. I haven't learnt to bear misfortune and dishonour as I should yet, and, like Job, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> God had forsaken us. But, as I said, His will be done. What is the next move, I wonder? Ah! we shall soon know, for here comes our friend Frank Muller." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whin I roused, the dhrink was dyin' out in me, an' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a she-cat had {{littered}} in my mouth. I had {{not learned}} to hould my liquor wid comfort in thim days. 'Tis little betther I am now. 'I will get Houligan to pour a bucket over my head,' thinks I, an' I wud ha' risen, but I heard some wan say: 'Mulvaney {{can take the}} blame av ut for the backslidin' hound he is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the first}} hour of that night I did not sleep a wink, my mind was so troubled. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were not really Bernard's wife, but {{some sort of a}} {{guardian}} angel who was watching over him to see that somebody else made him happy. After I had thus been in the depths of grief for a long while, I became angry.|$|E
60|$|But, {{man being}} a perverse animal, instead of rejoicing at my {{complete}} success, I beheld it with astounded and indignant eyes. There was something cynical in that unconcealed alteration, the true Jacobus shamelessness. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had been cheated in some rather complicated deal into which I had entered against my better judgment. Yes, cheated without any regard for, at least, {{the forms of}} decency.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I’ll do what I can for you," [...] {{said the}} seaman. [...] "If you’re in love, you ain’t {{responsible}} for your actions. I {{remember the first time}} I got the chuck. I went into a public-house bar, and smashed all the glass and bottles I could get at. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> must do something. If you were only shorter, I’d lend you some clothes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Chris Difford said [...] "it {{actually}} {{sounds like}} Jools Holland playing on it. It's a breathtaking solo by Paul. Piano playing {{does not get}} any better than that. When we recorded this <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'd finally arrived, that I was in a proper band with real men. Glenn's guitar sounds very Scotty Moore, with a distant amplifier. It's reminiscent of one of Glenn's earlier solos from when we were younger and a great way to end an album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whin I roused, the dhrink was dyin' out in me, an' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a she-cat had {{littered}} in my mouth.

60|$|After this, when I {{came to the}} Old Bailey {{and glanced}} up it towards Newgate, I found that the prison had an {{inconsistent}} look. There seemed to be some unlucky inconsistency in the atmosphere that day; for though the proportions of St. Paul's Cathedral are very beautiful, it had an air of being somewhat out of drawing, in my eyes. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the cross were too high up, and perched upon the intervening golden ball too far away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Philip," [...] she whispered, [...] "thank God! There it goes, all {{his great}} {{offering}} to me! It's {{like the man}} and his motto--'A man may do what he will with his own.' Only last night <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> would give anything in the world never to stand upon the stage of that theatre again. He doesn't know it, Philip, but his is a precious gift." ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{distance}} I heard a hippopotamus splash faintly, then the owl hooted {{again in a}} kind of unnatural screaming note {Endnote 4}, and the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees, making a heart-chilling music. Above was the black bosom of the cloud, and beneath me swept the black flood of the water, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> and Death were utterly alone between them. It was very desolate.|$|E
60|$|Once more I trotted {{up to my}} room, {{changed into}} unseasonable unbrushed grey tweeds, put studs into a clean shirt, dug out fresh socks, handed the whole {{garniture}} over to Ipps, {{and returned to the}} hall just in time to hear Stalky say, 'I'm a stockbroker, but I have the honour to hold His Majesty's commission in a Territorial battalion.' Then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> might be beginning to be repaid.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{turned and}} ran, or rather waddled, for in that gear I could not run, {{out of the}} chamber until the rock wall beyond stayed me, and there, with my back towards her, thrust my helmeted head against it, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> red-hot bradawls had been plunged into my eyes. So I stood while she laughed and mocked behind me until at length I heard the door close and the blessed {{darkness}} came like a gift from Heaven.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{we waited}} for a long while; {{it may have been}} two hours, or three, or four. At least I knew that, {{although}} I could see nothing, the solemnity of that place sank into my soul. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the dead were moving about me in the silence. I think it was the same with Martina, for although the night was very hot in that stifling, airless valley, she shivered at my side. At last <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> her start and heard her whisper: ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MusicRadar, Delson stated that the album would feature more guitar solos. He further stated that [...] "this is from someone who was quoted early on as saying I hated them. Not that I hated them as a listener; I just don’t want to play any; I shirked guitar solos. Early on, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the songs we were making aesthetically didn't want them. This new batch of songs, to me, always want solos. I feel like every song has one." ...|$|R
