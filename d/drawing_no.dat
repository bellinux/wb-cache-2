The Open Cup match was played on June 2, with United beating Real Salt Lake 2–1, thanks an Andy Najar-goal after extra time. Three days later, the two sides would play again at the same venue, with the teams <b>drawing</b> <b>no</b> goals apiece.|$|E
500|$|Mohun had {{remained}} US commercial agent throughout this time, {{and insisted on}} <b>drawing</b> <b>no</b> pay from the Belgian government for his services, though he did receive $5000 from the Société Anonyme Belge pour le commerce du Haut-Congo. [...] Although he never held a commission in the Belgian Army during this, and later expeditions, he would often wear a uniform to maintain discipline amongst his men. [...] Mohun is quoted as saying, {{of the reason for}} choosing to assist the Belgian military operations, that [...] "I prefer killing Arabs in the interior to killing time at Boma". [...] In 1894, he was awarded honorary membership of the Société Royale Belge de Géographie (Royal Belgian Geographical Society), and Leopold I appointed him a chevalier of the Royal Order of the Lion for his accomplishments in the slaver war. [...] Mohun also received decorations from the United Kingdom and France for his work in the Congo. [...] Mohun's stated priority in the Congo was to improve conditions for the inhabitants by bringing them within the Belgian sphere of influence. [...] He also claimed that the popular image of Belgian brutality in the region was a lie spread by missionaries—a statement contradicted by evidence of unnecessary cruelty by Belgian troops.|$|E

2500|$|Reaction to the League {{formation}} {{was generally}} skeptical of its non-partisan nature.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to towns, every New England state has incorporated cities. However, cities are {{treated in the}} same manner as towns under state law, differing from towns only in their form of government. Most cities are former towns that changed to a city form of government because they grew too large to be administered by a town meeting. However, even that distinction has become somewhat blurred in recent years. Cities are typically governed by a mayor (and/or city manager) and city council or other similar arrangement. In common speech, people often generically refer to communities of either type as [...] "towns", <b>drawing</b> <b>no</b> distinction between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Approached by Batman-editor Mark Chiarello, Bolland {{was asked}} whether {{he would like to}} draw Batman covers for a new title, [...] Jumping at the chance, he remarks that [...] "there was a misunderstanding" [...] {{resulting}} in his being unaware of the first issue being scheduled, resulting in [...] "the superb Dave Johnson" [...] <b>drawing</b> <b>No.</b> 1 instead, and Bolland joining at issue No. 2. Bolland's first two covers were coloured by editor Chiarello, but from issue No. 5 to No. 47 (his last) they were coloured by the artist himself.

Three days late, with a crew filled out from seaman volunteers from a local Naval brig released from minor offenses, the ship got underway from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation {{in the early hours of}} 27 October in an unescorted dash across the Atlantic to join the convoy. Contessa, loaded with only 738 tons of gasoline and bombs, overtook the convoy on 7 November.

60|$|For a while Gertrude was occupied, to the {{exclusion}} of everything else, in trying to keep her place, but when Prescott turned the team on to a stretch of smooth short grass she began to look about. It was a clear, cool morning, the sky was a wonderful blue, and bluffs miles away showed up with sharp distinctness.

Then Gertrude examined the rig, as the man had called it, which struck her as remarkably light and fragile; and the same thing was noticeable about the harness.
