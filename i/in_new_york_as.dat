5|$|NY326 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> a connector highway between Union Springs and Auburn. However, its original alignment followed Oakwood Road and Genesee Street from the hamlet of Oakwood to downtown Auburn. It was realigned in the mid-1970s to end at US20 and NY5 west of downtown Auburn. In 1981, NY326 was rerouted between the hamlets of Oakwood and Half Acre to follow Half Acre Road. NY326's former routing between the two points is now maintained by Cayuga County.|$|E
5|$|NY370 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> a Red Creek–Liverpool highway, replacing NY40 west of Cato and New York State Route37 from Cato to Baldwinsville. From Liverpool to Syracuse, modern NY370 was initially part of NY57, a route that continued north from Liverpool to Oswego. That route was eliminated in 1982, at which time NY370 was extended eastward to Syracuse over NY57's former routing. Other minor changes, namely a series of realignments west of Victory, have also occurred in the years since NY370 {{was assigned}}.|$|E

ZGF and Olin had competed against the team of Robert Murase, SERA Architects, and Christian Moeller.

5|$|East Midwood was {{organized}} in 1924 by Jacob R. Schwartz, a dentist who {{was concerned that}} his two sons had no nearby Hebrew school which they could attend. From the start his intention had been to create a Conservative synagogue: Conservative Judaism {{was seen as a}} compromise between Orthodox and Reform, providing the familiar (and lengthy) Hebrew services of Orthodox Judaism, but, like Reform, adding some English prayers. East Midwood differed from earlier Ashkenazi synagogues <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>as</b> services were to be conducted in Hebrew and English only (not Hebrew and Yiddish), and the members were to come from immigrants from all over Europe, not just one city or region.|$|E
5|$|He {{grew up in}} the Uranienborg {{neighbourhood}} in the West End of Oslo, {{and enrolled}} at the Royal Frederick University in 1933. Following law studies, he graduated in 1939 with a cand.jur. degree, and travelled to the United States to study at Columbia University in New York. From 1940 to 1945, during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, he was employed at the Norwegian general consulate in New York City. He worked as a foreign affairs journalist for the conservative newspaper Aftenposten from 1946 to 1948 and for the Norwegian News Agency from 1949 to 1953. He was a press attaché for the Norwegian United Nations delegation in 1953 and 1954. After that, he was stationed <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> a foreign correspondent and radio chronicler for Norway.|$|E
5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court struck down a law of this type <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> {{a violation of the}} First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{oversaw the}} {{creation}} of a formal garden and his wife oversaw decorating the interior. Mrs. Longfellow purchased several items from Tiffany's <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> well as $350 worth of carpets. They installed central heating in 1850 and gaslight in 1853. During their time in the house, the Longfellows hosted famous artists, writers, politicians and other luminaries who were attracted to Longfellow's hospitality and fame. Specific visitors included Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, singer Jenny Lind, and actress Fanny Kemble. Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil also visited the house privately and requested the company of Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell. Mr. and Mrs. Longfellow also raised their three daughters and two sons in the home. Longfellow and his wife stayed in the home until their respective deaths but spent their summers after 1850 in Nahant, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|NY333 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> a spur connecting U.S. Route15 (US15, now NY415) in Campbell to the hamlet of Risingville in the town of Thurston. It remained unchanged until April1, 1997, when ownership and maintenance of the route was transferred from the state of New York to Steuben County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In the switch, NY333 and nearby NY432, both maintained by the state, were given to Steuben County in exchange for maintenance of NY415 from Meads Creek Road in Coopers Plains (northwest of Painted Post) to Babcock Hollow Road in Bath as well as for maintenance of Hamilton Street (the original routing of NY17) between US15 and Gang Mills. NY333 was redesignated as CR333 as a result.|$|E
5|$|This {{interest}} {{had expanded}} by June 1953, when Hope recorded <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>as</b> {{part of a}} quintet led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson. Critic Marc Myers suggested that the six songs the band recorded were {{the first in a}} new form of jazz, 'hard bop', that became highly influential. That 1953 session also helped Hope gain exposure with Blue Note Records' producer Alfred Lion, who supervised his debut recording as a leader around a week later. This resulted in the 10-inch album Elmo Hope Trio, which had Morris alumni Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The tracks recorded illustrated, in critic Kenny Mathieson's view, that Hope was interested in the architecture and aural detail of the music more than in individual virtuosity. A further Blue Note recording session 11 months later led to Elmo Hope Quintet, Volume 2.|$|E
