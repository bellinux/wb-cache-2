5|$|The <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> started {{early in}} the morning when skirmishes broke out in a bar, which led to an Arsenal fan being stabbed. Later in the day, Galatasaray fans {{occupied}} City Hall Square before heading towards Arsenal fans in bars nearby. The Galatasaray fans were later attacked from behind by members of British hooligan firms seeking revenge for the Istanbul stabbings. Despite deploying 2,000 officers to the area and having prior warning of potential trouble, the police were unable to control the riot until they fired tear gas at the rioters. This led to 19 injuries, including 4 stabbings, and 60 arrests with similar events occurring in England and Turkey {{in the aftermath of the}} riots.|$|E

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} of the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed {{that he had seen}} Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later had seen him walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, {{which can only be}} prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E
5|$|Late {{that night}} the generals held a council of war in which Floyd and Pillow {{expressed}} satisfaction with the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> but Buckner convinced them that they had little realistic chance to hold the fort or escape from Grant's army, which was receiving steady reinforcements. General Floyd, concerned he would be tried for treason if captured by the North, sought Buckner's assurance {{that he would be}} given time to escape with some of his Virginia regiments before the army surrendered. Buckner agreed and Floyd offered to turn over command to his subordinate, Pillow. Pillow immediately declined and passed command to Buckner, who agreed to stay behind and surrender. Both Generals Floyd and Pillow left to leave General Buckner to surrender to the Union Forces. Pillow and Floyd were able to escape, as did cavalry commander Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest.|$|E
60|$|That evening, as the Plumfield boys {{sat on the}} steps, as usual, in {{the mild}} September moonlight, they {{naturally}} fell to talking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

5|$|On February 11, Buckner relayed {{orders to}} Pillow from Floyd to release Floyd's and Buckner's troops to operate {{south of the}} river, near Cumberland City, {{where they would be}} able to attack the Union supply lines while keeping a clear path back to Nashville. However, this would leave the Confederate forces at Fort Donelson heavily outnumbered. Pillow left early on the morning of February 12 to argue these orders with General Floyd himself leaving Buckner in charge of the fort. After hearing sounds of {{artillery}} fire, Pillow returned to Fort Donelson to resume command. After the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Buckner remained at Fort Donelson to command the Confederate right. With the arrival of Grant's army, General Johnston ordered Floyd to take any troops remaining in Clarksville to aid in the defense of Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Mavis starts dating {{the equally}} shy Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield), {{but it remains}} platonic. Jerry dies {{of a heart attack}} in 1975 before being able to express his romantic intentions. She meets {{salesman}} Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) the following year. They date, but the relationship is strained by Derek's interfering mother, who believes that Mavis is not good enough for her son. The relationship remains non-committal until 1983, when another man competes for Mavis's hand, the artistic Victor Pendlebury (Christopher Coll). Mavis is torn as she likes both but chooses Derek in the end. On their wedding day in 1984 Mavis has second thoughts about marrying Derek and jilts him at the altar. Her guilt turns to indignation when she learns that Derek– feeling the same way she does– did not attend the ceremony either. Derek goes on to an unhappy marriage with Angela Hawthorne (Diane Fletcher), but in 1986 he begins wooing Mavis again, realizing he made a mistake when he let her go. Mavis eventually decides Derek is the man for her and the couple marry in September 1988. The other residents of Coronation Street consider Mavis and Derek something of a joke, but neither care as they are genuinely in love. They spend evenings reading aloud to each other and discussing the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> They remain happy despite the occasional problem, but their happiness is cut short in 1997 when Derek dies suddenly of a heart attack after a road rage incident. Devastated, at his funeral Mavis chastises those who mocked her marriage over the years.|$|E

25|$|The {{faithful}} {{revisit the}} <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> through public reading of specific Psalms and the Gospels, and singing hymns about Christ's death.

25|$|His {{curiosity and}} {{interest}} in scientific observation were stimulated by his uncle Francesco, while his grandfather's keeping of journals set an example which he was to follow {{for most of his}} life, diligently recording in his own journals both the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> his visual observations, his plans and his projects. The journals of Leonardo contain matters as mundane as grocery lists and as remarkable as diagrams {{for the construction of a}} flying machine.|$|E

25|$|That evening, a {{group of}} the Queen's opponents met to discuss the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Most were {{concerned}} over the Queen's attempt to restore {{the power of the}} crown. Some annexationists, like Henry Baldwin, urged moderation but others, like Lorrin A. Thurston urged the complete overthrow of the monarchy. A plan of action was created by the group, including the creation of a Committee of Safety, the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a provisional government, and the petitioning for annexation to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{television}} {{personality and}} comedian Willie Revillame {{was the main}} eviction host of the show, along with young up-and-coming personalities Mariel Rodriguez and Toni Gonzaga.

Rodriguez, on the other hand, hosted the late night edition called Pinoy Big Brother: Uplate, which updates anything viewers missed in the primetime telecast, {{as well as what}} to look forward in the next one. Revillame hosted the live telecast of the eviction and the public revelation of the nomination for evictees, but only for the first season. He has not returned to the program even before the first Celebrity edition started because of the ULTRA stampede.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa's account of the <b>events</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, its minute hand near the 10 and its hour hand pointing virtually vertically downward, indicating a time of approximately 5:50; and to Victor Jorgensen's account of {{the circumstances of his}} own picture; concluding that Mendonsa's version of events is untenable.|$|E
