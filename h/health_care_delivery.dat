Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

25|$|In summary, the {{emigration}} of Filipino nurses {{has encouraged}} doctors {{to switch to}} nursing, created a shortage of skilled specialized and experienced nurses, affected the education system, and distorted <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>delivery</b> and attention to medical issues in rural areas.

25|$|The {{growth of}} managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the {{enactment}} of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were pioneered by health maintenance organizations, they are now used by a variety of private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in the U.S, but has attracted controversy because it has had mixed results in its overall goal of controlling medical costs. Proponents and critics are also sharply divided on managed care's overall impact on the quality of U.S. <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|E

40|$|Health Informatics is an {{intersection}} of information technology, several disciplines {{of medicine and}} <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> It sits at the common frontiers of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services including patient centric, processes driven and procedural centric care. From the information technology perspective it {{can be viewed as}} computer application in medical and/or health processes for delivering better <b>health</b> <b>care</b> solutions. In spite of the exaggerated hype, this field is having a major impact in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> solutions, in particular <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>deliveries,</b> decision making, medical devices and allied <b>health</b> <b>care</b> industries.
