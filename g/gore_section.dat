40|$|A {{method of}} {{assembling}} an inflatable shell of a structure comprises folding a plurality of shell sections about a set of fold lines and integrating the plurality of shell sections together with one another to form the shell. In another embodiment, an inflatable shell comprises a plurality of shell sections, each shell section having two pairs of fold lines for folding into stowage comprising a first <b>gore</b> <b>section</b> having a plurality of first gore panels layered and collectively folded about at a first set of fold lines. Each layer of the first gore panels and second gore panels are configured such that, once the first gore panel and second gore panel are attached to one another at the respective side edges of each panel, the lines of attachment forming {{a second set of}} fold lines for the shell section. A system and method for fabricating gore panels is also disclosed...|$|E
40|$|Generally, {{congestion}} occurs {{mainly in}} a section where a traffic flow merge or diverge. This congestion decreases the mobility of the roads and causes the increase of the logistics cost, and ultimately it is {{the main cause of}} weakening the national competitiveness. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the decrease effect of service traffic by interrupting once more diverge after diverge again. We analyzed the traffic flow according to the number of interventions when 1, 320 veh/h and 1, 356 veh/h of traffic entering the main fleet are located in the junction of the Seoul Junction and the West Coast Highway. As a result of analysis, the most frequent headway interval value was 2. 5 sec., which was longer than the connecting road (2. 0 seconds), but the composition ratio was almost similar in the 8 th observation time period when the intervention vehicle was 144 veh/h. On the other hand, in the 6 th observation period where the number of intercepting vehicles was 288 veh/h, the most frequent interval value was the same as the 8 th observation time zone, but the composition ratio was reduced to 20 %. In general, as the intervention traffic volume increases, the headway distance at the <b>gore</b> <b>section</b> increases, but the headway distance tends to decrease. In the case of the traffic volume of 1, 320 veh/h at the main line section and 288 veh/h in intercepting traffic (24 min. of 5 min. observation traffic), the capacity was reduced by 45. 2 % compared to the connecting road, the traffic volume of the fishermen was 1, 356 veh/h when the traffic volume was 144 veh/h (5 min. observation traffic volume: 12 vehicles), the capacity decreased by 19. 7 % compared to the connection road...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{gathering}} of sheet stock edges forms metal sheets {{in the shape}} of <b>gore</b> <b>sections</b> with heavier edge areas that can be welded without loss of strength. The edges are gathered by progressive resistance heating and upsetting, and are formed automatically. This process avoids disturbance of the metals internal structure...|$|R
50|$|During the {{manufacturing}} process, {{the material is}} cut into panels and sewn together, along with structural load tapes that carry {{the weight of the}} gondola or basket. The individual sections, which extend from the throat to the crown (top) of the envelope, are known as <b>gores</b> or <b>gore</b> <b>sections.</b> Envelopes can have as few as 4 gores or as many as 24 or more.|$|R
5000|$|Clinton is a {{small town}} in South Otago, in New Zealand's South Island. It is located on State Highway 1 {{approximately}} halfway between Balclutha and <b>Gore</b> (the <b>section</b> of State Highway 1 between Clinton and Gore is known as [...] "The Presidential Highway", after Bill Clinton and Al Gore, though the names are a coincidence), and the Main South Line railway passes through the town.|$|R
50|$|Forward speed (5-13 km/h) and {{steering}} {{can be achieved}} by cuts in various <b>sections</b> (<b>gores)</b> across the back, or by cutting four lines in the back thereby modifying the canopy shape to allow air to escape {{from the back of the}} canopy, providing limited forward speed. Other modifications sometimes used are cuts in various <b>sections</b> (<b>gores)</b> to cause some of the skirt to bow out. Turning is accomplished by forming the edges of the modifications, giving the parachute more speed from one side of the modification than the other. This gives the jumpers the ability to steer the parachute (such as the United States Army MC series parachutes), enabling them to avoid obstacles and to turn into the wind to minimize horizontal speed at landing.|$|R
5000|$|The bra's main {{components}} are a chest band that wraps around the torso, two cups, and shoulder straps. The chest band is usually {{closed in the}} back by a hook and eye fastener, but may be fastened at the front. Sleep bras or athletic bras do not have fasteners and are pulled on over the head and breasts. The section between the cups is called a <b>gore.</b> The <b>section</b> under the armpit where the band joins the cups is called the [...] "back wing".|$|R
50|$|The LOX {{tank was}} an {{ellipsoidal}} container of 10 meters diameter and 6.7 meters high holding up to 377.35 cubic meters (83,000 gallons) or 357,882 kg (789,000 lbs) of oxidizer. It {{was formed by}} welding 12 <b>gores</b> (large triangular <b>sections)</b> and two circular pieces for the top and bottom. The gores were shaped by positioning in a 211,000 liter tank of water with three carefully orchestrated sets of underwater explosions to shape each gore.|$|R
5000|$|Some unincorporated {{territory}} in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be “organized”, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Lincoln County currently contains one plantation (Monhegan, {{which is located}} on offshore islands), {{as well as a}} small amount of territory that is entirely unorganized (Hibberts <b>Gore).</b> Separate <b>sections</b> with census totals for unincorporated areas follows the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total. Except for Monhegan and Hibberts Gore, all of Lincoln County is incorporated; except for Hibberts Gore, all of the county is at least organized. [...] For more information on the New England municipal system, see New England town.|$|R
50|$|State Route 259 (SR 259) is {{a primary}} state highway in the U.S. state of Virginia. The state highway runs a total of 26.80 mi in two sections. The {{southern}} section, in northern Rockingham County, has a length of 21.81 mi from Interstate 81 (I-81) and U.S. Route 11 (US 11) at Mauzy through Broadway to the West Virginia state line into Mathias. The northern section, in western Frederick County, covers 4.99 mi from the West Virginia state line north to US 50 at <b>Gore.</b> The two <b>sections</b> of SR 259 are joined by West Virginia Route 259 (WV 259).|$|R
