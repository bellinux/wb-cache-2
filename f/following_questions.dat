2500|$|After the USA PATRIOT Act {{was passed}} it {{remained}} controversial, {{and began to}} be questioned by some members of Congress. On June 13, 2002 the House Committee on the Judiciary {{wrote a letter to}} Attorney General Ashcroft asking 50 questions about the use and effectiveness of the Act. In the letter they stated that [...] "he Committee is interested in hearing from you [...] and FBI Director Robert F. Mueller concerning the Department of Justice’s use of [...] and their effectiveness. In light of the broad scope of the Act, we are initially seeking written responses to the <b>following</b> <b>questions,</b> and we plan to schedule a hearing in the near future to allow further public discussion of these and other issues relating to the Department of Justice’s activity in investigating terrorists or potential terrorist attacks." [...] Only 28 questions were answered publicly, with 7 answered under separate cover to the Committee. Meanwhile, organisations such as the ACLU, the EFF and EPIC had not stopped opposing the most controversial parts of the Act. Three months after the official response to the Select Committee on the Judiciary, EPIC filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking the information that was not released by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the Department of Justice released a number of records in response to the request, they didn't release all the material, asserting that certain responsive records were exempt from disclosure. In order to gain access to these records, the ACLU and EPIC brought a civil action against the Department of Justice, and on November 26 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ordered the Department of Justice to complete its processing of the FOI request by January 15, 2003.|$|E
