40|$|A {{theory is}} {{proposed}} for the propagation of seismic surface-waves from finite moving sources. The method consists of obtaining, in the first place, basic solutions for surface displacements from directional sources. These solutions are integrated to obtain {{the effect of a}} moving fault with arbitrary dip angle. Displacements are evaluated for Rayleigh and Love waves at long ranges. It is shown that the dimensions of the source and the speed of rupture {{play an important role in}} the wave-pattern and cannot be ignored whenever the dimensions of the source are of the order of the radiation's <b>dominant</b> <b>wave-length.</b> It is demonstrated how this theory may lead to a derivation of the velocity of rupture and the length of faulting from seismic records of a single station...|$|E
40|$|The goal in maxillofacial {{prosthodontics}} is {{to restore}} the patient’s appearance and protect the resection site, allowing improvement in self-esteem to help the patient lead as normal a life as possible. It is important that a prosthesis be fabricated with optimal esthetics and main-tenance of its appearance over its service lifetime. Degra-dation in appearance due to changes in color and physi-cal properties are reasons for refabrication of a facial prosthesis. Koran et al 1 evaluated the accelerated-aging testing with MDX 4 - 4210 that had been colored with dry mineral earth pigments. There were small changes in luminous reflectance, contrast ratio, <b>dominant</b> <b>wave-length,</b> and excitation purity. The data did not support clinical observations of large changes in color over time. Beatty et al 2 evaluated color changes in Silicone A- 2186 elastomer, uncolored and then colored with dry earth pigments, after exposure to ultraviolet-A and ultra-violet-B lighting. Silicone A- 2186 elastomer underwent detectable color changes when stored {{in the dark for}} 45 days; cosmetic red and cadmium yellow pigments under-went significant color changes after 400 hours of expo-sure, and Mars violet and cosmetic yellow ochre remained color-stable after 1800 hours. 2 To determine the effects of a ultraviolet light absorber incorporated in the material, Lemon et al 3 evaluated Silastic 4 - 4210 and Color stability and colorant effect on maxillofacial elastomers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} choice {{behavior}} of bees for floral colors is influenced by innate prefer-ences only for the first flower visits prior to any experi-ence. After visits to rewarding flowers bees learn to as-sociate their colors with a reward. This learning process leads to an acquired preference for the trained colors that has been believed to dominate over previous experiences and over innate preferences. This work investigates how bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) chose among artificial flowers of different colors after they had been extensive-ly trained to other colors. The bees chose novel colors according to their similarity to the trained color if the trained color was similar {{to some of the}} test colors. This was true also if trained colors and test colors were well distinguished, so their color choice reflected generaliza-tion between colors. If the test colors were so different from the trained color that no generalization took place, choice behavior was not affected by the trained color and reflected innate preferences. The differences in choice frequencies could not be explained by physical proper-ties of the test colors other than the <b>dominant</b> <b>wave-length,</b> a parameter taken to reflect hue perception. Pre-ferred dominant wavelengths correspond to those ob-served in naive bumble bees and honeybees. Thus bum-ble bees show innate preferences for certain colors not only prior to color learning but also after intensive learn-ing when choosing among very different novel colors. Color choice among similar colors, however, is con-trolled by generalization from the learned color...|$|E
40|$|Comparison {{was made}} between the {{fluorescent}} lamp and the incandescent lamp basing on qualitative experiments, and the following conclusion was reached. (1) In incandescent lamps when the reflection factor {{of the color of}} reflector is smaller, intensity of illumination will be so much the lower. The same tendency is seen with fluorescent lamps, but the effect is generally smaller as compared with incandescent lamps. Furthermore, when the color of reflector belongs to the same color group as the <b>dominant</b> <b>wave-length</b> of the light-source, intensity of illumination will be stronger. In case it is of the complementary hue or of the same color group, illumination comes out weaker. (2) When various artificial light-sources are mutually compared by the quantities of filtered radiation, it is found that the light of daylight and white fluorescent lamp resembles most closely the daylight in cloudy weather. In incandescent lamps, the zone of long wave-length is in excess, while the blue and violet zones can hardly be seen. (3) Even among the persons with normal sense of color, a high percentage of misreading and hard-reading of Stilling's Charts occurs under the illumination by an incandescent lamp, whereas under that of a white fluorescent lamp, the percentage is extremely lower. (4) As the color rendition of various light·sources are examined from the viewpoint of the "difference of color", de luxe daylight fluorescent lamp is most superior. Next comes de luxe white fluorescent lamp, and it further worsens in the order of the daylight fluorescent lamp, white fluorescent lamp, fluorescent filament lamp, and daylight lamp. Ordinary electric lamps are markedly inferior. However, daylight fluorescent lamps are entirely the reverse of ordinary electric lamps in their status of the "difference of color". (5) Although the fluorescent lamp is an artificical light-source superior to the incandescent lamp in both quantitative and qualitative aspects, they should be utilized to their best advantage respectively so as to conform to the use intended...|$|E
