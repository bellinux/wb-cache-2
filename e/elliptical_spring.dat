50|$|As {{described}} by Hollingshead, mail vans in the United Kingdom were originally horse-drawn, operating {{in conjunction with}} the railway network, including Travelling Post Offices, carrying mail between railway stations and places distant from them, and between sub-post offices and sorting offices. Some of these vans were of the Brougham type. In the 1880s the General Post Office began hiring larger enclosed box vans from McNamara & Company. These vans had <b>elliptical</b> <b>spring</b> front suspension, semi-elliptical spring rear suspension, a double driving seat, and mail coach style headlamps. These were frequently called mail coaches, although unlike actual mail coaches they carried no passengers. At least six regular long-distance, i.e., not just to and from local railway stations, mail van services out of London existed in the late 19th century. A London-to-Chatham mail van service ran until the summer of 1908, and one mail van service ran from London to Oxford until 1909.|$|E
5000|$|The FN Kégresse 3T was a {{half-track}} with a two man driver-cabin {{and a heavy}} platform {{equipped for}} towing large trailers or artillery pieces. Back suspension was of the Citroën Kégresse half-track type, with a leaf spring type suspension with 2 two-wheel bogies attached to a single sidebar, connected to the back idler-wheel, with only the frontal wheel providing traction. The frontal suspension {{was the same as}} used in the Minerva CM-3 truck and of the <b>elliptical</b> <b>spring</b> type. The engine of the first version of the FN Kégresse 3T was a water cooled 6 cylinder Minerva 36 gasoline engine with an internal volume of 3 litres and a power rating of 55 hp, the second version had a 4 litre FN 63T 8 cylinder water cooled gasoline engine producing 60 hp. [...] As in the Minerva CM-3, the FN Kégresse 3T had a 4 speed transmission and an average autonomy of 400 km.|$|E

50|$|The US6 had {{a ladder}} frame with three beam axles, the front on semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs,</b> the rear tandem on quarter <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs</b> with {{locating}} arms.|$|R
50|$|Photographs {{from the}} 1940s show the {{original}} water tenders {{with a traditional}} high turret. The water tenders of 1938 had a water capacity of 6750 imp gal and rode on diamond-frame bogies (similar to North American Archbar trucks) with <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The chassis was 6x6, {{with three}} live beam axles, adapted and {{strengthened}} for {{conditions in the}} USSR. It had a reinforced ladder frame with three live beam axles, the front on semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs,</b> the rear tandem on quarter <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs</b> with locating arms.|$|R
50|$|Outwood Mill is a {{post mill}} {{on a single}} storey roundhouse. It has four Spring sails {{controlled}} by <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs,</b> carried on a wooden Windshaft with a cast iron poll end. The mill drives two pairs of millstones, arranged Head and Tail and is winded by tailpole.|$|R
50|$|A landau is {{lightweight}} and suspended on <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs.</b> It {{was invented in}} the 18th century; landau in this sense is first noted in English in 1743. It was named after the German city of Landau in the Rhenish Palatinate where they were first produced. Lord, Hopkinson, coachmakers of Holborn, London, produced the first English landaus in the 1830s.|$|R
50|$|The frame has {{the popular}} {{cruciform}} or X channelled sectioned cross membering.The unit of engine, fluid flywheel and self changing gearbox is held at four points on rubber, the two points in front being close together {{and on the}} cross member. Half <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs</b> wide-set to prevent roll are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by cam and lever. The four-wheel brakes are worked by rods.|$|R
50|$|The first {{production}} car, the 1925 2½ litre used a Meadows straight six, overhead-valve {{engine and}} four-speed gearbox in a chassis with semi <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs</b> all round cost from £595. Two different chassis lengths were available, 9 ft SC and 10 ft LC to cater for the customer's choice of bodywork. As demand grew {{a lot of}} the construction work went to Lenaerts and Dolphens in Barnes, London but final assembly and test remained at Fairmile. The engine grew to 3 litres in 1926 and 4½ litres in late 1928.|$|R
50|$|All models had {{a ladder}} frame with two axles on semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> A set back front axle allowed a {{wheelbase}} of only 9 ft, allowing {{a very short}} turn radius.|$|R
5000|$|A Governess cart {{is a small}} two-wheeled horse-drawn cart. Their {{distinguishing}} feature is a small tub body, with two opposed inward-facing seats. They could seat four, although there was little room for four large adults. The driver sat sideways {{on one of these}} seats. The centre rear of the body was lowered, or else had a small hinged door, and there was a step beneath. The wheels were of moderate size, always fitted with mud guards, and usually carried on <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs.</b> The axle was either straight or dropped, giving a low, stable, centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|Hearing of the 1848 California Gold Rush, Howe sailed around South America {{through the}} Drake Passage to reach California. He {{returned}} to Massachusetts in 1850, having {{run out of}} money and found no gold. The trip to California was a harsh one, particularly the sleeping accommodations. Beds consisted of little more than planks of wood nailed to a frame, and the slighest movement of the ship was transferred to the sleeper—making for restless sleep, and often inducing seasickness. Determined to invent an improved bed, Howe began work on a bed in which <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs</b> supported free-floating slats, and the frame of the bed kept the slats in a rectangular shape.|$|R
5000|$|The T11's {{engine was}} an {{air-cooled}} horizontally opposed twin cylinder engine with overhead valves. It had {{a capacity of}} [...] and was located above the front beam axle which was attached to it by a transverse <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{carriage}} is a {{wheeled vehicle}} for people, usually horse-drawn; litters (palanquins) and sedan chairs are excluded, {{since they are}} wheelless vehicles. The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use, though some are also used to transport goods. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage - terms for such include stagecoach, charabanc and omnibus. It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable or luxurious. Carriages normally have suspension using leaf <b>springs,</b> <b>elliptical</b> <b>springs</b> (in the 19th century) or leather strapping. Working vehicles such as the (four-wheeled) wagon and (two-wheeled) cart share important parts {{of the history of}} the carriage, as does too the fast (two-wheeled) chariot.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{enhancement}} {{to the existing}} <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>spring</b> (ELS) for improved damping and energy dissipation capabilities. The ELS consists of a high tensile stainless steel <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>spring</b> with polymer or rubber compound. This device is conceived as a shock and vibration isolator for equipment and lightweight structures. The enhancement to the ELS consists of a lead spring plugged vertically between the leaves (referred to as lead-rubber <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>spring</b> (LRELS)). The lead is shown to produce hysteretic damping under plastic deformations. The LRELS isolator is shown to exhibit nonlinear hysteretic behavior. In both horizontal directions, the LRELS showed symmetrical rate independent behavior but undergoes stiffening behavior under large displacements. However, in the vertical direction, the LRELS behavior is asymmetric, exhibiting softening behavior in compression and stiffening behavior in tension. Mathematical models based on the Bouc-Wen model, describing the hysteretic behavior of the proposed isolator, are developed and numerically calibrated using a series of finite element analyses. The LRELS {{is found to be}} effective in the in-plane and vertical directions. The improved damping and energy dissipation of the LRELS is provided from the hysteretic damping of the lead spring...|$|R
50|$|The classic saloon {{featured}} the streamlining increasingly characteristic of mainstream British {{cars in the}} later 1930s, along with “stand-alone” headlights. Power came from a 1185 cc side-valve engine for which 41 bhp (30 kW) of power output was claimed. All four wheels were suspended using semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> Top speed was quoted as 68 mph (109 km/h).|$|R

50|$|The {{front axle}} carries the iron frame via two <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> The wooden front wheels have steel rims with outer {{diameter}} of 750 mm. The steering column {{is on the}} {{right in front of the}} driver. The rear axle is sprung by two couples of spiral springs. The wheels are wooden with steel rim and outer diameter of 900 mm.|$|R
50|$|The Paramount had an {{aluminium}} over wood {{frame body}} with BMW like grille and was {{mounted on a}} separate tubular steel chassis with front transverse and rear semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> It was originally intended to have Alvis engine and suspension but to reduce cost the production versions used Ford 10 components including the 1172 cc side valve engines, but fitted with twin SU carburettors, which resulted in poor performance. The car was listed in both 2 and 4 seat versions.|$|R
5000|$|As stated, {{the general}} track gauge in Britain was [...] In the later 1950s, general track {{maintenance}} standards deteriorated rapidly due to manning difficulties, and freight train speeds increased on some routes. Freight trains consisted {{almost entirely of}} short wheelbase (10 ft) four-wheeled wagons carried on a very stiff <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>spring</b> suspension, and these wagons showed an alarmingly rapid rate of increase of derailment events. Anyone standing at the lineside could watch a freight train pass at speed and observe several of the wagons weaving and swaying alarmingly even on good track, and derailment occurred when any poor track was encountered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design was}} largely {{the work of}} Peter Wilks and [...] "Spen" [...] King who, like Wilks, was a nephew of {{brothers}} Spencer and Maurice Wilks who ran the Rover car company and was later famous for his involvement in many Rover and Leyland Group designs. The car named the [...] "A", later joined by the [...] "100", {{was based on the}} Rover P4 75 with the chassis shortened by 9 in from 111 in to 102 in, the track remaining the same at 52 in. The suspension was stiffened retaining the coil sprung independent front suspension and <b>elliptical</b> <b>sprung</b> live rear axle. The engine was moved back to allow for the fitting of 2/3-seater open coachwork with the Rover gearbox retained with optional overdrive instead of the Rover free wheel mechanism. The gearchange moved from column to floor. One fixed head coupé was also made. The first few bodies were made by Richard Mead in his Dorridge works and used some Rover panels but later ones were made by Abbey Panels of Coventry.

40|$|A two page {{discussion}} of non-aerospace seating applications {{and the design}} of NASA's safety seat cushioning (SSC) is presented. The SSC was designed for both safety and comfort in order to replace polyurethane cushioning which is flammable and produces lethal fumes upon combustion. The SSC is composed of advanced fabric reinforced composites and is lightweight, fire-retardent, and crashworthy. The seat design consists of central <b>elliptical</b> tubular <b>spring</b> supports made of fire-resistant and fatigue-durable composites surrounded by a fire-blocking sheath. The cushioning is made crashworthy by incorporating energy-absorbing, viscoelastic layers between the nested, elliptical-hoop springs. The design is intended to provide comfortable seating that meets aircraft-loading requirements without using the conventional polyurethane materials. The designs of an aircraft seat and structural components of the SSC are also presented...|$|R
50|$|The Wraith {{featured}} {{an independent}} coil sprung front suspension {{based on a}} Packard 120 retaining semi <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs</b> on the rear axle. The hydraulic dampers at the front had their damping rate controlled by governor and so varied {{with the speed of}} the car, making it superior to its predecessor, the 25/30 H.P. and on par with the Phantom III. The car was still built on a separate chassis but this was now of welded rather than the traditional riveted construction. The drum brakes were assisted by a mechanical servo driven by the engine patented by Hispano-Suiza and built by Rolls-Royce under licence. Wire wheels of 17 inch diameter were fitted, with the spokes usually covered by removable discs. A built in hydraulic jacking system was fitted operated by a lever under the passenger seat.|$|R
2500|$|The Ponnier D.III was {{a single}} seat, mid wing {{monoplane}} designed {{to compete in the}} 1913 Gordon Bennett Trophy race.

An oil deflecting cowling, open at the bottom, surrounded the powerful double row, fourteen cylinder Gnome Lambda-Lambda rotary engine, which delivered [...] to a 2 m diameter propeller. The oval, open cockpit was placed at mid-wing, just aft of the pylon centre. It had a finless rudder at the extreme rear of the fuselage and a straight edged tailplane mounted on the upper fuselage ahead of it. The elevators were aerodynamically separate but interconnected, controlled by central wires.

50|$|Edward A Tamplin, {{a member}} of the Sussex brewing family but with no direct {{involvement}} in the business, ran the Railway Garage in Staines and was an agent for the Carden cyclecar and in 1919, after contracting to take the entire output, purchased the rights to manufacture it. The car was powered by a 980 cc JAP V-twin, air-cooled engine mounted {{on the side of the}} body and coupled by chain drive to a Sturmey-Archer three-speed-and-reverse gearbox and then by an exposed belt to the rear wheels. To avoid the need for a differential drive was to the left side rear wheel. The engine was started by a kick starter from the driver's seat. The clutch pedal, when fully depressed operated the brakes. The wheels were close together giving the car a very narrow track. Front suspension was independent by coil springs and the rear had quarter <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs.</b> Some cars were fitted with Blackburne engines.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical {{results of the}} stresses in a coil spring of arbitrary cross section. The analysis consists of two parts {{one of which is}} concerned with the displacements, the angles of rotation, the resultant forces and the resultant moments which occur in a helical spring during the loading. The results in this problem are derived by application of the curved beam theory in which all displacements and all forces in three orthogonal directions of the coil spring are included with consideration of constraints of the edges of the spring. At the second step, the paper {{presents the}} expressions for stresses in the spring due to the compression {{in the direction of the}} axis of the cylindrical spring when both edges are kept to be parallel during the deformation by use of the author's results given in the preceding paper (1 st report). Numerical calculations have been carried out for four cases of a circular cross-section <b>spring,</b> an <b>elliptical</b> cross section <b>spring,</b> a rectangular cross section spring and an oval section spring...|$|R
50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated <b>elliptical</b> leaf <b>springs,</b> but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 friction shock absorbers per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, it {{is worth}} {{explaining}} why the gravity-based recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator is unique {{and it is not}} traditional. The integrated passive recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator can provide gravity-based recentering force without generating any undesired side effects. Several available traditional isolation devices [such as <b>springs,</b> <b>elliptical</b> and friction pendulum systems (FPS)] can provide some recentering forces but they are always accompanied by the generation of vertical accelerations out from the horizontal acceleration components, which leads to additional vertical vibration of structural elements, housed inner equipment and occupants discomfort. Moreover, the configurations that provide such recentering forces in elliptical and FPS isolation systems force the isolated structure to oscillate as a simple pendulum with a single vibration period, which may be close to the dominant period of the exciting earthquake causing resonance unlike the RNC isolator. In the RNC isolator, although the rolling core is ellipsoidal to provide adequate eccentricity for gravity-based recentering, the upper and lower bearing plates are provided with carefully designed inner curvatures (facing the rolling core) to exactly absorb any generated vertical displacement that arises from rolling of the elliptical core. This always keeps the vertical offset between the upper and the lower bearing plates unchanged during the RNC isolator motion, which theoretically prevents the generation of vertical motion component out from the horizontal one, leading to a unique recentering behavior of the RNC isolator.|$|R
