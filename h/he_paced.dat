5|$|Less than a {{week after}} Cox's {{appointment}} as manager of Mansfield Town, Meikle followed him to the Conference Premier club on 24 May 2011 after signing a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a 76th-minute substitute for Matt Green in a 1–1 home draw with Bath City on 13 August 2011. His first goal for the club was the 81st-minute winner in a 3–1 away win over Barrow, which came after <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> past two defenders before he calmly finished with a shot into the bottom corner. Meikle played a vital role in Mansfield reaching the play-offs in third place, playing in both semi-final matches against York City, which the team lost 2–1 on aggregate. He finished 2011–12 with 7 goals in 47 appearances and was offered a new contract by the club in May 2012.|$|E
25|$|Amundsen {{had used}} the {{opportunity}} of learning from the Inuit while on his Gjøa North West passage expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To {{make the most of}} the dogs <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey, and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the Antarctic while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.|$|E
500|$|By December 1959 Pound was {{mired in}} depression. He saw {{his work as}} {{worthless}} and The Cantos botched. In a 1960 interview given in Rome to Donald Hall for Paris Review, he said: [...] "You—find me—in fragments." [...] Hall wrote that he seemed in an [...] "abject despair, accidie, meaninglessness, abulia, waste". <b>He</b> <b>paced</b> up and down during the three days it took to complete the interview, never finishing a sentence, bursting with energy one minute, then suddenly sagging, {{and at one point}} seemed about to collapse. Hall said {{it was clear that he}} [...] "doubted the value of everything he had done in his life." ...|$|E

500|$|The CIA {{was unable}} {{to rule out the}} {{existence}} of an underground bunker below the compound. Presuming that one existed, 32 [...] bombs fitted with JDAM guidance systems would be required to destroy it. With that amount of ordnance, at least one other house was in the blast radius. Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound. Furthermore, it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead. Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29, Obama put the bombing plan on hold. Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid. The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone-fired small tactical munition as <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> in his compound's vegetable garden.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1944, Robert Oppenheimer persuaded Fermi to {{join his}} Project Y at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Arriving in September, Fermi was {{appointed}} an {{associate director of the}} laboratory, with broad responsibility for nuclear and theoretical physics, and was placed in charge of F Division, which was named after him. F Division had four branches: F-1 Super and General Theory under Teller, which investigated the [...] "Super" [...] (thermonuclear) bomb; F-2 Water Boiler under L. D. P. King, which looked after the [...] "water boiler" [...] aqueous homogeneous research reactor; F-3 Super Experimentation under Egon Bretscher; and F-4 Fission Studies under Anderson. Fermi observed the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, and conducted an experiment to estimate the bomb's yield by dropping strips of paper into the blast wave. <b>He</b> <b>paced</b> off how far they were blown by the explosion, and calculated the yield as ten kilotons of TNT; the actual yield was about 18.6 kilotons.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} reached London on November 25, Lord Germain {{described}} {{the reaction of}} Lord North to the news: [...] "he {{would have taken a}} ball on his breast. [...] For he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> up and down the apartment, during the few minutes, 'Oh God! It is all over!'" [...] King George was reported to receive the news with calmness and dignity, although he later became depressed as the news sank in, and even considered abdication. [...] The king's supporters in Parliament were depressed, and the opposition elated. [...] A resolution calling {{for an end to the}} war was introduced on December 12, and failed to pass by a single vote. [...] Lord Germain was dismissed in early 1782, and the North administration fell shortly afterward. [...] Peace negotiations followed, and the war was formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3, 1783.|$|E

500|$|Days {{before the}} battle a {{telegraph}} cable was laid between Fortress Monroe, which overlooked Hampton Roads, and Washington. Washington was immediately {{informed of the}} dire situation after the initial battle. [...] Many were now concerned Virginia would put to sea and begin bombarding cities such as New York while others feared she would ascend the Potomac River and attack Washington. In an emergency meeting among President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary Welles and other senior naval officers, inquiries were made about Monitors ability to stop Virginias prospect of further destruction. When the temperamental Stanton learned that Monitor had only two guns he expressed contempt and rage as <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> back and forth, further increasing the anxiety and despair {{among members of the}} meeting. Assurances from Admiral Dahlgren and other officers that Virginia was too massive to effectively approach Washington and that Monitor was capable of the challenge offered him no consolation. After further deliberations Lincoln was finally assured but Stanton remained almost in a state of terror and sent telegrams to various governors and mayors of the coastal states warning them of the danger. Subsequently, Stanton approved a plan to load some sixty canal boats with stone and gravel and sink them in the Potomac, but Welles was able to convince Lincoln at the last moment that such a plan would only prevent Monitor and other Union ships from reaching Washington and that the barges should only be sunk if and when Virginia was able to make her way up the Potomac.|$|E
2500|$|His next {{scheduled}} {{appearance was}} in Memphis, Tennessee, where little {{was expected of}} him due to the recent illness. On October 24, <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> a mile without prompters in 2:00, the fastest time paced that year despite appearing [...] "dull and weak" [...] to his old owner Manley Sturges. Just two days later though, Dan Patch returned in much better condition. Behind his galloping prompter, <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> the first quarter mile in 29 seconds and completed the first half in 57 seconds. He seemed to falter around the far turn, but still completed the three-quarters in 1:26. In the stretch, he recovered his best stride and completed the mile in a new world record of 1:56. He was greeted with an ovation and Hersey was carried from the sulky {{on the way back}} to the stands.|$|E

2500|$|Although Dan Patch {{continued}} to make public appearances and posted some excellent times, he {{was never able to}} achieve that level again. The closest he came was on October 11, 1908 at Lexington, when <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> the first three-quarters of a mile in an exceptional 1:25 before his prompter started bleeding and slowed down. Dan Patch was forced to check but still finished the mile in 1:56. Savage advertised that Dan Patch would otherwise have finished in 1:54, which [...] "the Horse Papers and all Horsemen admit was the Fastest and Greatest Performance {{in the life of the}} World Famous Harness Horse King." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{made two}} further {{appearances}} in 1903. At Birmingham, Alabama on November 10, {{he lowered the}} record for a mile on a half mile track to 2:03, even though his pacemaker had plunged wildly ahead. The conditions in Macon, Georgia on November 30 were cold and windy but Dan Patch still set two world records {{within an hour of}} each other. In the first, he was attached to an old-fashioned high-wheeled sulky and lowered the existing record by [...] seconds. In the second, <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> two miles in 4:17, lowering the existing record by two seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Masterman Hardy, 1st Baronet, GCB (5 April 1769 – 20 September 1839) was a Royal Navy officer. He {{took part}} in the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, the Battle of the Nile in August 1798 and the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. He served as flag captain to Admiral Lord Nelson, and {{commanded}} HMS Victory at the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars. Nelson was shot as <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> the decks with Hardy, and as he lay dying, Nelson's famous remark of [...] "Kiss me, Hardy" [...] was directed at him. Hardy went on to become First Naval Lord in November 1830 and in that capacity refused to become a Member of Parliament and encouraged the introduction of steam warships.|$|E

2500|$|From June 1 forward, Montreal {{transformed}} into the dominant club in the National League, going 46−18 until the players' strike halted the season on August 11. [...] In turn, they produced the most successful season in franchise history in terms of winning percentage (.649) as they attained a major league best 74−40 record.

2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and <b>he</b> <b>paced</b> his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
