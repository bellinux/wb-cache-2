50|$|The Fixed Dose Procedure (FDP), {{proposed}} in 1984 by the British Toxicology Society, {{is a method}} to assess a substance's acute oral toxicity. In this procedure the test substance is given {{at one of the}} four fixed-dose levels (5, 50, 500, and2000 mg/kg) to five male and five female rats. The objective is to identify a dose that produces clear signs of toxicity but no mortality (22). Depending on the results of the first test, either no further testing is needed or a higher or lower dose is tested: If mortality occurs, retesting at a lower dose level is necessary (except if the original dose chosen is 5 mg/kg). If no signs of toxicity occur at the initial dose, it is necessary to retest at a higher dose level. The results are thus interpreted in relation to animal survival and <b>evident</b> <b>toxicity</b> (5) and it becomes possible to assign the chemical to one of the OECD classification categories.|$|E

The models responded favorably to treatment so the study progressed to Phase 2 trials involving humans. Human studies have shown that R788 has good oral bioavailability, biologic activity, is well tolerated, and does not exhibit collagen or ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In NCT00706342, 16 adults with chronic ITP were entered into an open-label, single-arm cohort dose-escalation trials beginning with 75 mg and rising to 175 mg twice a day. The dose was increased until a persistent response was <b>evident,</b> <b>toxicity</b> was reached, or 175 mg twice a day was met. 8 patients achieved persistent responses with platelet counts greater than 50,000 mm3/L on more than 67% of their visits. 3 of these patients had not persistently responded to thrombopoietic agents. 4 others had nonsustained responses.

After conjugation of EGFRmAb with SPIONs, the magnetic characteristics of EGFRmAb-SPIONs were investigated. Thereafter, the targeting abilities of EGFRmAb-SPIONs with MRI were qualitatively and quantitatively assessed in EGFR-positive C 6 glioma cells in vitro and in a Wistar rat model bearing C 6 glioma in vivo. Furthermore, the preliminary biocompatibility and toxicity of EGFRmAb-SPIONs were evaluated in normal rats through hematology assays and histopathologic analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance and Student t-test, with a significance level of p <. 05. From the results of EGFRmAb-SPION characterizations, the average particle size was 10. 21 nm and the hydrodynamic diameter was 161. 5 ± 2. 12 nm. The saturation magnetization was 55 emu/g·Fe, and T 2 relaxivity was 92. 73 s− 1 mM− 1 in distilled water. The preferential accumulation of the EGFRmAb-SPIONs within glioma and subsequent MRI contrast enhancement were demonstrated both in vitro in C 6 cells and in vivo in rats bearing C 6 glioma. After intravenous administration of EGFRmAb-SPIONs, T 2 -weighted MRI of the rat model with brain glioma exhibited an apparent hypointense region within glioma from 2 to 48 hours.

40|$|Polyglutamine {{diseases}} are neurodegenerative disorders caused by expansion of polyglutamine tracts in the coding regions of specific genes. One {{of the most}} important features of polyglutamine diseases is that, despite the widespread and in some cases ubiquitous expression of the polyglutamine proteins, specific populations of neurons degenerate in each disease. This finding has led to the idea that polyglutamine {{diseases are}} cell-autonomous diseases, in which selective neuronal dysfunction and death result from damage caused by the mutant protein within the targeted neuronal population itself. Development of animal models for conditional expression of polyglutamine proteins, along with new pharmacologic manipulation of polyglutamine protein expression and toxicity, has led to a remarkable change of the current view of polyglutamine diseases as cell-autonomous disorders.

Many of these patients deserve second-or third-line treatment after failure of first-line chemotherapy. Therefore, we analysed toxicity and response rate of weekly docetaxel after failed upfront regimes in these upper GI cancer patients. Patients and Methods: Between 2001 and 2006, 18 patients received docetaxel based regimes (35 mg/m² weekly) after informed consent. Response rates were determined using RECIST criteria or tumor progression if clinically <b>evident.</b> <b>Toxicities</b> were graded based on NCI CTC criteria (version 2). Most patients had gastric cancer (13 / 18). The remaining entities comprised of bilio-pancreatic cancer (5 / 18). Results: Docetaxel was administered as 2 nd line therapy in 28 % (5 / 18), 3 rd line therapy in 56 % (10 / 18) and 4 th or 5 th line therapy in 17 % (3 / 18). The average docetaxel dose was 38 mg/m² (Median: 35 mg/m²) once weekly. Over a treatment duration of 14. 7 weeks, the average dosage was 58 gr per patient and week. Overall, docetaxel was well tolerated with only few chemotherapy-associated toxicities (Grade 3 / 4), including nausea (17 %), polyneuropathy (17 %), anorexia (11 %), neutropenia (6 %) and leukopenia (17 %). Docetaxel administration did not achieve any complete responses (CR) and one (5. 6 %) partial response (PR) was seen (1 / 18). In addition 5 patients (27. 8 %) had stable disease (SD), thus inducing a tumor control rate of 33. 3 % (6 / 18). Median progression-free survival was 2. 4 months for all patients, 2. 1 months in the gastric-cancer and 2. 4 months in the bilio- pancreatic cancer subgroups respectively. After first docetaxel administration median survival for all patients was 4. 5 months, patients with gastric cancer survived for 4. 9 months whereas patients suffering from bilio-pancreatic carcinoma survived for 4. 2 months. However, taken together 27 % (5 / 18) had a remarkable overall survival of more than 2. 5 years. Discussion: In severely pretreated patients, with documented chemoresistant GI tumors, weekly docetaxel was well tolerated, presented good tumor control rate and overall survival.

DNA accumulation in litter and soil was measured and DNA toxicity was assessed in laboratory experiments. Undecomposed litter caused nonspecific inhibition of root growth, while autotoxicity was produced by aged litter. The addition of activated carbon (AC) removed phytotoxicity, but was ineffective against autotoxicity. Phytotoxicity was related to known labile allelopathic compounds. Restricted 13 C NMR signals related to nucleic acids were the only ones negatively correlated with root growth on conspecific substrates. DNA accumulation was observed in both litter decomposition and soil history experiments. Extracted total DNA showed <b>evident</b> species-specific <b>toxicity.</b> Results indicate a general occurrence of litter autotoxicity related to the exposure to fragmented self-DNA. The evidence also suggests the involvement of accumulated extracellular DNA in plant–soil NF. Further studies are needed to further investigate this unexpected function of extracellular DNA at the ecosystem level and related cellular and molecular mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Background: EGFR {{mutation}} {{might be}} a predictive factor for applying EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs, includ-ing gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLS) patients. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} pool previous trials to compare the effect of EGFR-TKIs versus cytotoxic chemotherapy in EGFR mutation positive (mut+) and negative (mut–) patients. Material/Methods: This study identified 8 first-line and 9 second-line phase III trials in databases. Hazard ratio (HR) was pooled to assess the risk of progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS), while odds ratio (OR) was pooled to assess objective response, disease control, and toxicity of EGFR-TKIs verses chemotherapy. Results: In EGFR mut+ patients, EGFR-TKIs were associated with significantly lower risk of disease progression in the first-line setting, but this trend was only observed in the gefitinib group, not in the erlotinib group in the sec-ond-line setting. In EGFR mut – patients, gefitinib and erlotinib had significantly higher risk of disease progres-sion in first-line and second-line setting, respectively. Compared with chemotherapy, the effects of EGFR-TKIs on OS in both first-line and second-line settings were not <b>evident.</b> Regarding <b>toxicity,</b> EGFR-TKIs had signifi-cantly higher risk of rash and lower hematological toxicity compared with chemotherapy. Conclusions: All of the 3 EGFR-TKIs and gefitinib alone regimens had better effects in prolonging PFS in EGFR mut+ patients in first-line and second-line setting, respectively, but chemotherapy seemed more effective in EGFR mut- pa...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} have been implicated in various diseases, but {{attempts}} to find efficient antioxidant treatments for such conditions have met with only limited success. Here, we have developed an antioxidant nanoreactor by encapsulating a dual-enzyme mimic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, in polymeric nanovesicles and examined how this nanoreactor combats oxidative stress. The mimic (CuIIENZm) is encapsulated inside poly-(2 -methyloxazoline) –poly-(dimethylsiloxane) –poly(2 -methyloxazoline) polymer vesicles that feature membranes permeable to superoxide, enabling the enzyme mimic to act in situ. We ensured that {{the size and shape}} of polymeric vesicles were not changed during the encapsulation procedure by analysis with light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and that the structural geometry of CuIIENZm was preserved, as demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance and UV-vis spectroscopy. Due to its bi-functionality, CuIIENZm detoxified both superoxide radicals and related H 2 O 2. The intracellular localization of the nanoreactor in THP- 1 cells was established using confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. No <b>evident</b> <b>toxicity</b> was found using MTS and LDH assays. As CuIIENZm remained active inside the vesicles therefore, these CuIIENZm-containing nanoreactors exhibited efficient antioxidant activity in THP- 1 cells. Development of this simple, robust antioxidant nanoreactor represents a new direction in efficiently fighting oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|In atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD), topical anti-inflammatory therapy with skin barrier restoration to prevent repeated inflammatory episodes leads to long-term therapeutic success. Tacrolimus, although effective against AD, is a challenging molecule due to low solubility, low-penetration, poor-bioavailability, and toxicity. Part I of this paper, reported novel modified nanolipid carrier system for topical delivery of tacrolimus (T-MNLC), offering {{great opportunity to}} load low-solubility drug with improved entrapment efficiency, enhanced stability and improved skin deposition. Present investigation focused on restoration of skin barrier, site-specific delivery, therapeutic effectiveness, and safety of novel T-MNLC. T-MNLC greatly enhanced occlusive properties, skin hydration potential and reduced transepidermal water loss. This might help {{to reduce the number}} of flares and better control the disease. Cutaneous uptake and drug deposition in albino rats by HPLC and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed prominently elevated drug levels in all skin strata with T-MNLC as compared to reference. T-MNLC demonstrated efficient suppression of inflammatory responses in BALB/c mice model of AD. Safety assessment by acute and repeated-dose dermal toxicity demonstrated mild keratosis and collagenous mass infiltration at the treatment area with repeated application of reference. Interestingly, T-MNLC showed no <b>evident</b> <b>toxicity</b> exhibiting safe drug delivery. Thus, novel T-MNLC would be a safe, effective, and esthetically appealing alternative to conventional vehicles for treatment for AD...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of present {{investigation was to}} study in vivo behavior of tacrolimus-loaded lipid-nanoparticles (T-LN) to understand its targeting potential for treatment of atopic-dermatitis-(AD). T-LN have shown significantly improved drug penetration to deeper epidermal and dermal skin-layers than commercial ointment-Protopic® and effectively reached target dendritic-immune-cells, responsible for immunopathogenesis of AD. Due to enhanced penetrability of T-LN, it became necessary to evaluate the toxicity of the nanocarrier and the drug at non-target tissues. This paper evaluates dermatopharmacokinetics (DPK), biodistribution, efficacy and safety of T-LN in comparison to Protopic® as reference. In vivo DPK in guinea pigs showed 3. 02 -fold higher bioavailability while γ-scintigraphy in albino-rats demonstrated 1. 5 -fold rapid penetration of radioactivity in skin for T-LN. Biodistribution in albino-rats revealed restricted localization at the target-skin-area with no general spreading to other body organs suggesting targeting potential of T-LN. In vivo efficacy studies in BALB/c mice showed highly efficient suppression of inflammatory AD-like skin-lesions with T-LN than reference and placebo. Dermal toxicity-studies revealed keratosis and collagenous mass-infiltration with repeated application of reference however interestingly, T-LN treated group showed no <b>evident</b> <b>toxicity</b> demonstrating significantly improved safety. Thus T-LN offered improved penetration to the target site without any toxic-effects and would represent an efficient and commercially viable alternative for AD treatment...|$|E
30|$|According to {{the decline}} in hepatic GSH content (Figure  1 C), it was <b>evident</b> that paracetamol-induced <b>toxicity</b> {{involved}} a change in cellular redox status toward a state of oxidative stress. A wide variety of oxidizing molecules such as ROS and/or depleting agents can alter glutathione redox state, which is normally maintained by the activity of GSH-depleting (GPx, GST) and GSH-replenishing (GR) enzymes (Halliwell 1996). Therefore, it can be assumed that decreasing in the GSH concentration might cause the effectiveness of GST and GPx activity to be restricted, as evident by the intensification of lipid peroxidation (Czeczot et al. 2006). The APAP induced depletion of GSH was restored by essential oil treatment (Figure  3 A & B), which supported the involvement of exogenous administration of antioxidants in modulation of GSH metabolism. Thus, Achillea wilhelmsii essential oils may {{play a key role}} against APAP intoxication by influencing the cellular GSH pool.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} SAHA cap {{derivatives}} {{was designed and}} prepared in good-to-excellent yields that varied from 49 % to 95 %. These derivatives were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in several human cancer cell lines. Antiproliferative activity was observed for concentrations varying from 0. 12 to > 100 microM, and a molecular modeling approach of selected SAHA derivatives, based on available structural information of human HDAC 8 in complex with SAHA, was performed. Strikingly, two compounds displayed up to 10 -fold improved antileukemic activity with respect to SAHA; however, these compounds displayed antiproliferative activity similar to SAHA when assayed against solid tumor-derived cell lines. A 10 -fold improvement in the leukemic vs peripheral blood mononuclear cell therapeutic ratio, with no <b>evident</b> in vivo <b>toxicity</b> toward blood cells, was also observed. The herein-described compounds and method of synthesis will provide invaluable tools to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the reported selectively improved antileukemic activity.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the toxicity of both MPTP and MPP+ using some simple cell systems, such as PC 12 and C 6 cultures, as models. Exposure of PC 12 cells to 0. 5 mM MPTP for 72 h resulted in a 50 % cell loss with respect to the control cells, and clorgyline, a MAO-A inhibitor, antagonized this toxic effect. Higher concentrations of MPTP demonstrated only a weak cytostatic effect on C 6 cells. Moreover, MPP+ showed a toxic effect which was 100 times more <b>evident</b> than MPTP <b>toxicity</b> in the PC 12. We found a single, saturable class of [3 H]MPP+ binding sites with a relatively high affinity both in PC 12 and C 6 cell lines. Moreover, the most susceptible cell line towards the toxic effects of both MPTP and MPP+, i. e. PC 12, has the higher number of MPP+ binding sites. Our results suggest that MPTP can be toxic not only via MAO-B, but also via MAO-A activity and we propose PC 12 as a model to study the intracellular mechanisms of MPTP and MPP+ toxicity...|$|R
