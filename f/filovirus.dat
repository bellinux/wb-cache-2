25|$|A <b>filovirus,</b> {{at first}} {{suspected}} to be Ebola virus (EBOV), was discovered among crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) within the Covance Primate Quarantine Unit in 1989. This attracted significant media attention, including {{the publication of}} The Hot Zone. The <b>filovirus</b> {{was found to be}} distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for humans. It was named after the community, and is now known as Reston virus (RESTV). Macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized, and the facility was sterilized. The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenue. It was eventually torn down, and a daycare was built in its place.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines and the United States had no {{previous}} cases of Ebola infection, and upon further isolation, researchers concluded {{it was another}} strain of Ebola, or a new <b>filovirus</b> of Asian origin, which they named Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) after {{the location of the}} incident. Reston virus (RESTV) can be transmitted to pigs. Since the initial outbreak it has since been found in nonhuman primates in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Italy, where the virus had infected pigs. According to the WHO, routine cleaning and disinfection of pig (or monkey) farms with sodium hypochlorite or detergents should be effective in inactivating the Reston ebolavirus. Pigs that have been infected with RESTV tend to show symptoms of the disease.|$|E

50|$|There are {{presently}} no licensed vaccines for known <b>filovirus.</b> There {{has been a}} pressing concern that a very slight genetic mutation to a <b>filovirus</b> such as EBOV {{could result in a}} change in transmission system from direct body fluid transmission to airborne transmission, as was seen in Reston virus (another member of genus Ebolavirus) between infected macaques. A similar change in the current circulating strains of EBOV could greatly increase the infection and disease rates caused by EBOV.

50|$|The human Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) {{cholesterol}} transporter {{appears to}} be essential for Ebola virus infection: a series of independent studies have presented evidence that Ebola virus enters human cells after binding to NPC1. When cells from Niemann Pick Type C patients lacking this transporter were exposed to Ebola virus in the laboratory, the cells survived and appeared impervious to the virus, further indicating that Ebola relies on NPC1 to enter cells. The same studies described similar results with Marburg virus, another <b>filovirus,</b> showing that it too needs NPC1 to enter cells. In one of the studies, NPC1 was shown to be critical to <b>filovirus</b> entry because it mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein. A later study confirmed the findings that NPC1 is a critical <b>filovirus</b> receptor that mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein and that the second lysosomal domain of NPC1 mediates this binding.|$|E

In October 2014, following a successful pre-clinical demonstration of the combination vaccine regimen of its multivalent MVA-BN <b>Filovirus</b> vaccine and Crucell/Janssen's AdVac technology based on adenoviral vectors, Bavarian Nordic joined efforts with Crucell Holland B.V., one of the Janssen Pharmaceuticals Companies of Johnson & Johnson to develop and manufacture this vaccine regimen intended for emergency use to help contain the outbreak in West Africa. In January 2015, the company had produced the first 400,000 doses of the vaccine and the first clinical trial of the vaccine regimen was initiated in the UK, with additional trials planned in the US and Africa.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the <b>filovirus</b> disease outbreak in Reston, Virginia, a serosurvey was conducted to assess the prevalence of the infection.

The sensitivity of this procedure is sufficient to show virus in most acute phase sera, and is equal to that of the antigen capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The immunoelectron microscopy fluid technique can differentiate among antigenically distinct <b>filoviruses</b> in less than three hours.

The clinical symptoms of Ebola andMarburg hemorrhagic fevers are difficult to distinguish and there are currently no specific antiviral therapies against either of the viruses. Therefore, a drug that is safe and effective against both would be an enormous breakthrough.

Drugs that inhibit this pathway would be expected to be selectively antiviral.
