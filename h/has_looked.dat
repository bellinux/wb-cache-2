5|$|In November 2016, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin {{published}} and brand new {{and up to}} date book, with the foreword written {{by a member of}} Joseph Merrick's family - 'Joseph: The Life, Times and Places of the Elephant Man'. Peeling back the layers of myth, Joanne Vigor-Mungovin <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> into the early life of Merrick and his family in her hometown of Leicester, and presents for the first time, detailed information about Josephs family and his burning ambition to be self-sufficient rather than survive on the charity of others.|$|E
5|$|The navy <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> into {{creating}} precision guided artillery rounds for {{use with}} the current fleet of cruisers and destroyers. The most recent attempt to modify the guns for longer range came with the Advanced Gun System mounts that were to be installed aboard the Zumwalt-class destroyers, although the navy {{has been involved in}} the Long Range Land Attack Projectile and Ballistic Trajectory Extended Range Munition projects for over 10 years in an effort to develop Extended Range Guided Munitions.|$|E
5|$|While MLS <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> into {{changing}} to a fall-to-spring format, {{there are no}} current plans to do so. If the league were to change its schedule, a substantial winter break would still be necessary due to teams being located in harsh winter climates. It {{would also have to}} compete with the popularity and media presence of the National Football League (NFL) in the fall and winter as well as the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL), which both run on fall-to-spring schedules.|$|E
50|$|IFPRI {{has done}} {{extensive}} research into areas related to malnutrition. They have conducted research {{all over the}} world on various issues that arise from or cause malnutrition. They <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at HIV and Malaria and how malnutrition affects the epidemiology of these diseases. They <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at the effects of childhood malnutrition on adult health. They <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at the potential benefits of biotech crops on childhood nutrition, and the effects of vitamin supplements in general.|$|R

They must <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> quite like it." ...|$|R

60|$|I don't {{know what}} he <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> like, except a funeral; with the {{addition}} of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> very nice.|$|R

25|$|Since 2006 TV3 <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> towards home {{produced}} drama {{with the}} likes of Laura Windermere's Bag and Deception. It also took a look at two other drama serials The Guards and a revival of RTÉ's The Clinic; however, neither came to fruition.|$|E
25|$|Boston On Fire: Also {{known as}} Blind Moon or a Grand Slam. This is a blind bid {{to take all}} tricks in a hand, made before either partner <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> at their cards. Again, {{the first team to}} bid either Double Blind Nil or Blind Moon has precedence.|$|E

25|$|High {{oil prices}} {{typically}} affect less-affluent countries first, particularly {{the developing world}} with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation as well as private transport. The World Bank <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> more deeply at the effect of oil prices in the developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Many South American zoos hold tinamous, as do {{some private}} estates. Examples of captive {{breeding}} are small-billed tinamou in Minas Gerais and red-winged tinamou in Rio Grande do Sul. The small-billed tinamou <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> promising for domestication as the birds can raise 3–4 broods {{per year and}} are resistant to diseases that affect domestic chickens.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> at the tinnitus distress reaction (TDR) {{to account}} for differences in tinnitus severity. These findings suggest that at the initial perception of tinnitus, conditioning links tinnitus with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing tinnitus awareness and annoyance.|$|E

25|$|A Christian spiritual revival {{has grown}} in recent decades. While the Communist Party remains officially atheist, {{it has become more}} {{tolerant}} of churches outside party control. Christianity has grown rapidly, reaching 67 million people. In recent years, however, the Communist Party <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> with distrust on organizations with international ties; it tends to associate Christianity with subversive Western values, and has closed churches and schools. In 2015, Hong Kong has become a center of anti-Christian government activism.|$|E
25|$|Masuda's musical style {{draws from}} a number of sources, {{particularly}} classical music and the works of Igor Stravinsky and Dmitri Shostakovich. His favorite musical genre is techno, and he <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> to the music of the Super Mario series as an example of video game music that works well. Most of his ideas are inspired from simply observing real life and visualizing how he would design or draw outside objects. As a rule, he does not use previous characters as inspirations for new ones, instead creating each new one from independent sources.|$|E
25|$|The Quran {{is viewed}} {{to be the}} scriptural {{foundation}} of Islam and is believed by Muslims to have been revealed, without issue, to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel. Criticism of the Quran has frequently occurred since western scholarship <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> to decipher, understand and verify the claims of Islamic thought {{as stated in the}} Quran. Issues relating to the authenticity and morality of the Quran are criticized. Both critics and some scholars of western, eastern and secular backgrounds claim to have discovered scientific errors adding allegations of contradictions in the Quran while questioning its interpreted moral and ethical message.|$|E

25|$|Current {{operator}} New Jersey Transit <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> at restoring rail {{service to}} Phillipsburg, New Jersey, {{but there are}} no official plans to extend service over the border into Pennsylvania at present. Nor are there official plans to restore SEPTA service to Philadelphia. Freight operator Norfolk Southern Railway, heavily serves the region with a major classification yards in Allentown and Bethlehem using the former Lehigh Valley Railroad main line and the former Reading Company branch line, the Lehigh Line and the Reading Line. Canadian Pacific Railway, another freight operator, also transports through the Lehigh Valley using the Lehigh Line and the Reading Line.|$|E
25|$|Tabubil is host to {{a diverse}} range of cultures, due to its {{workforce}} historically being sourced from many parts of PNG, Australia, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Most expatriates are Australian, {{but there are also}} many Filipinos. A Canadian mining company, Inmet Mining Corporation owns an 18% stake in the mine, and of Tabubil. A number of Canadians, particularly those from Port Hardy on Vancouver Island, have also resided in Tabubil. During recent years, however, Ok Tedi Mining Limited <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> closer to home for human resources, with its long existent, but recently enforced preferred area human resourcing plan.|$|E
500|$|Bumblebees are {{in danger}} in many {{developed}} countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three neonicotinoid pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on neonicotinoid toxicity <b>has</b> <b>looked</b> at honeybees, a study on B. terrestris showed that [...] "field-realistic" [...] levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a [...] "considerable negative effect" [...] on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.|$|E
