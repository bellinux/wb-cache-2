40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{address the problem}} of pricing options in the {{presence}} of transaction costs. A known approach to this problem is a so-called superhedging approach. I suggest an idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and, based on it, a new algorithm to implement the superhedging approach. As far as I know, only European options were discussed in the literature on pricing derivatives when there are transaction costs. The proposed algorithm, however, can be applied to price American options as well. It is also more efficient compared with the previous methods. The superhedging approach is based on the problem of finding the cheapest portfolio now for which there is a trading strategy with consumption such that for every possible outcome the value of the portfolio {{at the time of the}} option exercise is not less than the value of the option (when the short position in the option is considered). A notion of a <b>hedging</b> <b>set</b> is introduced in the article to help to solve this problem. A discrete time economy is considered with price movements of an underlying asset being modeled by a recombining tree. At the current tree node a <b>hedging</b> <b>set</b> is defined as a set of portfolios that can hedge the considered option in the sense of superhedging. It is easy to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for every tree node at the time of the option exercise. I also show how to build <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> for the current tree nodes given <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> of the next tree nodes when there are proportional transaction costs. Thus the solution to the stated problem comes from building <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> backward the tree and then finding the cheapest portfolio in the first <b>hedging</b> <b>set.</b> I discuss in detail the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> and how to price European and American options under the presence of proportional transaction costs. Appropriate numerical examples are also given. I believe that the idea of <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> is versatile as it allows using a tree of any type to model price movements of an underlying asset when pricing and hedging derivatives using the superhedging approach. Also, multidimensional <b>hedging</b> <b>sets</b> may allow pricing and hedging derivatives that depend on several random factors...|$|R
40|$|Let H = (H,V) be a {{hypergraph}} with {{edge set}} H and vertex set V. Then hypergraph H is invertible iff {{there exists a}} permutation pi of V such that for all E belongs to H(edges) intersection of(pi(E) and E) = 0. H is invertibility critical if H is not invertible but every hypergraph obtained by removing an edge from H is invertible. The degree of H is d if |{E belongs to H(edges) |x belongs to E}| =< d for each x belongs to V Let i(d) be {{the maximum number of}} edges of an invertibility critical hypergraph of degree d. Theorem: i(d) =< (d- 1) { 2 d- 1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result leads to the following covering problem on graphs: Let G be a graph. A family H is subset of (2 ^{V(G) } is an edge cover of G iff for every edge e of G, there is an E belongs to <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> which includes e. <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> is a minimal edge cover of G iff for H' subset of H, H' is not an edge cover of G. Let b(d) (c(d)) be the maximum cardinality of a minimal edge cover <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> of a complete bipartite graph (complete graph) where <b>H(edge</b> <b>set)</b> has degree d. Theorem: c(d) =< i(d) =<b(d) =< c(d+ 1) and 3. 2 ^{d- 1 } - 2 =< b(d) =< (d- 1) { 2 d- 1 choose d} + 1. The proof of this result uses Sperner theory. The bounds b(d) also arise as bounds on the maximum number of elements in the union of minimal covers of families of sets. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

40|$|We derive a risk-neutral {{pricing model}} for {{discrete}} dynamic guaranteed funds with geometric Gaussian underlying security price process. We propose a dynamic hedging strategy {{by adding a}} gamma factor to the conventional delta. Simulation results demonstrate that, when hedging discretely, the risk-neutral gamma-adjusted-delta strategy outperforms the dynamic delta hedging strategy by reducing the expected hedging error, lowering the hedging error variability, and improving the self-financing possibility. The discrete dynamic delta-only hedging not only causes potential overcharge to clients but also could be costly to the issuers. We show that a naive application of continuous-time hedging formula to a discrete-time <b>hedging</b> <b>setting</b> tends to worsen these possibilities.

In the current study of 70 within-forest settings, factor analysis of preference ratings revealed two <b>setting</b> <b>categories</b> corresponding to high- and low-visual-access settings. In the high-access category, preference {{was positively correlated with}} mystery but uncorrelated with visual access. In the low-access category, preference was uncorrelated with mystery but positively correlated with visual access. We also examined an expanded definition of mystery that made explicit the distinction between mystery and surprise. The expanded definition produced results identical to the standard definition in the high-access category, but in the low-access category, expanded mystery was positively correlated with preference. We conclude that when properly understood, mystery tends to be positively related to preference...|$|R
