40|$|Abstract—A difficult-to-predict {{electrical}} failure is the continu-ity failure. Pressure junctions are common problem sources for continuity failures. Available tools {{to search for}} pressure-junction problems include low-resistance testing, temperature monitoring using physical contact between sensor and heated part, pyrom-eter temperature monitoring, infrared photography, and visual inspection. While each method is effective, each of these methods has one or more disadvantages. This paper will describe a break-through patented method of directly calculating conductor and pressure-junction impedance, resistance, and reactance using the noisy harmonic-laden switching-transient-laced (in other words, normal) load current flowing through an electrical distribution system. This technique then provides {{the solution to the}} problem of how to detect a conductor-path-impedance change of only a few tens of micro-ohms using conventional protective and metering devices without the need to de-energize the equipment or without the need to inject currents.

40|$|The plasma {{generated}} {{around the}} anode during <b>contact</b> <b>glow</b> discharge electrolysis (CGDE) {{is a rich}} source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals that can efficiently degrade organic contaminants in aqueous solutions. The degradation of textile azo dyestuffs, Reactive Yellow 176 (Y 3 RS), Reactive Red 239 (R 3 BS) and Reactive Black 5 (B 5), by anodic CGDE was investigated in the presence of chloride (Cl−) ions. The degradation kinetics of the dyes was dependent on the concentration of Cl− ions and on the respective dye being treated. R 3 BS degradation was inhibited by Cl− ions in the range of 0 – 0. 01 M. When the Cl− ion concentration was less than 0. 02 M, the dyes followed pseudo first-order degradation kinetics. For concentrations greater than 0. 02 M, the degradation of Y 3 RS and B 5 was significantly enhanced compared to the degradation of R 3 BS and deviated from first-order reaction kinetics. The presence of Cl− ions (0. 03 M) did not appear to improve dye mineralization but resulted in the formation of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX).

40|$|Solution plasma {{has been}} used in a variety of fields such as {{nanomaterials}} synthesis, the degradation of harmful substances, and solution analysis. However, as existing methods are ineffective in generating plasma over a large surface area, this study investigated the <b>contact</b> <b>glow</b> discharge electrolysis, in which the plasma was generated on the electrode surface. To clarify the condition of plasma generation, the effect of electrolyte concentration and temperature on plasma formation was studied. The electrical energy needed for plasma generation is higher than that needed to sustain a plasma, and when the electrolyte temperature was increased from 32 to 90 degrees C at 0. 01 M NaOH solution, the electric power density for vapor formation decreased from 2005 to 774 W/cm(2). From these results, we determined that pre-warming of the electrolyte is quite effective in generating plasma at lower power density. In addition, lower electrolyte concentrations required higher power density for vapor formation owing to lower solution conductivity. On the basis these results, a method for large-area and flat-plate plasma generation is proposed in which an initial small area of plasma generation is extended. When used with a plate electrode, a concentration of current {{to the edge of the}} plate meant that plasma could be formed by covering the edge of the electrode plate...|$|R

Emissions of H atoms and OH radicals were observed when the applied voltage was above 430 V. When the applied voltage increased to 450 V, emissions of O atoms were additionally detected. The emission intensities of these radicals and atoms increased with the increasing applied voltage. When the applied voltage exceeded 460 V, thermal radiation from the Pt anode was apparent in the visible and near infrared region. Electron temperature of the plasma increased with the applied voltage from 1. 0 x 10 (4) to 1. 5 x 10 (4) K by comparison of the intensities of H-alpha and H-beta lines.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{fabricate}} and characterize carbon graphite films by high-voltage cathodic and anodic <b>contact</b> <b>glow</b> discharge electrolysis (CGDE) for supercapacitor applications. Transmission electron microscopy {{revealed that the}} carbon films obtained by anodic CGDE, in which a carbon graphite is used as the positive electrode, are {{in the form of}} two-dimensional, relatively large lateral size sheets without major fractures or structural distortions. Whereas with the cathodic configuration, tiny and elongated flakes of graphite attached to larger sheets are obtained. We observed negative Raman wavenumber shifts of the G peak and the appearance of the T peak at ca. 1100 cm(- 1), which are attributed to thermal-induced strains and structural damages in the graphite crystal lattice, as well as to some C - C sp(3) bonds content. In addition to the aforementioned results and optical emission spectroscopy, it is proposed that both formation mechanisms by electrochemical exfoliation and material evaporation occur depending on the used polarization. All-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors using polyvinyl alcohol/H 3 PO 4 as gel electrolyte were fabricated and tested under dc and ac frequencies. We found two different behaviors: at dc and close-to-dc, the material prepared with cathodic CGDE showed close-to-ideal behavior with higher capacitance at different charging/discharging rates, which makes it more suitable for energy storage applications, whereas at higher frequencies (>= 100 Hz), the material prepared with anodic CGDE performed better for ac filtering applications that has been verified using an inverting integrator circuit.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{scarcity}} of water resources and increasing demand in energy, research efforts in effective water treatment and liquid waste management have been expanding steadily. The ability of UV light present in various electric discharges to disinfect water makes the use of plasma based technologies an effective alternative to the traditional methods like reverse-osmosis, distillation, etc. The interaction of plasmas with liquids has been a subject of current research and the present thesis includes both experimental and theoretical work done {{to better understand the}} physics of <b>contact</b> <b>glow</b> discharge electrolysis applied to waste water treatment. Other aspects of the interaction between electric fields and electrolytes have also been analyzed in this work. For instance, electric double layer theory has been used to model the interaction between electric field and liquid waste close to the solid surface incorporating joule heating and evaporation. The presence of the electric field results in a coupling of the momentum, energy, and mass transfer equations which are solved simultaneously with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation that describes the electric potential distribution. The results show that the rate of evaporation at the air-liquid interface is a strong function of the applied electric field and bulk ion-concentration. Temperature patterns observed in electrolytic cell experiments has been explained using buoyancy-driven flow model. As the heating element does not extend along the entire axial length of the cylindrical tank, this configuration displays very particular vortex patterns inside the cell and divides the domain into two regions of different temperatures. To model electrohydrodynamics accurately, boundary conditions for Navier-Stokes equations are revisited and a new formulation has been proposed to numerically solve the Navier-Stokes equations. The proposed formulation is particularly suitable for transient problems including start-up problems. In addition, a novel projection scheme has been proposed which is coupled with Navier-Stokes algorithm to produce numerical solutions on non-staggered grids, which is 2 $^{nd}$ order accurate in both space and time. The proposed projection scheme is also suitable for generating compatible initial data from given initial data at the start of any numerical simulation. The methodology developed can be adapted to study the dynamics of plasma based on a two-fluid formulation...|$|R
