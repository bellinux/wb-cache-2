25|$|On June 9, 2005, US Airways Flight 1170 and Aer Lingus Flight 132 {{narrowly}} avoided collision {{when they}} were cleared for takeoff nearly simultaneously on <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> by two different controllers. The crew of the US Airways flight spotted the oncoming Aer Lingus jet and avoided a collision by keeping their own aircraft on the runway past their normal rotation point, allowing the Aer Lingus flight to pass over them. Both flights lifted off safely, and continued to their destinations without further incident.|$|E
25|$|Wormingford was {{originally}} earmarked for an Eighth Heavy Bomb Group, being built by Richard Costain Ltd. and {{helped by a}} number of sub contractors during the period 1942/1943. The airfield had a 2,000-yard main runway on an E-W axis and two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> of 1,400 yards each along with the USAAF standard fifty hardstands, two T2 hangars, one each side of the airfield, Mark II lighting and temporary building accommodation for 2,900 personnel. The technical area was on the southern side of the airfield and the camp sites dispersed to the south and east in and around the village of Fordham.|$|E
25|$|The SkyWest {{aircraft}} was arriving at SFO after {{a flight from}} Modesto, California, and was cleared for a visual approach to runway 28R by NorCal approach control. After being switched over to the tower controller, SkyWest was cleared to land on runway 28R. At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the runway threshold the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} cleared for takeoff. Local procedures and FAA Order 7110.65 require the local controller {{to wait until the}} landing aircraft has passed through the intersection before clearing an aircraft for takeoff on one of the <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{abandoned}} <b>runway</b> <b>intersects</b> <b>runway</b> 17/35. Its {{direction is}} approximately 8/26, it is roughly 2500 ft. long, and its surface is asphalt, in extremely poor condition.|$|R
50|$|On 25 October 1979, Vickers Viscount G-BFYZ of Alidair {{was damaged}} beyond {{economic}} repair when the aircraft departed the runway after #4 propeller struck the runway. The nosewheel collapsed when the aircraft reached an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO, {{pronounced}} [...] "La-So") is an {{air traffic}} control procedure for aircraft landing and holding short of an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway</b> or point on a runway, to balance airport capacity and system efficiency with safety.|$|R
2500|$|Trichy Airport {{initially}} had two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways.</b> The shorter [...] runway 15/33 with PCN 15F/B/W/T {{was closed}} and is now used as an alternative taxiway to the international apron. The current runway under use 09/27 is [...] long with a PCN 40 F/B/W/T and has turning pads at both ends. The asphalt runway has a CA-1 ILS (Runway 27 only) and runway edge-lights. The other landing aids include a PAPI, HIRL, AFL and SAPL.|$|E
50|$|INS Garuda has 2 <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways,</b> {{allowing}} {{almost all}} operational aircraft {{to land and}} take off.|$|E
50|$|LAHSO was {{previously}} called SOIR (Simultaneous Operations on <b>Intersecting</b> <b>Runways),</b> and incorporates and expands all SOIR definitions.|$|E
50|$|On November 19, 1996, the {{aircraft}} collided on landing at Quincy with another Beechcraft, a private King Air, that was {{taking off from}} an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway.</b> All occupants of both planes, twelve on board the 1900 and two on board the King Air, were killed as a result.|$|R
50|$|The grass <b>runway</b> <b>intersects</b> {{the paved}} <b>runway,</b> {{and is used}} during the summertime. In 2013 there were almost 170 {{aircraft}} hangars at the airport.|$|R
50|$|Edgar County Airport covers {{an area of}} 180 acre at an {{elevation}} of 654 feet (199 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways: 9/27 has a surface measuring 4,501 by 75 feet (1,372 x 23 m). The second <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway,</b> designated 18/36, has a surface measuring 3,200 by 75 feet (975 x 23 m).|$|R
50|$|The airport has two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways,</b> whose {{configuration}} {{and available}} taxiways under current rules permit 34 passenger operations (takeoffs or landings) per hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{airfield}} has two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> of 3000 m and 3060 m in length. Each runway is 60 m wide, with 10 m wide safety shoulders on each side. The joint runway {{capacity is}} 60 aircraft movements per hour.|$|E
50|$|RAF Ridgewell was {{an early}} example of {{stations}} completed to Class A heavy bomber airfield design for the RAF, and had three <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> of 6,500 ft each in length, thirty-six hardstands, two T-2 hangars and accommodation for 2,900 men in temporary buildings.|$|E
50|$|Its use is voluntary: if a pilot denies LAHSO {{clearance}} the Air Traffic Controller must revector {{the aircraft}} to ensure adequate separation from other aircraft landing or departing an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway</b> or crossing down field. A heightened level of situational awareness is necessary, and student pilots or pilots {{not familiar with}} LAHSO should {{not participate in the}} program.|$|R
50|$|The airport has a main {{paved runway}} (5/23) and an <b>intersecting</b> grass <b>runway</b> (12/30).|$|R
50|$|On November 19, 1996, United Express Flight 5925 from Chicago and Burlington {{crashed on}} landing at Quincy. A Beechcraft King Air was {{attempting}} to takeoff on an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway</b> while the Beechcraft 1900 landed. The aircraft collided {{at the intersection of}} the two runways. All 12 on the 1900 and 2 on the King Air were killed in the accident.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II Coastwatchers, who {{observed}} and reported on Japanese shipping, had a station on Nukufetau. In 1943 United States Navy Seabees build a deepwater wharf and an airfield on Motulalo, {{which is the}} largest islet of Nukufetau. [...] Two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> of Nukufetau Airfield formed an [...] "X" [...] shape.|$|E
50|$|The Civil Constructional Corps and the Department of Main Roads began {{construction}} of an advanced operational airbase on the island during World War II, commencing in 1940. RAAF Base Horn Island was completed in 1941 and {{was used as a}} staging base for Allied aircraft moving between Australia and New Guinea. The airfield consisted of two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways,</b> with revetments for aircraft parking.|$|E
50|$|May 26, 2007: SkyWest Airlines flight 5741, an Embraer 120, was {{involved}} in a serious runway incursion when the plane nearly collided with Republic Airlines flight 4912, an Embraer 170, on <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> at San Francisco. There were no reported injuries to passengers and no reported damage to either aircraft. According to the NTSB, the FAA traffic controller was at fault and the aircraft were between 50 and 300 feet apart.|$|E
25|$|On , an {{arriving}} SkyWest Airlines Embraer EMB 120 nearly {{collided with}} a Republic Airline Embraer 170 Regional Jet at the junction of Runways 01L and 28R. After the SkyWest EMB 120 passed the Runway 28R threshold, the Republic E-170 was cleared for takeoff on 01L, in contradiction to local and FAA orders requiring the arriving aircraft to pass the intersection before clearing departing aircraft on the <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway.</b>|$|R
50|$|Runway 10 is {{occasionally}} {{used in a}} shortened configuration: aircraft land at {{the beginning}} of the runway but do not use its full length to stop. Instead, they hold short of the <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway</b> 5/23. Known as a land and hold short operation (LAHSO), this procedure is relatively common in the United States and allows both runways to be used at the same time. Pilots have the ability to reject the LAHSO clearance if they need the full runway to ensure a safe landing.|$|R
50|$|By 1949 the {{airstrip}} boasted three <b>intersecting</b> grass <b>runways</b> (N-S, E-W and NW-SE), {{the longest}} the 2,550-foot diagonal strip. Gene Rawdon {{was listed as}} the airport manager.|$|R
50|$|On 9 June 2005, US Airways Flight 1170, a Boeing 737-300, nearly {{collided}} with Aer Lingus Flight 132, an Airbus A330 at Logan International Airport in Boston after both flights were given nearly simultaneous clearances for takeoff on <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways.</b> The US Airways flight kept its nose {{down on the}} runway for an extended {{amount of time to}} go underneath the Aer Lingus flight and avoided a collision.|$|E
50|$|Framlingham {{airfield}} {{was built}} in 1942 and {{was used by the}} United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force. It was built as a standard heavy bomber airfield to Class A specification. The three <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> were of 2,030, 1,440 and 1,430 yards length.

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1949 that Hawkins was again {{classified}} as a civil airfield. With the introduction of jet service to Jackson in 1963, the City began work to annex land in Rankin County, Mississippi {{to build a new}} airport. Allen C. Thompson Field, Jackson Municipal Airport opened later that year, one of the first airports with parallel runways versus cross wind <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways.</b> With the opening of Jackson Municipal Airport, Hawkins Field became a general aviation airport.|$|E
50|$|The airfield, created {{especially}} for heavy bombers, comprised two <b>intersecting</b> bitumen <b>runways,</b> a north-south (165°) runway 5000 x 150 ft and an east-west (107°) runway 7000 x 150 ft.|$|R
50|$|On 16 November 1996, United Express Flight 5925 was {{landing at}} Quincy Regional Airport when {{the pilot of}} a Beechcraft King Air started to take off on an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway.</b> As the field was uncontrolled, the United Express pilots inquired whether the King Air was clear of the runways. They {{received}} no response except for {{a call from a}} Piper Cherokee saying they were holding short. The King Air and United Express collided at the intersection of the two runways killing all 12 on board Flight 5925 and the pilot and passenger of the Beechcraft King Air.|$|R
50|$|From January 1941 to June 1943, Tholthorpe {{underwent}} maintenance {{to upgrade}} to Class A standards, with three <b>intersecting</b> concrete <b>runways</b> designated main 10-28 at 2,000 yards, 06-24 at 1,430 yards and 16-34 at 1,400 yards.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} airport {{with its}} <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways</b> and large hangar remained intact until 1998 when the City of Linden, needing more tax-ratable property decided {{to divide up}} the underutilized airport to create a shopping center called Aviation Plaza {{on the north side}} of the field. A new airport was built on the south side complete with new taxiways, hangars and parking areas. The only remaining part of the original airport is the west to east (9-27) runway.|$|E
5000|$|Goxhill was {{originally}} {{used as a}} barrage balloon site to protect the port of Hull and the River Humber. In 1940, Goxhill was transferred to RAF Bomber Command and was planned and rebuilt as a bomber airfield. The base was equipped with three <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways,</b> the main runway at [...] and two secondary runways of [...] Three hangars were built - two T-2's, one J-Type and four blisters and fifty aircraft hardstands. Temporary accommodation was provided for 1700+ personnel.|$|E
50|$|Trichy Airport {{initially}} had two <b>intersecting</b> <b>runways.</b> The shorter 4776 ft runway 15/33 with PCN 15F/B/W/T {{was closed}} and is now used as an alternative taxiway to the international apron. The current runway under use 09/27 is 8136 ft long with a PCN 40 F/B/W/T and has turning pads at both ends. The asphalt runway has a CA-1 ILS (Runway 27 only) and runway edge-lights. The other landing aids include a PAPI, HIRL, AFL and SAPL.|$|E
5000|$|Kasimovo is {{a former}} air base in Leningrad Oblast, Russia located 30 km north of Saint Petersburg. It is an {{abandoned}} military airfield; Google Earth imagery shows that a road <b>intersects</b> the <b>runway.</b> Tenant units are unknown.|$|R

50|$|After the MOL program cancellation, Taylor {{continued}} his USAF {{career as an}} instructor at the Test Pilot School and served as deputy commandant. On September 4, 1970, he and French air force exchange test pilot trainee, Pierre J. du Bucq, were killed when their T-38 aircraft crashed during a training mission at Palmdale Regional Airport. The crash was caused by severe wake turbulence from a C-141 that was performing touch-and-goes on an <b>intersecting</b> <b>runway.</b> In memory of Taylor, the Test Pilot School presented the James M. Taylor Award to the outstanding graduate of the Experimental Test Pilot Course (Phase 1). The award was discontinued after class 71B when the school's curriculum was revised to eliminate the Phase I and II designation.|$|R
