2500|$|Owing to {{a limited}} {{literature}} on the subject, birds {{are believed to have}} very limited regenerative abilities as adults. Some studies on roosters have suggested that birds can adequately regenerate some parts of the limbs and depending on the conditions in which regeneration takes place, such as age of the animal, the inter-relationship of the injured tissue with other muscles, and the type of operation, can involve complete regeneration of some musculoskeletal structure. Werber and Goldschmidt (1909) found that the goose and duck were capable of regenerating their beaks after partial amputation [...] and Sidorova (1962) observed liver regeneration via hypertrophy in roosters. Birds are also capable of regenerating the hair cells in their cochlea following noise damage or ototoxic drug damage. Despite this evidence, contemporary studies suggest reparative regeneration in avian species is limited to periods during embryonic development. An array of molecular biology techniques have been successful in manipulating cellular pathways known to contribute to spontaneous regeneration in chick embryos. For instance, removing a portion of the elbow joint in a chick embryo via window excision or slice excision and comparing <b>joint</b> <b>tissue</b> specific markers and cartilage markers showed that window excision allowed 10 out of 20 limbs to regenerate and expressed joint genes similarly to a developing embryo. In contrast, slice excision did not allow the joint to regenerate due to the fusion of the skeletal elements seen by an expression of cartilage markers.|$|E
40|$|Antiserum to the Borrelia burgdorferi {{arthritis}}-related protein, Arp, {{has been}} shown to prevent or reduce arthritis in immuno-deficient mice. To directly investigate the requirement for this lipoprotein in the generation of Lyme arthritis, we utilized tar-geted deletion to generate a B. burgdorferi clone that lacked only the arp gene locus. Infection of Lyme disease-susceptible C 3 H/ HeNmice with the arp deletion mutant demonstrated significantly reduced tibiotarsal joint swelling during the first 6 weeks of infection compared to a wild-type control. The severity of joint swelling was restored to wild-type levels in mice infected with an arpmutant clone complemented in cis. Interestingly, the reduced swelling of <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> exhibited by mice infected with the arp deletion mutant did not directly correspond to reduced underlying arthritis. Histopathology data at 2 weeks postinfection showed some reduction in arthritis severity caused by the arpmutant clone; however, by 8 weeks, no significant difference was observed between <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> infected by the wild-type or arpmutant clones. The spirochete load in the <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> of mice infected with the arpmutant was found to be greater than that exhibited by the wild-type control.

It has been proposed that Fcγ receptor (FcγR) contributes to NKT cell activation in antibody-induced arthritis. To address this issue, we explored the functions of FcγR on NKT cells in antibody-induced arthritis. RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that NKT cells constitutively express surface FcγRIII but not FcγRI, -II, or -IV. FcγRIII engagement by aggregated IgG on NKT cells enhanced CD 25 and CD 69 expression, whereas FcγR–/– mouse NKT cells did not enhance activation. FcγRIII engagement on NKT cells enhanced the production of IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 13, and IFN-γ, whereas FcγR-deficient NKT cells did not alter the production of these cytokines after aggregated IgG treatment. However, FcγR-deficient NKT cells were functionally intact in terms of TCR-induced activation. Moreover, adoptive transfer of FcγR-deficient NKT cells could not restore inflammation or TGF-β production in the <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> of CD 1 d–/– mice, whereas adoptive transfer of wild-type NKT cells induced arthritis and reduced TGF-β production in <b>joint</b> <b>tissues.</b> We conclude that FcγRIII engagement by IgG in <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> provides activating signals to NKT cells in antibody-induced arthritis...|$|R

NO is also an important modifier of bone metabolism, and may partially mediate the bone-sparing effects of oestrogen.

Preliminary investigations tested a novel computer-assisted histomorphometric method of assessing osteochondral changes post-meniscectomy, in a trial of a putative disease-modifying osteoarthritis compound. Quantitative assessment revealed a subtle protective effect not evident by qualitative methods. These techniques were then used to test the experimental hypotheses in a combined trial involving 48 aged ewes, variously subjected to ovariectomy, bilateral lateral meniscectomy, and/or topical GTN therapy. At six months, <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> were analysed using histology, histomorphometry, dynamic biomechanical testing, serum markers, bone densitometry, and tissue culture of synovial fibroblasts and explants of cartilage and bone. Ovariectomy modified cartilage structure and chondrocyte metabolism, and induced subchondral bone remodelling. Prior ovariectomy altered the development of OA lesions post-meniscectomy, producing thicker but biomechanically inferior cartilage and elevated metabolic activity in subchondral bone. GTN treatment of normal sheep induced thinner, structurally-altered cartilage in normal sheep, and accentuated cartilage and subchondral bone lesions post-meniscectomy.

Cells from <b>joint</b> <b>tissue,</b> including cartilage derived progenitor cells (CPC), subchondral bone derived osteoblast and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) were isolated. The concentration-dependent effects of PVP–I on cell proliferation, migration and differentiation were evaluated. Additionally, the efficacy and mechanism of a PVP–I loaded bilayer collagen scaffold for osteochondral defect repair was investigated in a rabbit model. A micromolar concentration of PVP–I was found not to affect cell proliferation, CPC migration or extracellular matrix production. Interestingly, micromolar concentrations of PVP–I promote osteogenic differentiation of BM-MSC, as evidenced by up-regulation of RUNX 2 and Osteocalcin gene expression, as well as increased mineralization on the three-dimensional scaffold. PVP–I treatment of collagen scaffolds significantly increased fibronectin binding onto the scaffold surface and collagen type I protein synthesis of cultured BM-MSC. Implantation of PVP–I treated collagen scaffolds into rabbit osteochondral defect significantly enhanced subchondral bone regeneration at 6 weeks post-surgery compared with the scaffold alone (subchondral bone histological score of 8. 80 ± 1. 64 vs. 3. 8 ± 2. 19, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract The selectins, {{along with}} very late antigen- 4 and CD 44, have {{been implicated in}} {{mediating}} leukocyte rolling interactions that lead to joint recruitment and inflammation during the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. Previously, we showed that P-selectin deficiency in mice resulted in accelerated onset of joint inflammation in the murine collagen-immunized arthritis model. Here, we report that mice deficient either in E-selectin or in E-selectin and P-selectin (E/P-selectin mutant) also exhibit accelerated development of arthritis compared with wild type mice in the CIA model, suggesting that these adhesion molecules perform overlapping functions in regulating joint disease. Analyses of cytokine and chemokine expression in <b>joint</b> <b>tissue</b> from E/P-selectin mutant mice {{before the onset of}} joint swelling revealed significantly higher joint levels of macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α and IL- 1 β compared to wild-type mice.

Synovium was also obtained from 10 non-arthritic (NA) subjects. Hydroxyproline was measured in hydrolysed tissue samples and converted to an equivalent collagen content. The amounts of Pyr and Dpyr crosslinks measured in the hydrolysed samples using a fluorescence technique were expressed as mumol/mol of collagen. RESULTS: Pyr and Dpyr were distributed in all three tissues, but in different amounts. The ratio of the contents of Pyr and (Pyr:Dpyr) was 50 : 1 in cartilage, 3 : 1 in bone, and 25 : 1 in synovium. OA cartilage had a greater Dpyr content than the RA cartilage, but there was no other significant difference in the contents of Pyr and Dpyr and the ratio Pyr:Dpyr in the <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> from patients with OA or RA.

Moreover, concentration alterations of these neuropeptides {{at the site of}} inflammation in the arthritic ankle joints as well as the spinal cords were evaluated. The occurrence of Met-enk in bone and <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> was demonstrated using immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Met-enk labeling was observed in unmyelinated nerve fibers in periosteum, in synovial, bone marrow and bone cells as well as in bone matrix. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed straight and long Met-enk nerve fibers in periosteum and varicosed nerve fibers in synovial membrane. Quantification of its concentration in these tissues was done using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high performance liquid chromatographyelectrochemical detection. In cell culture, Met-enk inhibits the growth of osteoblast cells, whereas naltrexone stimulates its growth, denoting that Met-enk action is through opioid receptor. In adjuvant arthritis, Met-enk concentration decreases in chronic arthritic ankles and increases in spinal cords of the same group. The loss of Met-enk concentration in the arthritic ankles could explain pain and hypertrophic changes at the site of inflammation. Neurokinin-A was localized in normal bone and <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> using immunoelectron microscopy. It is present in synovial cells, in myelinated nerve fibers in the periosteum, bone marrow cells, and in bone matrix. Using RIA, its concentration in normal and arthritic tissues was studied. Its concentration was significantly increased in ankles and spinal cords of chronic arthritic rats. These changes in adjuvant arthritis may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Somatostatin morphological distribution in bone and <b>joint</b> <b>tissues</b> was studied using immunoelectron microscopy. It is present in myelinated nerve fibers in the periosteum, synovial cells, bone marrow cells and bone matrix. In addition, its concentration in these tissues was assessed using RIA, which revealed measurable concentrations.

The increase in the chronic arthritic ankles may be not to the level needed to stop arthritis, which thus merits supplement with exogenous somatostatin to treat the disease.
