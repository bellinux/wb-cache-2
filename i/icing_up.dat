25|$|The {{process of}} {{compressing}} gas into a diving cylinder removes {{moisture from the}} gas. This is good for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver's lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also {{thought to be a}} predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. It is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas is decompressed while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This <b>icing</b> <b>up</b> in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.|$|E

There the troop were briefed with aerial reconnaissance photographs of the objective that were provided by the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit, which showed that there were actually two aqueducts in the area, one larger than the other; after a brief discussion it was decided that the larger of the two would be targeted. At 18:30 on 10 February the six Whitleys took off from Malta, each carrying one officer and five other ranks of X Troop; the flight to the target area was uneventful, with clear weather and perfect visibility. The lead Whitley reached the drop zone, which was approximately [...] from the aqueduct, at 21:42.

The six men who had not landed in the drop zone were Royal Engineer sappers who were supposed to rig the aqueduct for demolition, and their Whitley had been carrying most of the explosives to be used in the operation. Despite these losses, the troop gathered up the remaining containers and took up positions around the aqueduct. However, on examining the aqueduct it was found the piers supporting it were made of reinforced concrete and not brick as had been expected, leading Pritchard to suspect that the remaining explosives might be insufficient to demolish the aqueduct. After closer inspection, Pritchard ordered that the majority of the explosives be placed around the western pier and the rest against its abutment, in the hope that this would cause enough damage to destroy the aqueduct. A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the Ginestra river.|$|E

At 18:30 on 10 February the six Whitleys took off from Malta, each carrying one officer and five other ranks of X Troop; the flight to the target area was uneventful, with clear weather and perfect visibility. The lead Whitley reached the drop zone, which was approximately 500 m from the aqueduct, at 21:42. All six men and their equipment containers landed within 250 m of the drop zone, as did the men from the next four aircraft; however two of the bombers failed to drop their containers due to the <b>icing</b> <b>up</b> of the release mechanisms, and the sixth aircraft failed to locate the drop zone and eventually dropped its six men and containers two hours later in a valley two miles from the aqueduct.

A small amount of explosives were also placed under a nearby bridge that bridged the Ginestra river.At 00:30 on 11 February the explosives were detonated and the western pier destroyed, causing the aqueduct to crumble and effectively break in half, and the Ginestra bridge was also successfully destroyed. Leaving one man who had broken his ankle when he had landed with a nearby farmer, the remainder of the Troop withdrew from the area at 01:00, splitting into three groups and heading towards the coast. The three groups moved as fast as possible towards the coast, but were all captured within a few hours of the aqueduct being demolished. The group commanded by Major Pritchard was spotted by a farmer who raised the alarm at a nearby village, leading to a local carabinieri unit surrounding the group; with little ammunition and heavily outnumbered, Pritchard decided to surrender. The other three groups, including the six sappers who had landed two miles from the objective, fared little better. The two groups from the aqueduct were soon located by Italian soldiers and ambushed, forcing them to surrender after brief firefights. The third group were found by a group of civilians as they moved towards the coast; after attempting to bluff their way past by claiming to be German soldiers on a special field exercise, which failed when the local Mayor demanded identity papers, they were captured by carabinieri. All were stripped of their weapons and equipment and transported to Naples, with the exception of the Italian translator, Picchi; he was handed over to the Blackshirts, a Fascist paramilitary group, who tortured and then executed him. Even if any of the groups had managed to make their way to the coast and the rendezvous point, they would not have been picked up by HMS Triumph. One of the two Whitleys conducting the diversionary raid at Foggia suffered engine trouble after bombing the railway yards. The pilot radioed Malta, informing his airfield that he was ditching in the mouth of the River Sele, coincidentally the area where the rendezvous was to occur. Fearing that the message had been monitored by the Italians and that the submarine might sail into a trap, the decision was made by senior officers not to send it to the rendezvous point.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates {{liquid water}} content (LWC) and its {{uniformity}} in supercooled aerosol clouds produced in a low-speed horizontal icing wind tunnel used for simulating atmospheric icing. The dependence of LWC obtained at mid-height of the tunnel test section on thermodynamic parameters of the air stream and on dynamic parameters applied to the nozzle system is determined empirically for two types of nozzles. The investigation reveals that LWC increases with air velocity, reaches a maximum at a low airspeed (below 30 m/s), and decreases as was observed at high airspeeds used for modeling aircraft <b>icing</b> (<b>up</b> to 160 m/s) only after passing this maximum. This complex behavior is explained by the concurrence of two processes: the vertical separation of droplets of different size due {{to the effect of}} gravity, and the vertical and transverse shrinkage of the aerosol cloud co-occurring with its streamwise expansion...|$|E

" When we read this passage, what is the tenor of the voice that we might deploy through the use of the third person narrative? In the examination of educational narrative forms, whether through qualitative research or self-evaluation exercises, one might discern many voices that could crowd one’s analytical frame. The problem for education is straightforward, and has been neatly summarised by Inna Semetsky (2004) when she said, “[A] new non-representational language of expression, exemplified in what Deleuze (1994 b) called a performative or modulating aspect, is being created by means of the language structure going through the process of its own becoming-other and undergoing a series of transformations giving birth to a new, as though foreign and unfamiliar, other language,” (p. 316). This is happening as I speak or as you read these words through the immense structures and processes of the education systems of the industrialised West. Metrophage was born of these structures and now sits innocently in my office or on the internet or in the computer files of high school students studying for examinations to go to respectable colleges. The problem can be broken down into two parts that I shall explore throughout this chapter: 1. What are the languages of otherness that can be produced through the action of educational processing? 2. How can we use this otherness to set off new directions of educational practice and how does the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze relate to these practices...|$|E
