Gross alpha and beta activities were determined by standard ISO 9696 and ISO 9697; liquid scintillation was usedfor 226 Ra determination. 238 U and 234 U concentrations were determined by alpha spectrometry after separation from matrix by extraction chromatography and electroplating.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Laboratori de Radiologia Ambiental (LRA) has {{recently}} implemented a method based on liquid scintilla-tion counting (LSC) for the simultaneous measurement of gross alpha and <b>gross</b> <b>beta</b> <b>activities</b> in water samples. The meth-odology described here {{serves as a}} basis for the development of these determinations in more complex matrixes. As usual for LSC, the sample treatment approach is quite straightforward. However, instrument optimization for this kind of determination is neither rapid nor easy because of the numerous factors that affect the response of the equipment. Some of these factors were studied in this work. The effect of distinct counting windows on the optimum pulse-shape discrimination device (PSA) was studied considering an alpha emitter (241 Am) and 3 different beta emitters (137 Cs, 40 K, and 90 Y) to detect possible different behavior relating to the energy of the emitter.

In this study, a monitoring of radioactivity content was performed in tap waters collected in a region of Central Italy to check the compliance with recent European and Italian regulations.

Gross alpha and beta activities were determined by standard ISO 9696 and ISO 9697; for 226 Ra, 222 Rn and 3 H determination, liquid scintillation was used. 238 U and 234 U concentrations were determined by alpha spectrometry after separation from the matrix by extraction chromatography and electroplating. The results obtained revealed that, in most samples, gross alpha and gross beta were lower than the parameter value indicated in the international regulations.

The article also presents an analysis of the results of activities of the Administration of Rospotrebnadzor in theBashkortostanRepublicfor the reducing of the levels of the Republican population exposure from the natural irradiation sources. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{characterization}} of a large area 200 mm × 200 mm EJ- 444 scintillation detector {{to be used for}} monitoring <b>gross</b> alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>activity</b> in tap water plants. Specific tests were performed {{in order to determine the}} best setup to read-out the light from the detector side. The possibility to stack many detectors and get a compact device with total active area of the order of 1 m 2 has been explored. Alpha/beta discrimination, efficiency and homogeneity tests were carried out with alpha and beta sources. Background from ambient radioactivity was measured as well. Alpha/beta real-time monitoring in drinking water is a goal of the EU project TAWARA_RTM...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mean <b>gross</b> alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>activities</b> in {{surface soil}} and {{drinkable}} {{water in the}} surrounding communities of a steel processing company, following a continuous exposure of workers and dwellers is determined using a low background Gas-less counting system with a solid state silicon PIPS detector for alpha and beta detection. The average activities for <b>gross</b> alpha and <b>beta</b> in soil ranged between 48. 5  ±  15. 8 – 64. 0  ±  10. 0 Bq/kg and 411. 5  ±  11. 5 – 2710. 0  ±  150. 0 Bq/kg respectively, whereas in water it ranged between 0. 0064  ±  0. 0001 – 0. 0182  ±  0. 0001  Bq/l and 0. 046  ±  0. 001 – 0. 126  ±  0. 001  Bq/l respectively. The average annual committed effective dose from intake of water was between 0. 0304  mSv and 0. 0678  mSv which {{is lower than the}} recommended reference level for ingested dose from drinkable water...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Natural {{radioactivity}} in bottled {{drinking water}} marketed in Jordan was measured. High purity germanium (HPGe) spectrometer system coupled to a PC {{was used to}} analyze the obtained gamma-ray spectra. The activity in Bq/l for each of eighteen samples of bottled drinking water and one drinking tap water was obtained and corrected for efficiency and background. For example, we found that the maximum measured activity of 226 Ra was 5. 5 Bq/l. <b>Gross</b> alpha and <b>beta</b> <b>activities</b> were also estimated from the isotopes identified in the samples. Concentrations of isotopes and their parent nuclides were calculated in g/l. For example, the concentrations were in the range of 0 mg/l to 0. 103 mg/l for 40 K. The committed effective dose due to ingestion of radionuclide from the consumption of bottled waters for adults and children were estimated. The range was found to be 1. 9 mSv/y for children and 1. 7 mSv/y for adults. No artificial or fission products were detected in any one of the samples...|$|R
