40|$|A {{new type}} of {{nanocomposite}} ion-exchange membranes containing sulfonated polyethersulfone (sPES) polymer matrix and sulfonated surface-functionalized mesoporous silica (SS) inorganic fillers was prepared. Various characterizations revealed that the addition of inorganic fillers with different shapes had a significant influence on the membrane structure. The mesoporous inorganic fillers not only created extra pore and water channels, assisting the ionic migration and improving conductivity of the composites, but also provided additional fixed charge groups upon surface modification. This allows the Donnan exclusion to work effectively and thus improve the selectivity of membranes. It was proved that the incorporation of appropriate amount of SS additive could significantly improve the conductivity (up to 20 folds) and permselectivity (about 14 %) of the sPES membranes.

However, the presence of dissolved salts may inhibit or retard the treatment process. In this work, a coupled process is studied including a <b>desalination</b> step <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> (ED) associated with an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) with a synthetic wastewater containing NaCl and phenol. The experimental study concerning ED was carried out using a pilot plant. The influence of process variables, like the initial water composition and the electrical current intensity, on the demineralization factor was investigated. Experiments were also performed without electrical current application, {{in order to determine the}} unfavorable phenol transfer through the membranes due to diffusion. The phenol and salt concentration variations in the ED compartments were measured over time, using dedicated procedures and an experimental design to determine the global characteristic parameters. A phenomenological approach was used to relate the phenol, salt and water fluxes with the driving force (concentration and electric potential gradients). Under normal ED conditions, two contributions were pointed out for the phenol transport, i. e. Diffusion and convection, this latter coming from the water flux due to electroosmosis related to the migration of salts. The fitting of the parameters of the transport equations resulted in good agreement with the experimental results over the range of conditions investigated. Photo- enton oxidation process was studied in a laboratory batch reactor. As expected, the results confirm the negative effect of the salt concentration on the phenol removal efficiency by oxidation. This effect was not found to be linear concerning salt concentration and degradation rate. Due to the complexity of these reaction systems, a model based on artificial neural networks has been developed to fit the experimental data. This model describes the evolution of the pollutant concentration i. e. phenol, by means of a reaction rate, during irradiation time under various operating conditions.

40|$|Hydrogels are {{considered}} to be in the class of smart materials that find application in diagnostic, therapeutic,and fundamental science tools for miniaturized total analysis systems. In this thesis, the focus is on three major applications of patterned hydrogels, which are explored as an alternative strategy to expensive and low throughput systems for preparative DNA fractionation, in vitro compartmentalization of human gut epithelium, and desalination by microelectrodialysis. The use of patterned hydrogels in closed fluidic microchips or different research fields depends crucially on the ease and accessibility of their fabrication technology. In this work, two simple fabrication procedures are developed to pattern hydrogel microarrays. First, intermittent illumination is applied on mechanically polished microchips or the photopatterning of hydrogels. Second, capillary pressure barriers are used for controlling the position of the liquid-air meniscus in microchip channels, allowing the subsequent patterning of hydrogels by photopolymerization and thermo-gelation. Both fabrication techniques differ from previous studies in terms of versatility and high reproducibility. Preparative fractionation and purification of small-sized DNA fragments play an important role for second-generation sequencing and personalized medicine, and it is the first major application of hydrogels explored. We describe a novel method for concurrent continuous flow fractionation and purification of DNA fragments in a microfluidic device filled with agarose gel. The innovation of this work is twofold. Firstly, a new principle for continuous flow DNA fractionation is demonstrated. We exploit the variation in the field-dependent mobility of DNA molecules with DNA length for the fractionation, which is a separation mechanism that has hitherto gone unnoticed. Secondly, since this new mechanism can be applied using agarose gel, it provides a low-cost, robust, and versatile separation matrix. The theoretical advancement in combination with the practical advantages can lead to new developments in the gield of sample preparation of biological samples. Baseline fractionation of a 0. 5 - 10 kbp DNA ladder is achieved within 2 minutes, which is ~ 15 times faster than in commercially available devices. Furthermore, the gel technology is easily adaptable; for example, changing the gel type can enable the fractionation of protein molecules. Thus, the microfluidic device is of broad interest for second generation sequencing and clinical diagnosis applications. The second major application of hydrogels reported in this thesis is the use of multicompartmental hydrogel arrays for 3 D culturing of human intestine epithelial cells. Engineering in vitro microenvironments that mimic in vivo tissue systems is crucial for improving our understanding of tissue physiology, as well as curtailing the high costs and complexities associated with the existing techniques. We propose and demonstrate an in vitro microfluidic cell culture platform that consists of periodic 3 D hydrogel structures. The compartmentalized nature of the microchip architecture and fluid delivery enable culturing of human intestine cells which spontaneously grow into 3 D structures on the 3 rd day of cell culturing. On the 8 th day of culture, Caco- 2 cells are co-cultured for 36 hours with intestinal bacteria E. coli, which adhered to the cells without affecting the cell viability. Continuous fluidic perfusion also enables the preliminary screening of chloramphenicol treatment on the intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, we find that different compartment geometries with large and small hydrogel interfaces lead to a difference in the proliferation and cell spread profile of Caco- 2 cells. The microchip enables facile fluidic control that allows dynamic regulation of culture conditions. Microelectrodialysis is explored as the last major application of hydrogels in this thesis. Common methods used to construct microelectrodialysis devices rely on incorporation of membranes into microchips, which is challenging in terms of robustness, consistency, and ease of fabrication. Hydrogels are more promising candidates for <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis,</b> than membranes due to their ion selective and hydrophilic matrix, which is also versatile, inexpensive, and easily tailorable. Patterning ion selective hydrogels at small scales is therefore used to miniaturize the electrodialysis process in microfluidic devices, and subsequently provides more insight into the ion transport phenomena. In this work, we firstly show that parallel streams of concentrated and ion-depleted water are formed in continuous flow when a potential difference is applied across the microchip containing alternating rows of patterned cation- and anion-selective hydrogels. The device could remove approximately 75 % of the 1 mM sodium chloride salt introduced via the inlet streams. We demonstrate different currents and flow rates in the microchip for desalination purposes. Secondly, the microchip enables ion transport visualization in the ion selective hydrogels and microchannels when a charged fluorescent dye is utilized. For sufficiently high potential differences, vortex formation is observed near the hydrogel-liquid interfaces, contributing to an enhanced convective transport towards the hydrogels in the overlimiting current regime...|$|E

40|$|Although {{industrial}} osmotic {{processes are}} {{often referred to}} as ‘novel’, the possibility for osmotic power generation has been suggested as early as the 1970 s. Today forward osmosis is attracting significant interest and this interest has resulted in intensive research. Forward osmosis has been suggested as viable separation process, with numerous potential applications – from osmotic drug delivery and concentration of liquid foods to water purification and re-use in space. Particularly interesting is the possibility of seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> forward osmosis, as the process is claimed to require little or no pre-treatment of the feed water, due to minor membrane fouling. This alone is a significant advantage over reverse osmosis. Within the oil and gas sector, research conducted {{in the last couple of}} years shows that low salinity waterflooding can result in enhanced oil recovery, and therefore the industry is searching for new possibilities for off-shore based production of low salinity water.

There is a need for robust technologies that handle the problem of mineral scaling in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, allowing operation at higher recoveries, i. e., with a higher production of potable water. In this study, the retentate stream of a nanofiltration unit was therefore desalinated <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis.</b> Two different ion exchange membrane pairs, namely AMX-CMX (Neosepta, Japan) and FTAM-FTCM (Fumasep, Germany) were used for this purpose.

The economic feasibility of retentate treatment <b>by</b> <b>electrodialysis</b> is discussed as well. The FTAM anion exchange membranes of Fumasep were able to remove sulphate ions faster, relative to chloride or nitrate ions. This is unexpected, because sulphate ions have a high hydrated ionic radius and steric hindrance typically obstructs their transport through anion exchange membranes, as is the case with the AMX membranes. This feature makes the FTAM membranes appropriate for the desalination of retentate streams of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, in water recycling applications.

Entropy generation in thermal technologies increases at lower waste heat temperatures largely in the feed or brine portions of the various heat exchangers used. This occurs largely because lower temperatures reduce recovery, increasing the relative flow rates of feed and brine. However, HDH (without extractions) had the reverse trend, only being competitive at lower temperatures.
