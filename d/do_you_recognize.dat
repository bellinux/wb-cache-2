60|$|Under {{cover of}} a mist that has settled over the scene, a few years flit by, and escape our notice. As the {{atmosphere}} becomes transparent, we perceive a decrepit grandsire, hobbling along the street. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> him? We saw him, first, as the baby in Goodwife Massey's arms, when the primeval trees were flinging their shadow over Roger Conant's cabin; we have seen him, as the boy, the youth, the man, bearing his humble part in all the successive scenes, and forming the index-figure whereby to note the age of his coeval town. And here he is, old Goodman Massey, taking his last walk,--often pausing,--often leaning over his staff,--and calling to mind whose dwelling stood at such and such a spot, and whose field or garden occupied the site of those more recent houses. He can render a reason for all the bends and deviations of the thoroughfare, which, in its flexible and plastic infancy, was made to swerve aside from a straight line, in order to visit every settler's door. The Main Street is still youthful; the coeval man is in his latest age. Soon he will be gone, a patriarch of fourscore, yet shall retain a sort of infantine life in our local history, as the first town-born child.|$|E
60|$|Oh, it is {{wonderful}} here, aunty dear, just paradise! Oh, {{if you could}} only see it! everything so wild and lovely; such grand plains, stretching such miles and miles and miles, all the most delicious velvety sand and sage-brush, and rabbits {{as big as a}} dog, and such tall and noble jackassful ears that that is what they name them by; and such vast mountains, and so rugged and craggy and lofty, with cloud-shawls wrapped around their shoulders, and looking so solemn and awful and satisfied; and the charming Indians, oh, how you would dote on them, aunty dear, and they would on you, too, and they would let you hold their babies, the way they do me, and they ARE the fattest, and brownest, and sweetest little things, and never cry, and wouldn't if they had pins sticking in them, which they haven't, because they are poor and can't afford it; and the horses and mules and cattle and dogs--hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, and not an animal that you can't do what you please with, except uncle Thomas, but I don't mind him, he's lovely; and oh, if you could hear the bugles: TOO--TOO--TOO-TOO-- TOO--TOO, and so on--perfectly beautiful! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> that one? It's the first toots of the reveille; it goes, dear me, SO early in the morning!--then I and every other soldier on the whole place are up and out in a minute, except uncle Thomas, who is most unaccountably lazy, I don't know why, but I have talked to him about it, and I reckon it will be better, now. He hasn't any faults much, and is charming and sweet, like Buffalo Bill, and Thunder-Bird, and Mammy Dorcas, and Soldier Boy, and Shekels, and Potter, and Sour-Mash, and--well, they're ALL that, just angels, as you may say.|$|E

5000|$|After searching, Madonna {{chose to}} work with Babyface, whose {{previous}} collaborations with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R&B songs. Through him, she met with then upcoming young producer from Atlanta called Dallas Austin, who had become famous {{for his work on}} girl group TLC's debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip (1992). Together they composed two songs for the album, [...] "Secret" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary". The former was originally produced in its demo form by Pettibone, under the name [...] "Something's Coming Over Me", however Austin reworked the demo and made it a different song musically. On September 27, 1994, the song was released as the lead single from Bedtime Stories. The cover art of the single showed a new look for Madonna, with blonde hair and style compared to the look of 1930s American actress, Jean Harlow. Shot by photographer Patrick Demarchelier in black-and-white, the image showed the singer slouched on a sofa with her dress down and revealing her translucent brassiere. Unusual for the mid-1990s, Madonna talked about the new single on the Internet leaving an audio message for her fans, as well as a snippet of the song.Hello, all you Cyberheads!
