500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a fear that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
2500|$|In particular, Waldon criticizes reporters asking {{questions}} like [...] "'Did you kill your wife?'" [...] It's those silly questions that elevate a perp walk to a circus. That's {{the stuff of}} a Saturday Night Live skit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> question that's insulting, presumptuous or bullying is totally off limits." [...] Crime reporter Art Harris suggests that such questions are not designed to elicit real answers: [...] "Usually you get no response. The journalists who shout probably know {{they are not going}} to get an answer but the reporter gets the voice on tape and his boss says, 'Hey, hey he is out there doing his job.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bryan Cranston as Walter White– a {{chemistry}} teacher diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer who turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation {{under the name}} of 'Heisenberg.' Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on doing something else. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.|$|E

2500|$|After his retirement, O'Neal {{was hired}} by Turner Sports as an NBA analyst. When asked {{whether it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to criticize Bryant, he answered [...] "I have the ability and the backing to give fair criticism. The only time I have trouble with people giving criticism is when they haven't walked that walk. I've walked many walks in my 19-year career, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> criticism that I give should be fair." [...] During the 2011 NBA lockout, Bryant discussed his problems with O'Neal with a radio station in Italy, saying [...] "I like players who workout. I used to do that 6–7 hours per day. I cannot stand players who practice for 30 minutes." [...] O'Neal countered that he did not need to work out, and that [...] "My three Finals MVPs speaks for itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Connecticut {{governor}} Dannel P. Malloy {{called on}} WTIC to remove Rowland {{from the air}} due to Rowland's implication in a corruption scandal involving former Congressional candidate Lisa Wilson-Foley. Malloy stated: “The reality is that we now know enough — two people have pled guilty to this charge and have identified the party they were engaged with [...] [...] [...] unless there’s {{going to be a}} denial and in light of two actual pleas, both identifying who the third party was, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> reasonable outlet would remove him at this point [...] He had the interesting position of trying to impact and influence political discourse on an afternoon radio show. That somebody would violate that trust as well, is disturbing." [...] Rowland has often criticized Malloy since the latter took office in 2011. On one occasion, Rowland labeled Malloy a [...] "pathological liar," [...] although he later apologized to Malloy.|$|E
2500|$|On September 21st, 2016, on his Twitter account, Reynolds {{suggested}} that any drivers feeling threatened by protesters objecting to the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina should [...] "run them down." [...] The tweet consisted {{only of the}} words [...] "Run them down" [...] and a link to a news story about the protestors. On September 22nd, 2016, Erik Wemple of the Washington Post, published an article titled [...] "'Instapundit' Glenn Reynolds defends 'Run them down' tweet during Charlotte unrest.'" [...] The article contained the original tweet and an interview in which Reynolds said:“But riots aren’t peaceful protest. And blocking interstates and trapping people in their cars is not peaceful protest — it’s threatening and dangerous, especially {{against the background of}} people rioting, cops being injured, civilian-on-civilian shootings, and so on. I wouldn’t actually aim for people blocking the road, but I wouldn’t stop because I’d fear for my safety, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> reasonable person would.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club was {{enthusiastic about}} the episode, stating that the episode's jokes and humor were solid throughout. He was pleased {{that the relationship between}} Leela and Fry was [...] "finally" [...] addressed, also feeling that up until this episode, [...] "he writing on Leela hasn't been as solid this season". Praising the episode's full use of science fiction and the smart structure of the episode, concluding: [...] "It feels like we're back in the sweet spot here, mixing high and low comedy with sharp ideas, and a surprisingly uncynical sincerity. Everything old is new again, I guess, and that's a very good thing." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, citing it as another example of Futurama's [...] "smart takes" [...] on time travel. He felt that [...] "it showed that there's still a lot of thought going into plotting out these time trips", although he also stated that the episode did not have enough laughs. Merrill Bar of Film School Rejects praised the episode, describing it as [...] "very joke hits, every line was sweet, every emotion is true, every visual was eye popping, this episode is Futurama at its finest. If there is any complaint, it's that it took this long for the show to regain this level of quality." [...] He concluded that [...] "his combined with last week's episode has restored my full confidence in the production team". Sean Gandert of Paste rated the episode a 9.4 out of 10, writing: [...] "'Late' was definitely the best episode of the season so far, and ranks with the best the show's ever done. Nearly every episode of this season has been better than the last, and it looks like it's finally reached the peaks it's hit in the past. As of now, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>any</b> doubt about the Futurama's reboot should be pretty damn well silenced." ...|$|E
