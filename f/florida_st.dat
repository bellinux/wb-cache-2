25|$|St. Augustine has a humid {{subtropical}} climate or Cfa – {{typical of the}} Gulf and South Atlantic states. The low latitude and coastal location give the city a mostly warm and sunny climate. Like much of <b>Florida,</b> <b>St.</b> Augustine enjoys {{a high number of}} sunny days, averaging 2,900 hours annually. Unlike much of the contiguous United States, St. Augustine’s driest time of year is winter. The hot and wet season extends from May through October, while the cool and dry season extends November through April.|$|E
25|$|After celebrating her {{upcoming}} birthday {{with her}} mother and sister in <b>Florida,</b> <b>St.</b> Guillen took a plane back to New York. On February 24, 2006, St. Guillen met with her best friend Claire Higgins to continue celebrating her birthday, a few days away. Out at a nightclub around 3:30 a.m. on February 25, the two women argued over whether to go home. Higgins left; later, in a 3:50 a.m. phone call, St. Guillen assured Higgins that she would soon be leaving for home. She was last seen at 4:00 a.m at a bar named 'The Falls'.|$|E
25|$|Kavanagh {{building}} {{is located at}} 1065 <b>Florida</b> <b>St.</b> in the barrio of Retiro, overlooking Plaza San Martín. It was constructed in the 1930s in the Rationalist style, by the architects Gregorio Sánchez, Ernesto Lagos and Luis María de la Torre and was finished in 1936. The {{building is}} characterised by the austerity of its lines, the lack of external ornamentation and its large prismatic volumes. It was declared a national historical monument in 1999, {{and is one of}} the most impressive architectural masterpieces of Buenos Aires. Standing at a height of 120 m, it still retains its impact against the modern skyline of the city. In 1939 its façade received an award from the American Institute of Architects.|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{criticism}} {{is that a}} team with similar or better arguments to another team can be {{left out of the}} BCS despite beating the other team. This happened between Miami (Florida) and Florida State University in 2000, where Miami beat <b>Florida</b> <b>St.</b> yet <b>Florida</b> <b>St.</b> went to the National Championship Game. [...] The University of Washington also beat Miami and finished with an 11–1 record, further adding to the controversy. [...] In 2008, the situation was repeated when one-loss Oklahoma was selected for the BCS Championship over one-loss Texas, which beat the Sooners during the regular season. Although not related to the title game, after the 2007 season, Kansas was chosen to go to the BCS Orange Bowl, even though they had lost to Missouri (who went to the non-BCS Cotton Bowl, despite only losing twice to Oklahoma, and being ranked higher than both Kansas and Big Ten Rose Bowl Representative Illinois, who Missouri beat). This, among other games in history, illustrates that late season losses are often more injurious than early season losses.|$|E
2500|$|Following a raiding {{expedition}} by Loyalist Thomas Brown in February 1777 {{against his}} state, Georgia President Button Gwinnett organized an expedition against {{the capital of}} British East <b>Florida,</b> <b>St.</b> Augustine. [...] General Robert Howe, commander of the Continental Army's Southern Department, agreed to contribute some Continental forces, and authorized Colonel Samuel Elbert's 2nd Georgia Regiment and Brigadier General Lachlan McIntosh to participate. [...] McIntosh and Gwinnett were bitter political enemies, and could not agree on issues of command and strategy. [...] As a consequence, Howe and the Georgia legislature gave command of the operation to Colonel Elbert. [...] (Another consequence of the disagreement between McIntosh and Gwinnett was a duel they fought on May 16; both men were wounded, and Gwinnett died several days later.) In addition to the 300 Continentals from the 1st and 2nd Georgia Regiments, the expedition included some militia cavalry led by Colonel John Baker. [...] Sources vary on the exact size of Baker's company; it {{is reported to be}} either about 100 or 200 men.|$|E
