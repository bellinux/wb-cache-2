In this thesis, I {{examined}} stratigraphic changes {{observed in the}} top ~ 15 m of two Arctic ice caps: one located at Svalbard (Lomonosovfonna) and the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Penny). The objective was {{to find out if}} and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>increasing</b> regional <b>temperatures</b> have impacted the stratigraphy and densification rates of these ice caps, and particularly since the 1990 s when Arctic warming accelerated. This was accomplished by analyzing and comparing recent (2000 s) and earlier (1990 s) ice-core density and stratigraphic measurements from these two ice caps, and also regional temperature data from Svalbard and the eastern Canadian Arctic over the period 1995 - 2013. Data over the amount and thickness of ice layers in the ice cores are also used and compared with the density development.

40|$|Abstract. An {{integrated}} simulation code TOPICS-IB {{based on}} a transport code with a stability code for the peeling-ballooning modes and a scrape-off-layer (SOL) model has been developed to clarify self-consistent effects of edge localized modes (ELMs) and SOL on the plasma performance. Experimentally observed collisionality dependence of the ELM energy loss {{is found to be}} caused by both the edge bootstrap current and the SOL transport. The bootstrap current decreases with <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> collisionality and intensifies the magnetic shear at the pedestal region. <b>The</b> <b>increase</b> of <b>the</b> magnetic shear reduces the width of eigenfunctions of unstable modes, which results in the reduction of the area and the edge value near the separatrix of the ELM enhanced transport. On the other hand, when an ELM crash occurs, the energy flows into the SOL and <b>the</b> SOL <b>temperature</b> rapidly <b>increases.</b> <b>The</b> <b>increase</b> of <b>the</b> SOL <b>temperature</b> lowers the ELM energy loss due to the flattening of the radial edge gradient. The parallel electron heat conduction determines <b>how</b> <b>the</b> SOL <b>temperature</b> <b>increases.</b> For higher collisionality, the conduction becomes lower and <b>the</b> SOL electron <b>temperature</b> <b>increases</b> more.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of {{transient}} ignition and combustion of hydrogen/air mixtures by a heated, thin catalytic wire in a natural convection environment. Modeling of the process is accomplished via a reduced set of heterogeneous kinetic processes which include dissociative adsorption and desorption of both reactants, three fast surface reactions of the Langmiur-Hinshelwood type, and the desorption reaction of the adsorbed product, H 2 O(S). The overall surface reaction rate {{is found to be}} limited by the adsorption rate of molecular oxygen, which depends on the concentration of molecular oxygen close {{to the surface of the}} wire and the distribution of empty sites in the catalyst. The analysis allows the determination of the critical conditions for ignition and the ignition delay time as a function of the important physicochemical parameters. The resulting wire temperatures and the critical value of the external heating rate at ignition are computed. <b>The</b> analysis shows <b>how</b> <b>the</b> ignition <b>temperature</b> <b>increases</b> as <b>the</b> external heating rate <b>increases.</b> <b>The</b> configuration dependence of the ignition temperature is taken as an indication that the use of a critical Damkohler number provides a better ignition condition than the ignition temperature concept.

40|$|International audienceAdult {{parasitoid}} females {{lay their}} eggs in or on host insects. Most species are incapable of de novo lipogenesis as adults, and lipids accumulated during the larval stage are allocated either to egg production or to adult survival. Lipid consumption increases with distance covered by the parasitoids and thus with the distance between available hosts within a habitat. Temperature should affect parasitoid fitness because it changes the constraint imposed by a limited reserve of lipids and because it influences behaviour. Climate change involves both an <b>increase</b> in average <b>temperature</b> and an <b>increased</b> frequency of extreme weather such as heat waves. We investigated <b>how</b> <b>the</b> predicted <b>increase</b> of <b>temperature</b> will affect parasitoid fitness and how this depends on habitat parameters (spatial distribution of hosts and lipid cost of habitat exploitation). We studied optimal behaviour and calculated fitness at different temperatures and in different habitats using a stochastic dynamic programming model for pro-ovigenic parasitoids (which mature all their eggs before becoming adult). We show that an <b>increase</b> in <b>temperature</b> decreases fitness of parasitoids adapted to lower temperatures. This decrease in fitness depends on habitat quality. In field conditions (assuming small costs of intra-patch foraging), the loss of fitness should be larger in habitats with high inter-patch distance and in habitats with a more aggregated distribution of hosts. The foraging behaviour of parasitoids is also affected; at higher temperature we show that intra-patch foraging becomes less efficient, and patch residence times are longer...|$|R

This field {{is growing at}} a fast pace with the demand for GNPs ever increasing with slow progress on development of synthesis techniques. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a new synthesis technique that produces gold/gold sulfide (GGS) nanoparticles with a high yield. This process can control the equilibrium shift of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the nanoparticles (Patel, 2012). The goal of this research is to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> total volume of GGS nanoparticles to be synthesized while keeping their tunability for the SPR absorption peak. This research has demonstrated the ability of cellulose membrane to reduce the need for purification steps, which are associated with traditional synthesis techniques for removing small colloidal gold (3 ̆c 10 nm). It was found that controlling the surface area to volume ratio (SA/Vol) of the cellulose to GGS solution and temperature of the synthesis process, would provide, greater control over the SPR peak. Using these principles allows for larger volume synthesis to be performed while still retaining the ability to tune the SPR peak. It was also discovered that dialyzing out ions during the synthesis process makes bare GGS nanoparticles more stable over time. The time for the reaction to reach equilibrium was observed and showed an <b>increase</b> in <b>temperature</b> and/or SA/Vol reduces the reaction time. In conclusion, this study demonstrated <b>how</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> and SA/Vol shifts the SPR peak and reduces the time for the reaction to reach equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{modern society}} strives to build higher {{and more complex}} {{buildings}} due to <b>the</b> constant <b>increase</b> of urban population. Several high and complex buildings have been constructed during the last decades {{in various parts of}} the world. However, this trend is relatively new and unexplored in Sweden. Another architectural trend in the construction industry is to create large window areas. The latest development of glass façade systems has made this request possible. The two most famous examples regarding these trends in Sweden are Kista Science Tower in Stockholm and Turning Torso in Malmö. The trend and technique to build high-rise buildings with alternative façade material, like glass, is rapidly implemented in Sweden. The lack of regulations, requirements and testing regarding the combination of these trends are consequences that follow the fast development. The requirements of today regarding fire safety design, only demand performance based design for buildings higher than sixteen floors. The Eurocode is another legislation, which contributes to more detailed guidelines regarding performance based design, and will shortly be implemented in all the affiliated countries in the European Union. Therefore a mix of current legislation and the Eurocode will be used in this thesis. This report theoretically examines <b>how</b> <b>the</b> fire develops when the exterior walls consisting of glass in an enclosed room breaks, when the room is located in the higher parts of a high rise building. The intensity of the fire tends to depend on the size of the opening. To illustrate the development of the temperature in the room, a comparison will be made with the curve for the standardized fire, ISO 834. Some of the temperature-time curves will be investigated further, to see <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in <b>temperature</b> affects <b>the</b> concrete and its strength. Furthermore, the radiation to the opposite façade wall is considered by using the calculated flame temperature and FireWind. To conclude the results, the temperature time-curves are highly affected by the size of the opening. In comparison with the ISO 834 -curve, all of the scenarios with openings larger than 2, 6 x 2, 5 m 2 resulted in more rapid and higher temperature developments. SAFIR showed that the curves, which exceeded the ISO 834 curve, had a large impact on the strength of the concrete at 20 - 30 millimetres depth. It is therefore necessary to have this in mind when deciding the thickness of the coating for the reinforced concrete. To ensure the resistance of the building’s framework, the time limit should be greater than 90 minutes, since most of the fire scenarios lasted up to 100 - 160 minutes. The likelihood of fire spread due to radiation is very high according to the results from FireWind. All cases, except one, exceed the recommended radiation level. It is therefore important that the entire glass façade system meets the required integrity and isolation to decrease the likelihood of fire spread, both within and between the compartments in the building.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, the antisolvent vapour precipitation {{method has}} been proven to produce uniformly sized lactose microspheres (1. 0 µm) from a single droplet (1. 2 mm diameter) at atmospheric pressure. These types of particles have potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry, especially due to their high dissolution rate. This project looked into {{the possibility of using}} antisolvent vapour precipitation to produce microspheres from finely atomised droplets. Microspheres in the sub-micron scale (0. 4 μm diameter) have been produced by this method, much smaller than those obtained from the single droplet method (1. 0 μm diameter). The microsphere formation only occurred above a certain threshold of antisolvent concentration. Below this threshold, different structures were formed e. g. : porous, bicontinuous, ridges or coagulated structures. On the other hand, the formation of these particles were not affected by exposure time to ethanol vapour (up to 60 s) or drying temperature (up to 190 oC). A two-phase system (caused by self-emulsification of the components in the droplets) was theorised as the mechanism responsible for the formation of the porous and bicontinuous structure., This theory was further reinforced as proven by the successful microsphere formation at higher antisolvent vapour concentrations, which was caused by a shrinkage phenomenon of the solute containing phase in the droplet. In the second part of this study, the effect of temperature variation during precipitation on particle formation was studied. Different temperature profiles were simulated using sets of Peltier modules to control direction of heat flow in or out of the chamber. No trend could be discerned from the different temperature profiles studied; microspheres appeared to form regardless of <b>how</b> fast <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>increased</b> or decreased over time. Nevertheless, an <b>increase</b> in <b>the</b> overall <b>temperature</b> reduced the concentration of antisolvent threshold required to precipitate microspheres from the atomised droplets. This discovery could be linked to <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> rate of evaporation in the droplet at higher temperatures; this led to an increased rate of antisolvent concentration rise in the droplets, which could indicate that this rate could be the determining factor in the type of particle structure formed. The results obtained from this study would be useful in determining the optimal parameters to produce microspheres using this approach in larger scale applications e. g. spray drying. Microspheres were successfully precipitated from smaller atomised droplets with a much smaller time scale, which would be advantageous for steady state processes...|$|R
