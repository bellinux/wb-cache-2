5|$|Adrastea is {{the largest}} {{contributor}} to material in Jupiter's rings. This appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter's <b>four</b> <b>small</b> inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from these satellites into space. This {{is due to the}} satellites' low density and their surfaces lying close to the edge of their Roche spheres.|$|E
5|$|Early on the {{community}} tried several names, rejecting Albion, All Saints, Lowell, Brooklyn, Addiseville and Winona. The twenty <b>four</b> <b>small</b> lakes that are now within the city limits led Charles Hoag, Minneapolis's first schoolmaster, to suggest Minnehapolis, derived from Minnehaha and mni, the Dakota word for water, and polis, the Greek word for city.|$|E

5|$|Improper {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing diplomatic incidents. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the <b>four</b> <b>small</b> stars incorrectly angled in the same direction, inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Byzantine period, {{more complex}} plans emerge, {{such as the}} {{integrated}} chapels of Theotokos of Lips, a monastic church in Constantinople that was built around 907.

5|$|Metis is the {{innermost}} of Jupiter's <b>four</b> <b>small</b> inner moons. It orbits Jupiter {{at a distance}} of ~128,000km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter's main ring. Metis's orbit has very small eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|By 2010, Marysville {{had grown}} to a {{population}} of 60,020 and surpassed Lynnwood and Edmonds to become the second-largest city in Snohomish County. In 2015, the city grew {{at a rate of}} 2.5 percent, the largest rate of any city in Washington state. The city's school district opened a second high school, Marysville Getchell, in 2010 to serve students living in the eastern area of Marysville. The school consists of <b>four</b> <b>Small</b> Learning Communities which share the same campus and athletics programs.|$|E
5|$|In July, while Fuentes was busied in {{the siege}} of Doullens, Maurice of Nassau, statholder of the Dutch Republic, {{assembled}} a force of 6,000 infantry, some cavalry companies and 16 artillery pieces of the Dutch States Army, and led them under the walls of Groenlo, a medium-sized town in the County of Zutphen. Its northern flank defended by the Slinge, a stream of the Berkel river, Groenlo was fortified with five bulwarks and garrisoned by 11 infantry companies from Count Herman van den Bergh's regiment numbering 600 troops under Jan van Stirum, a German officer, and <b>four</b> <b>small</b> artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|The {{pictorial}} {{space is}} bathed in soft light, probably an influence from Jan van Eyck. The light {{falls from the}} right, throwing shadows of both Mary and the Child's heads on the left wall of the niche. The Virgin and Child are shown seated in a small Gothic chapel or oratory projecting from a wall and opening onto a lawn. The painting pays very close attention to small realistic detail; for example, there are <b>four</b> <b>small</b> holes above each arch, likely to hold scaffolding.|$|E
5|$|Alibera quickly intensified, {{attaining}} {{tropical cyclone}} status on December20 while southwest of Agaléga. Although the MFR estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph) that day, the JTWC assessed that {{the storm was}} vastly stronger, estimating peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). This is equivalent to a super typhoon, which made Alibera tied for the strongest cyclone in the southern hemisphere that season, along with Cyclone Alex in the Australian basin. On December21, Alibera turned sharply {{to the south and}} slowly weakened. On the next day, the storm curved to an eastward drift as a downgraded severe tropical storm, its path influenced by ridges to the east and west. It maintained its intensity for the next several days, turning back to the south on December24 and slowly recurving to the west. However, the movement was erratic, and the storm executed <b>four</b> <b>small</b> loops. Although the MFR had forecasting difficulties during this time, the storm remained far enough {{to the north of the}} Mascarene Islands to limit rainfall warnings.|$|E
5|$|Ivall's Farm House is on {{the south}} side of the road near the Star Inn. It is a timber framed and cruck-built (A-frame) tiled roof {{building}} with a lobby entrance, previously a farmhouse, originally built around 1600. The south end dates to the 18th century.The tiled roof, with <b>four</b> <b>small</b> gabled dormers, half-hipped at the north west angle, was restored in the late 20th century. It became a Grade II listed building on 31 July 1963. Holt Cottage is a small thatched cottage situated on the edge of the village and was built in 1503. A Grade II listed building since 31 May 1985, much of the current building dates to the 17th and early 19th centuries. The roof is half-hipped at the south end and hipped at the north, with painted brickwork in monk bond.|$|E

5|$|Sangkum {{was based}} on <b>four</b> <b>small</b> monarchist, rightist parties, {{including}} the 'Victorious North-East' party of Dap Chhuon, the Khmer Renovation party of Lon Nol, the People's Party, and the Liberal Party. At the same time, Sihanouk {{was running out of}} patience with the increasingly leftist Democratic Party and the left-wing Pracheachon, as both had refused to merge into his party and had campaigned against him. He appointed as director of national security Dap Chhuon, who ordered the national police to jail their leaders and break up their election rallies. When elections were held, the Sangkum received 83 percent of all valid votes. They took up all seats in the National Assembly, replacing the Democrats, which had until then been the majority party. The following month, Sihanouk was appointed as prime minister.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{terminal}} docks {{were constructed}} {{for the opening}} of the canal. <b>Four</b> <b>small</b> docks were located {{on the south side of}} the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of Stretford: Pomona Docks No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main docks, built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in Salford, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, docks No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona Docks, but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on <b>four</b> <b>small</b> wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E

5|$|The {{first level}} of the {{building}} contains two classrooms, {{both of which have}} a cloakroom, a set of three swivel doors, and a large slate chalkboard that covers one of the walls. The first story also contains two bathrooms, <b>four</b> <b>small</b> storage closets, and a central hall, as well as a large stairwell leading up to the second floor. The second story contains three classrooms, with the same features as those downstairs, along with an office and three small storage rooms. A metal fire escape door is located {{in the center of the}} west wall of the second story. The schoolhouse also has a partial basement, which contains a large storage room, a coal room, and a disused coal furnace.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nationalist}} incursion following UDI came in March 1966, when <b>four</b> <b>small</b> {{groups of}} ZANLA insurgents crossed the Zambezi near Chirundu. One team of seven cadres contacted the BSAP near the northern town of Sinoia on 28 April 1966 and was wiped out, the police killing all seven without taking casualties. On 16 May {{another of the}} ZANLA groups murdered a farmer, Johannes Viljoen, and his wife at their farm just north of Hartley. 1 Commando and the police were deployed on Operation Pagoda, which ended on 18 September 1966, the BSAP having done most of the work; as the local police commanders were reluctant {{at this time to}} sign control over to the army, the RLI had been given little opportunity to act.|$|E
5|$|The giant {{freshwater}} stingray has a thin, oval {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly longer than wide and broadest towards the front. The elongated snout {{has a wide}} base and a sharply pointed tip that projects beyond the disc. The eyes are minute and widely spaced; behind them are large spiracles. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The small mouth forms a gentle arch and contains four to seven papillae (two to four large at the center and one to <b>four</b> <b>small</b> to the sides) on the floor. The small and rounded teeth are arranged into pavement-like bands. There are five pairs of gill slits on the ventral side of the disc. The pelvic fins are small and thin; mature males have relatively large claspers.|$|E
