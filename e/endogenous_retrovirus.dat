40|$|Since porcine <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> (PERVs) can infect cultured human cells, {{they are}} a {{potential}} hazard to xenotransplantation. For this reason, <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> from the Westran (Westmead Hospital transplantation) inbred line of pigs were analyzed by using consensus primers for the type A and type B viruses to amplify 1. 8 -kb envelope gene fragments. After preliminary analysis with restriction enzymes KpnI and MboI, 31 clones were sequenced. Between types A and B, five recombinant clones were identified. Fifty-five percent of clones (17 of 31) had premature stop codons within the envelope protein-encoding region. <b>Endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> in Westran pigs were physically mapped by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) using PERV-A and PERV-B envelope clones as probes to identify at least 32 integration sites (19 PERV-A sites and 13 PERV-B sites).

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by B cell hyperactivity {{leading to the}} production of various autoantibodies and subsequent development of glomerulonephritis, i. e. lupus nephritis. Among the principal targets of the autoantibodies produced in murine SLE are nucleic acid-protein complexes and the envelope glycoprotein gp 70 of <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses.</b> Recent studies have revealed that the innate receptor TLR 7 plays a pivotal {{role in the development of}} a wide variety of autoimmune responses against DNA- and RNA-containing nuclear antigens, while TLR 9 rather plays a protective role.
