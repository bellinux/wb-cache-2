500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he {{was initially}} skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. [...] "It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> it when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, and I hope that isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true piece of shit. It has no cohesive thread. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E

5000|$|Clarkson {{has also}} {{expressed}} disappointment over the song's production. She {{referred to it}} as having [...] "too much production", and revealed that [...] "the label wanted all the production that was on it, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hated</b> it. <b>I</b> thought it took away from the song, and so did the producer (Wilder)." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1980s, Boy George {{said about}} the music style of his band Culture Club, [...] "We play rock 'n' roll and I love rock 'n' roll music but I don't like the lifestyle. I don't like people tipping beer over their heads.... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> rock 'n' roll in that way. It's disgusting and boring. I look at what we're doing as very intelligent." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1999, HBO {{commissioned}} {{an interview}} of Wilson by the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne for {{an episode of}} Reverb which never aired. Following the interview, Coyne felt that Wilson surrounded himself with yes-men, which he found [...] "off-putting at times", and that [...] "later on, I was like, 'Well, if he's such a genius, why can't he talk?' He's been asked about his music, like, everyday of his fucking life, so you'd think that he'd {{have something to say}} about it ... I'm not in contempt of him, though. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> that if someone is drug-damaged, or eccentric, or possibly mad, people will let them shit all over themselves thinking, 'Isn't he cool?'." [...] In 2014, fans reacted negatively to the announcement that Wilson was to record a duets album, titled No Pier Pressure, and called it a [...] "cash-in". A Facebook post attributed to Wilson responded to the feedback: [...] "In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that." [...] The album received mixed or average reviews.|$|E

5000|$|The varying track listings {{is due to}} TISM {{not liking}} the album. Humphrey B. Flaubert stated [...] "No, no, I didn’t like Hot Dogma.

60|$|MARGARET. (Solus.) Dear, dear! it's dreary enough, to have {{to study}} this {{impossible}} German tongue: to be exiled from home and all human society except a body's sister {{in order to do}} it, is just simply abscheulich. Here's only three weeks of the three months gone, and it seems like three years. I don't believe I can live through it, and I'm sure Annie can't. (Refers to her book, and rattles through, several times, like one memorising:) Entschuldigen Sie, mein Herr, konnen Sie mir vielleicht sagen, um wie viel Uhr der erste Zug nach Dresden abgeht? (Makes mistakes and corrects them.) <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>hate</b> Meisterschaft! We may see people; we can have society; yes, on condition that the conversation shall be in German, and in German only--every single word of it! Very kind--oh, very! when neither Annie nor I can put two words together, except as they are put together for us in Meisterschaft or that idiotic Ollendorff! (Refers to book, and memorises: Mein Bruder hat Ihren Herrn Vater nicht gesehen, als er gestern in dem Laden des deutschen Kaufmannes war.) Yes, we can have society, provided we talk German. What would conversation be like! If you should stick to Meisterschaft, it would change the subject every two minutes; and if you stuck to Ollendorff, it would be all about your sister's mother's good stocking of thread, or your grandfather's aunt's good hammer of the carpenter, and who's got it, and there an end. You couldn't keep up your interest in such topics. (Memorising: Wenn irgend moglich--mochte ich noch heute Vormittag Geschaftsfreunde zu treffen.) My mind is made up to one thing: I will be an exile, in spirit and in truth: I will see no one during these three months. Father is very ingenious--oh, very! thinks he is, anyway. Thinks he has invented a way to force us to learn to speak German. He is a dear good soul, and all that; but invention isn't his fach'. He will see. (With eloquent energy.) Why, nothing in the world shall--Bitte, konnen Sie mir vielleicht sagen, ob Herr Schmidt mit diesem Zuge angekommen ist? Oh, dear, dear George--three weeks! It seems a whole century since I saw him. I wonder if he suspects that I--that I--care for him--j-just a wee, wee bit? I believe he does. And I believe Will suspects that Annie cares for him a little, that I do. And I know perfectly well that they care for us. They agree with all our opinions, no matter what they are; and if they have a prejudice, they change it, as soon as they see how foolish it is. Dear George! at first he just couldn't abide cats; but now, why now he's just all for cats; he fairly welters in cats. I never saw such a reform. And it's just so with all his principles: he hasn't got one that he had before. Ah, if all men were like him, this world would--(Memorising: Im Gegentheil, mein Herr, dieser Stoff ist sehr billig.
