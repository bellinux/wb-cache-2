40|$|Abstract: AECL and CANDU {{utilities}} {{have developed}} a process for minimizing <b>human</b> <b>error</b> in plant operations and maintenance. Recent plant operational experience demonstrates that <b>human</b> <b>error</b> is a key contributor to operating inefficiencies, equipment damage, and significant plant events. To improve plant operation and safety, plant designers and utilities are placing renewed emphasis on approaches {{to prevent the occurrence}} and limit the effects of <b>human</b> <b>error.</b> One aspect of the multifaceted approach to addressing error involves the choice of features that are incorporated into plant systems. This paper discusses the systematic approach developed, outlines the principles and general process adopted for avoiding <b>human</b> <b>error</b> in design, and describes design solutions that are representative of specific application principles. It is expected that application of the recommended approach will result in plant designs with decreased risk of <b>human</b> <b>error</b> occurrence and consequence. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a study about <b>human</b> <b>error</b> {{optimization}} is presented. A {{discussion about the}} maintenance or operation management is done. The models of <b>human</b> <b>error</b> were made using a well known technique named Technique for <b>Human</b> <b>Error</b> Rate Prediction (THERP), wisely used in the nuclear area. These models {{were included in the}} Probabilistic Safety Analysis (PSA) to evaluate the impact of <b>human</b> <b>error</b> on the frequency of a damage plant states. This paper shows how the optimization of maintenance management is only possible with a global approach and it is not feasible focusing on each task in a particular way.
