Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to <b>head</b> <b>height</b> before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the camera was damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
5|$|In the lead-up to the decider, Woodfull {{ran into}} form. In {{consecutive}} innings, he scored 131 and 228 not out against Gloucestershire and Glamorgan respectively. However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire. In the first innings, Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237. Bill Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed it with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than <b>head</b> <b>height.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{match between}} the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline {{practitioners}} of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than <b>head</b> <b>height.</b> Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|Although wildcats are solitary, {{the social}} {{behavior}} of domestic cats {{is much more}} variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. Within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories. These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at <b>head</b> <b>height</b> with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies, {{they do not have}} a social survival strategy, or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.|$|E

25|$|If the bowler bowls a {{ball that}} bounces and passes the batsman above <b>head</b> <b>height.</b> In some {{competitions}} the Laws of Cricket are modified by a playing regulation that any ball over <b>head</b> <b>height</b> is a Wide ball, but a second fast ball above shoulder height in an over is a No ball, e.g. in International T20 Cricket and IPLT20. But in International One-Day Cricket and in Test Cricket, TWO fast pitched short balls per over may pass over shoulder height before No ball is called, and again any ball over <b>head</b> <b>height</b> is a Wide. Thus competition rules may both {{tone down the}} definition of 'dangerous and unfair' (a Wide is a lesser sanction than a No ball, and cannot be applied if the batsman hits, or is hit by, the delivery) and put definite limits on repetition, intended not only to protect the batsman but also to maintain a fair contest between bat and ball, preventing such bowling being used to limit the batsman's ability to score. There is presently some difference of opinion between the authorities that {{is evident in the}} differences between Law and regulation.|$|E

Waqar again transgressed and Shepherd ordered his removal from the attack becoming the first umpire to have taken such an action during an international match.|$|E

25|$|Originally air {{turbulence}} {{was kept}} to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above <b>head</b> <b>height</b> is crowded with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E

25|$|A bouncer is a ball {{aimed to}} pitch {{in the first half}} of the pitch, meaning it has had time to rise sharply to chest or <b>head</b> <b>height</b> by the time it reaches the batsman. This causes two {{problems}} for the batsman who receives the ball. If he or she attempts to play it, their bat will be at eye-level making it difficult for them to watch the ball onto the bat and time their shot correctly. If he or she leaves or misses the ball, it may strike him or her a painful blow on the head or chest and occasionally result in injury. For this reason, bowling spells containing many bouncers are said to be intimidatory bowling.|$|E

When two participants meet, the actor closest to their goal continues walking, while the other must sit or lie on the landscape and rest. After a period lasting between 24 and 36 hours, only one remains standing. The process then draws to a close, the actors reassemble at the centre of the scene, the ground-level point of view gravitates around the worker who endured the longest, and the exercise begins anew.|$|E
25|$|A {{ball that}} bounces {{a little way}} before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen {{is said to be}} short pitched or {{described}} as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing. A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or <b>head</b> <b>height</b> is a bouncer and can be an effective delivery. Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.|$|E

40|$|Inheritance {{of mature}} plant traits of agronomic {{importance}} in a forage grass breeding program was studied {{in a population}} of 2 ̆ 7 Goldstrike 2 ̆ 7 sand bluestem (Andropogon hallii Hack.). Heritability estimates were determined by parent-offspring regression and variance component analysis. Phenotypic and genotypic (additive genetic) correlations were also determined among mature plant traits and seedling traits. ^ Average heritability estimates from parent-offspring regressions were 0. 03, 020, 0. 36, 0. 05, 0. 35, 0. 62, and 0. 73, respectively, for forage dry matter yield, forage protein content, forage in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), forage rating, forage dry matter content, <b>heading</b> <b>height,</b> and <b>heading</b> date. Heritability estimates from variance component analysis with heading date as a covariate were considered best estimates for yield, protein, IVDMD, forage rating, and dry matter since these traits were phenotypically correlated with heading date. Heritability estimates from variance component analysis with the effect of heading date removed by covariance analysis were 0. 28, 0. 36, 0. 40, 0. 21, 0. 33, and 0. 62, respectively, for yield, protein, IVDMD, forage rating, dry matter, and <b>heading</b> <b>height.</b> The phenotypic and genotypic correlations between yield and forage rating were 0. 68 and 0. 85, respectively. Genotypic correlations of forage rating with heading height,protein, and IVDMD were 0. 87, - 0. 55, and - 0. 11, respectively. Protein and IVDMD were positively correlated phenotypically and genotypically. Genotypic correlations of IVDMD with yield and seedling weight were 0. 33 and 0. 43, respectively. Yield was positively genotypically correlated with seed weight, seedling weight, first year yield, and all mature plant traits except protein where the correlation was - 0. 08. The genotypic correlations of <b>heading</b> <b>height</b> with protein and IVDMD were - 0. 44 and - 0. 43, respectively. Since desirable traits have positive genetic correlations, selection for seedling vigor, yield, and IVDMD should be effective in simultaneously improving sand bluestem for these traits. ...|$|R

25|$|About an {{hour later}} the British {{trenches}} had been occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind sap (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered once they had been discovered.

25|$|Depending {{upon the}} path of the ball, the batsman will either move forward or back in his attempt to {{intercept}} it. A forward movement is designated a front foot shot, whereas a backwards movement is designated a back foot shot. A front foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between ankle and thigh height. The batsman will step forward towards the ball, bending his front knee to bring his bat down to the anticipated height of the ball. By moving forwards, the batsman is also able to intercept the ball immediately after it has pitched, thus nullifying any potentially dangerous lateral movement. A back foot shot is typically used to address a ball arriving at between thigh and <b>head</b> <b>height.</b> The batsman will step back and, if necessary, stand on his tip toes to raise his bat to the height of the ball. By stepping back towards the wicket, he also receives the advantage of having an extra small amount of time to react to any unexpected lateral movement or variation in bounce.|$|E
25|$|To {{eliminate}} most complaints, {{the total}} indoor CO2 level should {{be reduced to}} a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 ppm are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation. The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated <b>head</b> <b>height</b> and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9:00am to 3:30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. In Hong Kong, the EPD established indoor air quality objectives for office buildings and public places in which a carbon dioxide level below 1,000 ppm is considered to be good. European standards limit carbon dioxide to 3,500 ppm. OSHA limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. These higher limits are concerned with avoiding loss of consciousness (fainting), and do not address impaired cognitive performance and energy, which begin to occur at lower concentrations of carbon dioxide.|$|E

Factorial combinations of N and clipping treatments were arranged in a randomized complete-block design with two replications. Nitrogen, in ammonium nitrate form, was applied at rates of 0, 70, and 140 kg/ha in November 1968. The two clipping frequency treatments were (1) nonclipped and (2) clipped five times at 21 -day intervals to a 5 -cm height. During 1969, measurements were made at 10 -day intervals of (1) plant upstretched-leaf and <b>head</b> <b>heights,</b> (2) dry matter yield, (3) percentage of crude protein and plant phosphorus (P), (4) extraction of soil water, and (5) evapotranspiration (ET).
