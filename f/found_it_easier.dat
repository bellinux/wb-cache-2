5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London but that was held back for the following episode.|$|E

Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged gut with steel for the first string and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms in New York. When in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of {{the class}} have survived into {{preservation}} thanks to the high workload of Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, which <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> and more commercially lucrative to scrap railway wagons, keeping the more technical steam locomotives for a downturn in workload. Five of the surviving Merchant Navy's have run in preservation, these being: 35005, 35006, 35018, 35027 & 35028. Three of them have even run on the mainline at some points in preservation: 35005 Canadian Pacific, 35018 British India Line and 35028 Clan Line, Both 35018 and 35028 are currently mainline certified.|$|E

5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as {{it was more of}} a soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the overall}} Vietnamese {{military}} performance {{was not as}} successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, {{the withdrawal of the}} Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Xenosaga Episode II was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe. The two worked respectively on the cinematic and gameplay tracks; {{they did not}} collaborate on any tracks, or even meet during the game's production. Hosoe, whose previous work included Street Fighter EX and the Ridge Racer series, was forced to greatly restrict his compositions' quality due to working with the limited sound hardware on the PS2. He felt that both the sound quality and overall direction of the soundtrack were faulted because of this. Kajiura, whose previous work consisted mostly of anime scores, felt that the game's soundtrack was different from her earlier work due to the different pieces linking with each other, although some tracks were split up by the production team when she composed them to merge as a single melody. She also <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> working from Mitsuda's rather than creating a completely original score. The realistic art design also influenced Kajura's work, as she wished to complement it. Kajura's compositions were released on a two-disc album in July 2004, while some of Hosoe's music was released on a promotional disc {{as part of the}} North American strategy guide. The rest of Hosoe's music for the game has yet to receive an album release.|$|E

25|$|In America, whisky {{was used}} as {{currency}} during the American Revolution; George Washington operated a large distillery at Mount Vernon.

It also was a highly coveted sundry and when an additional excise tax was levied against it in 1791, the Whiskey Rebellion erupted.|$|E

25|$|Such an {{accomplishment}} is {{more significant than}} it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.

Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.|$|E

25|$|Germany invaded Norway in April 1940. The {{country was}} {{completely}} occupied by June. There were about 1,800 Jews in Norway, persecuted by the Norwegian Nazis. In late 1940, the Jews were banned from some occupations and in 1941 all Jews had to register their property with the government. Also in 1940, Germany invaded Denmark. The country was overrun {{so quickly that}} there was no chance of organizing resistance. Consequently, the Danish government stayed in power and the Germans <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> to work through it. Because of this, few measures were taken against the Danish Jews before 1942.|$|E
25|$|New France {{allocated}} concessions {{all along}} lake Champlain to French settlers and built forts {{to defend the}} waterways.

The lake's northern tip at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec (known as St. John in colonial times under British rule), is a short distance from Montreal. The southern tip at Whitehall (Skenesborough in revolutionary times) is a short distance from Saratoga, Glens Falls, and Albany, New York.|$|E

They failed to create significant positive moves as their opponents <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> going in the centre of the field. Shillong Lajong had their best chance of the match when Brazilian striker Fábio Pena found an open net in front of him but still ended up hitting the woodwork.

The solution proposed in this paper is a workflow management system to formally and graphically specify the interrelationships among the derivative datasets. The applicability of the resulting system was assessed through a user experience study {{and a series of}} applicability tests.

The applicability of this proposed approach was validated though the successful integration of five 3 -D modelling workflows, and a user experience study revealed that users would be able to successfully complete workflow tasks within the expected time. In addition, the user experience evaluation indicates that users were satisfied with the system and <b>found</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to use and learn...|$|R
