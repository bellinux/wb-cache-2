A problem in mining is that the average age is increasing: 43.3 years in 2013 (in the USA) and as a person ages vision degenerates. [...] LED technology is physically robust compared to a filament light bulb, and has a longer life: 50,000 hours compared to 1,000 - 3,000. Extended life reduces light maintenance and failures; according to OMSHR an average of 28 accidents per year occur in US mines involving lighting. NIOSH has sponsored the development of cap lamp systems which they claim improve the [...] "ability of older subjects to detect moving hazards by 15% and trip hazards by 23.7%, and discomfort glare was reduced by 45%".

This effect is enhanced in <b>diffuse</b> <b>beams</b> with lengths much larger than ℓ, even when the surface is fairly smooth, 5 - 10 nm rms, and the peak thermal wavelength is 0. 6 μm.

Hence, if the surface roughness is not adequately controlled, the thermal conductance can vary significantly for <b>diffuse</b> <b>beams</b> fabricated across a wafer.

The latter beam has single scattering and multiple scattering contributions. In the former case and for single scattering, the problem is reducible to first-kind Fredholm equations, while for multiple scattering it is necessary to invert partial integrodifferential equations.

To make this measurement, the authors must characterize the BPM appropriately. The approach to this problem is to use a pulsed wire test fixture. By using the principle of superposition, they can build up a <b>diffuse</b> <b>beam</b> by taking the signals from different wire positions and summing them. This is done two ways: first by physically moving a wire about the aperture and building individual distributions, and, second, by taking a two dimensional grid of wire positions versus signal and using a computer to interpolate between the grid points to get arbitrary wire positions and, therefore, distributions.

40|$|It {{has been}} empirically {{observed}} in both experiments and particle-in-cell simulations that space-charge-dominated beams suffer strong growth in statistical phase-space area (degraded quality) and particle losses in alternating gradient quadrupole transport channels when the undepressed phase advance {sigma}{sub 0 } increases beyond about 85 {sup o} per lattice period. Although this criterion {{has been used}} extensively in practical designs of strong focusing intense beam transport lattices, {{the origin of the}} limit has not been understood. We propose a mechanism for the transport limit resulting from classes of halo particle resonances near the core of the beam that allow near-edge particles to rapidly increase in oscillation amplitude when the space-charge intensity and the utter of the matched beam envelope are both sufficiently large. When coupled with a <b>diffuse</b> <b>beam</b> edge and/or perturbations internal to the beam core that can drive particles outside the edge, this mechanism can result in large and rapid halo-driven increases in the statistical phase-space area of the beam, lost particles, and degraded transport.

The intensive ground observations of surface shortwave fluxes and cloud covers made by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program at the United States Southern Great Plains (SGP) site and at the Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) locale’s Manus and Nauru Islands in 1997 – 2004 are used for the investigation.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} {{radiative transfer}} model, Cupid, was tested by comparing simulations with measured canopy reflectances viewed from nadir. The model {{was used to}} evaluate the effects of leaf spectral properties and canopy structure on canopy reflectance. Non-Lambertian leaf spectral properties, characterized from laboratory measurements of bidirectional reflectance and transmittance of individual corn and soybean leaves in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelength bands, were incorporated into Cupid to evaluate the effects of specular reflectance. Forward scattering was a prominent feature with increasing source incidence angle. Hemispherical reflectance generally increased with increasing incidence angle while transmittance values decreased. Leaf spectral properties, LAI, leaf angle distributions, bare soil reflectance and <b>diffuse</b> <b>beam</b> fractions of incoming radiation were measured concurrently with nadir-viewed diurnal canopy reflectances and provided input information for model simulations. Normal incidence hemispherical reflectance and transmittance of in situ corn and soybean leaves were measured throughout a growing season. Spectral properties in corn remained fairly constant. Visible reflectance and transmittance decreased during soybean leaf expansion but increased at senescence. The opposite occurred with NIR reflectance. LAI and leaf angle distributions were inferred from light penetration measurements along a transect. The effects of leaf spectral properties, LAI and leaf angle distribution on canopy reflectance were separated by varying one input parameter while holding other input variables constant. Canopies composed of senescing soybean leaves had the highest reflectance in the visible and NIR wavebands. Canopies of low LAI had a relatively higher reflectance in the visible waveband and a relatively lower reflectance in the NIR than did canopies with higher leaf area. Canopies with more horizontally inclined leaves had the least variability in diurnal nadir viewed reflectance and the highest reflectance. The opposite was true for canopies with more erect leaves. Simulated non-Lambertian canopy reflectances were in good agreement with canopy specular reflectance measurements reported in the literature. Predictions from the Cupid model generally agree with experimental results. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{modelling}} and characterisation of underwater optical wireless communication links, particularly short-range diffuse links, by using numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. MC simulation provides a flexible, intuitive and accurate modelling of the underwater channel, which is severely affected by absorption and scattering processes. In diffuse Underwater Optical Wireless Communication (UOWC) links, scattering {{is expected to}} have a larger impact on communication link performance due to the wider beam divergence compared to collimated beams. Thus, this thesis will investigate the characterisation of path loss, spatial, temporal and angular dispersions of diffuse links in various types of water. Firstly, a detailed investigation on the path loss performance of <b>diffuse</b> <b>beam</b> in three types of water is presented. This includes the study on the contribution of unscattered and scattered components of light to the total received power and how they are attenuated. From the percentage of unscattered light that contributed to the total power reception, the distance at which the unscattered component drops to zero can be estimated. This distance is used to predict the transition point from minimal scattering to multiple scattering regime for diffuse beams in coastal and turbid water. In addition to this, the spatial dispersion effect is also studied at off-axis locations. To further understand the behaviour of scattering in diffuse links, the scattering order probability is evaluated for various beam sizes in various types of water. Currently, this kind of information cannot be obtained either analytically or experimentally. The information on the scattering order is used as the parameter to classify the links into three scattering regimes, namely minimal, intermediate and multiple scattering regimes. Further investigations into the transition regimes are conducted by investigating the impulse response and frequency response performance for temporal dispersion effects. From the impulse response and frequency response analysis, the bandwidth that can be supported by the channel can be predicted, which provides some insight into the potential and limits of the links. In addition to temporal dispersion, the angular dispersion performance is also evaluated. It is shown through the angle of arrival (AOA) distribution that diffuse beams exhibit significant angular dispersions, implying that a large receiver field of view (FOV) is needed for optimum power performance. The information on the AOA distribution is then used to study the impact of receiver FOV on the bandwidth. Finally, the effect of aperture on the power received and scattering order histogram is evaluated. As a conclusion, the numerical results presented in this thesis will provide an improved understanding of the effect of scattering on path loss, spatial, temporal and angular dispersions along with their relationships with each other...|$|E

For non-concentrating collectors or photovoltaics this is very often carried out with the isotropic sky model. However, these calculations are not correct as {{an important part of}} the measured diffuse radiation, the circumsolar part, comes from the direction of the sun. Therefore the diffuse part on surfaces not facing South is very often overestimated. This is especially true for North oriented surfaces. One solution of the problem would be the use of an anisotropic sky model. These models are more difficult to use and there are appreciable differences between models. Moreover for a user of a commercial program using the isotropic model it is nearly impossible to modify the source code. The second possibility is to use equivalent <b>diffuse</b> and <b>beam</b> radiation data as input for the isotropic model. Then the circumsolar radiation is treate d as beam radiation.
