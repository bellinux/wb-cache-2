5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding,</b> pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intracranial</b> <b>bleeding</b> (ICB) and {{subsequent}} stroke {{is a serious}} side effect of thrombolytic use. The risk factors for developing <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding</b> include a previous episode of intracranial bleed, advanced age of the individual, and the thrombolytic regimen that is being used. In general, the risk of ICB due to thrombolytics is between 0.5 and 1 percent.|$|E
25|$|For {{those with}} non-valvular atrial fibrillation, the NOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) are neither {{superior}} to nor worse than warfarin in preventing non-hemorrhagic stroke and systemic embolic events. They {{have a lower}} risk of <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding</b> compared to warfarin; however, dabigatran {{is associated with a}} higher risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.|$|E

25|$|Anticoagulation can be {{achieved}} {{through a number of}} means including warfarin, heparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban. Aspirin is less effective in reducing the risk of stroke and may not be safer with respect to major bleeding (including <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding)</b> than well-managed warfarin or a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC). A number of issues should be considered, including the cost of NOACs, risk of stroke, risk of falls, compliance, and speed of desired onset of anticoagulation.|$|E
25|$|No studies examine topical {{salicylic}} acid in pregnancy. Oral {{salicylic acid}} is {{not associated with}} an increase in malformations if used during the first trimester, but in late pregnancy has been associated with bleeding, especially <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low teratogenic potential.|$|E
2500|$|Thrombolytic {{therapy is}} {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of STEMI – if it can begin within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms, and the person is eligible based on exclusion criteria, and a coronary angioplasty is not immediately available. Thrombolysis is most effective in the first 2 hours. After 12 hours, the risk of [...] <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding</b> associated with thrombolytic therapy outweighs any benefit. Because irreversible injury occurs within 2–4 hours of the infarction, there is a limited window of time available for reperfusion to work.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} risk algorithms (QBleed) for estimating the absolute risk of upper gastrointestinal and <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed</b> {{for patients with}} and without anticoagulation aged 21 - 99 years in primary care. Design: Open cohort study using routinely collected data from general practice linked to hospital episode statistics data and mortality data during the five year study period between 1 January 2008 and 1 October 2013. Setting: 565 general practices in England contributing to the national QResearch database to develop the algorithm and 188 different QResearch practices to validate the algorithm. All 753 general practices had data linked to hospital episode statistics and mortality data at individual patient level. Endpoint: Gastrointestinal <b>bleed</b> and <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed</b> recorded on either the linked mortality data or the linked hospital records. Participants: We studied 4. 4 million patients in the derivation cohort with 16. 4 million person years of follow-up. During follow-up, 21 [*] 641 patients had an incident upper gastrointestinal bleed and 9040 had an <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed.</b> For the validation cohort, we identified 1. 4 million patients contributing over 4. 9 million person years of follow-up. During follow-up, 6600 patients had an incident gastrointestinal bleed and 2820 had an <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed.</b> We excluded patients without a valid Townsend score for deprivation and those prescribed anticoagulants in the 180 days before study entry. Risk factors: Candidate variables recorded on the general practice computer system before entry to the cohort, including personal variables (age, sex, Townsend deprivation score, ethnicity), lifestyle variables (smoking, alcohol intake), chronic diseases, prescribed drugs, clinical values (body mass index, systolic blood pressure), and laboratory test results (haemoglobin, platelets). We also included previous bleed recorded before entry to the study. Results: The final QBleed algorithms incorporated 21 variables.

2500|$|One {{can get a}} clue as {{to whether}} {{bleeding}} is due to [...] a platelet disorder or a coagulation factor disorder by the characteristics and location of the bleeding. All of the following suggest platelet bleeding, not coagulation bleeding: the bleeding from a skin cut such as a razor nick is prompt and excessive, but can be controlled by pressure; spontaneous bleeding into the skin which causes a purplish stain named by its size: petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses; bleeding into mucous membranes causing bleeding gums, nose bleed, and gastrointestinal bleeding; menorrhagia; and intraretinal and <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeding.</b>|$|E

40|$|High minute {{ventilation}} {{is required to}} lower intracranial pressures in patients with <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed.</b> Respiratory acidemia consequent to ventilatory difficulty is dangerous in such patients as it further raises intracranial tension. We describe such a case. A 24 -year-old man had to be intubated and mechanically ventilated after he met with a road traffic accident and sustained extensive maxillofacial injuries and <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed.</b> A tooth was accidentally aspirated in this injury and progressively resulted in left lower lobe collapse, pneumomediastinum, and consequent difficult ventilation. Under video bronchoscope guidance, the tooth was removed with grasping forceps. Pneumomediastinum temporarily increased after the tooth removal, but by 12 h postextraction, resolution of both the pneumomediastinum and left lower lobe collapse was observed. There was a 17 h delay postadmission before the cause of ventilatory failure was realized. Aspiration of foreign bodies, in general, and teeth, in particular, should be actively looked for in patients with ventilatory difficulties in the post-trauma setting...|$|R

50|$|The most {{commonly}} reported {{side effect of}} dabigatran is gastrointestinal upset. When compared to people anticoagulated with warfarin, patients taking dabigatran had fewer life-threatening bleeds, fewer minor and major <b>bleeds,</b> including <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleeds,</b> but the rate of gastrointestinal bleeding was significantly higher. Dabigatran capsules contain tartaric acid, which lowers the gastric pH and is required for adequate absorption. The lower pH has previously been associated with dyspepsia; some hypothesize that this {{plays a role in}} the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.|$|R
40|$|Background: Stroke is {{the major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. The number of stroke patients receiving recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), also known as Alteplase, in the developing world is extremely low. We aim to study the feasibility and efficacy of thrombolysis for the 1 st time in our country. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study (July 2012 -August 2015), acute ischemic stroke patients who were thrombolyzed within 3 h of stroke onset were included. Their demographic profiles, clinical profiles, risk factors, type of thrombolytic used, and outcomes were systematically recorded and analyzed. Results: A total of 9 patients were thrombolyzed. The mean time from the onset of stroke symptoms to first dose of rt-PA (onset to treatment) was 1. 2 h. Six patients had good neurological outcome as measured by modified Rankin Scale (mRS). The median mRS at discharge was 3. Thrombolysis-related post treatment complication was noted in 44. 4 %, of which nonfatal <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed</b> occurred only in 2 patients (22. 2 %). None of the patients receiving intravenous tenecteplase had thrombolysis-related complications, and none of the patients had fatal <b>intracranial</b> <b>bleed.</b> Conclusion: This study clearly demonstrates the beginning of a feasible and effective thrombolysis in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Nepal...|$|R
