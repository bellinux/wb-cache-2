50|$|Although police {{dropped the}} {{homicide}} investigation into Hernandez' death, {{many people still}} believe he was murdered in a drug-related incident. According to David Manning, Hernandez had three {{times the amount of}} cocaine in his system that would have resulted in a fatality, and he and Kevin Von Erich stated that Hernandez also had cocaine in his stomach. Manning also suspected foul play {{due to the fact that}} Hernandez's <b>dead</b> <b>bolt</b> on his door was not locked, as he made it a habit in the past to lock the <b>dead</b> <b>bolt</b> at all times.|$|E
50|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>bolt,</b> {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a spring bolt lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common spring bolt lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{holes are}} bored, {{perpendicular}} to one another, {{into the door}}. The [...] "face bore" [...] is the larger hole which is bored into the door face and a smaller [...] "edge bore" [...] hole is bored into the door edge. The edge may require additional preparation to receive the latch assembly, typically by routing or chiseling a shallow mortise. Some commercially-sold doors may come prepared to receive one or more bored cylindrical locks, such as entry doors, which typically require both a door knob and <b>dead</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E

The doors are purchased as blanks and then modified to order.

2500|$|In {{spite of}} his broken promise to reopen the hospital, Schoemehl gained {{popularity}} through a city beautification project known as [...] "Operation Brightside". Operation Brightside officers were political appointees and {{not part of the}} traditional civil service, but they succeeded in planting street trees and flowers (particularly daffodils and tulips) along major streets, distributing plants to homeowners, and providing summer jobs to city youth picking up litter in alleyways. Schoemehl also instituted a safety program to address city crime, starting in 1984. The program, known as Operation SafeStreet, provided low cost or free security measures, such as <b>dead</b> <b>bolts,</b> bars for windows, and The Club. In addition to providing security to homeowners, Schoemehl ordered the blocking of several through streets in neighborhoods around the city to prevent cruising and drug-dealing. Crime declined in targeted neighborhoods by an average of 30 percent, and crime continued to decline in the 1980s until a rise in auto thefts in 1989 increased overall crime rates in the city for that year.|$|R
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, <b>dead</b> <b>bolt,</b> face plate, strike plate, escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|E
5000|$|Galician {{has many}} portmanteaus, some {{existing}} also in Portuguese {{but many others}} not (or only in the North of Portugal, close to Galicia), which {{can be explained by}} its popular origin: carambelo (frozen candy), from caramelo (candy) and carámbano (icicle); martabela (a kind of <b>dead</b> <b>bolt),</b> from martelo (hammer) and tarabela (a kind of drill bit); rabuñar (to scratch with a fingernail, for instance a cat or a person), from rabuxa (a small tail, and also a common ill in tails) and rañar (to scratch); millenta ("many thousands", also common in Portuguese milhenta), from milleiro (one thousand) and cento (one hundred); runxir (to crackle, applied to some things only), from ruxir (to howl) and renxer (to grind the teeth), or vagamundo (tramp), from vagabundo (wanderer) and mundo (world), currently [...] "vagamundo" [...] and [...] "vagabundo" [...] mean the same, and the former is considered a vulgarism.|$|E
5000|$|When Maverick {{disappeared}} and was believed <b>dead,</b> <b>Bolt</b> took the Maverick alias {{for himself and}} joined the Underground, a group founded by Cable to battle Weapon X and expose its existence. Following the group's defeat, Chris remained in the Underground, though it {{was taken over by}} Marrow and remade into a new incarnation of the extremist mutant supremacist group Gene Nation. Chris did not leave as he wanted to undermine Gene Nation from within and prevent its terrorist attacks, though he was ultimately killed by his former mentor himself, now bearing the codename [...] "Agent Zero", who did not find out Chris had been the new Maverick until it was too late. Ironically, disgusted by Agent Zero and not wanting to know his true identity, Chris died in his arms, stating that he took on Maverick's persona {{in order to ensure that}} his mentor's name would live on and that he wanted his mentor to be proud of him.|$|E

The history of the nebulae is thus one of tragedy, and as they dissolve into the stars and planets of our own cosmical time, the narrator wonders at the creator who could author such a complex dance of hope and futility.|$|R
5000|$|Electric strikes can be {{differentiated}} in {{a number}} of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. [...] The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the <b>dead</b> <b>bolt</b> is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the spring latching capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.|$|E
5000|$|Miles {{was married}} twice to the British playwright Robert Bolt, 1967-1975 and 1988-1995. He wrote and {{directed}} the film Lady Caroline Lamb, in which Miles played the eponymous heroine, and wrote Ryan's Daughter as well. After his stroke, the couple reunited and Miles cared for him. [...] "I would be <b>dead</b> without her", <b>Bolt</b> said in 1987, [...] "When she's away, my life takes a nosedive. When she returns, my life soars."

50|$|THE BEAUFORT BOLT: The 11.30 up {{goods train}} from Stawell, {{composed}} of 35 trucks, drawn by two powerful engines, was descending a steep incline {{about three miles}} long near Beaufort, when It got {{beyond the control of}} the drivers. A goods engine was standing in Beaufort station as the up train approached, and the signalman, seeing that something was wrong, turned the oncoming train into a <b>dead</b> end. The <b>bolting</b> train struck the end with terrific force. The leading engine was derailed, and thrown along- side the line, while its tender was left in an almost perpendicular position. Tho second engine and its tender were jammed together {{in the form of a}} V. The driver of the first engine and the fireman of the second were killed outright, and the other driver and fireman seriously injured. The latter died before he was extricated from the position in which he was jammed beneath his engine.|$|R
