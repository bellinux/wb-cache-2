25|$|Although NIF was {{primarily}} designed as an indirect drive device, the {{energy in the}} laser is high enough {{to be used as}} a <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in fusion energy gains of about 40 times, somewhat higher than the indirect drive system. A more uniform beam layout suitable for <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> experiments can be arranged through changes in the switchyard that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber.|$|E
25|$|Laser fusion was {{suggested}} in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{shortly after the}} invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as inertial confinement fusion, involves imploding a target by using laser beams. There are two ways to do this: indirect drive and <b>direct</b> <b>drive.</b> In <b>direct</b> <b>drive,</b> the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes x-rays that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.|$|E

50|$|Sundyne {{centrifugal}} {{pumps and compressors}} are traditionally utilized for processes requiring high-head (pumps: 6,300 ft-1,921m)(compressors: 4000psia-350bara), and low-flow (pumps: 1,100gpm or 250m³/hr)(compressors: 10000acfm-17000am³/hr). They are engineered and built to meet the Best Efficiency Point 'BEP' for production processes.

25|$|Inertial {{confinement}} {{is the use}} {{of rapidly}} imploding shell to heat and confine plasma. The shell is imploded using a direct laser blast (<b>direct</b> <b>drive)</b> or a secondary x-ray blast (indirect drive) or heavy ion beams. Theoretically, fusion using lasers would be done using tiny pellets of fuel that explode several times a second. To induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. If <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> is used—the beams are focused directly on the pellet—it can in principle be very efficient, but in practice is difficult to obtain the needed uniformity. The alternative approach, indirect drive, uses beams to heat a shell, and then the shell radiates x-rays, which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy and light ion beams and electron beams have all been investigated.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable <b>direct</b> <b>drive</b> enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record {{back and forth on}} the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E

A peculiar type of parallel robots is called vertical Cable <b>Direct</b> <b>Driven</b> Robot (CDDR). In this {{paper we discuss}} an innovative type of planar parallel 2 -link, 2 -d. o. f. robot which is conceptually similar to CDDRs; in place of using cables, this robot uses Storable Tubular Extendible Member (STEM) actuators, {{one of which is}} also capable to actively rotate. STEMs are lightweight mechanisms used mainly in the space industry. We devise a complete model for the behavior of the robot. The kinematics of robot is defined analytically, whereas the structural model is based on numerical and empirical considerations as well. A working prototype of a STEM actuator is presented. The robot is evaluated via the analysis of force polytopes inside the workspace envelope. This allows us to define some useful indexes: maximum force, maximum admissible weight, out-of-plane stiffness. Results show that the robot outperforms Cable <b>Direct</b> <b>Driven</b> Robots (CDDRs). The robot's workspace reaches above the link anchor points and the system can eliminate configuration singularities. Out-of-plane stiffness is indeed computed to be within an acceptable range...|$|R
