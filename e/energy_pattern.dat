40|$|In echoing Varshney's seminal {{concept of}} jointly {{transmitting}} information and energy, we propose {{the concept of}} an <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> aided Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) system, where in addition to power transfer, information is conveyed both by the specific Receive Antenna (RA) indices to which the power is delivered {{as well as by the}} particular intensity of the power assigned to that particular RA pattern. By embedding information into energy patterns rather than imposing it by modulating classic radio waveforms, our proposed solution is capable of operating both in an integrated receiver mode and in a power-split mode, while relying on a low-complexity two-stage non-coherent detection algorithm. Both our analysis and simulations show that our <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> aided SWIPT system exhibits a beneficial immunity to any potential performance degradation imposed by power-conversion.

40|$|AbstractThe Weibull {{distribution}} {{has been}} widely used to represent the time distribution of wind speed.

The goodness of fit was quantified using Kolmogorov-Sminorv test, R 2, RMSE and the percent error of wind power density.

40|$|Two-parameter Weibull {{function}} {{has been}} widely applied to evaluate wind energy potential. In this paper, six kinds of numerical methods commonly used for estimating Weibull parameters are reviewed; i. e. the moment, empirical, graphical, maximum likelihood, modified maximum likelihood and <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> factor method. Their performance is compared through Monte Carlo simulation and analysis of actual wind speed according to the criterions such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, parameter error, root mean square error, and wind energy error. The results show that, in simulation test of random variables, the graphical method's performance in estimating Weibull parameters is the worst one, followed by the empirical and <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> factor methods, if data number is smaller. The performance for all the six methods is improved while data number becomes larger; the graphical method is even better than the empirical and <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> factor methods. The maximum likelihood, modified maximum likelihood and moment methods present relatively more excellent ability throughout the simulation tests. From analysis of actual data, {{it is found that}} if wind speed distribution matches well with Weibull function, the six methods are applicable; but if not, the maximum likelihood method performs best followed by the modified maximum likelihood and moment methods, based on double checks including potential energy and cumulative distribution function.

Of course the electromagnetic fields (both E and H), the power density and the energy density have their maximum on the boresight.

In this note we explore the concept of an <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> which holds good both in time and frequency domains. An <b>energy</b> <b>pattern</b> is useful in visualizing where the transient energy provided to the IRA is going.
