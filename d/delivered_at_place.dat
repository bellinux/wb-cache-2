40|$|This paper {{considers}} the changes between the Incoterms 2000 and the Incoterms 2010 from a risk management perspective, and highlights {{the challenges that}} traders may encounter when dealing {{with some of these}} terms. For example, the problematic FOB term and its use in containerisation is not likely to have been totally resolved, although the Incoterms 2010 have attempted to ameliorate the situation. The new terms DAT (Delivered at Terminal) and DAP (<b>Delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>Place)</b> should be useful for cross border transactions within Customs Union blocs, such as the European Union. The paper concludes that the new Incoterms 2010 provide improved definitions, and more effectively contextualise the use of old terms that are out of synch with today’s modern practices. However, if traders continue to cling to their old habits and fail to update their delivery terms and arrangements to reflect contemporary practices, much of the work and progress that the ICC has put into this change process will be lost...|$|E
30|$|Company B is an {{industrial}} equipment manufacturer and distributor of industrial filtration, recycling and cleaning equipment in workshop environments. The company has sales and service presence in 31 countries, manufacturing and assembly plants in 11, and distributors in an additional 30 countries. The company has an annual turnover of 290  M€ and employs some 1700 people. Almost {{two-thirds of the}} volume is transported by truck and RoRo shipping to continental Europe, and the remaining third is shipped out by containerised liner shipping. The flows included in the case study are the outbound volumes of finished products and components from Sweden to the Far East and North and South America. Air transport {{is used as a}} competing mode to maritime transport but the products are voluminous, making them expensive to send by air. For cost and environmental reasons, the aim is to minimise the use of air freight. Both components and finished products are produced after Company B receives actual orders. The level of customisation for many of the systems sold is such that orders normally originate from sales agents or offshore manufacturing sites, which in turn also place their orders based on actual end-customer orders. Sales are delivered according to Incoterm DAP (<b>Delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>Place).</b> Transport services are routinely purchased as door-to-door transport from a forwarder. The company has a standing order based on the departure schedule of the shipping lines. Deviation from the standing order is managed through contacts with a forwarder. The forwarder is biannually re-evaluated in competitive tendering. The annual volumes for the relevant flows are about 500 TEUs.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to searching the {{potential}} ofthe maritime traffic in the Black Sea, the good application of the INCOTERMS in this region and the opportunities of maritime transport with the others seas. The research project conducted in this thesis uses qualitative methods: interviews with people that working in the maritime transport in the Black Sea that were made through e-mail to get a practical view on the topic, statistics and studies makes by me in the practice. The results indicate {{that there are no}} outstanding obstacles {{for the development of the}} commercial maritime traffic in the Black Sea and that the maritime companies of the world are very interested to start a large process to export and import in this region, ofcourse applying correct the INCOTERMS. Also, we analyze in this study the im portance of the Bosporus Strait that connecting the Black Sea with the Mediterrean Sea and offers big opportunities to the global maritime transport. The studies in this field of maritime traffic conducted us to find out what are the standards in the maritime trade in the Black Sea but also in comparison with the Mediterrean Sea, Baltic Sea and Caspian Sea. The Black Sea basin presents various challenges and offers numerous opportunities. Ps a result, its development requires special consideration by policy makers. The central question of this paper is given the difference in legal and political systems in the presence, more geo strategically considerations, building on the commercial development from existing business practices. Mercantile custom plays an important role in international commercial law, whether that is as a source of or merelyas an element of the new law merchant. Trade usages and practices tend to be linked to a specific location, trade or port in which they are used. Es pecially in the context of trade term s, differences in interpretation detract from their harmonization function. The latest edition of the ICC INCOTERMS was carried out in 2010 when the INCOTERMS. Two major innovations are the num ber of rules and their classification. Under previous INCOTERM revis ions, term s were grouped in order of increasing responsibilityon the seller, now were classified according to the mode of trans port. There are 11 rules instead of 13. INCOTERMS 2010 includes two new rules, Delivered atTerminal (DAT) and <b>Delivered</b> <b>at</b> <b>Place</b> (DAP), and eliminates the Delivered at Frontier (DAF), Delivered Ex-Ship (DES), Delivered Ex-Quay (DEQ) and Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) designations. DAT replaces the current DEQ, while DAP replaces DAF, DES and DDU. The option of applying one or another INCOTERM of the delivery conditions or practices known worldwide should consider a number of criteria, such as the following: the ratio of currency and foreign currency contract for payment of transportation, insurance and other charges related to delivery; market situation and the charges of air and land transport, participation in international conventions on transport, which involves preferential rates oftransport, customs outlets in markets or supplies. In the case of a saturated market, where there is a strong competition, the exporter can earn a segment of this market, providing certain favorable conditions to the importer within the meaning of risk and minimal costs that the latter must bear. Delivery condition is one of the essential terms are agreed between international contract partners, thereby regulating the transfer actually goods and the seller to the buyer risks, including legal consequences and general economic. Since the implementation ofthe each entry in the various delivery methods, costs, which can't be neglected, their enrollment contract specifications require is especially importantto establish who and what pays any omission of this view mayor cancel benefits buying or selling expected at closing. We hope that this thesis may be able to help the future importers and exporters in the global maritime traffic...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Web-based {{asynchronous}} learning systems have revolutionized the learning environment. Rapid advances in computer technology, the Internet and transmission technology have created {{new opportunities for}} delivering instruction. It is anticipated that these technologies will dramatically change the way instruction will be imparted throughout the educational system. One example is {{asynchronous learning}} wherein instruction can be <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> any <b>place</b> <b>at</b> any time on demand. If we are to use this new mode of delivering and receiving instruction, we need to fully understand its advantages and limitations to existing forms of delivering instruction. In response to this need, this paper describes a study conducted to evaluate the usefulness of delivering instruction asynchronously. The study compared three forms of instruction: classroom, synchronous and asynchronous using student subjects from an industrial engineering course. Results of this study throw new light into {{the usefulness of the}} Internet and asynchronous learning. 1...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} communication {{challenge was}} notifying {{the community of}} the date of the polio campaign. While there was an intensive media campaign on air and IEC material had been developed to serve this purpose, the community needed constant reminders. Booth turnout would surely increase if announcements were made in mosques and other places of worship. Mosques also had microphones that could ensure {{that a large number of}} people heard the announcement. Although there was a provision for miking, there was nothing to guarantee that announcements made would be widely heard. Targeting a congregation was a surer way to ensure that the message delivered was heard. If this message was <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> a <b>place</b> of worship, it had greater credibility. The CMC networked with imams at mosques and pundits in temples to organise announcements prior to booth day. Today, mosque announcements are universally made in all CMC areas. Mosques and temples often offer space to vaccinators to set up booths in their premises.|$|R

Such trends are exacerbated in regions of social deprivation yet little is known on how best to intervene in this male population. The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a purpose-built active video game (AVG) intervention in a target population of sedentary males from a region of lower socio-economic status. Methods: This was a community-based pilot randomised controlled exploratory trial. We recruited men (n = 47) from areas of social deprivation in the North East of England in distinct community settings; a working men’s club (n = 6), taxi ranks (n = 22), mosque (n = 17) and home visits (n = 2). Following baseline measures of metabolic health and quality of life, participants were randomly allocated by a third party to an intervention (n = 27) or control (n = 17) group. A prototype boxing-based AVG was developed where participants were required to punch against resistance bands in time to music and on-screen prompts at varying frequencies.
