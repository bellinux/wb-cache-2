40|$|Abstract. The present {{requirements}} for the connecting rod are indicated and the fracture splitting (FS) technologies for constructing the big <b>end</b> <b>boss</b> are reviewed. Two possibilities of FS for a high strength Cr-Mo steel and Ti alloys were discussed. The carburized quench-temper FS connecting rod has a superior fatigue strength with a high dimensional accuracy at the big <b>end</b> <b>boss.</b> The possibility of using a titanium FS connecting rod was examined and proposed. Fracture Splitting Method constructing Big <b>End</b> <b>Boss</b> Environmental issues require a drastic improvement in the fuel economy and power output of automotive engines. As an engine part, the connecting rod should be light and have an adequate strength to endure the combustion pressure and the inertial force due to the piston weight. The reduced friction loss in the big end bore (Fig. 1) {{is also an important}} issue. The light weight design of the connecting rod reduces the reciprocating mass during engine revolution, therefore, the engine vibration is reduced. It also affects th...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper examines how female evil {{is represented in}} adventure games from 1982 till 2013 and how this representation of female evil can be understood in a cultural philosophical perspective. First, the philosophical growth of the term evil is summarized and the paper describes how media forms, such as art, literature and movies, have represented evil in the past. While these art forms focus on representation through images, sound and text, video games introduce interactivity as a new tool to represent, understand and occasionally even be evil. Observed is that female villains are represented through text, images, sound and extra diegetic material. By examining the female gender role of <b>end</b> <b>bosses</b> in digital games, the portrayal of evil is studied and it is shown that humanlike female <b>end</b> <b>bosses</b> become demonized oral villains as their representation is stereotyped {{with the use of}} symbols for evil. Only when the villain is a genderless being the female aspects of the <b>end</b> <b>boss</b> can be said to be of cultural importance...|$|R
50|$|To {{save his}} friends, Mickey has to collect puzzle pieces that completes images of his Disney friends, {{including}} Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy and even obscure characters like Grandma Duck from {{the comic book}} series. To do this, Mickey has to wave his wand over crystals which conceal not only pieces of the image, but also items and even an occasional enemy. Each big level has ten small stages, each {{with at least one}} image to complete. Each tenth stage has an <b>end</b> <b>boss</b> to defeat. The image to complete in the tenth stage of each level reveals the Disney character being held captive by the <b>end</b> <b>boss</b> of that level.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} an organic fiber in an epoxy matrix by winding 20 -cm diam spherical and cylindrical pressure vessels of various designs. For the spherical vessels, we used soft aluminum liners 0. 76 mm thick for a double <b>boss</b> <b>design</b> and 2 mm thick for a single <b>boss</b> <b>design.</b> For the cylindrical vessels, we used both 0. 5 -mm rubber liners and 0. 76 -mm soft aluminum liners. Vessels of both types were tested for burst pressure and cyclic fatigue at room temperature and liquid hydrogen temperature. The effects of temperature and vessel shape on the vessel performance factor were negligible. Our vessel fatigue data were marred by premature failure of the liners...|$|R
