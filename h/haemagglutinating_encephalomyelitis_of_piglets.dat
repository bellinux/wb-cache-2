Three treatments were studied: 100 B (100 % biological piglets, n= 13), 50 B 50 A (50 % biological piglets and 50 % adopted piglets, n= 13) and 100 A (100 % adopted piglets, n= 13). All litters were standardised to eleven piglets on average within 20. 1 ± 0. 4 h (14. 3 – 24. 7 h) of birth. The behaviour <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> was recorded during four consecutive sucklings for four days (days 1, 2, 4 and 6 after farrowing, considering day 1 as the cross-fostering day). The observations were performed at two time periods: TP 1 (from release <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> out <b>of</b> creep box until milk letdown) and TP 2 (from the end of milk letdown up to 15 min later). Piglets were weighed at days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16.

On the basis of cost price per feeding day of a sow and the number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> per litter, production costs <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> older than 28 days with an average body weight of 7 kg were determined. Price cost per piglet after weaning, with 7 kg average body weight, and 146 days of reproduction process accounts for 21, 78 EUR if there are 10 piglets in a litter. If the reproductive cycle would last exactly the same and if successful conception would be achieved 25 days after weaning, production cost per piglet would be 23, 79 EUR...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Purebred and {{crossbred}} litters of Yorkshire and Berkshire breeds {{of swine}} were evaluated for number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> born alive per litter, number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> weaned per litter, mean piglet birth weight, mean piglet birth weight adjusted for number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> born alive per litter and mean piglet weaning weight. The 632 litters, adjusted to a sow equivalent, were weaned at 56 days. The data {{were subjected to}} two analyses; the first calculates paternal, maternal and litter heterosis as the difference between crossbred and purebred means. The second analysis calculates estimates using an additive-dominance model and an epistatic model; model and scale are tested for appropriateness. In the first analysis, litter heterosis estimates tend to be positive, to range between 5...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} to {{what extent}} maternally derived antibodies interfere with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccination {{in order to determine}} the factors that influence the correct vaccination for <b>piglets.</b> Groups <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> with maternally derived antibodies were vaccinated at different time points following birth, and the antibody titers to FMD virus (FMDV) were measured using virus neutralization tests (VNT). We used 50 piglets from 5 sows that had been vaccinated 3 times intramuscularly in the neck during pregnancy with FMD vaccine containing strains of FMDV serotypes O, A, and Asia- 1. Four groups <b>of</b> 10 <b>piglets</b> were vaccinated intramuscularly in the neck at 3, 5, 7, or 9 weeks of age using a monovalent Cedivac-FMD vaccine (serotype A TUR/ 14 / 98). One group <b>of</b> 10 <b>piglets</b> with maternally derived antibodies was not vaccinated, and another group <b>of</b> 10 <b>piglets</b> without maternally derived antibodies was vaccinated at 3 weeks of age and served as a control group. Sera samples were collected, and antibody titers were determined using VNT. In our study, the antibody responses <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> with maternally derived antibodies vaccinated at 7 or 9 weeks of age were similar to the responses <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> without maternally derived antibodies vaccinated at 3 weeks of age. The maternally derived antibody levels in piglets depended very strongly on the antibody titer in the sow, so the optimal time for vaccination <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> will depend on the vaccination scheme and quality of vaccine used in the sows and should, therefore, be monitored and reviewed on regular basis in countries that use FMD prophylactic vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Peri‐partum {{nutrition}} {{is essential}} for immune development and survival <b>of</b> new‐born <b>piglets.</b> A dietary short‐chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS) supplementation <b>of</b> sows or <b>piglets</b> could, by stimulating growth of beneficial bacteria, modulate immune activity of gut and optimise performances <b>of</b> <b>piglets.</b> Thus, effects <b>of</b> scFOS supplementation <b>of</b> sows and <b>piglets</b> on immune quality of colostrum, on immune activity of innate or adaptative system and on performances <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> have been investigated. Twenty‐six sows in 3 replicates received a control diet or a diet supplemented with scFOS (respectively 10 g/d of maltodextrin or scFOS) for the last 4 weeks of gestation and during lactation. Serum Ig concentrations of sows and immune quality of the colostrum and milk were determined. Performances <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> were recorded. Twenty‐six piglets were slaughtered on d 21. Cellular immune activity was evaluated after cell culture. After weaning, <b>piglets</b> <b>of</b> each litter {{were divided into two}} groups to receive the control diet or the scFOS diet (1. 2 g/d of maltodextrin or scFOS) from d 29 to d 77. On d 35 and 56, piglets were vaccinated against influenza. <b>Piglet</b> serum concentrations <b>of</b> Ig were determined at d 7 and 21 after birth and of specific IgA and IgG anti‐flu at d 56 and 77. scFOS maternal supplementation increased immune quality of colostrum, intestinal immune maturation <b>of</b> suckling <b>piglets</b> and growth <b>of</b> weaned <b>piglets.</b> Supplementation <b>of</b> scFOS in weaned piglets improved the response to a vaccine challenge. Finally, supplementation of scFOS contributes to secure diets, ensuring a development of the immune system for optimising health and performances...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Genetic {{parameters}} {{including the}} proportion of variance for the service sire effect were estimated for number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> stillborn (including piglets died until 24 h after birth) and number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> died from 24 h after birth until weaning in Czech Large White (89 231 litters) and Czech Landrace (28 320 litters) pigs. Both traits {{were considered to be}} traits of the sow. Two two-trait animal models were evaluated for each breed including or excluding the service sire effect. Estimates of genetic parameters were very similar for the two models. The herit-ability for number <b>of</b> stillborn <b>piglets</b> was 0. 06 in both breeds and both models and the heritability for number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> died until weaning was 0. 07 in Czech Large White and 0. 05 to 0. 06 in Czech Landrace. The proportion of variance due to service sire was very low (between 0. 8 and 1. 6 %). Therefore, {{there is no need to}} include the service sire effect in models for genetic evaluation. A selection against farrowing losses is recommended though only a slow improvement of the trait can be expected. Selecting against piglets died until weaning seems to be cumber-some. Probably a selection on number <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> weaned could be helpful in minimizing piglet losses until weaning...|$|R
40|$|Early {{weaned piglets}} are {{vulnerable}} to diarrhea because of weaning stress and immaturity of intestinal tract. Compelling evidence suggests that gut microbiota is vital to host health. However, it is not well understood on the composition and succession <b>of</b> <b>piglet</b> gut microbiota during the weaning transition. In our two trials, total 17 commercial piglets were studied in a pig farm in Jiangxi Province, China. Fresh feces were collected for four times (10 days before weaned, weaned day, 10 days after weaned, 21 days after weaned) by rectal massage. Fecal bacterial composition was assessed by 16 S rRNA gene V 3 –V 4 regions sequencing by Illumina Miseq platform. The {{results showed that the}} gut microbiota <b>of</b> <b>piglets</b> shifted quickly after weaned and reached relatively stable level in 10 days after weaned. The alpha diversity increased significantly with the age <b>of</b> <b>piglets.</b> The microbiota <b>of</b> suckling <b>piglets</b> was mainly represented by Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella, and Megasphaera. This pattern contrasted with that of Clostridium sensu stricto, Roseburia, Paraprevotella, Clostridium XIVa, and Blautia, which were major representative genera after weaned. In summary, we delineated the development <b>of</b> <b>piglet</b> gut microbiota during the weaning transition. This study helps us understand the maturing development of gut microbiota in commercial piglets...|$|R
