5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent fact may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E

50|$|The Rules Committee {{was formed}} on April 2, 1789, {{during the first}} Congress. However, it had nowhere near the {{powerful}} role it has today. Instead, it merely proposed <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> for the House to follow when debating bills (rather than passing a special rule for each bill), and was dissolved after proposing these <b>general</b> <b>rules.</b> These <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> still have {{a great impact on}} the tone of the House floor today.|$|R
5|$|Another {{exception}} to the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact. In such situations, intervention by the High Court is warranted as the action or decision is factually unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{since that}} time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country.

5|$|As a <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{there is}} no {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written.

40|$|Extending the {{relational}} data model using classical logic to give deductive databases has some significant benefits. In particular, classical logic rules offer an efficient representation: a universally quantified rule can represent many facts. However, classical logic {{does not support}} the representation of <b>general</b> <b>rules,</b> or synonymously defaults. <b>General</b> <b>rules</b> are rules that are usually valid, but occasionally have exceptions. They are useful in a database since they can allow for the derivation of relations on the basis of incomplete information. The need for incorporating <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> into a database is reinforced when considering that participants in the development process may naturally describe rules for a deductive database in the form of <b>general</b> <b>rules.</b> In order to meet this need for using <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> in databases, we extend the notion of deductive databases. In particular, we use default logic, an extension of classical logic that has been developed for representing and reas [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, mixed lodges {{following}} a standard Masonic ritual started {{to appear in}} France, and quickly spread to other countries. Women-only jurisdictions appeared soon afterwards. As a <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the admission of women is now recognised in Continental (Grand Orient) jurisdictions. In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be cordial, with premises sometimes shared.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. As a <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> free-living larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least one}} species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose that}} in large {{knowledge}} bases which are collections of atomic facts and <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> (Horn clauses), the rules {{should be allowed}} to occur in the answer for a query. We introduce a new concept of the answer for a query which includes both atomic facts and <b>general</b> <b>rules.</b> We provide a method of transforming rules by relational algebra expressions built from projection, join, and selection and demonstrate how the answers consisting of both facts and <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> can be generated...|$|R

Tornadoes have been known to cross major rivers, climb mountains, affect valleys, and have damaged several city centers. As a <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> no area is safe from tornadoes, though some areas are more susceptible than others.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant {{has a right}} to counsel without a conflict of interest. If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E

Any new <b>General</b> <b>Rules</b> had to be laid before Parliament {{at the start of the}} next session. [...] <b>General</b> <b>Rules</b> were those issued to the Guardians of more than one Union. Therefore, there was no provision for Parliamentary scrutiny of policy changes (e.g., on the extent to which out-door relief would be permitted) affecting a number of Poor Law Unions, provided these were implemented by separate directives to each Union involved.|$|R

5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} {{to this group}} of works, the Commission express the opinion that an enemy {{will not attempt to}} enter Washington from this direction, and that we cannot (as a <b>general</b> <b>rule)</b> expect to be able to meet him with a line of troops. What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> of elements being more electropositive in their lower oxidation states.|$|E

There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about the morality of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care.
