2500|$|As Michigan's {{equipment}} manager, Hatch {{played a}} role in the early history of the Little Brown Jug, one of the most famous trophies in college athletics. [...] In 1903, the Michigan Wolverines traveled to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the unbeaten Wolverines played the unbeaten Minnesota Golden Gophers. [...] At the end of the game (a 6-6 tie), the crowd poured onto the field, and Michigan left its earthenware water jug on the field. [...] Michigan asked to have it returned, but Minnesota refused, saying Michigan would have to win the jug back. [...] Michigan reclaimed the jug several years later. [...] In 1919, Minnesota beat Michigan on the Wolverines' home field in Ann Arbor. [...] When Minnesota asked for the symbolic trophy at the end of the game, Michigan officials said they could not locate it. [...] Eventually, Hatch came up with it. [...] Hatch recalled, [...] "When Minnesota made such a fuss about getting it back, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> around and found it behind a clump of shrubbery near the gym. I shined it up and shipped it on to Doc Cooke." [...] Minnesota fans have long doubted Hatch's story, raising their suspicions that Hatch did not find the jug in a clump of shrubbery, but more likely [...] "in a trophy case inside the gymnasium, easily dusted off and proudly brought back to Minnesota." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When I {{began to}} feel easier, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>looking</b> about me. It was an {{extraordinary}} sight. Even the light was extraordinary, a kind of reddy-coloured twilight, {{on account of the}} streamers of seaweed that floated up {{on either side of the}} ship. And far overhead just a moony, deep green blue. The deck of the ship, except for a slight list to starboard, was level, and lay all dark and long between the weeds, clear except where the masts had snapped when she rolled, and vanishing into black night towards the forecastle. There wasn't any dead on the decks, most were in the weeds alongside, I suppose; but afterwards I found two skeletons lying in the passengers' cabins, where death had come to them. It was curious to stand on that deck and recognise it all, bit by bit; a place against the rail where I'd been fond of smoking by starlight, and the corner where an old chap from Sydney used to flirt with a widow we had aboard. A comfortable couple they'd been, only a month ago, and now you couldn't have got a meal for a baby crab off either of them.|$|E

5000|$|Brooks adopts what {{he calls}} a [...] "polemic" [...] tone when {{offering}} recommendations, urging that philanthropic giving not be crowded out by government programs and that giving must be cultivated in families and communities.

5000|$|Discussing the {{challenges}} of playing a mythological character, the actor says that his approach was to make Coop a [...] "real person".

He'd be very confident. Let's say he wasn't Cupid, let's say he's a master of love, what would he have? That's how <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>looking</b> at it. <b>I</b> think he'd have a great sense of humor, sense of style. He can probably dance and cook and tell good jokes, be a lot of fun, have a lot of positive energy, want to lift you up. Obviously he would take great care of himself. He would look immaculate the whole time." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>started</b> and <b>looked</b> in the {{direction}} from which the voice--a sweet, childish treble--came.

60|$|Where were my thoughts? What {{had become}} of my attention? I was too bewildered to know. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> and <b>looked</b> at my new husband.
