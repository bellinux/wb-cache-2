5|$|The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{named after}} the Brazilian {{physician}} and epidemiologist Carlos Chagas, who first described it in 1909. The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> not seen as a major public health problem in humans until the 1960s (the outbreak of Chagas disease in Brazil in the 1920s went widely ignored). Dr Chagas discovered that the intestines of Triatomidae (now Reduviidae: Triatominae) harbored a flagellate protozoan, a new species of the Trypanosoma genus, {{and was able to}} demonstrate experimentally that it could be transmitted to marmoset monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Later studies showed squirrel monkeys were also vulnerable to infection.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Fairley {{investigated}} schistosomiasis (then {{known as}} bilharzia). The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{known to be}} caused by contact with fresh water inhabited by certain species of snails, and orders had been issued that prohibited bathing in fresh water, but the troops were slow to appreciate the danger involved. In its toxic phase, the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> easily confused with typhus, so Fairley developed a complement fixation test for the disease {{along the lines of the}} Wassermann test. He studied its pathology, confirming that the worms in the circulatory system could be cured by intravenous tartaric acid. Fairley also studied, and later published papers on typhus, malaria, and bacillary dysentery.|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} on bond, Jernigan {{returned}} to {{the room at the}} Continental Inn in Lexington where he had been living prior to his arrest. On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment to dismiss the case in 1986.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the fall of Nojpetén, there are {{estimated}} to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's first book, Biological Aspects of Infectious <b>Disease,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} in 1940. It had wide influence and {{was translated into}} several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, {{as well as his}} sense of loyalty to the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E

5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. <b>Disease</b> <b>was</b> a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{isolated from the}} brain of a turquoise parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the turquoise parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E

30|$|We {{calculated}} sensitivity, specificity, positive {{predictive value}} (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of p 300 where sensitivity is {{the probability that a}} test result will be positive when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present, specificity is the probability that a test result will be negative when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present, and {{positive predictive value}} is the probability that the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> present when the test is positive. Negative predictive value will be negative when the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present. Positive predictive value is the probability that the <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> not present when the test is negative. Accuracy is the overall probability that a patient will be correctly classified.|$|R
5|$|Levin {{began to}} have {{difficulty}} with his balance as early as 1988, although Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> not diagnosed until the early 1990s. From September 1995 his Times column appeared once weekly instead of twice, and in January 1997 the editor, Peter Stothard, concluded, despite a great admiration for Levin, that the weekly column should cease. Levin retired, though he continued to write for the paper occasionally over the next year.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common cancer in babies and the third most common cancer in {{children}} after leukemia and brain cancer. About 1 in every 7,000 children is affected at some point in time. About 90% of cases occur in children less than 5 years old and it is rare in adults. Of cancer deaths in children about 15% are due to neuroblastoma. The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> first described in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Polio was {{eliminated}} in the Americas by 1994. The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> officially eliminated in 36 Western Pacific countries, including China and Australia in 2000. Europe was declared polio-free in 2002. Since January 2011, {{there were no}} reported cases of the disease in India, and hence in February 2012, the country {{was taken off the}} WHO list of polio endemic countries. In March 2014, India was declared a polio-free country.|$|E
40|$|As we {{head into}} the mid-season of crop growth, some foliar soybean <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> visible. Based on my {{observations}} and reports from growers and agronomists, the following foliar <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> relatively common in Iowa soybean fields. Bacterial blight has been observed in some soybean fields. The <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Lesions associated with this <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> normally first observed on younger, top leaves of soybean plants. The lesions are small, angular, water-soaked, yellow-to-brown spots. The angular lesions enlarge in rainy weather and merge to produce large, irregular dead areas. The bacteria also can infect pods and seed quality may be affected when this <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> severe...|$|R

50|$|Fatty liver <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{believed}} {{by many to}} be caused by bad diet. Hedgehogs will eagerly eat foods that are high in fat and sugar. Having a metabolism adapted for low-fat, protein-rich insects, this leads to common problems of obesity. Fatty liver <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> one sign, heart <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> another.|$|R
5|$|Populations of C.australis were {{decimated}} in {{some parts}} of New Zealand because of Sudden Decline. In some areas, particularly in the north, no big trees are left. Although Sudden Decline often affects cabbage trees in farmland and open areas, trees in natural forest patches continue to do well. Trees in the southern North Island and northern South Island are generally unaffected with few dead branches and no symptoms of Sudden Decline. By 2010, there was evidence to suggest the severity of the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> lessening.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{preventable}} with the polio vaccine; however, {{a number of}} doses are required {{for it to be}} effective. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends polio vaccination boosters for travelers and those who live in countries where the disease is occurring. Once infected there is no specific treatment. In 2016, polio affected 42 people, while there were about 350,000 cases in 1988. In 2014 the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan. In 2015 Nigeria had stopped the spread of wild poliovirus but it reoccurred in 2016.|$|E

50|$|The overall {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> decreasing; the cause for these changes <b>is</b> unclear. Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> rare in people less than 55 years of age, and the prevalence increases with age. Evidence from studies of autopsy results have demonstrated Paget's disease in about 3 percent of people older than 40 years of age. Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more common in males than females. Rates of Paget's <b>disease</b> <b>are</b> about 50 percent higher in men than in women.|$|R
5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{thought in}} Victorian healthcare concerning {{the transmission of}} contagious diseases was the miasma theory, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could {{take the form of}} the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of cholera, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The term malaria {{originates}} from Medieval —"bad air"; the <b>disease</b> <b>was</b> formerly called ague or marsh fever due to {{its association}} with swamps and marshland. The term {{first appeared in the}} English literature about 1829. Malaria was once common in most of Europe and North America, where it is no longer endemic, though imported cases do occur.|$|E
5000|$|An aging-associated <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a <b>disease</b> that <b>is</b> {{most often}} seen with {{increasing}} frequency with increasing senescence. Essentially, aging-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> complications arising from senescence. Age-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>are</b> to be distinguished from the aging process itself because all adult animals age, save for a few rare exceptions, but not all adult animals experience all age-associated diseases. Aging-associated diseases do not refer to age-specific diseases, such as the childhood diseases chicken pox and measles. [...] "Aging-associated disease" [...] is used here to mean [...] "diseases of the elderly". Nor should aging-associated <b>diseases</b> <b>be</b> confused with accelerated aging diseases, {{all of which are}} genetic disorders.|$|R
50|$|Non-communicable: A non-communicable <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{a medical}} {{condition}} or <b>disease</b> that <b>is</b> non-transmissible.
