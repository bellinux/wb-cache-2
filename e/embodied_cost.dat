40|$|The {{drive to}} reduce carbon {{emissions}} from domestic housing {{has led to}} a recent shift of focus from new-build to retrofit. However there are two significant differences. Firstly more work is needed to retrofit existing housing to the same energy efficiency standards as new-build. Secondly the remaining length of service life is potentially shorter. This implies that the capital expenditure – both financial and carbon - of retrofit may be disproportionate to the savings gained over the remaining life. However the Government’s definition of low and zero carbon continues to exclude the capital (<b>embodied)</b> carbon <b>costs</b> of construction, which has resulted in a lack of data for comparison. The paper addresses this gap by reporting the <b>embodied</b> carbon <b>costs</b> of retrofitting four individual pilot properties in Rampton Drift, part of an Eco-Town Demonstrator Project in Cambridgeshire. Through collecting details of the materials used and their journeys from manufacturer to site, the paper conducts a ‘cradle-to-gate’ life cycle carbon assessment for each property. The embodied carbon figures are calculated using a software tool being developed by the Centre for Sustainable Development at the University of Cambridge. The key aims are to assess the real <b>embodied</b> carbon <b>costs</b> of retrofit of domestic properties, and to test the new tool; it is hoped that the methodology, the tool and the specific findings will be transferable to other projects. Initial changes in operational energy {{as a result of the}} retrofit works will be reported and compared with the <b>embodied</b> carbon <b>costs</b> when presenting this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} impacts associated with two iconic development types (urban redevelopment and fringe development) as their <b>embodied</b> <b>costs</b> are {{broken down into}} the categories of infrastructure provision, transportation costs, greenhouse gas emissions and health costs. The findings show that there are substantial cost savings associated with urban redevelopment. By far, the largest figures are associated with infrastructure and transportation while GHG emissions and health constitute smaller portions of total costs, although the latter do have serious implications {{in terms of the}} attainability of national emissions reductions targets (redevelopment will save 4, 400 tonne of GHG per year for 1, 000 dwellings) and the Australian population’s health and well being (now one of the most obese populations in the world). Emissions and health savings are closely related to active forms of travel that are only realizable in areas with high levels of amenity and servicing and high levels of transit access. Their cost savings over a 50 year urban lifetime are quite modest, $ 19. 32 million and $ 4. 23 million for 1000 dwellings, but if these more walkable, low emission developments are pursued then the savings in transport and infrastructure for 1000 dwellings are in the order of $ 86 million up-front for infrastructure and $ 250 million for annualized transportation costs over 50 years. A simple model is developed from these assessments {{that can be used to}} predict urban development costs associated with any proposed development in Australian cities or with the associated urban development from any major infrastructure decisions...|$|R

40|$|A {{strand of}} the banking {{literature}} studies switching costs for borrowers {{as a source of}} market power for banks. This paper <b>embodies</b> switching <b>costs</b> à la Klemperer (1995) and customer relationships that allow banks to price discriminate between old and new customers into a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model. These costs generate a customer “lock-in ” effect and rents for banks. Modelling the banking sector in this way allows us to obtain countercyclical pricecost margins in line with the empirical evidence in Aliaga-Díaz and Olivero (2005), Mandelman (2005) and Chen, Higgins and Mason (2005). The reason is that with the customer “lock-in ” effect, when lowering the interest rate on their lending banks face a trade-off between lower current profits and gaining bigger future market share. An increase in the level of economic activity increases the importance of future market share relative to that of current profits and induces banks to offer lower interest rates on their lending to attract new customers that will be “locked-in ” in the future...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate {{about whether or not}} inflation targeting is compatible with Post Keynesian economics. It does so by developing a model that takes into account the potentially inflationary consequences of interest rate manipulations. Evaluations of the macroeconomic implications of this so-called cost channel of monetary policy are common in the mainstream literature. But this literature uses supply-determined macro models and provides standard optimizing microfoundations for the various ways in which the interest rate can affect mark-ups, prices and ultimately the form of the Phillips curve. Our purpose is to study the implications of different Phillips curves, each <b>embodying</b> the <b>cost</b> channel and derived from Post Keynesian, cost-based-pricing microfoundations, in a monetary-production economy. We focus on the impact of these Phillips curves on macroeconomic stability and the consequent efficacy of inflation and output targeting. Ultimately, our results suggest that the presence of the cost channel is of less significance than the general orientation of the policy regime, and corroborate earlier finding that, in a monetary-production economy, more orthodox policy regimes are inimical to macro stabilization.

First, a review of existing studies about energy life cycle assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprint of PV systems has been carried out in this paper. Then, a new method to evaluate the Real Energy Payback Time (REPBT), which includes power looses due to PV panels degradation is proposed and di erences with traditional Energy Payback Time are analysed.

In national economic and sustainability accounting it can be calculated as units of resource expended per unit of GDP.

Relatively high resource intensities indicate a high price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP; low resource intensity indicates a lower price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP.|$|R
40|$|Colombia's {{unemployment}} rate rose to 20 % {{during the late}} 1990 s from less than 8 % in 1994. This paper argues {{that this has been}} the result of high non-wage labor <b>costs</b> <b>embodied</b> in the legislation. The estimated own-wage labor demand elasticity is around 0. 5, which implies that a reduction in those costs, while politically costly, can have a significant payoff in terms of equity and efficiency. We also find that adjustment costs of changing employment as well as wage elasticities were not affected by changes in the regulations regarding severance payments and dismissal costs. In this sense, structural reforms did have an impact on labor demand through its effect on relative prices alone. Finally, we conclude that the wage elasticity of labor demand increases (in absolute terms) during contractions. Hence, the increase in prices and the beginning of a recession had a significant effect on employment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{sum of all}} energy {{embedded}} in products and processes used in constructing a building is known as embodied energy. According to the literature, {{the current state of}} embodied energy research suffers from three major issues. First, there is little agreement on the definition of embodied energy. Second, the existing embodied energy data suffers from variation and are regarded as incomplete and not specific to a product under study. Third, there are various methods for calculating embodied energy with varying levels of completeness and accuracy. According to the literature, the input-output-based hybrid method is the most appropriate method but it needs further improvements. Some of the studies also found a positive and strong correlation between the <b>cost</b> and <b>embodied</b> energy of a building but this correlation needs to be analyzed at a building material or product level. This research addressed the three issues identified by the literature. First, using a rigorous literature survey, it proposed an embodied energy definition, a complete system boundary model, and a set of data collection, embodied energy calculation, and result reporting guidelines. The main goal of proposing the guidelines was to streamline the process of embodied energy calculation to reduce variations in embodied energy data. Second, three improvements were carried out in the current input-output-based hybrid approach, which included process energy data inclusion, human and capital energy integration, and sectorial disaggregation to calculate material-specific embodied energy. Finally, the correlation between the <b>embodied</b> energy and <b>cost</b> and price was analyzed at a material level. The study concluded that an input-output-based hybrid method was the most appropriate method for calculating the embodied energy of a building material in a complete manner. Furthermore, incompleteness in the results of a process-based method was significant (3. 3 to 52 % of the total). The energy of human labor and capital inputs was up to 15 % of the total embodied energy. It was also found that the sectorial disaggregation could provide results specific to a material under study. The results of this study indicated a strong and positive correlation between the <b>embodied</b> energy and <b>cost</b> (and price) of building materials under study...|$|R

Reducing the number of purchases that people regret could be a first step in changing the overall dynamic of consumption patterns. This research looks at some potentially adverse effects of consumption on well-being (e. g. negative emotions), applying social practice theory to give insights into why people make purchases that they feel negatively about. This paper draws from: (i) findings of a national survey of over 2000 respondents which found that 53 % of adults had reported regretting purchasing an electrical device at some point, and that 23 % regretted making such a purchase within the past year; and (ii) a series of walking interviews around people's homes that provide detailed insights into the nature and extent of regretted purchases of electrical goods (e. g. resentment at built-in obsolescence, frustration at the pace of technological change). By combining the qualitative and quantitative data, we develop a typology of regretted consumption and explore the underlying factors that lead to such purchases.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 A {{proposed}} copper mine in Arizona has {{the potential}} to be the largest copper producing mine in North America. It is expected to produce over a billion pounds of copper per year, and individually produce more than half of the United State's demand for copper. The operation claims to be more sustainable than previous operations by being more efficient with their use of water, energy and material resources. An embodied energy, or EMERGY analysis, was used to evaluate the sustainability of the proposed copper mining operation. The post-mining externalized annual energy cost of copper waste management for previous operations had an EMERGY value of 1. 50 E+ 22 solar emjoules per year (sej/yr); the proposed mine plans to internalize the cost of waste management during operation by containing and reusing waste, resulting in an estimated annual EMERGY cost of 6. 00 E+ 18 sej/yr. These results indicate that the proposed method of waste management will potentially be more sustainable than past mining operations in terms of <b>embodied</b> energy <b>cost</b> savings. A 1992 copper mine required 7. 35 E+ 23 sej/yr for annual energy resource investment; the proposed mine is estimated to require 5. 85 E+ 20 sej/yr. These results indicated that the proposed mine will use energy resources more efficiently than old copper mining operations. However, these results do not account for the impacts of subsidence on water and land resources, nor do they account for other potential impacts of deep mining extraction that may occur as a result of the proposed mining operation. Further analysis will be necessary to evaluate these impacts...|$|R

While low-energy housing has been extensively studied by the US Green Building Council and others, research tends to focus upon technologies used in the construction of homes, rather than the full optimization of site and building relationships. In order to explore optimal site-structure relationships for low-energy housing and introduce early design students to fundamental case study practices, three faculty members led a total of forty-four students in a study of three sites. The resulting case study sites include homes ranging in building cost from $ 150, 00 -$ 600, 000 and employing a variety of both passive and active energy saving techniques. The case studies can be characterized as: a high-design urban lot home, a rural "earthship" home, and a suburban LEED platinum-certified retirement home. This interdisciplinary research effort included forty-one undergraduate students and three graduate students, all of whom were just beginning the interior architecture and product design program or the landscape architecture program at Kansas State University. The case study pedagogy employed experiential learning during site visits and in the context of teamwork between the two disciples. Students and professors visited the three low‐energy homes on a one day field trip in Kansas and Missouri.

30|$|The {{corresponding}} {{relationship between}} consumers’ total real expenditure structure and retailers’ profit structure <b>embodies</b> a basic <b>cost</b> transfer {{in the above}} equilibrium. Many scholars have conducted similar studies, such as the pioneering research conducted by Salop and Stiglitz (1977), which says that an insufficiency of information leads to higher or lower search costs for consumers, which causes the formation of different equilibrium prices. Another example is Oi (1992) who construct the model of choice of location and store from retailers’ point of view. He finds that in a situation with the same full price and competition of stores, consumer heterogeneity in locations and other purchase costs may be {{the main source of}} the diversity of merchandise categories. He also speculates that there may be an equilibrium solution. This paper makes clear that consumer heterogeneity is an important reason for the diversity of retail formats and multiple equilibrium and different prices, locations and diversity of merchandise categories in different retail formats are all equilibrium characteristics. Consumer preference heterogeneity and distribution, retailers’ differentiated cost transfer and its spillover effect of scale (economies of scale and scope) are the endogenous drivers that promote the prosperous development of diversified retail formats.|$|R
40|$|Rapid urbanization, {{especially}} in developing countries, {{means that the}} worldwide tradition of living in low-rise housing is giving way to life in urban apartments. This implies huge environmental and sociocultural changes. For sustainability, dense cities offer some advantages, including efficient land use and transport systems.

The interest of our approach is four-fold. Firstly, we extend the core of light field approaches using an explicit BRDF model from the Image Synthesis community which is more realistic than the Lambertian model. The chosen model is the Cook-Torrance BRDF which enables us to model rough surfaces with specular effects using specific material parameters. Secondly, we extend light field approaches for non-pinhole sensors and non-rectilinear motion by using a proper geometric transformation on the image sequence. Thirdly, we produce a 3 D volume <b>cost</b> <b>embodying</b> all the tested possible heights and filter it using simple methods such as Volume Cost Filtering or variational optimal methods. We have tested our method on a Pleiades image sequence on various locations with dense urban buildings and report encouraging results with respect to classic multi-label methods such as MIC-MAC, or more recent pipelines such as S 2 P.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to develop tools for {{evaluating}} the potential sustainability and security of renewable energy systems in the UK, with a long-term view of maximising the potential renewable energy penetration of wind and solar by deployment of electrical energy storage. Using computer modelled renewable energy systems, a number of system variables are considered such as system size, energy sources (solar and/or wind), type of demand load, and capacity and type of storage technology. The results allow for a broad comparison {{of different types of}} renewable energy systems, and their optimisation. The optimisation methodology is also critically evaluated with consideration of its robustness and applicability, using two alternative metrics to measure system energy security and two different measurements of energy return on investment (EROI) to measure sustainability. When comparing renewable energy systems, results found that large systems that predominately got their power from wind sources were the most sustainable and secure, using optimisation methods that penalised both their overproduction and underproduction. Nearly all systems benefit from the use of electrical energy storage, without impacting too much on sustainability levels, but larger wind systems used less storage, suffering lower energy security as a result. System performance can best be improved by developing solar power technologies with lower <b>embodied</b> energy <b>costs,</b> followed by a reduction in embodied energy of storage technology. The former will enable more effective use of storage methods, while the latter allows for larger storage capacities with less environmental impact. Sustainability and energy security were given equal priority in the optimisation, however it was found that more sustainable generation technologies were preferable to more secure technologies, as there is more scope to improve energy return on investment than security. Therefore there is a limit, generally around 45 - 85 % (depending on size of system and choice of technology) to the proportion of time that renewable energy systems using variable energy sources can be autonomous, meaning that energy backup from the grid and/or dispatchable sources is still required...|$|R

Physical scientists have long proposed alternative but testable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross correlation between energy consumption and economic output at the national level through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of precise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive evidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual commodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has accumulated a huge body of price data, which {{for the first time ever}} provides us the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value correlation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical elements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining them from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear correlation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying physics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such as the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic valuation. It demonstrates how energy cost serves as the "invisible hand" governing economic valuation. Thorough understanding of this energy connection between the human economic and the Earth's biogeochemical metabolism is essential for improving the overall energy efficiency and furthermore the sustainability of the human society.

Fundamentally at {{the root}} of {{financing}} is the core principle that investors expect compensation for the risk taken, since investing in equity <b>embodies</b> an opportunity <b>cost.</b> The Platinum Sector of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is notorious for its volatility, but seems to be very attractive to the investor due to increasing demand for platinum. The JSE is also an emerging market, with potentially stronger growth potential. The aim of the study is to develop a selection framework based on a limited number of key identified indicators, to incrementally reduce the risk of selecting poor performing assets/shares from the Platinum Sector, with anticipated higher rates of return. Eight variables were selected to develop a regression model, but only two variables, namely: Margin of Safety and Intrinsic Value were incorporated in the final regression model. Only four of the twenty years studied revealed a 10 % level of significance. It was therefore concluded that no overall reliable selection framework could be developed for the Platinum Sector of the JSE. Individual companies were therefore tested against the regression model, with periods of good fit, but no persistent fit. Aquarius Platinum was the single company to demonstrate a reliable overall fit. Stand–alone risk of each company was hence evaluated against the average Johannesburg Stock Exchange All Share Index. By using the Security Market Line, investment potential in individual companies was identified. Master...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} for supporting decision making in design activities; in case of new projects or retrofitting of existing buildings. A multidisciplinary approach is adopted; involving Real Estate Appraisal and Economic Evaluation of Project and Building Environmental Design. It is proposed a methodology for selecting the preferable solutions among technological options; considering both economic and environmental aspects; in terms of global performance. Assuming the principles of Life Cycle Thinking and Circular Economy focus is posed at the end‐of‐life stage. Attention is paid on disposal costs and residual value as relevant items enable to orient investment decisions. This is done through an approach for quantifying environmental indicators related to Life Cycle Assessment (Standard ISO 14040 : 2006); and economic indicators adopting the Life Cycle Costing (Standard ISO 15686 : 2008). The paper proposes a conjoint "economic‐environmental indicator". An application of Global Cost calculation is illustrated; including monetized environmental impacts (Embodied energy and <b>Embodied</b> carbon); disposal/dismantling <b>costs</b> and residual value. The result of the Global Cost calculation is expressed through a "synthetic economic‐environmental indicator" in order to select; between two different technologies; the most viable solution for a multifunctional building glass façade project; in Northern Italy. The study demonstrates that the initial investment decisions depend on the design solutions; since the early stages; related to the whole building life cycle considering conjointly the construction‐management phases and the end‐of‐life stage...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of {{the impact on the}} environment of the diverse human activities becomes more unavoidable as the signs of the ecological damage become more evident. Here, the relative merit of several formulations for the physical <b>cost</b> of building (<b>embodied</b> energy, exergy <b>cost</b> and matter cost of materials) is analysed; it is also analysed the structure of the aggregate physical cost, including the relative evaluation of its more meaningful items. As a way of concrete examples, the energy and matter embodied into different building functions is evaluated depending on the material used (earth, steel, concrete, brick). Lastly, some conclusions about the attributes of a future, "sustainable" building are taken out. Conforme los indicios del deterioro ecol&# 243;gico se hacen m&# 225;s evidentes, la evaluaci&# 243;n del impacto sobre el ambiente de las distintas actividades humanas se vuelve m&# 225;s insoslayable. Aqu&# 237; se analiza el relativo m&# 233;rito de distintas formulaciones del coste f&# 237;sico de la construcci&# 243;n: energ&# 237;a incorporada, coste exerg&# 233;tico y coste material; tambi&# 233;n la estructura del coste f&# 237;sico agregado, incluyendo la valoraci&# 243;n relativa de sus t&# 233;rminos m&# 225;s significativos. Como ejemplos concretos, se eval&# 250;a la energ&# 237;a y la materia incorporada por distintas funciones constructivas seg&# 250;n el material empleado (tierra, acero, ladrillo, hormig&# 243;n). Finalmente, se extraen algunas conclusiones acerca de las caracter&# 237;sticas de una futura construcci&# 243;n "sostenible "...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} energy and cost {{performance}} of 30 recent buildings in Melbourne, Australia. Commonly, building design decisions are based on issues pertaining to construction cost, and consideration of energy performance is made only {{within the context of}} the initial project budget. Even where energy is elevated to more importance, operating energy is seen as the focus and embodied energy is nearly always ignored. For the first time, a large sample of buildings has been assembled and analyzed to improve the understanding of both energy and cost performance over their full life cycle. The data was obtained from capital costs provided by Davis Langdon Australia and the application of modelling tools for embodied energy, operating energy and operating costs over a 100 -year time horizon. The aim of this paper is to determine typical equivalence periods for embodied energy v operating energy, and capital cost v operating cost across a range of building functional types. Discounting is advocated as an appropriate mechanism for comparative energy studies but for different reasons than commonly employed in comparative cost studies. The conclusion is that, when discounting of energy flows at 5 % per annum is introduced, the energy equivalence period increases from 14 to 28 years, placing more emphasis on initial <b>embodied</b> energy. Mean <b>cost</b> equivalence is shown to be 2. 26 more than mean energy equivalence, although at a 5 % discount rate nearly half of the projects never reach cost equivalence (operating cost exceeding capital cost), even when measured over a 100 -year time horizon...|$|R
