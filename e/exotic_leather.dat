50|$|Though Bizarre {{was a small}} format magazine, it had a {{huge impact}} on later kink publications, such as ENEG's fetish magazine, Exotique, {{published}} 1956-1959. Exotique was entirely devoted to fetish fashions and female-dominant bondage fantasies. The 36 issues featured photos and illustrations of dominatrix-inspired vamps (including Burtman's wife Tana Louise and iconic model Bettie Page) wearing <b>exotic</b> <b>leather</b> and rubber ensembles, corsets, stockings/garters, boots, and high heels. Gene Bilbrew contributed illustrations to the magazine. The articles, many written by Leonard Burtman, using an alias, covered various aspects of sadomasochism and transvestism, with men depicted as slaves to imperious, all-powerful women. Exotique had no nudity, pornographic content, or even sexually suggestive situations. Nevertheless, much like fellow publisher Irving Klaw, in 1957, Burtman would be targeted as a pornographer. He was relentlessly pursued by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (acting as a censorship agency under the Comstock laws) and local law enforcement (who functioned in coordination with Postal Inspectors and the Catholic Church). Eventually, he was arrested, his magazines and materials confiscated, and brought to trial. This led to the demise of the magazine in 1959. However, starting in 1960, Burtman (under a different imprint) would go on to publish many more fetish magazines that were nearly identical to Exotique such as New Exotique, Masque, Connoisseur, Bizarre Life, High Heels, Unique World, Corporal (a pioneering spanking-fetish magazine) and others well into the 1970s.|$|E

This research aimed to study the effect of tanning materials (vegetable and chrome) and the type of finish (natural, aniline, semi-aniline and two tone) on morphology, organoleptic and mechanical properties of lizard skin. The materials used in this study were dry preserved lizard skins. The research varied on the types of tanning (vegetable and chrome) and the type of finish (natural, aniline, semi-aniline and two tone) each by varying the finishing materials (casein and protein binders). The tests were conducted on the observation of the structure using photomicrographs, rub fastness, adhesion of finish strength, tensile strength, elongation at break and organoleptic. The results showed that the best result was vegetable tanned lizard skin using natural finish with casein and met the requirements of SNI 06 - 4362 - 1996, lizard skin for shoe upper. This gave dry and wet rub fastness of 5 and 5 respectively; dry and wet adhesion of finish strength of 650 and 100 g/cm respectively; tensile strength of 207. 43 kg/cm 2; elongation at break of 37. 52...|$|E
50|$|I have {{considered}} the impudent accusations of Mr Dawkins with exasperation at his lack of serious scholarship.

He even laughs at the highly popular and most persuasive arguments of his fellow countryman, Lord D. T.

Confirmation of the tanning of the skins was performed by measuring the shrinkage temperature of leathers, obtaining a value of 80 °C, higher than those of the raw hides.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African female consumers' purchase intent for luxury <b>exotic</b> <b>leather</b> accessories, with specific reference to exotic crocodile leather, {{as well as}} their perceived values of luxury <b>exotic</b> <b>leather</b> products and brands. A survey was conducted across South Africa that included representation of the following ethnic groups: African, White, Coloured, Asian and Indian. All the individuals surveyed were female. Consulta Research, a consumer research company, assisted the research study in collecting data. Data was collected by means of a non-probability convenient sampling method. Consulta Research distributed an online questionnaire to female participants on their database. Three hundred and thirty seven (337) usable questionnaires were completed and returned. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, Spearman's correlation analysis and Cohen's d correlation analysis. All of the demographic and lifestyle characteristics were useful in describing the South African female consumer. The findings indicated {{that the majority of the}} respondents were not willing to spend market-related prices for genuine crocodile leather accessories. The study confirmed that luxury value perceptions may include five dimensions that are distinguished in literature, namely Social, Individual gifts, Individual pleasure, Financial, and Functional value perceptions. Functional value perceptions were found to be more important to South African respondents, although previous studies in other countries have shown that Social and Individual value perceptions are more important. According to the literature presented in the study, it was confirmed that purchasing intent is part of the decision-making process, since intention is evident in an individual's readiness to perform a given behaviour. The findings showed that South African female respondents have a weak Purchasing intent for exotic crocodile leather accessories. The study, however, also showed that in the future at some point a substantial percentage of respondents might buy (24. 00 % + 18. 60 % + 20. 70 %), have the intention to buy (23. 40 % + 17. 50 % + 21. 30 %) and have an interest to buy (23. 10 % + 17. 80 % + 18. 90 %) an exotic crocodile leather accessory. A high practical significance was also found for the correlation between Purchasing intent and Functional value perceptions. This might be an indicator of the important role that functionality would play in respondents' final decision to buy or not buy an exotic crocodile leather accessory. This has implications for industry stakeholders because Functional value perceptions, according to the study, can be described as superior quality, quality assurance, high quality standards and substantive attributes and performance factors. Therefore industry stakeholders within the luxury exotic crocodile leather industry, be it suppliers, manufacturers, breeders, farmers, retailers or marketers, should take these consumer values into consideration in order to maximise the ultimate value delivered by the supply chain. Various recommendations are made based on the findings of this study, to either expand or build onto this existing research. Topics related to luxury exotic crocodile leather accessories and luxury consumers in South Africa can definitely be explored further to fill the current gap in knowledge in this field.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Two species of tegu lizards, the black-and-white tegu (Tupinambis merianae) and the red tegu (T. rufescens), are hunted for their skins to supply the <b>exotic</b> <b>leather</b> trade. Tegu lizards were among the most exploited reptiles in the world. During the 1980 s, the annual harvest averaged 1. 9 million skins, and current quotas for Argentina and Paraguay are 1 million and 300, 000, respectively. Commercial trade in Tupinambis is legal in these countries, and management programs require monitoring the harvest. Skins are traded according to width: class 1 (> 30 cm), class 2 (> 25 - 29 cm), class 3 (< 24 cm). Management guidelines consist of the national export quota, and a ban on commerce of class 3 skins, aimed at reducing the number of subadults harvested. I studied the tegu management and monitoring program in Paraguay. I recorded snout-vent length (SVL), width, sex, and species from skins measured at check stations and in tanneries from 1991 to 1998. Comparison among field sites and tanneries allowed me to evaluate efficiency of the management guidelines and analyze harvest trends. Analyses of 8 seasons of harvest data showed a statistically significant, but slight, increase in SVL, and an increase in the proportion of males harvested for both species. The sex ratio (M: F) of harvested black-and-white tegus and red tegus varied in different years, but was generally biased toward more males. Corresponding to the general increase in skin size, the proportion of subadults in the harvest decreased during the sampling period. For black-and-white tegus, skins < 24 cm wide occurred in a higher proportion at check stations than in tanneries, presumably due to re-stretching of the skins by middlemen. Results indicate that tegu lizards are withstanding the harvest in Paraguay. There is no indication of overharvest, and no indicators of population decline. However, more field studies are needed to obtain data on hunting effort, and {{to assess the impact of}} the harvest at regional levels. Recommendations to improve the management program include the creation of a special committee involving governmental and non-governmental agencies and organizations related to the tegu trade and conservation of renewable resources...|$|E
