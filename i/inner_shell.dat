25|$|Atomic {{spectroscopy}} was {{the first}} application of spectroscopy developed. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) involve visible and ultraviolet light. These absorptions and emissions, {{often referred to as}} atomic spectral lines, are due to electronic transitions of outer shell electrons as they rise and fall from one electron orbit to another. Atoms also have distinct x-ray spectra that are attributable to the excitation of <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> electrons to excited states.|$|E

25|$|The {{probability}} of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is {{the energy of the}} incident photon. This rule is not valid close to <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (Z=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.|$|E

40|$|We {{found that}} by {{fluorination}} of double walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs), {{it is possible}} to suppress only the Raman radial breathing mode and absorption peaks from the outer (large diameter) tubes of DWNTs. In contrast, Raman signals from the <b>inner</b> <b>shells</b> showed no difference from the pristine DWNTs. The stability of the <b>inner</b> <b>shells</b> of fluorinated DWNTs was also confirmed from the photoluminescence (PL) map and the optical absorption spectra, which only showed the signals from the <b>inner</b> <b>shells</b> of DWNTs, with no distinct change in the optical properties of the inner tubes after fluorination. Our results indicate that once fluorinated, there exist only a weak, if not none, interaction between the inner tube and the outer fluorinated tube, and proved that fluorination can be used to suppress the optical properties of carbon nanotubes without interfering the properties of inner tubes. Present finding can be important in electronic and sensor applications, where keeping the inner tube from not having unwanted contact with other substances that may distract inner tube’s own characteristics.

25|$|Mausoleums {{were rarely}} built as {{free-standing}} structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, {{such as those}} of the madrasa of Goharshad (1417–1433) and the madrasa at Ḵargerd (1436–1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Goharshad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement. Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the Amir Chakhmaq mosque (1437) has a semi-circular <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> and an advanced system of stiffeners and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of Bayazid Bastami was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third conical shell over the existing two domed shells.|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an <b>inner</b> <b>shell</b> electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E
25|$|The muqarnas {{dome type}} may have {{originated}} in Abbasid Iraq as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, {{but it was}} popular in North Africa and Spain with more intricate cell patterns in stucco on a wooden <b>inner</b> <b>shell.</b> Two outstanding examples from the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, are the 14th century Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters. In 14th century Egypt, the Mamluks began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of sultans and emirs and would construct hundreds of them {{over the next two}} and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by chamfered or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, ogee, and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in spirals, zigzags, and floral designs. Bulbous minarets from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the Low Countries of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.|$|E
40|$|Context. Shells in Elliptical Galaxies are faint, {{sharp-edged}} features, {{believed to}} {{provide evidence for}} a merger event. Accurate photometry at high spatial resolution is needed to learn on presence of <b>inner</b> <b>shells,</b> population properties of shells, and dust in shell galaxies. Aims. Learn more {{about the origin of}} shells and dust in early type galaxies. Methods. V - I colours of shells and underlying galaxies are derived, using HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) data. A galaxy model is made locally in wedges and subtracted to determine shell profiles and colours. We applied Voronoi binning to our data to get smoothed colour maps of the galaxies. Comparison with N-body simulations from the literature gives more insight to the origin of the shell features. Shell positions and dust characteristics are inferred from model galaxy subtracted images. Results. The ACS images reveal shells well within the effective radius in some galaxies (at 0. 24 r(e) = 1. 7 kpc in the case of NGC 5982). In some cases, strong nuclear dust patches prevent detection of <b>inner</b> <b>shells.</b> Most shells have colours which are similar to the underlying galaxy. Some <b>inner</b> <b>shells</b> are redder than the galaxy. All six shell galaxies show out of dynamical equilibrium dust features, like lanes or patches, in their central regions. Our detection rate for dust in the shell ellipticals is greater than that found from HST archive data for a sample of normal early-type galaxies, at the 95 % confidence level. Conclusions. The merger model describes better the shell distributions and morphologies than the interaction model. Red shell colours are most likely due to the presence of dust and/or older stellar populations. The high prevalence and out of dynamical equilibrium morphologies of the central dust features point towards external influences being responsible for visible dust features in early type <b>shell</b> galaxies. <b>Inner</b> <b>shells</b> are able to manifest themselves in relatively old shell systems...|$|R

2500|$|With no remains found since May 3, the Corps of Engineers {{began to}} fear on June 16 {{that no more}} bodies would be found. In part {{this was due to}} the {{condition}} of the ship.
