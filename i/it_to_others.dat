5|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} describe {{the various types}} of coral reef, each chapter starting with a section giving {{a detailed description of the}} reef Darwin had most information about, which he presents as a typical example of the type. Subsequent sections in each chapter then describe other reefs in comparison with the typical example. In the first chapter, Darwin describes atolls and lagoon islands, taking as his typical example his own detailed findings and the Beagle survey findings on the Keeling Islands. The second chapter similarly describes a typical barrier reef then compares <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> and the third chapter gives a similar description of what Darwin called fringing or shore reefs. Having described the principal kinds of reef in detail, his finding was that the actual surface of the reef did not differ much. An atoll differs from an encircling barrier reef only in lacking the central island, and a barrier reef differs from a fringing reef only in its distance from the land and in enclosing a lagoon.|$|E

25|$|But a {{continuing}} emphasis to the well-rounded graduate {{can be seen}} in the University's approach to education degrees. As a solely graduate-level program, this is based on the principle that people need to learn primary subject matter well before they can learn how to teach <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> Thus future teachers at Lehigh often take a five-year program earning both a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and a master's degree in Education. This latter degree, along with the Business College's M.B.A., are among the most popular graduate programs in the University.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the early}} scriptures, the Nirvana {{attained}} by Arahants is identical to that attained by the Buddha himself, as {{there is only one}} type of Nirvana. Theravadins believe the Buddha was superior to Arahants because the Buddha discovered the path all by himself and taught <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> (i.e., metaphorically turning the wheel of Dhamma). Arahants, on the other hand, attained Nirvana partly because of the Buddha's teachings. Theravadins revere the Buddha as a supremely gifted person but also recognize the existence of other such Buddhas in the distant past and future. Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya), for example, is mentioned very briefly in the Pali Canon as a Buddha who will come in the distant future.|$|E

Before the Quran was {{commonly}} available in written form, speaking it from memory prevailed as the mode of teaching <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> The practice of memorizing the whole Quran is still practiced among Muslims. Millions of people have memorized the entire Quran in its original Arabic. This fact, taken {{in the context of}} 7th-century Arabia, was not an extraordinary feat. People of that time had a penchant for recited poetry and had developed their skills in memorization to a remarkable degree. Events and competitions that featured the recitation of elaborate poetry were of great interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of Ibsen's Ghost at Toole's Theatre in London {{was seen by}} William Archer, the translator of Ibsen's works into English. Apparently comfortable with the parody, he enjoyed the humour of the play and recommended <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> Barrie's third play Walker, London (1892) resulted in him being introduced to a young actress named Mary Ansell. He proposed to her and they were married on 9 July 1894. Barrie bought her a Saint Bernard puppy, who {{played a part in}} the novel The Little White Bird. He used Ansell's given name for many characters in his novels. Barrie also authored Jane Annie, a comic opera for Richard D'Oyly Carte (1893), which unfortunately failed. He begged his friend Arthur Conan Doyle to revise and finish it for him.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Harmonix {{launched}} a crowd funding campaign through the Fig platform to produce Rock Band 4 for personal computers, {{to have been}} released {{in the last quarter}} of 2016. Harmonix estimated the game would cost $2 million to make, of which they would contribute $500,000 towards if they can raise the remaining $1.5 million. The port would have been primarily handled by Sumo Digital, integrating the updates that Harmonix will continue to provide in the main game. The game would have been released via Steam, allowing users to use the Steam Workshop to create their own songs and distribute <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others,</b> with curation by Harmonix to avoid copyright infringements, in a manner comparable to the Rock Band Network but at a lower cost; they have already ported the previous Rock Band Network tools to offer to backers of the campaign. Harmonix planned to allow compatibility with all existing instrument controllers from the various PlayStation 2, 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and One platforms, and had begun working through details with Sony and Microsoft. The game would have shipped with the same 65 songs as the console version, and at least 1700 songs for downloadable content (all those currently available for Rock Band 4 on consoles), though, as with the console versions, users would have had to repurchase these songs on the PC and cannot transfer over songs they already own on either platform. The funding campaign failed to reach its goal, only obtaining about $793,000 of the $1.5M target; Harmonix has not ruled out approaching a personal computer version in the future as they are aware there is some demand for Rock Band there.|$|E

500|$|Sree Padma and Anthony Barber {{note that}} merit {{transfer}} was well-established {{and a very}} integral part of Buddhist practice in the Andhra region of southern India. In addition, inscriptions at numerous sites across South Asia provide definitive evidence that the transfer of merit was widely practiced {{in the first few}} centuries CE. In Theravāda Buddhism, it has become customary for donors to share merits during ceremonies held at intervals, and during a teaching. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, it is believed that Bodhisattvas in the heavens are capable of transferring merits, and will do so to help relief the suffering of their devotees, who then can dedicate <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others.</b> This concept has led to several Buddhist traditions focused on devotion. Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhists transfer merits as part of the 'Seven-part-worship' (...) , and there is almost no ceremony without some form of merit transfer. Thus, merit transfer has developed to become a standard element in the basic liturgy of all main schools of Buddhism. Indeed, the transfer of merits has grown that important in Buddhism, that it has become a major way for Buddhism to sustain itself. In Japan, some temples are even called ekōdera, which means a temple for merit transfer.|$|E
500|$|On 13 February 1969, Negus and {{two others}} (Sir Geoffrey Keynes and Sir Stanford Cade) were {{presented}} with the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. This award, which had only been made thirty times since 1802 prior to the 1969 ceremony, is presented for [...] "liberal acts or distinguished labours, researches and discoveries, eminently conducive to the improvement of natural knowledge and of the healing art." [...] The medal was presented by Sir Hedley Atkins, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons, who paid tribute to Negus: [...] "Sir Victor Negus {{is perhaps the most}} distinguished of all those who have served the Council as a co-opted member. He has always been known to us as a great research worker and scientist, whose labours earned him the Lister Medal, a man of exceptional integrity and industry and a persistent advocate of the value of tradition in its best sense." [...] Atkins also paid tribute to Negus's wife, Lady Negus, who had crafted and presented to the college a tapestry of its coat-of-arms. Responding, Negus thanked the members of the Council for the award and for the privilege of having used college facilities since 1921, concluding: [...] "I take this honour as a mark of approval for any work I have done, and I feel I can now sit back and leave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>others</b> to carry on. I {{would also like to thank}} you for inviting my wife to be here to-day; she has taken a great part in all I have done." ...|$|E
