5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total operating costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of operating revenues and costs (operating income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the operating loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first operating profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E

We then apply these results to extend some popular interest rate and option pricing models that present arbitrage opportunities {{in the absence of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> In particular, we prove that the quite striking result obtained by Dybvig, Ingersoll, and Ross (1996), which asserts that under the assumption of absence of arbitrage long zero-coupon rates can never fall, is no longer true in models with <b>fixed</b> <b>costs,</b> even arbitrarily small <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> For instance, models in which the long-term rate follows a diffusion process are arbitrage-free in the presence of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (including arbitrarily small <b>fixed</b> <b>costs).</b> We also rationalize models with partially absorbing or reflecting barriers on the price processes.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{a region that}} invests in infrastructure used by both local demand and through traffic. We then compare transport systems that have, for a given capacity, the same total infrastructure cost but vary {{in the proportion of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> and variable capacity costs. We show that, compared to a benchmark infrastructure which has zero <b>fixed</b> <b>costs,</b> an infrastructure which has (ceteris paribus) a higher share of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> leads to higher welfare for the regional government building it. Moreover, we find that, even for capacity characterized by very high shares of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs,</b> financing of infrastructure is generally not an important issue as long as regions are allowed to toll through traffic. Finally, we show that, compared to the benchmark technology without <b>fixed</b> <b>costs,</b> regions are more likely to make a particular transport investment if they can chose a technology with higher <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> As a corollary, projects with a higher share of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> do not necessarily require higher federal subsidies.

Typically, high-premium (high-coupon) MBSs backed by mortgages with an original loan balance no larger than $85,000 command the largest pay-ups. Even though the borrower is paying an above market yield, {{he or she is}} dissuaded from refinancing a small loan balance due to the high <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> involved.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, all maize {{harvesting}} was by manual labour, by grazing, or by {{some combination}} of those. Whether the ears were hand-picked and the stover was grazed, or the whole plant was cut, gathered, and shocked, people and livestock did all the work. Between the 1890s and the 1970s, the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly. Today, all such technologies, from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized, are still in use to some degree, as appropriate to each farm's needs, although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate, as they offer the lowest unit costs when scaled to large farm operations. For small farms, their unit cost can be too high, as their higher <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> cannot be amortized over as many units.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the legal}} {{barriers}} were overcome, American investments transformed the Cuban economy. Within {{two years of}} entering Cuba, the Cuba Company built a 350-mile railroad connecting the eastern port of Santiago to the existing railways in central Cuba. The company was the largest single foreign investment in Cuba {{for the first two}} decades of the twentieth century. By the 1910s it was the largest company in the country. The improved infrastructure allowed the sugar cane industry to spread to the previously underdeveloped eastern part of the country. As many small Cuban sugar cane producers were crippled with debt and damages from the war, American companies were able to quickly and cheaply take over the sugar cane industry. At the same time, new productive units called centrales could grind up to 2,000 tons of cane a day making large-scale operations most profitable. The large <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> of these centrales made them almost exclusively accessible to American companies with large capital stocks. Furthermore, the centrales required a large, steady flow of cane to remain profitable, which led to further consolidation in the industry. Cuban cane farmers who had formerly been landowners became tenants on company land, funneling raw cane to the centrales. By 1902, 40% of the country’s sugar production was controlled by North Americans.|$|E

2500|$|Since (by definition) <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> do {{not vary}} with {{production}} quantity, it {{drops out of}} the equation when it is differentiated. [...] The important conclusion is that marginal cost is not related to <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> This can be compared with average total cost or ATC, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced and does include <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Marginal {{costs are}} not {{affected}} by changes in <b>fixed</b> <b>cost.</b> Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently the profit maximizing quantity and price would not change. [...] This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short run variable cost curve. The shape of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance {{of the origin of}} the SRTC above the origin represents the <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.|$|E

The fixture or adapter is a significant <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production flying probe testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system instructs the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.|$|E

2500|$|Tim Hortons {{switch to}} a parbaking system has {{disappointed}} some die-hard customers, who note that this contradicts the chain's [...] "always fresh" [...] slogan. David Swick reported in the Halifax Daily News on September 19, 2003 Tim Hortons outlets in Atlantic Canada would no longer serve fresh donuts, but rather donuts that had been remotely factory-fried and then frozen and shipped. In 2008, two franchisees initiated a class-action lawsuit against the parent company for the switch to parbaking, [...] "claiming breach of contract, breach of duty of fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment". The lawsuit cited that parbaking tripled the franchisee's <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> to produce a doughnut (from 6 cents per doughnut to 18 cents), required the purchase of new freezers and microwaves, and reduced profitability for the franchises while increasing profits for the parent company. Franchise owners are required to purchase food products from the Brantford-based parbaking company owned by IAWS Group PLC, and had originally been told the price of each doughnut would be 11 or 12 cents (and each Timbit 4.6 cents). The case was dismissed in February 2012.|$|E
