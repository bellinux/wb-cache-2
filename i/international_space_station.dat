5|$|During the Shuttle-Mir programme, {{a series}} of American Space Shuttle {{missions}} visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 {{in preparation for the}} construction of the <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Station.</b> After the construction of the <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Station</b> began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Present study {{focuses on}} the {{fascinating}} concept of Space Elevators. Object {{of this study is}} to get introduced with every aspect in Designing, Working & Construction of Space Elevators. It‟s a concept in which tether is used to uplift any type of cargo or personnel from Earth surface to an orbit in space. Such invention not only becomes the new path for heavy loads to get into space but also becomes a cheap one. Also from the top of it, loads can be launch in any desired direction. By this not only the cost of the launch through rocket gets reduced but also the personnel handling this launch i. e. reduction of human error too. Perfect suitable material for such operation is Carbon Nano-tube which hundred times stronger and ten times lighter then Steel. In coming 50 years, it might be possible that many space elevators are ready to launch the spacecraft in space. Its application is not just only limited to the launching but also it can help in carrying heavy payloads to <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Stations.</b> It simply can give access to space for scientific, commercial & military purposes...|$|R
40|$|The JAXA {{spacecraft}} “KOUNOTORI- 6 ” {{was launched}} on December 9 th, 2016 {{on a mission}} to resupply the <b>International</b> <b>Spaces</b> <b>Station.</b> It carried the TuPOD system developed by Tetonsys, Gauss, Moorehead State, Open Space Networks and CRP USA. This unique Small Satellite was designed as both a CubeSat and as a dispensing system for two Tube Satellites.

5|$|STS-125 was {{the only}} planned shuttle mission after the Columbia {{accident}} to be launched into a low-inclination orbit that did not allow rendezvous with the <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Station.</b> Due to the inclination and other orbit parameters of Hubble, Atlantis would {{have been unable to}} use the <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Station</b> as a safe haven in the event of structural or mechanical failure. To preserve NASA's post-Columbia requirement of having shuttle Launch On Need (LON) rescue capability, STS-400 was the flight designation given to the Contingency Shuttle Crew Support (CSCS) mission which would have been flown by Endeavour in the event Atlantis became disabled during STS-125. After Atlantis performed the late inspection and was cleared for re-entry, Endeavour was officially released from stand-by status on Thursday, 21 May.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{action in}} California in the U. S. A. vividly {{illustrates}} {{that lack of}} appreciation by civil actors of the economics of energy companies. This study seeks to act as future roadmap for legal actors to obtain clarity on economic issues affecting a potential future energy source, namely Space Solar Power (SSP). Currently envisioned systems SSP systems would deliver gigawatts of power to terrestrial power grids from space, lasting over 20 years and having orbital masses {{on the order of}} 40 <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Stations.</b> The interaction of legal challenges and economic justifications is examined for any group of public and private entities (fully domestic commercial ventures, international conglomerates, international civil organizations, etc) that seek to build and/or operate an SSP system. In April of 2000, the Ministry of Economics and Industry (MITI) of Japan and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States started a joint feasibility study on Space Solar Power. Due to the current climate of limited public funding for such large-scale space projects, governments would prefer more industry involvement (technically and more important financially) in SSP. Conceptual case studies are developed of innovative future government and private sector partnerships for SSP. Sensitivities are performed on proposed legal and economic architectures...|$|R
40|$|In August 2006, NASA awarded Space Act Agreements (SAAs) for Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) {{under the}} Commercial Crew and Cargo Project Office at Johnson Space Center. One {{of the goals}} of the SAAs is to {{facilitate}} U. S. private industry demonstration of cargo transportation capabilities, ultimately achieving reliable, cost effective access to low-Earth orbit (LEO). Each COTS provider is required to complete <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Stations</b> (ISS) Integration activities, which includes meeting the physical and functional interfaces and interface requirements between the ISS and COTS vehicles. These requirements focus on the areas of risk to the ISS during rendezvous and proximity operations, as well as the integration operations while the COTS vehicle is berthed to the ISS. On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) contracts to provide resupply services to the ISS, following the Shuttle retirement. In addition to performing any ISS Integration activities, NASA will be performing independent assessments of the launch vehicle and orbital vehicle to evaluate the readiness of the contractor to deliver NASA cargo safely to the ISS.

40|$|The Space Exploration Division of the Safety and Mission Assurances Directorate is {{responsible}} for reducing the risk to Human Space Flight Programs by providing system safety, reliability, and risk analysis. The Risk & Reliability Analysis branch plays a part in this by utilizing Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) and Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) tools to identify possible types of failure and effective solutions. A continuous effort of this branch is MaRS, or Mass and Reliability System, a tool that {{was the focus of}} this internship. Future long duration space missions will have to find a balance between the mass and reliability of their spare parts. They will be unable take spares of everything and will have to determine what is most likely to require maintenance and spares. Currently there is no database that combines mass and reliability data of low level space-grade components. MaRS aims to be the first database to do this. The data in MaRS will be based on the hardware flown on the <b>International</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Stations</b> (ISS). The components on the ISS have a long history and are well documented, making them the perfect source. Currently, MaRS is a functioning excel workbook database; the backend is complete and only requires optimization. MaRS has been populated with all the assemblies and their components that are used on the ISS; the failures of these components are updated regularly. This project was a continuation on the efforts of previous intern groups. Once complete, R&M engineers working on future space flight missions will be able to quickly access failure and mass data on assemblies and components, allowing them to make important decisions and tradeoffs...|$|R
40|$|Progress and avenues being {{explored}} by NASA to hasten {{the commercialization of}} space are described. A task force has recommended that the effort begin at once, that bureaucratic barriers to commercial space activities be removed, and that a partnership between government and industry be seriously explored.

The government/industry relationship can be legally evinced by MOUs, joint endeavor agreements, technical exchange agreements and industrial guest investigator arrangements.
