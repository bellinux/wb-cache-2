5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by the Taliban {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the Sharia. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. The Taliban also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy <b>growing</b> <b>area</b> and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E

30|$|Fecal {{pollution}} {{can also}} deteriorate the aquatic environment for producing, harvesting, and consuming shellfish. To control {{and improve the}} water quality, proper management and remediation plans require good methods. Fecal coliforms (FCs) including Escherichia coli (E. coli) are used as indicators {{of the quality of}} shellfish and to classify the <b>growing</b> <b>areas</b> from which shellfish are harvested (Hunt 1977). Fecal contamination can be hazardous to humans, and therefore the levels of FCs in bivalves or their <b>growing</b> <b>areas</b> must be monitored regularly to determine whether shellfish are safe for consumption. To protect public health, the authorities in various countries, such as Korea, the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and New Zealand, have established regulatory limits and monitoring programs using the FC levels of bivalves or their <b>growing</b> <b>areas</b> (European Commission (EC) 2005; New Zealand Food Safety Authority (NZFSA) 2006; US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 2013; Korea Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (KMFDS) 2015; Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries (MOF) 2015). The impact of inland pollution sources on the bacteriological water quality of shellfish <b>growing</b> <b>areas</b> must also be estimated regularly to identify fecal pollution sources and evaluate the <b>growing</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
