5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized in August 1944 to {{concentrate}} on creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Studying implosion on a large scale, or even a full scale, required special diagnostic methods. As early as November 1943, Kerst suggested using a betatron employing 20 MeV gamma rays instead of x-rays to study implosion. In the August 1944 reorganization, he became <b>joint</b> <b>head,</b> with Seth Neddermeyer, of the G-5 Group, part of Robert Bacher's G (Gadget) Division specifically charged with betatron testing. Oppenheimer had the 20 MeV betatron at the University of Illinois shipped to Los Alamos, where it arrived in December. On January 15, 1945, the G-5 Group took their first betatron pictures of an implosion.|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{felt that}} the key to a {{successful}} police drama was its ability to reflect the society [...] "in which it existed". Answers about what best reflected the society that people lived came from <b>joint</b> <b>head</b> of Kudos, Jane Featherstone, who stated that HolbyBlue would be the first British police drama to be created since the September 11 attacks. As a result, Jordan created a drama in which his characters would be forced to deal with limited resources and bureaucracy stemming from the war on terror, whilst trying to combat domestic crime. Jordan decided to imitate two American police dramas: Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue, using [...] "flawed characters, who still managed to be heroes", while also aiming to [...] "accurately reflect society".|$|E

2500|$|Since 2007, the UCU {{has been}} {{controversially}} {{involved in the}} academic boycotts of Israel and for rejecting the previously accepted definition of [...] "anti-Semitism". Some Jewish members resigned following claims of an underlying institutional anti-Semitism. In 2010, the UCU passed a boycott motion that invoked a [...] "call from the Palestinian Boycott National Committee" [...] for [...] "an isolation of Israel while it continues to act in breach of international law" [...] and calls to [...] "campaign actively" [...] against Israel's trade agreement with the European Union. Susan Fuhrman, President of Teachers College, Columbia University said: [...] "As the president of an academic institution dedicated {{in large part to}} the preparation of teachers, I believe that universities and all centers of learning must be allowed to function as safe havens for freedom of discussion, debate and intellectual inquiry, standing apart from national and international politics and partisan strife. Only thus can they continue to produce scholarship that informs the policies and laws of democratic societies and stand as islands of hope in a frequently polarized world.... Teachers College welcomes dialogue with Israeli scholars and universities and stands with Columbia University President Lee Bollinger in expressing solidarity with them by inviting UCU to boycott us, as well." [...] Jeremy Newmark of the Jewish Leadership Council and <b>joint</b> <b>head</b> of Stop the Boycott, sharply criticized the boycott proposal, stating that: [...] "Whether you are a trade unionist wanting a powerful union or whether you are a long-standing campaigner for peace, it is clear that the UCU has taken leave of its senses." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{suitable}} planting {{pattern and}} irrigation strategy {{are essential for}} optimizing winter wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE). The study aimed to evaluate the impact of planting pattern and irrigation frequency on grain yield and WUE of winter wheat. During the 2013 - 2014 and 2014 - 2015 winter wheat growing seasons in the North China Plain, the effects of planting patterns and irrigation frequencies were determined on tiller number, grain yield, and WUE. The two planting patterns tested were wide-precision and conventional-cultivation. Each planting pattern had three irrigation regimes: irrigation (120 mm) at the jointing stage; irrigation (60 mm) at both the <b>jointing</b> and <b>heading</b> stages; and irrigation (40 mm) at the <b>jointing,</b> <b>heading,</b> and milking stages. In our study, tiller number was significantly higher in the wide-precision planting pattern than in the conventional-cultivation planting pattern. Additionally, the highest grain yields and WUE were observed when irrigation was applied at the jointing stage (120 mm) or at the <b>jointing</b> and <b>heading</b> stages (60 mm each) in the wide-precision planting pattern. These results {{could be attributed to}} higher tiller numbers as well as reduced water consumption due to reduced irrigation frequency. In both growing seasons, applying 60 mm of water at <b>jointing</b> and <b>heading</b> stages resulted in the highest grain yield among the treatments. Based on our results, for winter wheat production in semi-humid regions, we recommend a wide-precision planting pattern with irrigation (60 mm) at both the <b>jointing</b> and <b>heading</b> stages...|$|R
