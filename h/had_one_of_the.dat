5|$|A major {{producer}} of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. In 2007, it <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fastest-growing {{economies in the}} United States, ranking among the top states in per capita income growth and gross domestic product growth. Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.|$|E

5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. The city was overcrowded, and the Victorian terraces were unsuitable for modern inhabitation. Leeds <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most Labour orientated councils and in the 1930s pledged to replace 30,000 slums.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Frederick <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E

5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in this war was encouraging in that it had won but also cautionary in that the enemy <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 {{miles from the nearest}} American harbor.

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the Swahili Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was similar in size to Gedi. However, compared to sites similar in size, Gedi <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more densely populated urban centers.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{successful}} seasons {{in franchise history}} in 1990, the season had a difficult beginning as Taylor held out of training camp, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks reached September with no progress. As the season approached Taylor received $2,500 dollars a day in fines for not reporting. Taylor signed a contract just {{four days before the}} season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite barely practicing since the previous season, he started and finished with three sacks and a forced fumble.|$|E
5|$|Australians {{took part}} in all of Bomber Command's major offensives and {{suffered}} heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France. The Australian contribution to major raids was often substantial, and the Australian squadrons typically provided about 10percent of the main bomber force {{during the winter of}} 1943–44, including during the Battle of Berlin. Overall, the Australian squadrons in Bomber Command dropped 6percent of the total weight of bombs dropped by the command during the war. Australian aircrew in Bomber Command <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during World WarII. Although only two percent of Australians enlisted in the military served with Bomber Command, they incurred almost 20percent of all Australian deaths in combat; 3,486were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Bristol {{was founded}} by 1000; by about 1020, it was a trading centre with a mint {{producing}} silver pennies bearing its name. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, and that year the townsmen beat off a raiding party from Ireland led by three of Harold Godwinson's sons. Under Norman rule, the town <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strongest castles in southern England. Bristol was the place of exile for Diarmait Mac Murchada, the Irish king of Leinster, after being overthrown. The Bristol merchants subsequently played {{a prominent role in}} funding Richard Strongbow de Clare and the Norman invasion of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, Real Madrid {{had lost its}} grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of {{home-grown}} stars brought domestic success back to the club. Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which {{was derived from the}} nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manuel Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy. With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best teams in Spain and Europe {{during the second half of}} the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish cup and three Spanish Super Cups. In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E
5|$|Critics like Edwin Cameron accused Mandela's {{government}} of doing little {{to stem the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of South Africa's population were HIV positive. Mandela later {{admitted that he had}} personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in South Africa, and that he had instead left the issue for Mbeki to deal with. Mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; South Africa <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. Mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed {{to deal with the problem}} of corruption.|$|E

In 2009, crime continued {{to fall in}} the city of Dayton. Crime in the categories of forcible rape, aggravated assault, property crime, motor vehicle theft, robbery, burglary, theft and arson all showed declines for 2009. Overall, crime in Dayton dropped 40% over the previous year. The Dayton Police Department reported a total of 39 murders in 2016, which marked a 39.3% increase in homicides from 2015.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} {{from the back of}} the grid due to a number of {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|Following Mikan's {{retirement}} in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but {{still managed to}} win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals. Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year. Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season. Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games. They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.|$|E
