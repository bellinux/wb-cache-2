40|$|In {{the last}} few decades, droplet {{microfluidics}} has been developed as a new area of microfluidics, where samples are compartmentalised in another immiscible phase. With these micro-droplets, Taylor dispersion can be minimised between samples and thorough mixing is easy and fast within the droplets themselves. Moreover, the sample consumptions are comparatively low as the samples are limited within nano-litre, pico-litre or even smaller droplets. Due to these attractive features, droplet microfluidics has been widely used as a platform to study various phenomena in chemistry, biology and physics. Droplets are normally generated in a T-junction or flow-focusing with syringe pumps or other pressure sources. An alternative way to generate droplets is to sequentially aspirate aqueous samples and carrier oil under negative pressures. Both of the typical T-junction methods and the current aspiration methods, have limitations in freely introducing/collecting <b>samples</b> into designed <b>droplets,</b> such as continuous sampling where introduction of samples {{does not affect the}} droplet generation, and in-situ sampling where samples from environment can be directly introduced into droplets. This ‘sample in’ problem is still a challenge in droplet microfluidics. This thesis addresses the two <b>droplets</b> <b>sampling</b> issues in <b>droplet</b> microfluidics: continuous <b>droplet</b> <b>sampling,</b> and in-situ <b>droplet</b> <b>sampling.</b> To solve the first issue, a novel microfluidic platform was engineered which includes aspiration droplet generators, a peristaltic pumping system and a feedback system which is used to synchronise droplet generation with pulsations of flowrates from the peristaltic pump. The demonstration of this platform successfully shows the capability of continuously generating and pumping droplets. To solve the second issue, a micro peristaltic pump was engineered to realise a robust droplet generation method and a direct sample introduction from ‘out-world’ to chip. The results show that this device is capable of generating droplets in-situ...|$|R
40|$|Photoconvertible {{fluorescent}} proteins (pc-FPs) are a {{class of}} fluorescent proteins with "optical highlighter " capability, meaning that the color of fluorescence can be changed by exposure to light of a specific wavelength. Optical highlighting allows noninvasive marking of a subpopulation of fluorescent molecules, and is therefore ideal for tracking single cells or organelles. Critical parameters for efficient photoconversion are the intensity and the exposure time of the photoconversion light. If the intensity is too low, photoconversion will be slow or not occur at all. On the other hand, too much intensity or too long exposure can photobleach the protein and thereby reduce the efficiency of photoconversion. This protocol describes a general approach {{how to set up}} a confocal laser scanning microscope for pc-FP photoconversion applications.

The {{quality and}} {{properties}} of steels {{may be affected}} due to the segregation of the alloying elements, even though the properties of steels can be improved by adding appropriate amount of alloying elements. Rapid solidification was regarded {{to be an effective}} method to reduce or eliminate the segregation of alloying elements. While the segregation of C, P and Mn was also observed in rapid solidified (in silicone oil) droplet carbon steels in this paper. The microstructures of rapid solidified droplets were rather fine. When the P content was less than about 0. 09 % (in mass) in low carbon steels, P did not show obvious segregation in rapid solidified droplet samples; when the P content raised up to about 0. 5 % in the samples, both P and Mn showed center segregation even though the content of Mn kept unchanged. So the alloying elements can segregate and even effect the distribution of other elements in rapid solidified steel samples. When the C content increased, the segregation of C was observed in high-C samples, while the segregation tendency is opposite to that of P in high-P samples. For all the <b>droplet</b> <b>samples,</b> the micro-hardness of high-P samples was also much higher than those samples with less P content...|$|R
