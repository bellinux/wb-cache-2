5|$|In 2011, Rainie {{returns to}} Tanya's house as their mother, Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), is visiting. Rainie {{says she is}} now {{completely}} clean and is staying with Cora because her counsellor wants her to reconnect with her family. When Tanya and Greg Jessop (Stefan Booth) go on their honeymoon, Rainie looks after their house and meets Phil at R. They talk about their past but he tells her {{that he does not}} want to associate with her and leaves. She and Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) then get drunk together and later go to his flat and have sex. Jack rejects Rainie the following morning. Tanya and Greg return and see <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> Rainie has caused. She also causes trouble with Shirley so Tanya asks her to leave but Rainie persuades Tanya to let her stay, much to Greg's disappointment. Rainie visits Jack's wife Ronnie Branning (Samantha Womack) to find the knickers she supposedly left behind and taunts Ronnie, asking her to tell Jack to phone her, leading to her being kicked out again. She joins a support group to help her stay off drugs and alcohol which Phil also attends. Rainie struggles and calls her drug dealer but Phil catches Rainie with drugs and takes them from her, destroying them. She gets drunk and goes to Tanya's salon, where Tanya takes her home. Greg throws her out after Tanya lies that Rainie tried to stab her. A few days later, Phil finds Rainie in the pub and Shirley catches them talking and wrongly assumes they are romantically involved but finds out that Phil has been sponsoring Rainie. Shirley almost gives Rainie a job in the café but changes her mind.|$|E

Zoey's mother, a captive-bred {{orangutan}} named Lucky, didn't know how to care for her new baby, having never seen it done in the wild. As a result, little Zoey had to be placed in the care of Mrs. Miles, a primatologist at the zoo, and the only character with the time and patience to be Zoey's foster parent. Molly tries her hardest {{to get used to the}} new family member, even making Zoey her current-events project for school, but after having her homework destroyed and her mother's time taken up by the baby orangutan she gives up and begins desperately wanting things to be normal again. After Zoey ingests a bottle of shampoo and has to be rushed to the hospital, Molly learns what it truly means to be a big sister and to care about Zoey, no matter <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> she causes.|$|E
500|$|As September {{passed into}} October {{it became clear}} that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne, who put the army on short rations on October 3. The next day, Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed, but no {{conclusive}} decisions were made. When the council resumed the next day, Riedesel proposed retreat, in which he was supported by Fraser. Burgoyne refused to consider it, insisting that retreat would be disgraceful. They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men, {{more than one-third of the}} army, on October 7. [...] The army he was attacking, however, had grown in the interval. [...] In addition to the return of Lincoln's detachment, militiamen and supplies continued to pour into the American camp, including critical increases in ammunition, which had been severely depleted in the first battle. The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12,000 men strong and was led by a man who knew <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> Burgoyne was in. Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines and had also intercepted Clinton's response to Burgoyne's plea for help.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, on most simple test {{questions}} such as [...] "Who is the girl pulling?" [...] or [...] "What is the red box on?" [...] Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to ask an interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful. Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no deixis or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year people stopped asking her to produce these questions.|$|E
2500|$|The first Harmonists left Pennsylvania in June 1814 and {{traveled}} by flatboat {{to their new}} land in the Indiana Territory. In May 1815 {{the last of the}} Harmonists who had remained behind until the sale of their town in Pennsylvania was completed departed for their new town along the Wabash River. Frederick Reichert Rapp, George Rapp's adopted son, drew up the town plan for their new village at Harmony, Indiana, which surveyors laid out on August 8, 1814. By 1816, the same year that Indiana became a state, the Harmonists had acquired [...] of land, built 160 homes and other buildings, and cleared [...] for their new town. The settlement also began to attract new arrivals, including emigrants from Germany such as members of Rapp's congregation from Wurttemberg, many of whom expected the Harmonists to pay for their passage to America. However, the new arrivals [...] "were more of a liability than an asset". On March 20, 1819, Rapp commented, [...] "It is astonishing <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> the people who have arrived here have made, for they have no morals and do not {{know what it means to}} live a moral and well-mannered life, not to speak of true Christianity, of denying the world or yourself." ...|$|E

Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production.

If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>trouble</b> any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. So I take what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there.

2500|$|Georgescu's {{legacy and}} {{influence}} as an essayist {{and author of}} fiction remained marginal in Romania's post-communist transition, a fact which caused several critics to react negatively. Hostility toward him was reportedly widespread in the literary community {{at the time of}} his death, which, in his 1989 obituary for the author, Nicolae Manolescu equated with ingratitude: [...] "the 'trifles' of daily life [...] have become essential in the biographies of aspiring writers." [...] Manea also wrote: [...] "plenty among Paul's former friends and admirers have enclosed themselves into an opaque conjectural silence, others have rushed in to 'cleanse' themselves of the unseasonable connection." [...] Literary critic Daniel Cristea-Enache defines Georgescu as [...] "a critic and a prose writer who should not be omitted by any serious work of literary history", while his colleague Cernat refers to Georgescu as [...] "unfairly forgotten". Horasangian believes him to have been [...] "completely forgotten", [...] "ignored", and [...] "taken out of the circuit." [...] Cristea-Enache adds that, with time, [...] "our, how should I put it?, indecent indifference [...] shadowing the name and bibliography of an important writer who is no longer among us". The Georgescu-Simuţ correspondence was published in 2000 as Învăţăturile unui venerabil prozator bucureştean către un tânăr critic din provincie ("The Teachings of a Venerable Prose Writer from Bucharest to a Young Provincial Critic"). In his review of that year, Cristea-Enache called it [...] "one of the most beautiful, most energizing and at the same time most impressive books I have read lately." [...] Dimisianu sees in them proof of [...] "how very human this 'devil' could prove himself to be, how full of warmth, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>troubled</b> by his friend's troubles". Reflecting on Georgescu's fiction, Ioan Holban notes that, during Romania's transitional stage, Ţăndărei came to resemble Huzurei more and more, especially after it became the center of a human trafficking and illegal immigration scandal pitting United Kingdom authorities against members of the local Romani community.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to assess <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{rebalancing}} of the six eurozone troubled economies (Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus) was achieved since {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 / 2008, to what extent migrations were a mitigating factor on their labor markets and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the <b>troubled</b> countries were assisted in their adjustment by other countries. The first part of the article shows an overall macroeconomic picture of the troubled economies' rebalancing together with a presentation of the etiology of the problem (i. e. accumulation of imbalances). The second part presents the role of migrations and the third part the role of the Eurosystem and international financial assistance in the rebalancing process. The research is based on comparing developments in selected indicators across countries. The conclusions are that the rebalancing in the troubled countries was either at most limited or actually their economies continued to fall out of balance (various indicators showing various developments make the situation ambiguous), migrations were either not much supportive for rebalancing of the troubled economies or they did not provide any dent to unemployment at all and that the troubled countries were provided with significant international assistance mainly {{in the form of the}} ECB policies causing the rise in the Target balances...|$|R

40|$|Good Vibrations is an {{independent}} movie that seeks to illustrate {{through the use of}} familiar tropes the importance of music as a transformative experience. The above trailer demonstrates the centrality of punk music as a means to change through relationships, do-it-yourself, and resistance. The movie is based on the life of Terri Hooley, specifically his role in the nascent punk scene in Belfast as something of an unlikely hero and ringmaster. In focusing on Hooley the movie serves up a number of points key to this chapter: the power of music to sidestep divisions and boundaries; <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the <b>troubles</b> in Northern Ireland were a background part of everyday life for most people; the ability within punk to cherry pick aspects and times and conveniently ignore or marginalise other equally important but less ‘sellable’ dimensions. This chapter will be structured to deal with each of these three areas as a means of demonstrating that Northern Ireland had one of the most vital and vibrant punk scenes in the UK {{at the time of the}} troubles. Vital in that, it was often the only space for Catholics and Protestants to mix and interact. Vibrant in that it was largely isolated from the drama and media wrangling of the mainland punk scenes and so had to form and inform itself. The chapter is based on the auto-ethnography of the author and on a sociological and religious studies research project on punk during and after the troubles...|$|R
