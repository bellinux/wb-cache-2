David and I were about 12 and John was only three years older, but we thought he was a shit-hot guitarist. John and his sister Judy did fraternity gigs together as a duo. Later John moved to England and became one of the Walker Brothers. ... He showed me some fingerpicking techniques and strumming stuff that I still use. When I play a solo, he's still there." [...] While Brian perfected the band's vocal style and <b>keyboard</b> <b>base,</b> Carl's Chuck Berry-esque guitar became an early Beach Boys trademark.
