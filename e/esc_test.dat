40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} biodiesel on the injection, spray, and engine characteristics with the aim to reduce harmful emissions. The considered engine is a bus diesel engine with injection M system. The injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics, obtained with biodiesel, are compared to those obtained with mineral diesel (D 2) under various operating regimes. The considered fuel is neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Its density, viscosity, surface tension, and sound velocity are determined experimentally and compared to those of D 2. The obtained results are {{used to analyze the}} most important injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics. The injection characteristics are determined numerically under the operating regimes, corresponding to the 13 mode <b>ESC</b> <b>test.</b> The fuel spray is obtained experimentally under peak torque condition. Engine characteristics are determined experimentally under 13 mode <b>ESC</b> <b>test</b> conditions. The results indicate that, by using biodiesel, harmful emissions (NOx, CO, smoke and HC) can be reduced to some extent by adjusting the injection pump timing properly...|$|E

Stress relaxation of PC and PC/silicone coating under a combined action of ethanol and stress {{was measured by}} self-made three point bending equipment. After stress relaxation testing, crack morphology was observed by polarizing microscope. The results indicate that silicone coating is able to improve the stress cracking resistance of PC parts in ethanol. The coated PC shows slower stress relaxation rate and less number of cracks than pristine PC. It is mainly attributed to that the silicone coating can provide barrier effect to the absorption and diffusion of ethanol in PC substrate. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of flexible silicone coating matched fairly well with that of PC, so that the coating is uneasy to peel off from PC substrate during the <b>ESC</b> <b>testing.</b> The silicone coating has a favorable effect to protect PC substrate from ESC under the combined action of solvent and stress...|$|R

Here, rhesus and baboons ESCs were investigated in interspecific mouse chimera generated by aggregation or blastocyst injection. Aggregation chimera produced mouse blastocysts with GFP-nhpESCs at the inner cell mass (ICM), and embryo transfers (ETs) generated dimly-fluorescencing abnormal fetuses. Direct injection of GFP-nhpESCs into blastocysts produced normal non-GFP-fluorescencing fetuses. Injected chimera showed > 70 % loss of GFP-nhpESCs after 21 h culture. Outgrowths of all chimeric blastocysts established distinct but separate mouse- and NHP-ESC colonies. Extensive endogenous autofluorescence compromised anti-GFP detection and PCR analysis did not detect nhpESCs in fetuses. NhpESCs localize to the ICM in chimera and generate pregnancies. Because primate ESCs do not engraft post-implantation, and also because endogenous autofluorescence results in misleading positive signals, interspecific chimera assays for pluripotency with primate stem cells is unreliable with the currently available <b>ESCs.</b> <b>Testing</b> primate <b>ESCs</b> reprogrammed into even more naïve states in these inter-specific chimera assays will be an important future endeavor...|$|R

The improved algorithm was built based on an improved UKF. The improved UKF sampling strategy used scaled minimal skew sampling method {{to speed up the}} system sampling rate. The sigma points of the improved UKF were sampling two times {{to enhance the}} accuracy. The three degree of freedom vehicle model was built to establish vehicle dynamic relationship. According to the three degree of freedom vehicle model, the vehicle measurement model was built. The verification experiments of improved soft measurement algorithm were made based on the electric-wheel vehicle <b>ESC</b> <b>test</b> platform. The experiments included a step input experiment in 70 kilometers per hour and a step input experiment in 110 kilometers per hour.

The present study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the electrochemical skin conductance (<b>ESC)</b> <b>test</b> in detecting early DPN, compared with the vibration perception threshold (VPT) test and diabetic neuropathy symptom (DNS) score, using the modified neuropathy disability score (NDS) as the reference standard. Five hundred and twenty-three patients with type 2 diabetes underwent an NDS-based clinical assessment for neuropathy. Participants were classified into the DPN and non-DPN groups based on the NDS (≥ 6). Both groups were evaluated further using the DNS, and VPT and ESC testing. A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of ESC measurements with those of DNS and VPT testing in detecting DPN. The DPN group (n = 110, 21 %) had significantly higher HbA 1 c levels and longer diabetes durations compared with the non-DPN group (n = 413). The sensitivity of feet ESC 15 V, and DNS ≥ 1, were 16. 4, 10. 9 and 1. 8, respectively. ESC measurement is an objective and sensitive technique for the early detection of DPN.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{worldwide}} proliferation of synthetic cannabinoids that have become marketed as legal alternatives to cannabis (marijuana). Unfortunately, there is a dearth {{of information about the}} pharmacological effects of many of these emerging synthetic cannabinoids (ESCs), which presents a challenge for regulatory authorities that need to take such scientific evidence into consideration in order to regulate ECSs as controlled substances. We aimed to characterize the pharmacological properties of ten ESCs using two cell based assays that enabled the determination of potency and efficacy relative to a panel of well-characterized cannabinoids. Agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels was monitored in live HEK 293 T cells transfected with human cannabinoid receptor 1 gene (CNR 1) and pGloSensor- 22 F. Pharmacological analysis of this data indicated that all of the <b>ESCs</b> <b>tested</b> were full agonists, with the following rank order of potency: Win 552122 ̆ 01322 ̆ 2485 F-PB- 222 ̆ 248 AB-PINACA 2 ̆ 248 EAM- 22012 ̆ 248 MAM- 2201 >JWH- 2502 ̆ 248 PB- 22 >AKB 48 N-(5 FP) >AKB- 482 ̆ 248 STS- 135 >XLR- 11.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the interpretations of extended-spectrum and advanced-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs and ASCs, respectively) for isolates of Enterobacteriaceae would be impacted by the results of aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) testing. Fifty-three isolates of Escherichia coli, 21 Klebsiella species, and 6 Proteus species that were resistant to at least one <b>ESC</b> were <b>tested</b> by disk diffusion with ceftazidime and cefotetan disks with and without APBA. Ceftazidime disks with and without clavulanic acid (CLAV) were also tested to confirm extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) carriage. Twenty-nine (36. 3 %) isolates were only APBA test positive, 27 were only CLAV test positive, 2 were positive with both substrates, and 22 were negative with both substrates. Thirteen (41. 9 %) of the 31 APBA-test-positive isolates (all E. coli) tested susceptible to cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ceftazidime. Since clinical data suggest that AmpC-producing isolates should be reported as resistant to all <b>ESCs,</b> APBA <b>testing</b> can be helpful in identifying such organisms. Screening for AmpC-producing organisms using nonsusceptibility to cefoxitin and amoxicillin-clavulanate was less specific than APBA testing; it identified ESBL as well as AmpC-producing organisms. Only 18 of 31 APBA-positive isolates were positive by PCR for an AmpC β-lactamase gene. Thus, testing with APBA could improve the accuracy of reporting ESCs, especially for E. coli. However, results of APBA and CLAV testing did not correlate well for isolates containing both AmpC β-lactamases and ESBLs. Thus, additional data are needed before formal recommendations can be made on changing the reporting of ASC test results...|$|R

Compared with diesel fuel, use of BE-diesel increased PM emissions by 14 % due {{to the increase in}} the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of PM, but it greatly reduced the Bosch smoke number by 60 %- 80 % according to the results from 13 -mode test of European Stationary Cycle (<b>ESC)</b> <b>test.</b> The SCR catalyst was effective in NOx reduction by ethanol, and the NOx conversion was approximately 73 %. Total hydrocarbons (THC) and CO emissions increased significantly during the SCR of NOx process. Two diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) assemblies were used after Ag/Al 2 O 3 converter to remove CO and HC. Different oxidation catalyst showed opposite effect on PM emission. The PM composition analysis revealed that the net effect of oxidation catalyst on total PM was an integrative effect on SOF reduction and sulfate formation of PM.

This necessitates {{the identification of the}} PET material characteristics. Because the biaxial elongation of macromolecules induces great modifications of the mechanical properties of the material, it is difficult to manage an accurate simulation: properties are not well known in the base or neck region of the bottles. The aim of the work presented here is to provide an identification tool for the orthotropic elastic properties in the 3 D regions of PET bottles of carbonated soft drinks. More specifically, we focus on the behavior of the petaloid bases when bottles are submitted to internal pressure like during burst or ESC (environmental stress cracking) tests. A stereo correlation tool has been developed in order to build digital 3 D surface; comparing the initial surface with the same surface when the bottle is under pressure, it is possible to evaluate the membrane strains at each point of the petaloid surface. Two bases, one with large valleys (LV) between the five feet and one with small valleys (SV) which highlight very different behavior at the <b>ESC</b> <b>test,</b> are compared with this tool. Coupled with a finite element simulation managed on the same bases, these results allow the identification of the induced mechanical properties.

40|$|Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is the {{dominant}} solution for meeting future NOx reduction regulations for heavy-duty diesel powertrains. SCR systems benefit from closed-loop control if an appropriate exhaust gas sensor were available. An ammonia sensor has recently been developed {{for use as a}} feedback element in closed-loop control of urea dosing in a diesel SCR aftertreatment system. Closed-loop control of SCR dosing enables the SCR system to be robust against disturbances and to meet conformity of production (COP) and in-use compliance norms. The ammonia sensor is based on a non-equilibrium electrochemical principle and outputs emf signals. The sensor performs well when tested in a diesel engine exhaust environment and has minimum cross interference with CO, HC, NO, NO 2, SO 2, H 2 O and O 2. Previous work, done in a simulation environment, demonstrated that an ammonia sensor provides the optimal feedback for urea dosing control algorithms in closed-loop SCR systems. A model-based SCR control strategy deploying an ammonia feedback sensor demonstrated high NOx conversion, low NH 3 slip and good robustness against disturbances. In this paper, FTP, ETC and <b>ESC</b> <b>test</b> data will be presented confirming these results.

The cathodic and anodic reaction steps have been investigated as a function of gas composition. It was found that the cathode polarization can be described by three processes: (i) oxygen adsorption on the cathode surface, (ii) oxygen diffusion to the three phase boundary followed by electrochemical reaction and (iii) oxygen transfer into electrolyte. In the MEA impedance spectra mainly the processes (i) and (ii) were observed. For B-doped LSM based cathodes the impact of oxygen adsorption on the total polarization resistance was reduced. In the anode the number of observed processes depends strongly on the art of the used anode and on the fuel humidification level. The Ni/YSZ anodes have mainly two arcs in impedance spectra connected with (i) hydrogen adsorption on Ni surface and (ii) diffusion of adsorbed species and formation of water.

Under each condition, concentration-response curves were obtained for three parameters: activity of the tubulin alpha 1 promoter (typically activated in early neurons), activity of the elongation factor 1 alpha promoter (active in all cells), and total DNA content (proportional to the number of surviving cells). We tested 37 compounds from the ESNATS test battery, which includes polypeptide hormones, environmental pollutants (including methylmercury), and clinically used drugs (including valproic acid and tyrosine kinase inhibitors). Different classes of compounds showed distinct concentration-response profiles. Plotting of the lowest observed adverse effect concentrations (LOAEL) of the neuronal promoter activity against the general promoter activity or against cytotoxicity, allowed the differentiation between neurotoxic/DNT substances and non-neurotoxic controls. Reporter activity responses in neurons were more susceptible to neurotoxic compounds than the reporter activities in ESCs from which they were derived. To relate the effective/toxic concentrations found in our study to relevant in vivo concentrations, we used a reverse pharmacokinetic modeling approach for three exemplary compounds (teriflunomide, geldanamycin, abiraterone).

Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems were introduced during the end of the 1990 s, and accident statistics show that they have had a huge impact on traffic safety. Early tests on track have indicated that ESC systems have a great potential at reducing accidents where the driver suddenly lose control over the vehicle (Yamamoto and Kimura 1996). Many studies based on accident statistics confirm that ESC systems have been very effective in reducing the number of single accidents among passenger cars and SUVs.

40|$|Understanding how genes affect {{behavior}} {{is critical to}} develop precise therapies for human behavioral disorders. The ability to investigate the relationship between genes and behavior has been greatly advanced {{over the last few}} decades due to progress in gene-targeting technology. Recently, the Tet gene family was discovered and implicated in epigenetic modification of DNA methylation by converting 5 -methylcytosine to 5 -hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC). 5 hmC and its catalysts, the TET proteins, are highly abundant in the postnatal brain but with unclear functions. To investigate their neural functions, we generated new lines of Tet 1 and Tet 3 mutant mice using a gene targeting approach. We designed both mutations to cause a frameshift by deleting the largest coding exon of Tet 1 (Tet 1 Δe 4) and the catalytic domain of Tet 3 (Tet 3 Δe 7 - 9). As Tet 1 is also highly expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we generated Tet 1 homozygous deleted ESCs through sequential targeting to compare the function of Tet 1 in the brain to its role in <b>ESCs.</b> To <b>test</b> our hypothesis that TET proteins epigenetically regulate transcription of key neural genes important for normal brain function, we examined transcriptional and epigenetic differences in the Tet 1 Δe 4 mouse brain. The oxytocin receptor (OXTR), a neural gene implicated in social behaviors, is suggested to be epigenetically regulated by an unknown mechanism. Interestingly, several human studies have found associations between OXTR DNA hypermethylation and a wide spectrum of behavioral traits and neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorders. Here we report the first evidence for an epigenetic mechanism of Oxtr transcription as expression of Oxtr is reduced in the brains of Tet 1 Δe 4 -/- mice. Likewise, the CpG island overlapping the promoter of Oxtr is hypermethylated during early embryonic development and persists into adulthood. We also discovered altered histone modifications at the hypermethylated regions, indicating the loss of TET 1 has broad effects on the chromatin structure at Oxtr. Unexpectedly, we discovered an array of novel mRNA isoforms of Oxtr that are selectively reduced in Tet 1 Δe 4 -/- mice. Additionally, Tet 1 Δe 4 -/- mice display increased agonistic behaviors and impaired maternal care and short-term memory. Our findings support a novel role for TET 1 in regulating Oxtr expression by preventing DNA hypermethylation and implicate TET 1 in social behaviors, offering novel insight into Oxtr epigenetic regulation and its role in neuropsychiatric disorders.

40|$|Backgrounds: A straight-forward way to {{identify}} whether a drug or environmental chemical can {{be harmful to}} unborn baby is to evaluate its effect on laboratory animals. All invivo methods need large number of animal and are therefore time consuming and expensive.

In recent years, embryonic stem cell <b>test</b> (<b>ESC)</b> {{has been used to}} investigate the mutagenic, cytotoxic and embryotoxic effects of compounds in vitro. Methods: The EST uses two cell lines and three endpoints to predict embryotoxic chemicals:  mouse embryonic stem cells (D 3 cells) and murine fibroblasts (3 T 3 cells). The validated prediction model was developed based on the inhibition of differentiation of D 3 cells into cardiomyocytes, and the inhibition of D 3 cells and 3 T 3 cell viability. In addition, differences in sensitivity between differentiated (adult) and embryonic cells are also taken into consideration. Results: The three experimental endpoints: ID 50 (50 % inhibition of differentiation of ES cells into cardiac myoblasts and IC 50 D 3 and IC 50 3 T 3 (50 % inhibition of cell growth in ES and 3 T 3 cells in the MTT assay, respectively).

Methods: The study material comprised 68 rectal carriage K. oxytoca isolates non-susceptible to ESCs recovered in 2008 - 11 from patients in 14 hospitals across Europe and Israel. <b>ESC</b> resistance was <b>tested</b> phenotypically; genes encoding ESBLs, AmpC cephalosporinases and carbapenemases were amplified and sequenced. The isolates were typed by PFGE and MLST, followed by sequencing of blaOXY genes. Results: MLSTand PFGE distinguished 34 STs and 47 pulsotypes among the isolates, respectively. Six STswere split into several pulsotypes each. Five STs were more prevalent (n= 2 - 9) and occurred in several countries each, including ST 2, ST 9 and ST 141, which belong to a growing international clonal complex (CC), CC 2. Four phylogenetic lineages were distinguished, each with another type of chromosomal OXY-type β-lactamase. Three of these, with OXY- 1 /- 5, OXY- 2 types and OXY- 4, corresponded to previously described phylogroups KoI, KoII and KoIV, respectively. A single isolate from Israel represented a distinct lineage with a newly defined OXY- 7 type. The phylogroups showed interesting differences in mechanisms of ESC resistance; KoI strains rarely overexpressed the OXY enzymes but commonly produced ESBLs, whereas KoII strains often were OXY hyperproducers and carried ESBLs much less frequently. AmpCs (DHA- 1) and carbapenemases (VIM- 1) occurred sporadically. Conclusions: The study confirmed the high genetic diversity of the collection of K. oxytoca ESC-non-susceptible isolates, composed of phylogroups with distinct types of OXY-type β-lactamases, and revealed some STs of broad geographical distribution...|$|R
40|$|Pluripotent {{stem cells}} (PSCs) have the unique {{characteristic}} {{that they can}} differentiate into cells from all three germ layers. This makes them a potentially valuable tool {{for the treatment of}} many different diseases. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and continuing research with human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) {{there is a need for}} assays that can demonstrate that a particular cell line is pluripotent. Germline transmission has been the gold standard for demonstrating the pluripotence of mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) lines 1, 2, 3. Using this assay, researchers can show that a mESC line can make all cell types in the embryo including germ cells 4. With the generation of human ESC lines 5, 6, the appropriate assay to prove pluripotence of these cells was unclear since human <b>ESCs</b> cannot be <b>tested</b> for germline transmission. As a surrogate, the teratoma assay is currently used to demonstrate the pluripotency of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) 7, 8, 9. Though this assay has recently come under scrutiny and new technologies are being actively explored, the teratoma assay is the current gold standard 7. In this assay, the cells in question are injected into an immune compromised mouse. If the cells are pluripotent, a teratoma will eventually develop and sections of the tumor will show tissues from all 3 germ layers 10. In the teratoma assay, hPSCs can be injected into different areas of the mouse. The most common injection sites include the testis capsule, the kidney capsule, the liver; or into the leg either subcutaneously or intramuscularly 11. Here we describe a robust protocol for the generation of teratomas from hPSCs using the testis capsule as the site for tumor growth...|$|R
40|$|International and Australian {{research}} has found that there are significant benefits to road safety associated with the addition of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to passenger vehicles. The greatest benefit to Australia is for crashes on high speed rural roads that occur due to a loss of control. An investigation of what variables in the South Australian statewide crash database are associated with high injury severity for vehicle occupants during crashes on high speed rural roads was conducted. For specifically single vehicle crashes on high speed rural roads, a higher speed limit, the hours of darkness, and an earlier crash year were found to be the major indicators of a high injury severity outcome. A complementary investigation of high speed rural road crashes that were a result of a loss of control was also conducted. This required the development of a method for identifying loss of control crashes using available variables from the South Australian statewide crash database. It was estimated that, per year in South Australia, 561 injury crashes on high speed rural roads are the result of a loss of control including 33 fatal crashes and 208 crashes resulting in injuries requiring hospital admission. While literature from ESC manufacturers clearly explains the theory behind how ESC operates, no {{research has}} directly investigated what braking interventions are made by ESC during real world situations where a vehicle not equipped with ESC would have crashed. More specifically, no research has investigated how braking interventions affect vehicle trajectory and enable a collision to be avoided. Also of interest is how the effect of interventions are altered when combined with other rural road safety features such as lower travelling speeds, sealed roadside shoulders, and sealed roads. Crash scenarios, developed based on high speed rural road crashes, were simulated using a vehicle model (with a corresponding ESC model) supplied by Bosch Australia. The simulation method included processes such as dynamic testing of the vehicle model, use of a driver model, and trajectory matching through optimisation. Each crash scenario was simulated using the vehicle model without ESC active and then again using the vehicle model with ESC active. The differences in vehicle trajectory and the braking interventions responsible for those differences were then analysed. The crash scenario simulations were also altered to represent the presence of specific rural road safety measures in order to investigate how ESC braking interventions were affected. However, this process was found to render the results unreliable and no analysis of how ESC was affected by the rural road safety measures was possible. The results of simulating each crash scenario were presented in figures that show when braking interventions are made and how they affect vehicle trajectory. Vehicle trajectory was analysed by investigating how ESC affected vehicle sideslip, lateral offset, and yaw. The strength and duration of individual braking interventions were then analysed which included an investigation of how they were affected by travelling speed and how they compare to braking interventions elicited during <b>ESC</b> effectiveness <b>tests.</b> Thesis (Ph.

30|$|Bacteria were {{isolated}} using trypticase soy agar (TSA) and selective agar thiosulphate–citrate–bile salts–sucrose agar (TCBS) for isolating Vibrio sp. The colony-forming unit (CFU) from fifth time serial dilution (10 − 5) {{was selected for}} colony counting. Gram staining also was done to identify Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Catalase test was done to identify Gram-positive bacilli. API kit (Biomerieux) API 20 E and API 20 NE were used to identify Gram-negative bacteria. Incubation box, tray and lid were prepared for the strip preparation. For the inoculum preparation, an ampule of API NaCl 0.85  % (2  ml) was selected and 1 – 4 colonies of bacteria were picked up using inoculation loop from the agar plate and then suspension was prepared with the turbidity equivalent to 0.5 McFarland. For the API 20 NE strip inoculation, test nitrate reduction (NO 3) and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside hydrolysis (PNPG) were inoculated by distributing the saline suspension into the tubes using Pasteur pipette. API AUX medium was added to approximately 200  µl of the remaining suspension into the ampule and was homogenized well. Tubes and cupules of test glucose fermentation (GLU) and Phenyl-acetate assimilation test (PAC) were filled with the suspension. Mineral oil {{was added to the}} cupules of 3 tests (GLU), arginine hydrolysis (ADH), and urea hydrolysis (URE) until convex meniscuses formed. The incubation box was closed and incubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h. After the incubation period, the strips were read by referring to the reading table. The reactions for (GLU, ADH, URE, aesculin hydrolysis <b>test</b> (<b>ESC)),</b> gelatine hydrolysis (GEL) and (PNPG) were recorded on result sheet. For NO 3 test, 1 drop of NIT 1 and 1 drop of NIT 2 reagents were added to NO 3 cupule. For tryptophan deaminase test (TRP), 1 drop of JAMES reagent was added and immediate reaction took place. NIT 1, NIT 2 and JAMES reagents were removed using pipette and test NO 3 and TRP were covered with mineral oil. Kit was reincubated at 29  ±  2  °C for 24  h and all tests were read again except for NO 3, TRP and underlined GLU, which were only read once at 24  h. Identification is obtained with the numerical profile. Database (V 6.0) in the API web index was used by entering the seven digit numerical profile in the identification software for species identification.|$|R
40|$|Embryo-derived {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} (ePSCs) naturally derive from different founder tissues, namely the early and late epiblast, that vary in their cellular characteristics. Recent evidence in mice suggests these sources of starting material correspond with two states of pluripotency referred to as ‘naïve’ and ‘primed’, respectively. Pluripotency {{is defined as the}} ability of a cell to give rise to any foetal or subsequent adult cell type. Naïve and primed ePSCs have different fundamental properties and only naïve cells can give rise to all cell types of an animal, including functional gametes (Nichols & Smith 2009). Until recently, naïve ePSCs (also known as embryonic stem cell or ESCs) were only available in mouse. After almost 30 years, the first non-mouse ESCs were derived in rat using a combination of specific inhibitors that block the FGF-ERK differentiation pathway and simultaneously maintain self-renewal through inhibition of GSK 3 (Buehr et al. 2008; Ying et al. 2008). The three inhibitor combination, or 3 i, included inhibitors of the FGF receptor (PD 173074), downstream ERK activity (PD 0325901) and the GSK 3 pathway (CHIR 99021). The dual inhibition of PD 0325901 and CHIR 99021, termed 2 i, was found to be effective for ESC culture; therefore the requirement for PD 173074 became dispensable. If pluripotent mechanisms are conserved between species, we hypothesise that these inhibitors would aid the derivation of naïve ESCs in livestock species i. e. cattle. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of these inhibitors on the developing bovine embryo. We hypothesised that the use of the inhibitors in culture medium would enhance the pluripotent characteristics of blastocysts for subsequent <b>ESC</b> culture. To <b>test</b> this idea we cultured in vitro fertilised bovine embryos in the presence of the inhibitors to initially assess the effect on embryo development. To assess embryo quality, blastocysts were analysed to evaluate the total number of cell nuclei. Additionally, mRNA and protein analyses were undertaken to characterise the expression of core pluripotent genes and assess if the inhibitors had an effect on their expression. We found that culturing bovine embryos in either 3 i or 2 i did not influence the total number of embryos that progressed to the blastocyst stage. A significant decrease was observed in the proportion of early vs. late stage blastocysts in 2 i, which suggested acceleration in the rate of development. In 2 i medium, the number of cell nuclei in D 7 blastocysts was significantly increased in both the inner cell mass (ICM) and the outer trophectoderm (TE). Additionally, embryos cultured in 2 i showed a > 2 -fold increase in NANOG, a transcription factor at the core of the pluripotency network. The ICM-specific pluripotency marker SOX 2 was also up-regulated in the presence of 2 i. Both these genes were found to be significantly enriched in the ICM of bovine blastocysts. Overall, we conclude that bovine blastocysts differ from mouse in their response to 2 i signal inhibition and molecular control of pluripotency...|$|R
