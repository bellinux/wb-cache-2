5|$|The film's {{script was}} laid out similar to a comic book, with {{pictures}} {{on the left and}} dialog and descriptions on the right. Jeunet planned every shot, which made it easier for visual effects artists to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> Blue Sky Studios was hired to create the first CGI Aliens to appear on film. Impressed with the company's work on Joe's Apartment creating CGI cockroaches, Jeunet and Pitof opted to hire the company to create 30 to 40 shots of CGI Aliens. The decision was made to use CGI Aliens rather than puppets or suited actors whenever the creatures' legs were in frame, as Jeunet felt that a man in a suit is easy to distinguish when the full body is seen.|$|E

25|$|Business Process Reengineering (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E

25|$|However, it is {{also clear}} from the law tracts that the {{practice}} of Sick Maintenance was being discarded. Thus, while Críth Gablach mentions some of what each individual is entitled to while being nursed according to his rank, it also mentions that the practice was no longer in use, and instead an additional fine encompassed the same provisions the injurer would have had to pay for under sick maintenance. Bretha Crólige does not mention anything about the practice being obsolete. However, it does mention that certain types of person could not be maintained because of the difficulty in doing so. Thus {{it was very hard to}} provision those of the highest rank and obviously impossible to find a substitute to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> Certain professionals could similarly be difficult. On the other hand, a number of persons could cause difficulty to the people maintaining the victim. Such troublesome individuals included the insane and women likely to cause trouble for those nursing them.|$|E
25|$|This {{meant that}} a group of car valeters, {{although}} described in their contracts as being self-employed, with a right to substitute another person to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> and professed to have no obligation to undertake work, were entitled to a minimum wage and paid leave. The contract terms could be disregarded because they did not represent the reality of the situation. In addition, a ‘worker’ is defined in ERA 1996 section 230 as someone with a contract of employment or who personally performs work and is not a client or a customer. This concept has greater scope, and protects more people, than does the term ‘employee’. This class of person is entitled to a safe system of work, a minimum wage and limits on working time, as well as discrimination and trade union rights, but not job security, child care and retirement rights. This concept thus reaches up to protect people who are quasi-self-employed professionals, such as partners of a law firm. People will also be workers but not employees when they are not so vulnerable, and relatively independent from their employers, such as home cleaners, music teachers who visit a student home, or independent taxi cab drivers. However, if they are employed through an agency, they will be employees in relation to the agency. Though not entitled to employee rights, these workers may form trade unions and take collective action under UK, EU and international law, to protect their interests.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November Dagobert {{was arrested}} for disagreeing with the representatives. He was {{eventually}} acquitted {{and returned to his}} division where he died on 18 April 1794. Meanwhile, on 3 November the government replaced Turreau with François Amédée Doppet, another ex-doctor. Not wanting to wait for Turreau's successor, the representatives reappointed d'Aoust to command from 22 to 27 November. Doppet came to take command on 28 November but was practically ignored by the representatives on mission. On 7 December, d'Aoust with 10,000 men was defeated at Villelongue-dels-Monts by Ricardos with 8,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops. The Allies lost only 56 casualties while inflicting losses of 340 killed and wounded, 312 missing, 26 guns, two colors and 2,000 muskets on the French. Doppet decided to pull back to Perpignan for the winter under cover of a spoiling attack on Villelongue. D'Aoust led the attack on 18 December which overran the Portuguese camp and slaughtered its garrison. Doppet soon came down with illness and spent the next {{two and a half months}} in bed recovering. D'Aoust was finally in full command just in time to be blamed for a disaster. In the Battle of Collioure, a Spanish corps commanded by Lieutenant General Gregorio García de la Cuesta drove the French out of Collioure and Port-Vendres on 20 December, inflicting 4,000 casualties on the French. Fort Saint-Elme was betrayed to the Spanish by its traitorous commander. D'Aoust ordered a retreat on the 21st but the Spanish harassed it severely. Finally, the French fought their way back to the safety of Perpignan but their total losses in the debacle were 7,700 men and 23 guns. The government singled out the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for disapproval despite the fact that its representatives were in large part responsible for the defeats. D'Aoust was arrested and the representatives on mission were recalled, except Fabre who was killed at Collioure. New representatives Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany celebrated their arrival by purging the army of both good and bad army officers. However, they subsequently did a better job of keeping the army supplied while letting the army officers <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> D'Aoust fell victim to the guillotine on 2 July 1794.|$|E

500|$|As Thakkar {{explained}} in a 2016 interview to The Times of India, the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System was developed {{in an era of}} 56K modems: [...] "They wanted any artist to view any number of shots, back-to-back, from part of the film, in high resolution, at 24 fps, with high quality audio, with speed-change control, from any phase of production from any department (story, editing, animation, modeling, layout, lighting, vfx, etc.)..." [...] As per Thakkar, it was a technology that allowed technicians and artists in multiple locations to simultaneously work on films in real time; one of the main provisions was useful transparency, enabling artists and technicians to seamlessly <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> without any need to think about the technology. Apart from the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, Thakkar says he additionally headed DreamWorks' [...] "high performance particle system rendering software" [...] and [...] "colour management system and software".|$|E
500|$|In {{his role}} as producer, Iwakami took a mostly {{hands-off}} approach. Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based on an already existing work, he described the main goal solely as [...] "coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment." [...] After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as [...] "I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they {{did an excellent job}} and I was very happy seeing the results in episode one." ...|$|E

500|$|Many {{of these}} {{resistors}} collaborated, and drew support {{not just in}} the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern [...] "Scotland-proper", and elsewhere in the Gaelic world. However, {{by the end of the}} twelfth century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control in order to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work,</b> the most famous examples being Lochlann, Lord of Galloway and Ferchar mac in tSagairt. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annex the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following Haakon Haakonarson's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the Battle of Largs with the Treaty of Perth in 1266. The conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the Lordship of Galloway after the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235 meant that Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king formed a majority of the population during the so-called Norman period. The integration of Gaelic, Norman and Saxon culture that began to occur may have been the platform that enabled King Robert I to emerge victorious during the Wars of Independence, which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.|$|E

2500|$|Business process {{re-engineering}} (BPR) is {{a business}} management strategy, originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. BPR aimed to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.

2500|$|Telecommuting {{is another}} way {{organizations}} can help reduce stress for their workers. Employees defined telecommuting as [...] "an alternative work arrangement in which employees perform tasks elsewhere that are normally done in a primary or central workplace, {{for at least some}} portion of their work schedule, using electronic media to interact with others inside and outside the organization." [...] One reason that telecommuting gets such high marks is that it allows employees more control over how they <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work.</b> Telecommuters reported more job satisfaction and less desire to find a new job. Employees that worked from home also had less stress, improved work/life balance and higher performance rating by their managers.|$|E

[...] Therefore, workers {{are not allowed to}} work at night and then hire themselves out during the day, because they will already be weak from their night work. Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that one is not allowed to work one's animal by night and then hire it out during the day.

2500|$|Within academia, {{plagiarism}} by students, professors, or researchers {{is considered}} academic dishonesty or academic fraud, and offenders {{are subject to}} academic censure, {{up to and including}} expulsion. Many institutions use plagiarism detection software to uncover potential plagiarism and to deter students from plagiarizing. Most universities address the issue of academic integrity by providing students with thorough orientations, required writing courses, and clearly articulated honor codes. Indeed, there is a virtually uniform understanding among college students that plagiarism is wrong. Nevertheless, each year students are brought before their institutions’ disciplinary boards on charges that they have misused sources in their schoolwork." [...] However, the practice of plagiarizing by use of sufficient word substitutions to elude detection software, known as rogeting, has rapidly evolved as students and unethical academics seek to stay ahead of detection software. An extreme form of plagiarism, known as contract cheating involves students paying someone else, such as an essay mill, to <b>do</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> for them.|$|E
