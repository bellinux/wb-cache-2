5|$|Before {{he worked}} for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some {{household}} and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the first secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna's poor English, he answered all interview questions in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. Turkish secret service apparently warned the embassy at some point about Bazna. Over the few months that Bazna worked for Busk, he secretly photographed a few documents and, {{with the help of}} Mrs. Busk's nursemaid named Mara, he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence.|$|E

He is also an insomniac. His talent is training squirrels on doing various tricks and skills. After the events of [...] "Bad Man Oldman", he apologizes to the Warriors for <b>hiring</b> them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his chores and decides <b>to</b> <b>hire</b> them <b>to</b> fight monsters and accomplish quests instead when he has one for them.

5|$|In {{addition}} to Abbott, the duo recruited other professionals experienced in musical comedy. Choreographer Robert Alton {{had worked in}} such hits as Panama Hattie and in movie musicals. Don Walker was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the orchestrations; his would be simpler than those of Robert Russell Bennett, who usually performed that function in the pair's musicals but who was not available. Irene Sharaff was engaged to design the more than 300costumes which would be needed. The show was originally named Hercules and Juliet, but they soon changed it to Me and Juliet. The Majestic Theatre, which Rodgers and Hammerstein desired to have for Me and Juliet, was currently occupied by their South Pacific, four years into its run. Arrangements were made to shift South Pacific to the Broadway Theatre though, due to schedule conflicts, this meant moving that show to Boston for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|Peckinpah's {{longtime}} {{composer and}} collaborator Jerry Fielding was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film score for The Getaway. He had worked previously {{with the director}} on Noon Wine (1966), The Wild Bunch (1969), Straw Dogs (1970), and Junior Bonner. After the film's second preview screening, McQueen was unhappy with the music and used his clout to hire Quincy Jones to rescore the film. Jones's music had a jazzier edge and featured harmonica solos by Toots Thielemans and vocals by Don Elliott, both {{of whom had been}} his associates. Peckinpah was unhappy with this action and took out a full-page ad in Daily Variety on November 17, 1972, including a letter he had written to Fielding thanking him for his work. Fielding would work with Peckinpah on two more films, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) and The Killer Elite (1975). Jones was nominated for a Golden Globe award for his original score.|$|E

25|$|A {{professional}} Dutch diver {{was supposedly}} <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the salvage job, making his headquarters on the isle, with a store ship standing by. Upon discovering the wreck and entering {{he found the}} golden throne, on which was seated, a gigantic figure who rose and came towards him. When the diver grasped {{the hand of the}} figure, instead of a hand, he found that he was grasping a cloven hoof! He escaped the scene with his life and some of his wits intact, however no one has attempted further salvage attempts. One of the Masters of a Kilwinning Lodge was presented with a wooden mallet which had been made with wood from one of the Armada ships which had been wrecked on the Ayrshire coast.|$|E
25|$|In February 1969, Hirsch {{was hired}} {{away from the}} Rams {{to serve as the}} {{athletic}} director at the University of Wisconsin. Within four years, he had raised home attendance at football games from an average of 43,000 to 70,000 per game. During his tenure as athletic director, the number of sports offered by the UW athletics department doubled and the Badgers won national titles in ice hockey, men's and women's crew, and men's and women's cross country. However, the program also had problems with recruiting violations and a fundraising controversy. Hirsch announced his resignation as Wisconsin's athletic director in December 1986; the resignation became effective at the end of June 1987. In July 1987, he was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> color commentary on radio broadcasts of Wisconsin football games.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{arrangement}} {{to avoid}} long-term serial temporary assignments is to [...] "in-source" [...] the work <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> {{and not the}} position that does the work. In this arrangement, a company does not hire a staffing firm to fill a position, but rather <b>hires</b> it <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work. The staffing firm still must <b>hire</b> the permatemp <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work, still on-site at the corporation.|$|R

[...] Selleck has also stated he dislikes avocados.|$|R
25|$|The team of Costas, Thomas and Collins {{worked the}} major games that season {{including}} the 1998 NBA Finals (which set an all-time ratings {{record for the}} NBA). Mike Breen, who played second fiddle to Albert on MSG Network's New York Knicks broadcasts, was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> select playoff games that year and was later promoted to backup announcer status. For the 1998–99 season, Thomas {{was moved to the}} studio, while Costas and Collins made up the lead team. The 1998–1999 season, which was marred by a lengthy lockout (which resulted in the regular season being shortened to 50 games) included the low-rated 1999 NBA Finals between the San Antonio Spurs and the New York Knicks. Albert was brought back for the 1999–2000 season, making a return which included calling that year's lead Christmas Day game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers from Staples Center.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in the village of Santa Ana Chiautempan, Tlaxcala in 1858. He was a good student, but {{after the death of his}} father, he was obliged to quit school to work to {{maintain}} his mother and sister. Eventually he lived in Mexico City, where he was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some carpentry work at the house of a wealthy family. Here met and fell in love with one of the young women there named Matilde. She was an orphan living with aunt and uncle at the house. He got her pregnant but never married her since he was poor. The family left to hide the pregnancy, stating that they would go on vacation to Europe. They returned two years later with a little girl named Dolores who they claimed they adopted in France. Chucho kidnapped the girl and took her to his sister’s house. However, the police went after him, and he was forced to abandon his family.|$|E
25|$|Productive {{behavior}} {{is defined as}} employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during {{which he or she}} may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do),</b> efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.|$|E

500|$|Church {{interpretation}} of the seventh commandment teaches that business owners should balance a desire for profits that will ensure {{the future of the}} business with a responsibility toward the [...] "good of persons". Business owners are required to pay their workers a reasonable wage, honor contracts, and abstain from dishonest activity, including bribery of government officials. Workers are required to do their jobs conscientiously, as they have been <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them, and to avoid dishonesty in the workplace, such as using office goods for personal use without permission (embezzlement).|$|E
500|$|In March 1979, after a {{few months}} without a job, Dahl was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a morning show at WLUP where he met {{overnight}} DJ Garry Meier (who was then broadcasting under the pseudonym of [...] "Matthew Meier"). Shortly thereafter, the two began a cross talk that eventually led to Meier being teamed up with Dahl as both sidekick and newsman.

500|$|Alagappan {{was hired}} as an intern with Ayasdi, a big data startup in Palo Alto, California, through Stanford's Mayfield Fellows Program, where he was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> sales. He tested the company's {{software}} on basketball stats and called the output [...] "the true positions of the NBA". The topological data analysis mapped similarities between NBA players and identified 13 distinct positions of play, {{as opposed to the}} traditional five. Those traditional positions, such as power forward and shooting guard, have become ambiguous and outmoded {{as a result of the}} increased variety of player styles categorized by them. Alagappan's method groups professional basketball players by statistical strengths and places them into the new positional model.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{work began}} on the North Tower in August 1968 with {{construction}} beginning on the South Tower by January 1969. [...] In January 1967, $74 million in contracts were awarded to the Pacific Car and Foundry Company, Laclede Steel Company, Granite City Steel Company, and Karl Koch Erecting Company to supply steel for the project. [...] The Port Authority chose to use many different steel suppliers, bidding on smaller portions of steel, rather than buy larger amounts from a single source such as Bethlehem Steel or U.S. Steel as a cost-saving measure. [...] Karl Koch was also <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all the work of erecting the steel, and a contract for work on the aluminum facade was awarded to the Aluminum Company of America. [...] Tishman Realty & Construction was hired in February 1967 to oversee construction of the project.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was <b>hired</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it."
