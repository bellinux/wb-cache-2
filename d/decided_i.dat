25|$|For {{the first}} time I liked school and for {{the first time}} I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E
500|$|Koufax tried {{one more}} year of {{baseball}} and showed up for the 1961 season in better condition than he had in previous years. Years later he recalled, [...] "That winter was when I really started working out. I started running more. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was really {{going to find out}} how good I can be." [...] During spring training, Dodger scout Kenny Myers discovered a hitch in Koufax's windup: he'd rear back so far that his vision was obstructed and he couldn't see the target.|$|E

He batted [...]277 in 188 at-bats in his pro debut for the Spokane Indians in the Short-season Northwest League, while leading {{the team in}} steals (11) and triples (6). He then spent the 2003–04 winter in Arizona, working out with the Rangers' {{strength}} and conditioning coaches. He said: [...] "I was probably 170 pounds, and I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> needed to lift, put on some weight, and eat as much as I could. And I learned how to hit." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Bell {{announced}} that he had quit as producer of Last of the Summer Wine. Citing differences with the BBC and his dislike of their indifference towards the series, Bell said, [...] "I have now <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> will not do it again. I have had enough of the BBC's attitude." [...] The announcement came following rumours initiated by Bell that the network would not commission another series of episodes following the 30th series and their indecision regarding a possible one-off special. However, on 26 June 2009, the BBC {{announced that}} it had recommissioned the show for a 31st series with Bell continuing as producer and director.|$|E
500|$|After the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{announced}} that he was splitting with Frost to train with one of his assistants, Tracey Menzies, who had no prior international experience. Admitting that tension existed between him and Frost, Thorpe asserted that the split was amicable. He cited waning motivation for the split, stating [...] "I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> either had to make the change or it was {{to walk away from the}} sport". The retired Talbot expressed concerns that Thorpe was making a decision whilst he was physically and emotionally drained, while other coaches felt that the new relationship would end up with Thorpe, rather than Menzies, making the decisions. Despite a turbulent year, he was again named by Swimming World as its World Swimmer of the Year.|$|E

People are so interested in the whole process, how it all comes together. This book does that."

Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was going to go up there and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E

She began dancing {{at the age of}} five, and trained in the {{classical}} Indian dance traditions of Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kathakali and Manipuri at the Shanti Kumar School of Dance and the Kalaya School of Dance in Colombo. In 1954, she won the gold medal at the All-Ceylon Dance Festival and was selected to perform for Elizabeth II when the Queen visited Sri Lanka in April 1954 during her tour of the Commonwealth after acceding to the throne. Neila has said: [...] "That was the day I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was going to devote my life to dance. My father wanted me to become a dental surgeon, but I refused".|$|E

500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day I forgot to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way." [...] Regarding the backlash about the sound, he stated, [...] "It's crazy, that kind of closed-mindedness." [...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos. It probably sounds heavier because it's Metallica, but really this was a 15-minutes-on-the-drum-sound type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When I was in my early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I went out there before kick-off I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not get a very clear view {{but there was no}} time I had any thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996 Penman {{published}} {{the first in}} the series of medieval mystery novels. Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E
500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was working too hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so unless I {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> had to do something else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It was a wonderful, experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E

500|$|Balukas {{was greatly}} incensed over the {{sanction}} {{and refused to}} pay on principle, turning away offers by others to pay the fine in her stead. Balukas explains that [...] "It wasn’t the $200... pool players, who were ranked three and six and five, {{were the ones who}} <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> should be fined. I felt it should have been done by an outside panel, not by my competitors." [...] The sides were at an impasse. Balukas refused to relent and the WPBA refused to lift the sanction and would not allow Balukas to play again until she paid the fine. [...] "Just because she was our premier player doesn't mean she was above the rules," [...] said Vicki Paski in 1992, then president of the WPBA. Professional Loree Jon Jones in the same interview expressed mixed sentiments: [...] "Her not playing is, I guess, sad," [...] but she reflected that in Balukas's absence, [...] "we've all learned how to win." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to {{be known}} for their {{adherence}} to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. [...] "I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent." [...] The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, fusing music hall and folk, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period.|$|E

A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. I <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> would play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
