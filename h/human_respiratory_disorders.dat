40|$|Several <b>human</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> {{have been}} linked to an {{abnormality}} of pulmonary surfactant synthesis or turnover. Among those conditions, hereditary deficiency in the hydrophobic surfactant protein B (SP-B) has been recognized as a rare cause of respiratory failure in term newborn infants. Homozygosity for a common mutation (1549 C [...] >GAA, or 121 ins 2) of the SP-B-encoding gene (SFTPB) results in rapidly fatal respiratory failure, with complete absence of the mRNA and protein observed in lung fluid or biopsy specimens. Hereditary SP-B deficiency is also associated with aberrant processing of proSP-C and deficiency of the active SP-C peptide. In the present study, we characterized the SFTPB gene in an infant with severe unexplained respiratory distress and identified a paternally derived 1549 C [...] >GAA lesion, as well as a hitherto unreported mutation (457 delC) inherited from the mother. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid demonstrated the complete absence of SP-B, However, unlike previous infants with hereditary SP-B deficiency, proSP-C was processed to the active SP-C peptide, suggesting that the defect in SP-B, rather than SP-C, caused the respiratory distress in this infant. The present findings demonstrate the importance of SFTPB in pulmonary function and support the need for further genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with SP-B deficiency.

40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} causative agents of <b>human</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and are {{distributed}} widely in our environment. Little {{is known of}} their interaction with human respiratory epithelial cells, which may contribute to allergic airway responses. In this study, {{we report on the}} release of C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL- 8) from human bronchial epithelial BEAS- 2 B cells upon stimulation with Fusarium proliferatum extracts. F. proliferatum-induced cytokine release from BEAS- 2 B cells was determined by cytokine array and CXCL- 8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Blocking antibodies and signaling pathway inhibitors were employed to delineate cell surface receptors and signaling pathways participating in CXCL- 8 release. F. proliferatum extracts induced the release of CXCL- 8 in a time-dependent manner. The dectin- 1 receptor ligands, curdlan and laminarin, reduced CXCL- 8 release. Cells pre-treated with anti-Dectin- 1 antibodies (2 µg/mL) decreased CXCL- 8 release by 24 %. Furthermore, F. proliferatum-stimulated CXCL- 8 release was reduced by 32 %, 53 %– 81 %, 40 % and 26 % after BEAS- 2 B cells were pretreated with activation inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) —piceatannol—, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) —PD 98059, U 0126, SB 202190, SP 600125 —, phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) —LY 294002 —and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) —BAY 117082 —, respectively. These results suggest that Dectin- 1 -mediated activation of the Syk, MAPKs, PI 3 K and NF-κB signaling pathways contributes to F. proliferatum-stimulated CXCL- 8 release from BEAS- 2 B cells and provides an important basis for developing novel therapeutic strategies in clinical allergy...|$|E
40|$|Defects {{in complex}} I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) {{are the most}} {{frequent}} cause of <b>human</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> The pathogenicity of a given human mitochondrial mutation {{can be difficult to}} demonstrate because the mitochondrial genome harbors large numbers of polymorphic base changes that have no pathogenic significance. In addition, mitochondrial mutations are usually found in the heteroplasmic state, which could hide the biochemical effect of the mutation. We propose that the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas could be used to study such mutations because (1) respiratory-deficient mutants are viable and mitochondrial mutations are found in the homoplasmic state, (2) transformation of the mitochondrial genome is feasible, (3) Chlamydomonas complex I is close to that of humans. To illustrate that, we have introduced a Leu 157 Pro substitution in the Chlamydomonas ND 4 subunit of complex I of two different recipient strains by biolistic transformation, demonstrating that site-directed mutagenesis of the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome is possible. This substitution did not lead to any respiratory enzyme defect when it is present in the heteroplasmic state in a patient presenting chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia. When present in the homoplasmic state in the alga, the mutation does not prevent the assembly of the 950 kDa whole complex I which conserves nearly all the NADH dehydrogenase activity of the peripheral arm. However, the NADH:duroquinone oxidoreductase activity is strongly reduced, suggesting that the substitution could affect ubiquinone fixation to the membrane domain. The in vitro defects are correlated in vivo with a decrease in dark respiration and growth rate. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Rett {{syndrome}} (RTT) is an autism spectrum disorder {{caused by}} mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes the transcription factor methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP 2). A major debilitating phenotype in affected females is frequent apneas, and heterozygous Mecp 2 -deficient female mice mimic the <b>human</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder.</b> GABA defects {{have been demonstrated}} in the brainstem of Mecp 2 -deficient mice. Here, using an intact respiratory network, we show that apnea in RTT mice is characterized by excessive excitatory activity in expiratory cranial and spinal nerves. Augmenting GABA markedly improves the respiratory phenotype. In addition, a serotonin 1 a receptor agonist that depresses expiratory neuron activity also reduces apnea, corrects the irregular breathing pattern, and prolongs survival in MeCP 2 null males. Combining a GABA reuptake blocker with a serotonin 1 a agonist in heterozygous females completely corrects their respiratory defects. The results indicate that GABA and serotonin 1 a receptor activity are candidates for treatment of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> in Rett syndrome...|$|R

40|$|The global {{estimated}} annual {{numbers of}} non-severe and severe (i. e. hospitalized) {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) infections in children younger than five are 34 and 3. 4 million. Most children with RSV bronchiolitis are treated outside the hospital and most children with RSV bronchiolitis are healthy term infants. This thesis {{is based on the}} Netherlands Amniotic Fluid Cohort, which was initiated to gain insight in the etiology of RSV bronchiolitis and to contribute to its prediction in healthy term infants. We found the following predictive factors for RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants: presence of siblings / day-care attendance, birth in April to September, birth weight > 4 kg, and highly educated parents. Abundant viral exposure (i. e. siblings, day-care) appeared to be the strongest predictor of RSV bronchiolitis in healthy term infants. The derived prediction rule could differentiate between children with low risk (3 %) of RSV bronchiolitis and high risk (32 %). Children with RSV bronchiolitis had an increased prevalence of recurrent wheezing and reduced health-related quality of life {{during the first year of}} life. In addition, vitamin D deficiency at birth was also associated with an increased risk of RSV bronchiolitis. RSV viral load was positively associated with disease severity in primary RSV infections. A high correlation with RSV viral load was found for single RSV infections and for RSV co-infections. In line with these findings, the sensitivity of the nasal swab for the molecular detection of RSV infection in the community was generally moderate, but high in case of more severe RSV infection. Term spontaneous onset of labor vaginal delivery was associated with high levels amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-α) and a high prevalence of histological chorioamnionitis. Fetal exposure to higher levels of amniotic fluid pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 8, TNF-α) appeared to be associated with a decreased risk of medically attended RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life. In addition, in the group of children that developed RSV bronchiolitis, the number of days with wheezing symptoms in the first year of life was inversely associated with the amniotic fluid concentration of IL- 8. Finally, newborn airway compliance was positively correlated with the amniotic fluid concentration of sLAIR- 1, which is considered a marker of general immune activation. Additionally, children exposed to a high level of amniotic fluid sLAIR- 1 had a decreased incidence of recurrent wheezing. Given the finding that a firm pro-inflammatory profile was present in amniotic fluid of the majority of physiologic term deliveries, one could speculate on the role of exposure of the fetal mucosa to these inflammatory signals. Maybe these signals instruct the local mucosal immune system to prepare for the invasions of several pathogens, allergens and pollutants after birth. Since the impressive inflammatory response is present during term deliveries on such a large scale, it is likely that the beneficial effect found is not specific for RSV bronchiolitis, but also holds true for other childhood respiratory condition, such as viral-induced wheezing and asthma.

40|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{the most}} common cause for higher {{morbidity}} and mortality rate in India. Higher oxygen concentration of extrauterine existence causes increased erythrocyte lysis lead to release of iron in neonates. Iron is known to catalyze the formation of Reactive oxygen species. Involvement of hemoglobin and iron in oxygen-mediated reactions stimulate us to study the role of these in neonates. Objectives :i) To estimate the concentration of Haemoglobin, serum iron, serum lipid peroxidation in neonates with respiratory disorders; and compare those with that of healthy controls. ii) To study the role of these parameters in neonates with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> Materials and Methods: Present study includes 50 neonates suffering from <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and 50 healthy neonates as controls. Samples collected from these were used for the estimation of haemoglobin, serum iron, and serum lipid peroxidation. Observations: Significantly (p< 0. 001) increased levels of serum iron and lipid peroxidation were observed in neonates with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> when compared those with control values. These levels were found significantly (p< 0. 001) higher in preterm than full-term neonates. Concentration of haemoglobin showed no significant difference in both groups. Conclusion: Exacerbation of oxidative stress in neonates with <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> may be due to hypoxia induced free radical generation, higher oxidative tendency of HbF and elevated iron. Premature neonates are probably unprepared for extra uterine life in an oxygen rich environment and due to this they are more prone to oxidative insult.
