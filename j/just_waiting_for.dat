25|$|We have {{recorded}} {{everything in the}} studio and are <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Gaahl to put vocals on it. So we have only vocals and the final mix to go before it's all done. It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we get nothing done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, {{despite the fact}} that it was {{formerly}} worn by Sosa, who coincidentally later hit his 600th home run against Marquis. Ted Lilly, who had also signed with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was told it was not available as it was going to be retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, and they were <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.|$|E
25|$|Until 1916, mail {{carriers}} {{knocked on}} the door and waited patiently for someone to answer. Efficiency experts estimated that each mailman lost over 1.5 hours each day <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> patrons to come to the door. To correct this problem, the Post Office Department ordered that every household must have a mail box or letter slot in order to receive mail. This requirement was phased in, starting with new delivery locations, around 1912. Slowly, homeowners and businesses began to install mail slots or attached mailboxes to receive mail when they were either not at home or unable to answer the door. The requirement was made mandatory in 1923.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Symonds scored 101 {{and took}} two wickets for 46 {{to be the}} {{difference}} between the sides at Old Trafford. Having been sent in to bat, Lancashire owed much of their success to a partnership of 118 between Symonds and Marcus North, and good lower-order hitting took the total to 249 for 8, despite three wickets each from Sussex' Pakistanis, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Mushtaq Ahmed. The Sussex chase looked on when they were 112 for 1 with Matt Prior and Chris Adams at the crease, as they were <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> opportunities to up the run-rate, but instead Symonds and England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff ran through them with the ball, and Robin Martin-Jenkins and Ahmed eventually had to consolidate to 214 for 8, losing by 35 runs.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed clear}} {{all along that}} the Republican {{dominance}} would render this a no-contest and the Republicans were <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> all of their votes to be present, but the Federalists had one last defense. A marathon session of debate, lasting from 11 A.M. to 10 P.M., was {{the order of the}} day on December 2, 1803. Most notably, Uriah Tracy of Connecticut argued in a similar vein as Adams when he invoked the federative principle of the Constitution. For Tracy, the original two-vote system was formulated in order to give the small states a chance to elect the Vice President, who would be a check on the President’s powers. In essence, the states balanced the power of the people. However, this only works if you make it partisan, as Georgia (for example) was a Republican small state.|$|E
25|$|She {{has often}} said that {{she knew she would}} become a monastic in the Buddhist {{tradition}} at some point in her life; she was <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the right time. That time came in 2000 when she took early retirement from Thammasat University and received the bodhisattva's precept from the Fo Guang Shan order in Taiwan. In 2001, she took her sāmaṇerī ordination in Sri Lanka from R. Saddha Sumana Bhikkhuni and T. Dhammaloka Bhikkhu. In 2001, she was ordained a full bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka, the first Thai woman to be ordained in a Theravada monastic lineage, as Dhammananda. Her ordination lineage is Syamopali from Dambulla chapter. She currently resides at the Songdhammakalyani Monastery in the Muang District, Nakhonpathom province, Thailand. Since her ordination, Dhammananda has written more than 100 books, designed to educate the public about various issues related to Thai Buddhism, including the place of women.|$|E

Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> someone to write them down.

500|$|After {{his death}} Sibelius, though {{remaining}} {{popular with the}} general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as [...] "the worst composer in the world"; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity {{about the existence of}} material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked [...] "VIII" [...] within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that [...] "ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. Maybe there are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> some scholar to discover them." ...|$|E

Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality.
