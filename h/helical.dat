5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that is neither purely <b>helical</b> nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a <b>helical</b> tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a <b>helical</b> structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and very flexible. The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} <b>helical</b> capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} <b>helical</b> virus.|$|E
5|$|The ship lift's design uses a <b>helical</b> gear system, {{to climb}} or descend a toothed rack.|$|E
5|$|Boron {{fibers and}} sub-millimeter sized {{crystalline}} boron springs {{are produced by}} laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex <b>helical</b> structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (elastic modulus 450GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in micromechanical systems.|$|E
5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} with a nick, {{or break}} {{in one of}} the strands, at the junction point adopt a perpendicular orientation, and always prefer the stacking conformer that places the nick on a crossover strand rather than a <b>helical</b> strand.|$|E
5|$|More than 50% of the world's {{population}} harbor H. pylori {{in their}} upper gastrointestinal tract. Infection {{is more common}} in developing countries than Western countries. H. pylori's <b>helical</b> shape (from which the genus name derives) is thought to have evolved to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach.|$|E
5|$|The BRCA2 <b>helical</b> domain {{adopts a}} <b>helical</b> structure, {{consisting}} of a four-helix cluster core (alpha 1, alpha 8, alpha 9, alpha 10) and two successive beta-hairpins (beta 1 to beta 4). An approximately 50-amino acid segment that contains four short helices (alpha 2 to alpha 4), meanders around {{the surface of the}} core structure. In BRCA2, the alpha 9 and alpha 10 helices pack with the BRCA2 OB1 domain through van der Waals contacts involving hydrophobic and aromatic residues, and also through side-chain and backbone hydrogen bonds. This domain binds the 70-amino acid DSS1 (deleted in split-hand/split foot syndrome) protein, which was originally identified as one of three genes that map to a 1.5-Mb locus deleted in an inherited developmental malformation syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Unlike bony fish, sharks have {{a complex}} dermal corset made of {{flexible}} collagenous fibers and arranged as a <b>helical</b> network surrounding their body. This {{works as an}} outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.|$|E
5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), <b>helical</b> or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5|$|As noted above, most DNA {{molecules}} {{are actually}} two polymer strands, bound {{together in a}} <b>helical</b> fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded (dsDNA) structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart– {{a process known as}} melting– to form two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high pH (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double <b>helical</b> structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a <b>helical</b> {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above this air pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a <b>helical</b> arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links below for link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive <b>helical</b> body that twists about as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as <b>helical</b> flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the <b>helical</b> axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the <b>helical</b> axis and elliptically polarized if it comes in obliquely.|$|E
5|$|The unstacked form is {{a nearly}} square planar, {{extended}} conformation. On the other hand, the stacked conformers have two continuous double-helical domains separated by an angle of about 60° in a right-handed direction. Two {{of the four}} strands stay roughly <b>helical,</b> remaining {{within each of the}} two double-helical domains, while the other two cross between the two domains in an antiparallel fashion.|$|E
5|$|A <b>helical</b> {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and SHF bands.|$|E
5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This bright yellow solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with <b>helical</b> chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double <b>helical</b> gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was expected at standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E
5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, {{a biological}} process that increases genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve <b>helical</b> strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a corkscrew (a <b>helical</b> path), climbing and turning and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the electron velocity. This centripetal force causes the electron to follow a <b>helical</b> trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces the electron to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of the electron, known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows the electron. This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helical</b> railguns are {{multi-turn}} railguns {{that reduce}} rail and brush current {{by a factor}} equal {{to the number of}} turns. Two rails are surrounded by a <b>helical</b> barrel and the projectile or re-usable carrier is also <b>helical.</b> The projectile is energized continuously by two brushes sliding along the rails, and two or more additional brushes on the projectile serve to energize and commute several windings of the <b>helical</b> barrel direction in front of and/or behind the projectile. The <b>helical</b> railgun is a cross between a railgun and a coilgun. They do not currently exist in a practical, usable form.|$|E
25|$|Z-DNA {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{possible}} double <b>helical</b> structures of DNA. It is a left-handed double <b>helical</b> structure in which the double helix winds to the left in a zig-zag pattern (instead of to the right, like the more common B-DNA form). Z-DNA is thought to be one of three biologically active double <b>helical</b> structures along with A- and B-DNA.|$|E
25|$|The muscular layer {{consists}} of an inner circular layer and a longitudinal outer layer. The circular layer prevents food from traveling backward and the longitudinal layer shortens the tract. The layers are not truly longitudinal or circular, rather the layers of muscle are <b>helical</b> with different pitches. The inner circular is <b>helical</b> with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is <b>helical</b> with a much shallower pitch.|$|E
25|$|<b>Helical</b> (or spiral) cone beam {{computed}} tomography {{is a type}} of three-dimensional {{computed tomography}} (CT) in which the source (usually of X-rays) describes a <b>helical</b> trajectory relative to the object while a two-dimensional array of detectors measures the transmitted radiation on part of a cone of rays emanating from the source.|$|E
25|$|There are a {{class of}} image {{artifacts}} specific to <b>helical</b> acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{techniques}} used most frequently include renal ultrasound and <b>helical</b> CT scan.|$|E
25|$|Screw piles, {{also called}} <b>helical</b> piers and screw {{foundations}}, {{have been used}} as foundations since the mid 19th century in screw-pile lighthouses. Screw piles are galvanized iron pipe with <b>helical</b> fins that are turned into the ground by machines to the required depth. The screw distributes the load to the soil and is sized accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Access to {{the depths}} of the mine was by a long <b>helical</b> roadway.|$|E
25|$|In 1951 and 1952, {{together}} with William Cochran and Vladimir Vand, Crick {{assisted in the}} development of a mathematical theory of X-ray diffraction by a <b>helical</b> molecule. This theoretical result matched well with X-ray data for proteins that contain sequences of amino acids in the alpha helix conformation. <b>Helical</b> diffraction theory turned out to also be useful for understanding the structure of DNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal milling machine except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a <b>helical</b> gear is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the <b>helical</b> path.|$|E
25|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the CDKN2 cyclin-dependent kinase {{inhibitor}} family. p16 comprises four ankyrin repeats, each spanning a length of 33 amino acid residues and, in the tertiary structure, forming a helix-turn-helix motif. One exception is the second ankyrin repeat, which contains only one <b>helical</b> turn. These four motifs are connected by three loops such that they are oriented perpendicular to the <b>helical</b> axes.|$|E
25|$|Bizon-2-01: Chambered for the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum {{cartridge}} using {{a modified}} <b>helical</b> magazine with a 53-round capacity.|$|E
25|$|However, because Arnold's {{balance spring}} patents were in force (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could {{not use the}} <b>helical</b> balance spring until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, {{in the case of}} the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat balance springs only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a <b>helical</b> spring with terminal overcoils.|$|E
