5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

40|$|Across {{all types}} of higher {{education}} in the United States, tenure has been historically linked to the concepts of academic freedom and economic security. In medical schools, however, the link between tenure and a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> has changed appreciably over the past decade into something much more tenuous. In the current economic environment where medical schools operate with limited and, arguably, unstable bases of “hard” funding, the liability of a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> to tenured faculty presents schools with a fiscal risk they often must manage. Accordingly, schools continue to revise their policies and increasingly provide no <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> at all, or when they do, it is on a much more limited basis. This Analysis in Brief (AIB) presents data on the current relationship of the <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> associated with tenure for both clinical and basic science medical school faculty, and how that relationship has evolved over time...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 {{season the}} New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) {{suspended}} Gallaher from playing after a disagreement over a claim for expenses he had submitted to the Auckland Rugby Football Union for travel to play in the match against the British Isles. Eventually the matter was resolved when, under protest, Gallaher repaid the disputed amount. This settlement, coupled with his performance in 26–0 North Island win over the South Island in the pre-tour trial, allowed Gallaher to be considered for selection for New Zealand's 1905–06 tour of Europe and North America. The NZRFU had been trying to secure an invitation to send a team to Britain for some time, and were finally able to secure satisfactory <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> to proceed in 1905. This was the first representative New Zealand team to undertake such a tour, though a privately organised team, the New Zealand Natives, had preceded them in 1888–89.|$|E
5|$|The Coastal Administration {{stated that}} they would not allow a pontoon bridge. SBT decided on 26 June 1987 to work towards {{receiving}} permission to collect advanced tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take longer time to plan—and thus complete—the Triangle Link. A poll from January 1988 showed that 78.6 {{percent of the population of}} Bømlo wanted the Triangle Link, while 8.6 percent wanted the pontoon bridge. On 6 January, SBT started negotiating loans with various banks to receive <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> for the Triangle Link, and by February sufficient funding had been secured.|$|E

Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} the Olympic Village from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in voting against a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid.

The data used {{are from the}} <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> system of the Finnish statutory pension scheme.

A Markov regime-switching model is used to predict the frequency and severity of future depression periods. The claim amounts are predicted using a transfer function model where the predicted growth rate of the real GNP is an explanatory variable. The pure premium and initial risk reserve are evaluated on the basis of the predictive distribution of claim amounts. Bayesian methods are applied throughout the modelling process. For example, estimation is based on posterior simulation with the Gibbs sampler, and model adequacy is assessed by posterior predictive checking.

40|$|Equity-indexed annuity (EIA) {{insurance}} products {{have become increasingly}} sought after since their introduction in 1995. Some {{of the most important}} characteristics of these products are that they allow the policyholders to benefit from the equity market's potential growth and ensure that the principals can grow with a minimum guaranteed interest rate. In this thesis, we show how to derive the closed-form pricing formula of a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee,</b> using the Black-Scholes framework. Moreover, under the complete-market assumption, we construct a replicating portfolio that can hedge a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee.</b> However, in real financial markets, some of the assumptions required by a complete-market cannot be respected, particularly the continuous-time trading assumption. The replicating portfolio generates hedging errors because companies can only trade discretely. We will show the distribution of the present values of hedging errors for the <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee.</b> We also introduce the Lee-Carter stochastic mortality model. After presenting how to price a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity with fixed mortality rates, we then take the stochastic mortality rates into consideration to re-evaluate the point-to-point. In both cases, the pricing work for the point-to-point product is done under the assumption of independence between the equity market and the policyholder's time of death. Furthermore, the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity can be derived based on the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> with the corresponding mortality rates. The distributions of the present values of hedging errors under both fixed and stochastic mortality rates will be presented. Indeed, the replicating portfolio can help companies reduce the risks of issuing EIA products, since it can hedge the EIA very well. The impact of stochastic mortality model is examined {{at the end of the}} thesi...|$|R

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the century new {{railways}} were proposed which were likely to enable the Barry Railway to encroach on the GWR area of dominance at Swansea. The R was a possible means of getting this access if another railway could get control, or running powers, and this motivated the GWR to negotiate with the R for control. In 1906 agreement was reached by which the GWR took over the management of the R system in return for generous <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees.</b> The colliery activity in the area was at its peak and the R directors were able to use this fact to the advantage of their shareholders in the negotiation. The ordinary dividend of the R had been % in 1902; the GWR now guaranteed 3% rising to 5% in 1907. This was in effect a lease; the arrangement took effect from 30 June 1906.|$|E
25|$|According to Simon Wilde, part of {{the reason}} for Ranjitsinhji's reduced output in 1901 was the death in November 1900 of Rajinder Singh; the {{subsequent}} reduction in his income would have presented Ranjitsinhji with financial difficulties. By November 1901, Ranjitsinhji faced bankruptcy and after an unavailing request to Nawangar for a resumption and increase of his allowance, only an appeal to the India Office prevented a court action against him. Through his solicitor, Ranjitsinhji claimed that his debt to one creditor only came through his acting on behalf of Pratap Singh and Sardar Singh, the Maharaja of Jodhpur. In December, Ranjitsinhji travelled to India to attempt to secure <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> from the council acting for Rajinder Singh's son and from Jodhpur but he was unsuccessful in his attempt to get the support of the Maharao of Kutch, who was sympathetic but unwilling to help; he nevertheless later received a request for a substantial sum of money which Ranjitsinhji claimed he had been promised. Ranjitsinhji's Indian trip caused him to miss the start of the 1902 season; no reason was given for his absence and the press and public did not know where he was.|$|E
25|$|Under a joint {{marketing}} agreement between {{most of the}} companies {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, UNDERGROUND signs appeared outside stations in central London. World War I delayed extensions of the Bakerloo and Central London Railways, and people used the tube stations as shelters during air raids in 1915. After the war, government-backed <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> were used to expand the network, and the tunnels of the City and South London and Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railways were linked at Euston and Kennington, although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later. The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow. In 1933, the underground railways and all London area tram and bus operators were merged into the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The outlying branches of the Metropolitan were closed; various upgrades were planned. The Bakerloo line's extension to take over the Metropolitan's Stanmore branch, and extensions of the Central and Northern lines, formed part of the 1930s New Works Programme. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 halted or interrupted some of this work, and many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters.|$|E
