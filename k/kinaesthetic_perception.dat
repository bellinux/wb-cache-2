40|$|This study {{explored}} perceptions {{regarding the}} experience of flow (Csikszentmihalyi 1975) in elite golf; a sport which is different to those studied previously due to its self-paced, stop-start nature. In-depth, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} 10 European Tour golfers. Whereas the majority of previous studies have deductively coded data into Csikszentmihalyi’s dimensions, the data in this study were analysed inductively. Thirteen categories were generated which described the flow experiences of these golfers, and these were compared to the original flow dimensions after analysis. In contrast to previous understanding, these golfers reported being aware that they were in flow as it occurred, and seemingly were able to manage their flow experiences. A category describing altered cognitive and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perceptions</b> was also generated which was not accounted for in the existing flow framework, while the participants also suggested that flow was observable (e. g., through changes in behaviour). Findings are discussed in relation to existing literature, and recommendations made for future research including possible revisions to the flow framework to better describe this experience within golf and other sporting contexts...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{explored}} how flow (commonly {{known as}} “the zone”) is experienced in elite golf, a sport {{which may be}} different to those studied previously due to its slower paced, stop-start nature. Design: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were employed to gain rich insight into the flow experiences of these participants. Method: The participants were 10 male professional golfers (Mean age = 37) who had competed on the European Tour for, on average, 10 full seasons. Five of these had won on the European Tour and two had Ryder Cup experience. The players were asked a range of questions relating to what the experience of flow is like within golf, and the interviews lasted, on average, 53 minutes. Results: Inductive thematic analysis was employed and 14 themes describing flow emerged, of which 11 displayed similarities to Csikszentmihalyi’s dimensions. Notably, however, these golfers reported an additional awareness of being in flow as it occurred, and even attempted to maximise the experience. Two other themes did not clearly fit with the original dimensions either: altered cognitive and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and feeling calm and/or relaxed during the experience. Finally, the participants also perceived that they could observe others in flow, e. g., through changes in behaviour. Conclusions: These findings suggest possible revisions to the existing framework to more clearly describe the flow experience within elite golf and possibly other sporting contexts. The seemingly observable nature of flow may also be useful for researchers and, for example, within coaching...|$|R
40|$|Understanding and {{managing}} emotion in psychological therapy {{is a complex}} and challenging problem for practitioners and clients. The traditional emphasis on verbal language as the mediating process in therapy is expanding with the inclusion of multimodal creative arts, based on visual, auditory, and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perceptions,</b> to better support the reaccessing of emotion. This can be followed recursively {{by the use of}} words to develop narrative and meaning. The main research emphasis in this thesis was on visual art. Studies of other art forms may follow. Philosophical understanding, neuroscience advances and developments in psychological therapy underpin and explain this therapeutic expansion. A qualitative research approach is taken, engaging several different actions from within that research paradigm. The thesis is written as a metaphorical journey and conveys the experience of art dialogue and the experience of researching, as parallel stories. Psychological learning journeys undertaken by its author and a colleague, some clients, therapists and teachers, are described in three encounters. The first encounter explored visual art dialogue as a process addition to a developing experiential phenomenological approach using multimodal creative arts (The MIECAT Process - Lett 2001). The objective was for the colleagues to experience a lengthy creative arts sequence, developing and undertaking the process of visual art dialogue. Multilevel actions and outcomes were recorded throughout the collegial engagement. The collegial encounter required that the co-researchers pursue their own personal psychological meanings and report on their experience of the process. Personal narrative meanings exposed in exploring visual art dialogue, are not discussed, the emphasis being on confirming how actions occurred and their effectiveness for application. Actions stopped where direct verbal therapeutic engagement might occur. Following collegial experience, visual art dialogue was used with clients and other therapists and teachers, to question its broader relevance. The second inquiry, involving three clients of the author, asked how the process would support professional actions in a therapeutic situation. The third encounter engaged other therapists and teachers to expand on questions of by whom and how, art dialogue could be used. Psychological therapy theory suggests process location within a humanistic framework, in an eclectic focus or supporting the development of an experiential, phenomenological psychology process approach based on the known functions of mind and body. The associated personal and professional aspects of the experience of process exploration constituted a step in authorial understanding and may contribute to increasing knowledge of the creative arts applied to psychological therapy...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Haptic {{perception}} involves both cutaneous perception, through mecha-noreceptors {{lying on}} the skin, and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perception</b> mediated by {{the position of the}} fingers. Analogously, artificial devices should replicate both these perceptual channels, as well. While kinesthetic information is satisfactorily replicated by current technology, cutaneous information is still a challenging task to be provided. In order to comply with this goal, a computational model of perceptual flow, inspired to established models for vision, has been recently extended to the tactile domain. It has been shown that tactile flow encodes important information on relative motion and segmentation of tactual scenes. In this paper we illustrate how previous results on the ”contact area spread rate ” with softness detection can be conveniently explained in terms of integral of tactile flow over the contact area. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the degree to}} which vision may alter <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perception</b> by asking participants to view their hand through a prism, introducing different horizontal deviations, while trying to align their fingers above and below a thin table. When the visual image of one hand was displaced this overwhelmed kinaesthetic judgements and participants reliably reported that they felt their limbs were aligned, even when they were laterally misaligned by as much as 10 cm. This effect, however, was mediated by visual capture and when the task was attempted in a darkened room with limb position indicated by an LED taped to the finger, kinaesthesis dominated and participants reported that the LED seemed to become detached from their finger tip. In both light and dark conditions the finger was clearly visible and only the background detail was extinguished. Hence, in perceiving limb position, it appears that we believe in what we see, rather than in what we feel, when the visual background is rich, and in what we feel when the visual background is sparse...|$|E
40|$|My {{subject in}} this essay is kine-aesthetics, the {{perception}} of movement, {{and its role in}} dance speetatorship. I am revisiting territory closely associated with dance critic and theorist John Martin, along with his somewhat discredited notion of kinaesthetic empathy. I will suggest that the questions Martin posed concerning the nature of dance communication are still pertinent, as is his intention, however imperfectly realized, to develop a dance poetics that is sensitive to a bodily, sensory logic. 'How is it that I am moved when a dancer moves?' Martin asked. To respond to this question today requires, amongst other things, a re-examination of the perceptual processes underpinning dance production and reception. Writing in 1939, in the midst of modernist experimentation, "Martin reasoned that if dance was to be an autonomous, or absolute art, its modes of representation and expression must be unique to it. Comparable to the isolation of optical experience in modernist painting, :Ylartin identified kinaesthesis, the perception of movement, as the essential ground of absolute dance. But <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perception</b> is a complex business. Despite "Martin's efforts to align his theory of dance reception with modernist precepts, the perception of (dance) movement is not reducible to a singular sensory modality. Kinaesthesis, the 'pick up' of movement, cannot be isolated to a specific group of receptors, but cuts across functional perceptual systems. The visual, the articular and the haptic/ tactile systems may all be involved in movement perception. In this essay I will suggest that dance speetatorship entails a complex mode of visual kinaesthesis, that is, a way of looking which is intricately interwoven with the sense of touch. I will describe thekinaesthesia of the dancing body in textural terms, as given to both vision and touch. A key resource for the paper is the work of cognitive psychologist James Gibson. Gibson's insights concerning the nature and function of the sensory-perceptual systems have had an important impact upon American experimental dance. In particular, his understanding of the interplay between visual and haptic systems provided theoretical support and experimental data for dancers' creative exploration of the relationship between movement, perception and bodily change. Gibson's work has also been important in developing alternative approaches to dance and movement training. It has informed the philosophy and methods of Contact Improvisation, Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's Body-Mind Centering and Todd alignment/ideokinesis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDesigning for <b>kinaesthetic</b> awareness, the <b>perception</b> of our body's {{position}} and movement, presents a {{unique set of}} challenges and opportunities. While these implications are relatively new in the HCI community, they resonate with experiential knowledge from somatic practices and theories in embodied cognition. Still, moving is an interactive sound installation designed to support the perception of a person's micro-movements. We elaborate here on findings from a previous study, first emerged inductively from a grounded theory analysis of phenomenological interviews. Tracing the connections between these findings, and existing research in somatic practices and embodied cognition, reveals a range of distinctions and alternatives to flesh out the question: How can we understand and cultivate kinaesthetic awareness through interaction...|$|R
40|$|Video {{games are}} {{evolving}} and are becoming ever more immersive. Consequently, {{it is necessary}} to understand their effects on gamers’ psychological wellbeing. The impact on cognition, affect and behaviour has mostly been investigated separately and sometimes from narrow approaches that limit the understanding of the video games’ effects. This thesis investigates the effects of playing video games from a novel, multimodal and broad research approach that is termed "Game Transfer Phenomena" (GTP). The Game Transfer Phenomena framework examines the influence of video games on gamers’ sensorial perception, cognitions, and behaviours directly related to video games’ structural characteristic, game content and, in-game activities. A theoretically eclectic approach is taken to explain the interplay of physiological, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms involved in GTP, mainly informed by socio-cognitive and behavioural theories. Mixed-methods were used in the empirical research. The three qualitative studies presented here were analysed by content and thematic analysis methodologies (n= 1, 244), and the quantitative online survey using appropriate statistical testing (n= 2, 362). The specific aims of the thesis were: (i) identify, classify and explain GTP experiences collected in online video game forums divided in three empirical studies, and (ii) investigate the characteristics of GTP, and factors associated with GTP in a cross-cultural online survey with a total sample of English and Spanish Speaking gamers. The results suggest that gamers experience a variety of non-volitional phenomena when not playing. (i) Experiencing thoughts, urges, images, sounds, tactile and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perceptions</b> and sensations associated with the game, (ii) perceiving distorted physical stimuli due to the video game features, (iii) confusing physical stimuli with video game elements, (iv) responding to certain physical stimuli as in the game, and (v) experiencing involuntary body movements and behaviours directly related with the video game. In summary: (i) different gamers reported similar GTP in the same video games, (ii) GTP are in the continuum between normal and pathological phenomena, and appear to reflect failures in cognitive and control inhibition, and neural adaptations, (iii) age and occupation, having a medical condition, gamer type, session length, playing for escape, immersion, exploring, customization and rules and mechanics were significantly associated with GTP, and (iv) the appraisal of GTP were either positive or negative (with one in five players experiencing distress or dysfunction due to their GTP experiences). Findings suggest that resemblances between virtual and physical objects facilitate GTP and these may be strengthened with more advanced technologies. Knowing about particular video game features and their effect on gamers may contribute to taking more informed decisions regarding the psychological, cognitive, physiological and social effects of video games and the technologies that are still to come...|$|R
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} a bilateral kinaesthetic deficit during the post-surgical phase of ACL reconstruction surgery. This bilateralism confirms previous reports in multiple studies, including {{in patients with}} a deficient ACL (Bonfim et al., 2008; Gauffin et al., 1990; Lysholm et al., 1998; Pap et al., 1999) {{and in some cases}} after ACL reconstruction (Denti et al., 2000; Fremerey et al., 2000). The hypothesis proposed in the literature to explain this bilateralism is a change in the central nervous system (CNS), with the loss of ACL mechano-receptors that occurs during the tear altering the proprioceptive information in the CNS. Supporting this theory are reports of central reorganization after sensory deprivation or a peripheral lesion (Kapreli & Athanasopoulos, 2006). Several studies have reported central somatosensory changes after ACL tears (Courtney & Rine, 2006; Valeriani et al., 1996; Valeriani et al., 1999), and the cerebral cortex is known to participate in voluntary motor control. Pitmann et al. (Pitman et al., 1992) have reported somatosensory evoked potentials after direct stimulation of the ACL during surgery. Valériani et al. (Valeriani et al., 1996; Valeriani et al., 1999) have measured somatosensory evoked potentials before and after reconstruction in seven patients and found decreased knee <b>kinaesthetic</b> position <b>perception</b> and a lack of the cortical P 27 potential {{on the side of the}} ACL lesion. Baumeister et al. (Baumeister et al., 2008) have also shown that electroencephalography changed cortical activity after ACL reconstruction. Modifications mostly concern the anterior frontal cortex (theta) and parietal cortical (alpha- 2) areas. These modifications are also found during stimulation of healthy limbs in operated patients, explaining the change of proprioceptive capacities. This central reorganization could explain bilateral proprioceptive modifications.|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about whether deficits in motion {{perception}} contribute to balance impairment among individuals with sensorimotor deficits such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and stroke. Deficits in directional acuity during behaviorally relevant conditions {{may be an important}} and understudied aspect of many sensorimotor impairments. Most tests of whole-body directional perception have been performed during seated tasks. However, seated tasks do not actively engage motor systems, which can affect proprioceptive signals in muscles, and therefore lead participants to rely on only cutaneous, vestibular, and visual information. These factors contribute to our ability to perceive the direction and magnitude of an impending fall and to appropriately activate muscles to restore balance when standing. Our first objective was to measure sensory thresholds of directional acuity, in a young adult population, as a method to quantify <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>perception</b> of the body’s motion and direction in space during perturbations to standing balance. Our second objective was to validate methods for quantifying directional acuity thresholds in response to perturbations during standing by comparing two methods, parameter estimation by sequential testing (PEST) and the psychometric method. To avoid use of visual and auditory cues, subjects were blindfolded and wore headphones with a white noise masking stimulus. In each trial, two ramp and hold perturbations of identical magnitude (7. 5 cm, 15 m/s, and 0. 1 m/s 2) were applied, with 3 seconds between perturbations to allow recovery of balance. The first perturbation was in the backward direction, causing forward displacement of the center of mass. The second perturbation was deviated by 0 - 30 ° to the right or left of the initial perturbation. After each pair of perturbations, subjects pressed a button to indicate whether they perceived the pair of perturbations {{to be in the same}} or different direction. We found that the directional acuity threshold of whole-body perturbations for a young adult population was 8. 9 + 2. 2 °. Sensory thresholds identified using PEST, an adaptive algorithm, required fewer trials (approximately 31 trials vs. 100 trials) than those estimated from full psychometric curves but converged to thresholds, approximately 7. 8 + 3. 1 °, with greater variability within the population. The directional acuity thresholds, measured in this study, are the first known quantification of whole-body directional perception during standing. Future work is aimed at determining thresholds in clinical populations, such as PD and stroke, and in the lateral and diagonal directions and to compare perceptual and motor responses.

40|$|Een {{master-slave}} systeem voor heelkundige ingrepen, voorzien van be trouwbare krachtterugkoppeling, maakt het mogelijk ook voor complexere i ngrepen minimaal invasieve technieken te gebruiken. Voor het lokaliseren van tumoren, verborgen aders en venen, of de kwaliteitscontrole van een steek, baseren de chirurgen zich voornamelijk op de stijfheid van het w eefsel. Dit werk integreert de karakteristieken van de menselijke perceptie van stijfheid in het ontwerpproces van de teleoperatiecontrole. Bij gebruik van traditionele controleschemas limiteert de wrijving in de medische r obot de kwaliteit van de krachtterugkoppeling. Een combinatie van het online schatten van de omgevingsstijfheid met een directe weergave van deze stijfheid in de haptische interface is ontwik keld. Deze techniek ontkoppelt de controle voor het uitvoeren van de taa k van de terugkoppeling van de informatie. De regelaars van de medische robot en de haptische interface kunnen onafhankelijk van elkaar worden o ntwikkeld, wat resulteert in verhoogde stabiliteit en positienauwkeurigh eid. De wrijving in de medische robot heeft bij gebruik van deze technie k geen invloed meer op de teruggekoppelde stijfheid. Dit werk introduceert verder het concept van verhoogde gevoeligheid voor het discrimineren van stijfheidsverschillen. Met het telechirurgisch sy steem kan de chirurg zo kleinere stijfheidsverschillen detecteren dan me t de blote hand. Deze techniek verhoogt de nauwkeurigheid en biedt een h oger zekerheidsniveau bij palpatie. Een experiment met directe weergave van de stijfheid in de haptische interface, gecombineerd met het online vormen van het gewenste gevoel, toont de technische haalbaarheid aan.

40|$|The {{thought process}} of profoundly and {{severely}} prelingually deaf children were studied {{in a field}} situation, to determine both general mechanisms and individual differences in information processing. The central concern was whether individuals who were largely deprived of normal means of verbal processing make particular use of visual, articulatory and <b>kinaesthetic</b> cues. The <b>perception</b> and immediate recall of visually presented letters were investigated (Experiments 1 - 4). All the deaf subjects appeared to be relying heavily on visual cues, whilst articulatory coding was employed only by those most able to articulate intelligibly. The use of visual cues was also found in a lexical-decision task when graphemically similar word pairs were processed significantly faster than either phonemically similar word-pairs were processed significantly faster than either phonemically similar or control word-pairs (Experiment 5). When similarity of sign equivalent wan manipulated (Experiment 6), the deaf subjects processed the word-pairs with sign equivalents significantly faster than those without sign equivalents. In a sentence-recall task, a written version of sign language (SL) was recalled significantly better than either “deaf English” or standard English (SE) (Experiment 7). The deaf subjects were also able to understand short stories written in SL significantly better than those written in SE (Experiemnt 8). In the final experiment (Experiment 9), kinaesthetic feedback provided by the active use of fingerspelling significantly improved the deaf children’s retention of new spelling patterns. The experimental evidence suggested that the cognitive system of the deaf children was structurally {{different from that of}} normally hearing children, developing as it does primarily through visual input. It was visually oriented, backed up by additional kinaesthetic, and, in some cases also by articulatory, information processing. In the light of the present findings, the implications for cognitive development of the use of standard English as the 'official' language of classroom instruction in deaf schools are discussed. Throughout this study there was considerable evidence of marked individual differences in the communicative abilities of the deaf children. Since these differences clearly constituted important experimental variables, it is suggested that, in future studies, there should be greater awareness of the importance of such differences within experimental populations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to specify the {{phenomenon}} of the actor’s presence onstage – to discuss its theoretical basis. The fact that the internally active body of the actor is gaining increasing precedence over the spoken word testifies to changes in the aesthetic sense of modern theatre. These changes, in turn, refer to paradigmatic changes in the Western way of thinking – the heretofore prevalent linear causality is gradually being replaced by a circular causality. An actor’s psychophysical presence and corporal intensity plays an important role in the aesthetic currents of the contemporary theatre. On the stage, an actor (as a form) is positioned among other stage forms (lighting, music, setting/costumes, space and language) and, in such a community, the actor’s presence here and now becomes an important principle. His/her active condition of onstage presence requires wider <b>kinaesthetic</b> sensations and <b>perceptions,</b> which are achieved through specific psychophysical training. Important factors include the multi-levelled focus of attention, the sensitivity and activity of the actor’s organism and the sensing of the body as a transcendental and ontological unity. These keywords are taken from various phenomenological philosophies of the body (M. Merleau-Ponty, D. Leder, J. Gibson and A. Noë), and from P. Zarrill’s phenomenological model of the embodiment-experience of the contemporary actor, and I will try to relate them to my own analysis of the practical experience of onstage presence. In the analysis, I focus on evoking and maintaining onstage presence in the personal practice of acting and conclude that the psychophysical onstage presence is primarily based on the self-acknowledgment of one’s bodily movement. Theatrical acting is a practical way of thinking and acting which is always based on technique, no matter whether it involves bodily expression, working with the voice, imagination or text. The imaginary aspect of theatre and the actor’s work is secured by discipline (i. e. technique), which has a direct effect on the aesthetic formal aspirations of a production. Contemporary theatre prefers a more action-based, more ‘bodily’ and consciously psychophysical (self-) experience of the actor within the performance space. I believe that this situation indicates the need for developing a phenomenological theory of the presence of a human being that cannot directly be found in the works of the authors referred to in this article. In a narrower sense, the theory of the actor’s presence onstage could help to explain changes in the aesthetic aspirations of contemporary theatre. In the wider sense, the development of the theory of presence could be aimed at the interpretation of the processes active in the perception and way of thinking of humans...|$|R
