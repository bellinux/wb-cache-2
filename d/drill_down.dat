5|$|JMP {{software}} is partly focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization. It {{is designed for}} users to investigate data to learn something unexpected, as opposed to confirming a hypothesis. JMP links statistical data to graphics representing them, so users can <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> or up to explore the data and various visual representations of it. Its primary applications are for designed experiments and analyzing statistical data from industrial processes.|$|E

25|$|Drilling, {{longwall}} and rockbreaking {{machines are}} now also available as autonomous robots. The Atlas Copco Rig Control System can autonomously execute a drilling plan on a drilling rig, moving the rig into position using GPS, {{set up the}} drill rig and <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> to specified depths. Similarly, the Transmin Rocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination. These systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to increase costs and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E

2500|$|ROLAP works {{directly}} with relational databases {{and does not}} require pre-computation. The base data and the dimension tables are stored as relational tables and new tables are created to hold the aggregated information. It depends on a specialized schema design. This methodology relies on manipulating the data stored in the relational database to {{give the appearance of}} traditional OLAP's slicing and dicing functionality. In essence, each action of slicing and dicing is equivalent to adding a [...] "WHERE" [...] clause in the SQL statement. ROLAP tools do not use pre-calculated data cubes but instead pose the query to the standard relational database and its tables in order to bring back the data required to answer the question. ROLAP tools feature the ability to ask any question because the methodology does not limit to the contents of a cube. [...] ROLAP also has the ability to <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> to the lowest level of detail in the database.|$|E

As of 31 January 2017, there are 32 Supercentres. There have been no more new Supercentre openings since 2008, and the dual Asda Wal*Mart branding on the older Supercentres is being gradually phased out in favour of using the sole Asda branding as each store comes up for major refurbishment work. Most supercentres have now removed the dual Walmart branding. Most supercentres also have a petrol station. They also have either a customer cafe, or a McDonald's franchise restaurant. However, the Pudsey supercentre has both. This store is also the only supercentre to have a basement-level sales floor underneath the original surface-level ground floor sales area. At the time of the Pudsey superstore conversion to the supercentre format in 2002, the building contractors could not build a traditional exterior extension due to lack of space, because the Pudsey site had been a joint venture development with Marks & Spencer in 1990, and they had a large store immediately adjacent to the Asda store. So, it was decided that instead of creating a first floor mezzanine level extension {{it would be better to}} <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> underneath the original shop floor to excavate and create a new basement store extension.|$|E
