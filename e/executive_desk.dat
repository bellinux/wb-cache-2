2500|$|Since the {{lasing medium}} was fairly small, a single bomb could host {{a number of}} them and attack {{multiple}} ICBMs in a single burst. The Soviet ICBM fleet had tens of thousands of warheads, but only about 1,400 missiles. If each satellite had two dozen lasers, two dozen satellites on-station would significantly blunt any attack. In Molniya orbits, where the satellites would spend much of their time over the USSR, only a few dozen satellites would be needed, in total. An article in Aviation Week and Space Technology described how the devices [...] "... are so small that a single payload bay on the space shuttle could carry to orbit a number sufficient to stop a Soviet nuclear weapons attack".

40|$|The {{furniture}} industry in India is highly fragmented: the 85 % {{of the national}} furniture production comes from small size firms. On the contrary, the office furniture segment displays {{a higher degree of}} industrial concentration, concerning particularly the segments of metal and plastic furniture. Wooden furniture is concentrated in States where forests are more readily attainable. But India, due to the shortage of timber resources, is often forced to import them from the neighbouring countries. The Indian office furniture production is estimated to amount to around US$ 1. 6 billion, 40 % is operative desking. The research The office furniture market in India is based on field studies involving direct interviews with roughly 100 sector firms and distributors. In addition to the data collected through direct surveys, we have also used and uniformly processed data from the balance sheets of some firms and from their annual reports or from articles in the specialist press. The report provides trends in office furniture production and consumption, office furniture imports and exports. Trade data are analyzed by country and by geographical area as well as by product type (office furniture including/excluding seating). Prices and factors determining the demand for furniture are examined, as well as furniture supply structure. Short profiles and figures about sales of the main Indian office manufacturers and of foreign office furniture manufacturers operating in India are also provided.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} has highlighted {{the correlation between}} sedentary behaviour and an increased all-cause mortality. This is a problem commonly observed in the workplace due to the current ergonomic format of traditional seated workstations, where employees are spending long hours in sedentary behaviours. The introduction of standing desks into the workplace provides an alternative to reduce sedentary behaviours associated with a conventional seated workstation. As this is a workstation modification, {{it is necessary to}} determine the effects of standing on cognitive performance. Executive function is an important domain of cognition that is thought to be a key process in intelligent behaviour. Recognising the effects that standing <b>desks</b> have on <b>executive</b> function may provide support for their implementation in the workplace. A crossover design was used to investigate the effects of a standing desk, compared with a traditional seated workstation, on executive function during a simulated working day. Thirty healthy participants (14 female, 16 male), aged between 20 - 49 years old, were recruited and asked to complete a number of cognitive tests over two 7. 5 -hour sessions, one whilst standing, and the other whilst seated. There were three testing sessions (Morning, Midday and Afternoon) throughout each day comprised of batteries of cognitive tasks, including four tasks specifically testing Executive Function: Verbal Fluency, Visuospatial Search, Stroop Effect and Trail Making. A repeated measures ANOVA was performed to investigate whether there was a difference between the sitting and standing conditions, and Time of Day (Morning, Midday, Afternoon) was also analysed. Executive function was not found to be negatively affected by standing when compared to sitting, but evidence was found to suggest an improvement in performance in the Visuospatial Search task, the Trail Making Task, and the Stroop Effect Task across the simulated work day. The results of this study provide supporting evidence to suggest that standing desks may be effectively implemented into the workplace without negatively influencing <b>Executive</b> Function. Standing <b>desks</b> should be considered by employers to provide an effective workplace alternative to sitting while reducing the rapidly increasing health risk caused by sedentariness...|$|R
