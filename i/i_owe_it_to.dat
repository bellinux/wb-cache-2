5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

Pacino won an Obie Award for Best Actor for his role, with John Cazale winning for Best Supporting actor and Horowitz for Best New Play. Martin Bregman saw the play and became Pacino's manager, a partnership that became fruitful {{in the years to}} come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do The Godfather, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. [...] "Martin Bregman discovered me off Broadway. I was 26, 25. And he discovered me and became my manager.

Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. You have got to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E

A large retrospective exhibit was held in New Canaan, Connecticut in 1980, featuring of his works. In an interview done during the exhibition he stated: “I tried not to exhibit unless I had to. I hate to see [...] go out. I don’t like to show. It’s an interruption to painting but I feel <b>I</b> <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> people.

She is the voice with both the range and the heart - which is like none I've ever heard of in my entire career." [...] After singing A Piece of Sky with Velasquez, Legrand exclaimed, [...] "It's tough to sing that song after Barbra Streisand, I will tell you, but to sing with Regine is.. I'm in heaven. She sings so well, she has such an extraordinary technical and sensitive voice and talented expression." [...] When asked who was Brian McKnight's favorite Filipino singer, the 16-time Grammy nominated artist immediately answered Regine Velasquez, [...] "Regine is probably one of the greatest singers I have ever heard anywhere. She can hold her own next to anyone. I doubt that anybody would want to come behind her after she sings." ...|$|E

[...] The album was panned by critics, with Titik Pilipino stating [...] "To be honest, what 've been expecting {{at this point in}} Nina's career is an album of original compositions suited to her voice [...] she didn't have to shout and be a vocal Chinese acrobat." [...] OPM critics reacted negatively to the kind of musical process she was doing, noticing that her most popular albums, Nina Live! and Nina Featuring the Hits of Barry Manilow, contain covers. Her most popular singles, [...] "Love Moves in Mysterious Ways", [...] "Foolish Heart" [...] and [...] "Through the Fire", are also revivals. In an interview with the entertainment press at Red Box, Nina defended herself, saying [...] "It's fulfilling to sing any song, maybe a cover or an original song, just the fact that I'm singing is fulfilling enough."
