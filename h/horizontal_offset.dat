This allows a conscious [...] diver to adjust trim to suit the circumstances such as the choice between swimming face down or face up, or remaining vertical for best field of view or visibility. The position of the diver's centre of gravity is determined by the distribution of weight, and buoyancy is determined by the equipment in use, particularly the buoyancy compensator, which can significantly influence centre of buoyancy shifts as it is inflated and deflated.

50|$|Wind {{presents}} {{probably the}} largest challenge for an FT shooter - {{while it is}} not too difficult to hit even the furthest targets on a perfectly still day with a little practice, mastering shooting in wind can take many years. Pellets can be blown sideways by even a light breeze. At longer distances this can start to cause misses, as the pellet will often be blown onto the faceplate if you aim centrally. In stronger winds {{it is not uncommon to}} have to aim completely off the faceplate in order to score a hit, and judging the amount of compensation to apply takes a lot of practice and experience. Head and tail winds can also have an effect on the trajectory of the pellets, causing them to hit high or low. It is common to fit a “windicator” to the barrel of the rifle - a piece of light cord with a feather on the end will provide a good indicator of general direction in light winds when it may not be entirely obvious, but it does not tell you what the wind will be doing on the way to the target. Competitors may choose to lift the reset cord of a target off the ground to get a feel for this wind - it will arc gently in a steady crosswind, and may even reveal changes in wind direction caused by nearby trees and foliage. Although many scopes have mechanical adjustment for <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset,</b> it is primarily used to ensure the rifle is shooting straight ahead in still conditions. The variable nature of the wind means it is often easier to aim off target (sometimes called “Kentucky windage” in the US) than to try to adjust the calibration of the crosshairs.|$|E

However, there is a paucity {{of information on the}} biomechanical results of this type of arthroplasty com-pared with those of contemporary total hip arthroplasty. Methods: Using standardized radiographs, we measured and compared the biomechanical parameters that affect the hip joint reactive forces in fifty hips that had a metal-metal surface replacement with those parameters in forty hips that had a contemporary cementless total hip replacement performed during the same time-period by the same surgeon. Results: On the average, the arthritic hips that were treated with metal-metal surface replacement had had a more valgus preoperative neck-shaft angle and less <b>horizontal</b> femoral <b>offset</b> than the normal, contralateral hips (p = 0. 0003). After both the metal-metal surface replacements and the cementless total hip replacements, the hip center of rotation was medialized by approximately 6 mm. Both procedures were associated with an average increase in limb length of approximately 3 or 4 mm. After the metal-metal surface replacements, the <b>horizontal</b> femoral <b>offset</b> was es-sentially equal to the preoperative value, but both values averaged about 8 mm less than those on the normal, con-tralateral side (p < 0. 00001).

40|$|Figure 1 - Schematic {{explanation}} of aligned rendering of name usages in hierarchies on screen. Name usages in three tree diagrams representing hierarchies, h 1, h 2 and h 3 are {{aligned with the}} aid of an aligner tree. Capital letters in hierarchies represent name usages in each hierarchy. The aligner tree is composed from hierarchies as a kind of superset where letters in the aligner tree are place holders to determine vertical offset of nodes. Rendering of a tree diagram in two dimensions based on the folder metaphor requires calculation of node position where <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset</b> depends on depth of the node while vertical offset is relevant to both depth and width. Nodes in hierarchy diagrams can be aligned horizontally by sharing the calculation of vertical offset of nodes. For example, vertical position of node C in hierarchy diagram h 1 is determined by vertical offset of node C of the aligner tree while <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset</b> is determined in the diagram h 1 alone. Inconsistency between hierarchies results in duplicated nodes in the aligner tree; different assignments of name usage S in hierarchies h 2 and h 3 results in two S nodes in the aligner tree. Vertical offset of nodes S in hierarchies h 2 and h 3 are determined by position of corresponding nodes S in the aligner tree. Missing name usages, e. g. name usages B and S in hierarchy h 1, result in vacancies in the hierarchy diagrams like vacancy for boundary sets of Rough set representation.

40|$|Purpose: Precise biomechanical {{reconstruction}} of the hip joint by a hip arthroplasty {{is essential for the}} success of this procedure. With the increasing use of surface replacement arthroplasty (SRA), {{there is a need for}} better understanding of the key factors that influence the anatomical and the biomechanical parameters of the resurfaced hip joint. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of SRA on the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset</b> of the hip. Method: Twenty-one hips from 12 embalmed cadavers were resurfaced with a Birmingham Hip resurfacing. The thickness of the acetabular bone was measured pre- and post-reaming in 6 acetabular zones. Radiographs were taken before and after the procedure with a scaling marker. For statistical analysis, the paired Student’s T-test with a confidence interval of 95 % and a significant p-value of p< 0. 05 was used. Results: The mean acetabular bone loss was 3. 8 mm, 5. 9 mm, 9. 3 mm, 10. 6 mm, 8. 5 mm and 3. 6 mm in zones 1 to 6. The “polar length loss” is the cumulative displacement of the femoral and the acetabular articulating surface in zones 2 to 5. This displacement indicates a shortening of the neck plus a medio-cranial displacement of the acetabular articulating surface and was 4. 3 mm, 7. 5 mm, 9. 4 mm and 7. 7 mm (zone 2 - 5). The radiographic center of rotation (COR) was significantly medialised (mean 6. 2 mm) and displaced in the cranial direction (mean 6. 9 mm) (p< 0. 00001). The mean total (femoral plus acetabular) horizontal and vertical offset change was 6. 4 mm and 9. 5 mm respectively (p< 0. 00001). There was a significantly higher vertical offset change in the acetabulum than in the femur (p= 0. 0006). This resulted in a significantly larger change in vertical than in <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset</b> (p= 0, 04). Conclusion: The displacement of the acetabular COR was responsible for 60 % of the total vertical and 99 % of the total <b>horizontal</b> <b>offset</b> change. The femoral side did not compensate for this displacement. SRA did not restore the biomechanics of the native hip. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the critical merger or strong interaction distance between two equal-potential-vorticity quasi-geostrophic vortices. The {{interaction between the}} two vortices depends on five parameters: their volume ratio, their height-to-width aspect ratios and their vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>offsets.</b> Due {{to the size of}} the parameter space, a direct investigation solving the full quasi-geostrophic equations is impossible. We instead determine the critical merger distance approximately using an asymptotic approach. We associate the merger distance with the margin of stability for a family of equilibrium states having prescribed aspect and volume ratios, and vertical offset. The equilibrium states are obtained using an asymptotic solution method which models vortices by ellipsoids. The margin itself is determined by a linear stability analysis. We focus on the interaction between oblate to moderately prolate vortices, the shapes most commonly found in turbulence. Here, a new unexpected instability is found and discussed for prolate vortices which is manifested by the tilting of vortices toward each other. It implies than tall vortices may merge starting from greater separation distances than previously thought. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
