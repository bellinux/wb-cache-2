5|$|Additional subclasses of glycerolipids are {{represented}} by glycosylglycerols, which are characterized {{by the presence of}} one or more sugar residues attached to <b>glycerol</b> via a glycosidic linkage. Examples of structures in this category are the digalactosyldiacylglycerols found in plant membranes and seminolipid from mammalian sperm cells.|$|E
5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and <b>glycerol.</b> The <b>glycerol</b> enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal <b>glycerol</b> moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The <b>glycerol</b> moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand does not fit easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{abundant}} {{throughout the world}} and live {{in a wide range}} of environments, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Cockroaches can withstand extremely cold temperatures, allowing them to live in the Arctic. Some species are capable of surviving temperatures of −188°F (−122°C) by manufacturing an antifreeze made out of <b>glycerol.</b> In North America, 50 species separated into five families are found throughout the continent. 450 species are found in Australia. Only about four widespread species are commonly regarded as pests.|$|E
5|$|Glycerophospholipids, usually {{referred}} to as phospholipids, are ubiquitous in nature and are key components of the lipid bilayer of cells, {{as well as being}} involved in metabolism and cell signaling. Neural tissue (including the brain) contains relatively high amounts of glycerophospholipids, and alterations in their composition has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Glycerophospholipids may be subdivided into distinct classes, based {{on the nature of the}} polar headgroup at the sn-3 position of the <b>glycerol</b> backbone in eukaryotes and eubacteria, or the sn-1 position in the case of archaebacteria.|$|E
5|$|In {{carbohydrate}} anabolism, simple {{organic acids}} {{can be converted}} into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch. The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate, lactate, <b>glycerol,</b> glycerate 3-phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis. Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose-6-phosphate {{through a series of}} intermediates, many of which are shared with glycolysis. However, this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse, as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes. This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately, and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and <b>glycerol</b> are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two {{equivalents}} of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the <b>glycerol</b> backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal lipopolysaccharide required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given <b>glycerol</b> phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E
5|$|X. bracteatum can {{be grown}} in large pots or window boxes, and is a good pioneer plant in the garden until other plants become more established. Lower-growing cultivars are {{suitable}} for hanging baskets and border plantings. The flowers attract butterflies to the garden. Dried flowers are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut flowers. The main factor limiting lifespan of dried flowers is the wilting of stems, so flowers are sometimes wired into arrangements. Immersing flowers in <b>glycerol</b> or polyethylene glycol also lengthens lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform. The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a <b>glycerol</b> molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron transport chain. These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron transport chain using a <b>glycerol</b> phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E
5|$|They have {{membranes}} {{composed of}} glycerol-ether lipids, whereas bacteria and eukaryotes have membranes composed mainly of glycerol-ester lipids. The {{difference is the}} type of bond that joins the lipids to the <b>glycerol</b> moiety; the two types are shown in yellow in the figure at the right. In ester lipids this is an ester bond, whereas in ether lipids this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments. Bacteria and eukaryotes do contain some ether lipids, but in contrast to archaea these lipids are not a major part of their membranes.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used compounds as a matrix are variations of <b>glycerol,</b> such as <b>glycerol,</b> deuteroglycerol, thioglycerol, and aminoglycerol. If the sample cannot dissolve in the chosen matrix, such as <b>glycerol,</b> a cosolvent or additive can be mixed with the matrix to facilitate the dissolving of the solid analyte. For example, chlorophyll A is completely insoluble in <b>glycerol,</b> but by mixing in {{a small amount of}} Triton X-100, a derivative of polyethylene glycol, the chlorophyll becomes highly soluble within the matrix. It {{is important to note that}} though a good signal may be achieved through <b>glycerol</b> or <b>glycerol</b> with an additive, there could be other matrix compounds that can offer an even better signal. Optimization of matrix compounds and concentration of solid analyte are vital for FAB measurements.|$|E
25|$|Usually this crude <b>glycerol</b> {{has to be}} purified, {{typically}} {{by performing}} vacuum distillation. This is rather energy intensive. The refined <b>glycerol</b> (98%+ purity) can then be utilised directly, or converted into other products. The following announcements were made in 2007: A joint venture of Ashland Inc. and Cargill announced plans to make propylene glycol in Europe from <b>glycerol</b> and Dow Chemical announced similar plans for North America. Dow also {{plans to build a}} plant in China to make epichlorhydrin from <b>glycerol.</b> Epichlorhydrin is a raw material for epoxy resins.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glycerol</b> {{released}} by lipase action is phosphorylated by <b>glycerol</b> kinase {{in the liver}} (the only tissue in which this reaction can occur), and the resulting <b>glycerol</b> 3-phosphate is oxidized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The glycolytic enzyme triose phosphate isomerase converts this compound to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is oxidized via glycolysis, or converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycerol</b> was {{historically}} {{used as an}} antifreeze for automotive applications {{before being}} replaced by ethylene glycol, which has a lower freezing point. While the minimum freezing point of a glycerol-water mixture is higher than an ethylene glycol-water mixture, <b>glycerol</b> is not toxic and is being re-examined for use in automotive applications. <b>Glycerol</b> is mandated for use as an antifreeze in many sprinkler systems.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} {{can be used}} {{to allow}} an organism to use a cheaper substrate such as <b>glycerol</b> instead of glucose. Because fermentation processes require glucose derived from foods, butanol production can negatively impact food supply (see food vs fuel debate). <b>Glycerol</b> is a good alternative source for butanol production. While glucose sources are valuable and limited, <b>glycerol</b> is abundant and has a low market price because it is a waste product of biodiesel production. Butanol production from <b>glycerol</b> is economically viable using metabolic pathways that exist in Clostridium pasteurianum bacterium.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, <b>glycerol</b> is {{a common}} {{component}} of solvents for enzymatic reagents stored at temperatures below 0°C due to the depression of the freezing temperature of solutions with high concentrations of <b>glycerol.</b> It is also used as a cryoprotectant where the <b>glycerol</b> is dissolved in water to reduce damage by ice crystals to laboratory organisms that are stored in frozen solutions, such as bacteria, nematodes, and mammalian embryos.|$|E
25|$|By <b>glycerol</b> {{gradient}} centrifugation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the blood}} stream, nascent {{chylomicron}} particles interact with HDL particles resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent chylomicron. The chylomicron {{at this stage}} is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (<b>glycerol</b> covalently joined to three fatty acids) that ultimately releases <b>glycerol</b> and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. <b>Glycerol</b> and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Glycerol</b> with σ=.48 was {{introduced}} in 1964, {{but it has a}} likelihood of exhibiting rebound effects and causing side effects such as hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, renal failure, hyperosmolar coma and nausea. When <b>Glycerol</b> is used, the dosage is 1.2 g/kg followed by 0.5-1 g/kg for 3–4 hours.|$|E
25|$|In {{a classic}} (1905) organic {{reaction}} called the Bally–Scholl synthesis, named after Oscar Bally and Roland Scholl, anthraquinone condenses with <b>glycerol</b> forming benzanthrone. In this reaction, the quinone is first reduced with copper metal in sulfuric acid (converting one ketone group into a methylene group) {{after which the}} <b>glycerol</b> is added.|$|E
25|$|Like {{ethylene}} glycol and propylene glycol, <b>glycerol</b> is a non-ionic kosmotrope that forms strong hydrogen bonds with water molecules, competing with water-water hydrogen bonds. This disrupts the crystal lattice formation of ice unless {{the temperature is}} significantly lowered. The minimum freezing point temperature is at about 36°F / 37.8°C corresponding to 60–70% <b>glycerol</b> in water.|$|E
25|$|Geological {{findings}} in 2013 showed that reactive phosphorus species (like phosphite) were in abundance {{in the ocean}} before 3.5 Ga, and that Schreibersite easily reacts with aqueous <b>glycerol</b> to generate phosphite and <b>glycerol</b> 3-phosphate. It is hypothesized that Schreibersite-containing meteorites from the Late Heavy Bombardment could have provided early reduced phosphorus, which could react with prebiotic organic molecules to form phosphorylated biomolecules, like RNA.|$|E
25|$|Paraxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, {{leading to}} {{elevated}} <b>glycerol</b> and {{free fatty acid}} levels in blood plasma.|$|E
25|$|Every living cell is {{encased in}} a {{membrane}} that separates it from its surroundings. Cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins, typically {{in the form of}} a bilayer. Phospholipids are derived from <b>glycerol</b> with two of the <b>glycerol</b> hydroxyl (OH) protons replaced by fatty acids as an ester, and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Once {{used for}} {{automotive}} antifreeze, <b>glycerol</b> {{has the advantage}} of being non-toxic, withstands relatively high temperatures, and is noncorrosive.|$|E
25|$|The chylomicrons {{circulate}} {{throughout the}} body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal. Lipoprotein lipase on the endothelial {{surfaces of the}} capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but {{to a lesser extent}} also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, <b>glycerol</b> and chylomicron remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes, but the <b>glycerol</b> and chylomicron remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using <b>glycerol</b> derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the fuel requirements of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the adipocyte.|$|E
25|$|Once {{freed from}} <b>glycerol,</b> the {{free fatty acids}} enter the blood, which {{transports}} them, attached to plasma albumin, throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Gluconeogenesis allows {{humans to}} {{synthesize}} some glucose from specific amino acids: from the <b>glycerol</b> backbone in triglycerides {{and in some}} cases from fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Increases {{the release}} of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. Plasma {{concentrations}} of <b>glycerol</b> and nonesterified fatty acids are increased by i.v. infusion of ANP in humans.|$|E
25|$|Succinic acid– Like <b>glycerol,</b> this {{is often}} formed early in fermentation. Usually found in {{concentrations}} of 500–1200mg/L, it is a minor acid in the overall acidity of wine.|$|E
25|$|One {{synthetic}} route to pyrrole involves the decarboxylation of ammonium mucate, the ammonium salt of mucic acid. The salt is typically heated in a distillation setup with <b>glycerol</b> as a solvent.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{permanganate}} {{is typically}} included in survival kits: as a fire starter (mixed with antifreeze {{from a car}} radiator or <b>glycerol),</b> water sterilizer, and for creating distress signals on snow.|$|E
25|$|Stimulation of fat {{breakdown}} in adipose tissue: The fatty acids released by lipolysis {{are used for}} production of energy in tissues like muscle, and the released <b>glycerol</b> provide another substrate for gluconeogenesis.|$|E
