500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice to be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E

500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{separation}} from Threapleton, Winslet met the director Sam Mendes when he {{offered her a}} part in a play. She refused the offer but began dating him.

Their son, Joe, was born later that year. The family divided their time in New York with frequent visits to their estate at Cotswolds in England, and describing her family routine in 2009, she said, [...] "we go to the park, kick a ball around, go to a museum, watch a movie together or just <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> home playing Monopoly". Amidst intense media speculation of an affair between Mendes and the actress Rebecca Hall, the couple announced their separation in 2010 and were divorced a year later. Winslet admitted to being heartbroken by the split, but remarked that [...] "there's no way I'm going to allow my children to be fucked up because my marriages haven't worked out".|$|E
500|$|Hummer was a [...] back to {{the basket}} player who {{generally}} defended opposing high school centers. He had an underdeveloped face-up game yet he was undersized to play that style of game in power conferences. Power conference schools questioned how much potential he had in a league where his low post skills would likely be defended by larger, stronger and/or more athletic players who relegated him to perimeter play. When Princeton head coach Sydney Johnson recruited him, the only competition was mid-major schools and Hummer {{was not interested in}} any of them. During his campus visit with his father at his brother Alex's (Princeton Class of 2011) dorm room, he decided at midnight to go <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Dan Mavraides room across campus, signalling to his father that he was pretty comfortable with Princeton and likely to attend. Due to Hummer's relationship with former Princeton and current Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball head coach John Thompson III, he was able to train at the Georgetown University gym over the summers. He also played in the Kenner League (the only National Collegiate Athletic Association–sanctioned summer league in the Washington, D.C.) during the summer.|$|E
500|$|Hoping to {{continue}} the series, Carter introduced a new central character to replace Mulder: Doggett. More than 100 actors auditioned for the role, with only about ten considered by the producers. Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees, and Phillips, Bochner and Bruce Campbell were considered for the role. In particular, Campbell, following his involvement with the sixth season episode [...] "Terms of Endearment", was considered, but, due to a contractual obligation, could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It was nice {{to be involved in}} that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> that party." [...] Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role". In the end, the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. Reportedly, Patrick was cast {{due to the fact that}} his featured role in [...] (1991) would attract a great 18- to 35-year-old male demographic to the show. In fact, Fox executives reported a 10 percent overall increase in the demographic, solely due to Patrick's casting.|$|E

500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
500|$|During {{her teenage}} years, Sevigny became rebellious: [...] "I was very well-mannered, {{and my mother}} was very strict. But I did <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the Mobil station and smoke cigarettes." [...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so I made my own clothes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} on stage nearly every weekend, even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers. The band soon {{became part of}} a circuit that also {{included}} the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law, and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma, a local all-ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline. Big-name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played {{on the main floor}}, while smaller acts were relegated to the basement, an area referred to as [...] "the Dungeon". The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage (which required a 100+ crowd to attend). [...] "Soma was like home away from home. All the punk kids who didn’t give a fuck about football games and proms or whatever came to <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> Soma," [...] claimed Hoppus. The band's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday, where the band opened for Face to Face. Hoppus' manager at the record store, Patrick Secor, fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime. The result was Buddha (1994), which the members of the band viewed as the band's first legitimate release. By this time, the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon, but Raynor's family relocated to Reno, Nevada, and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull. The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows, but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure.|$|E

This depiction of Australian culture was greeted with surprise by many Australians, and anger throughout the Australian coffee industry, which claimed the statements did not accurately reflect the industry, painted the Australian coffee drinker in a bad light, and expected that the industry would be negatively affected by the statements. In the same episode, McDonald's products were handed out to the studio audience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influx of}} {{newcomers}} to Aspen {{at the time were}} largely hippies and other countercultural types of the era. They were attracted to Aspen by its natural beauty, skiing and remoteness from larger population centers. It had been popularized in the writings of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, himself a transplant to the area who had almost been elected Pitkin County sheriff on a promise to put profiteering drug dealers in the stocks on the lawn of the county courthouse. During the 1970s, he was a regular at the J-Bar, coming in from his home in nearby Woody Creek to pick up his mail and then <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the bar, drinking, eating and watching television as it had the best reception in the area prior to cable becoming widespread.

2500|$|In {{the final}} episode produced, the writers {{attempted}} a [...] "relaunch" [...] of sorts by having Diana reassigned to the Los Angeles bureau of IADC {{with a new}} supporting cast. Though done {{in anticipation of a}} fourth season, the revamp was seen for only a single episode ("The Man Who Could Not Die"), which set up an assortment of new supporting characters. These included Dale Hawthorn, Diana's new IADC boss, Bret Cassiday (Bob Seagren), a genetically enhanced man who was indestructible (the titular character of the episode), as well as a streetwise youngster named T. Burton Phipps III who inexplicably is allowed to <b>hang</b> <b>out</b> <b>at</b> the IADC. Also added to the cast was a chimpanzee who, like Bret, is also indestructible. This episode was actually the last to be produced and should have ended the third season, but was shown out of sequence with the two-parter [...] "The Phantom of the Roller Coaster." [...] These final three episodes aired by themselves in August–September 1979, months after the broadcast of the rest of season three, creating a mini-season, though they remain grouped as part of season three as opposed to being considered an abbreviated fourth season.|$|E
