50|$|Bend-Or spots (or Ben d'Or, Smuts, or <b>Grease</b> <b>Spots)</b> are {{a type of}} spotted marking {{found on}} horses. They are fairly rare and range in color from {{slightly}} darker than the horse's coat to an almost-black shade. These random spots are most commonly seen on palominos, chestnuts, and darker horses, and may not appear until the horse is several years old. It is still unknown what causes these markings, as they {{do not appear to}} be related to other spotting patterns. However, they are often correlated with horses showing sooty traits.

5000|$|Wise Foods {{started as}} Wise Potato Chip Company, founded in Berwick, Pennsylvania, in 1921 {{by a young}} man named Earl Wise, Sr.. He owned Wise Delicatessen and began making potato chips as a way to make use of excess potatoes, {{initially}} cooking them in his mother's kitchen, and then selling them to customers in brown paper bags. At the time, potato chips were generally kept in glass display cases, or cracker barrels, and scooped into paper bags for customers. The bags developed <b>grease</b> <b>spots</b> and did not keep the chips fresh for very long, eventually leading to the development of waxed paper bags. Wise's chips proved an immediate hit with customers and soon the delicatessen owner became a regional potato chip mogul. He decided on an owl as a company mascot, a creature reputed to be [...] "wise," [...] the stylized eye of which remains the corporate logo. He had his first delivery truck by 1922, and opened his first production plant in 1925.|$|R

5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and <b>grease</b> <b>spots</b> to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|R
40|$|Peach skin {{discoloration}} (PSD) is {{a disorder}} that {{has also been}} called inking, ink spot, black spot, <b>grease</b> <b>spot,</b> purple streak, purple spot, browning, blackening, or streaking. For simplicity, any type of skin discoloration discussed here will {{be referred to as}} PSD. No microorganism, pathogenic or otherwise, has been isolated from affected fruit or identified as a cause of PSD. The disorder appears to result from a combination of physical, chemical, and physiological factors. PSD symptoms may vary from a barely detectable discoloration that, depending on the cause, can be reversible, to severe blackening that covers most of the fruit. Usually PSD is associated with red areas of the fruit, but there have been reports of browning, sometimes called <b>grease</b> <b>spot,</b> that is restricted to the yellow and orange areas. Most significant peach-producing areas worldwide have at some time reported PSD problems. Early work by Van Blaricom and Webb in South Carolina focused on identification of the cause of PSD. They induced PSD by exposing fruit to abrasion on sponge rubber rollers. Treatment with solutions of sodium carbonate, chlorinated water, hot water, zinc, copper, and iron all induced the development of PSD. However, in almost all cases, abrasion from contact with a variety of roller or brush types was necessary in order for the symptoms to appear. These results were later confirmed by Hopfinger in New Jersey who added ammonia exposure to the list of PSD causes. More recently, Crisosto and co-workers have conducted intensive studies in California to define the physical, chemical, an...|$|E
40|$|Causes, {{symptoms}} and treatment for pythium blight are covered here. Pythium blight, sometimes called 2 Ì† 2 <b>grease</b> <b>spot</b> 2 Ì† 2 or 2 Ì† 2 cottony blight, 2 Ì† 2 {{is no longer}} a disease of golf courses; it also is a serious problem in home lawns and other turfs. Caused by several species of Pythium fungi, the two most commonly associated with Pythium blight are Pythium aphanidermatum and P. graminicola. These fungi are in a group known as 2 Ì† 2 the water molds, 2 Ì† 2 a group that includes Phytophthora and other pathogenic genera. They are referred to as 2 Ì† 2 water molds 2 Ì† 2 because they function best under wet, saturated soil conditions. The Pythium species that attack turfgrass survive well in thatch, infected leaves and roots, and soil. These organisms are ubiquitous and capable of invading turfgrass leaves, crowns and roots from spring to fall...|$|E
40|$|A sensor is {{developed}} for simple, in situ characterization of dielectric thermal interface materials (TIMs) at bond line thicknesses less than 100 lm. The working principle {{is based on}} the detection of regions of contrasting electric permittivity. An array of long, parallel electrodes is flush-mounted into each opposing substrate face of a narrow gap interface, and exposed to the gap formed between the two surfaces. Electrodes are oriented such that their lengthwise dimension in one substrate runs perpendicular to those in the other. A capacitance measurement taken between opposing electrodes is used to characterize the interface region in the vicinity of their crossing point (junction). The electric field associated with each electrode junction is numerically simulated and analyzed. Criteria are developed for the design of electrode junction geometries that localize the electric fields. The capacitances between floating-ground electrodes in the electrode sensor configuration employed give rise to a nontrivial network of interacting capacitances which strongly influence the measured response at any junction. A generalized solution for analyzing the floating network response is presented. The technique is used to experimentally detect thermal <b>grease</b> <b>spots</b> of 0. 2 mm to 1. 8 mm diameter within a 25 lm interface gap. It is necessary to use the generalized solution to the capacitance network developed in this work to properly delineate regions of contrasting permittivity in the interface gap region using capacitance measurements...|$|R
50|$|Ground glass joints are {{translucent}} when physically free {{of debris}} and clean. Solvents, reaction mixtures, and old grease {{show up as}} transparent <b>spots.</b> <b>Grease</b> can be removed by wiping with an appropriate solvent; ether, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, or hexanes work well for silicone- and hydrocarbon-based greases. Fluoroether-based greases are quite impervious to organic solvents. Most chemists simply wipe them off as much as possible. However, some fluorinated solvents can remove fluoroether greases, but are more expensive than laboratory solvents.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{we figured}} out a {{proposition}} {{which seems to be}} as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle. And inside of thirty days you find us swarming into Kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the European plan. John Tom is Chief Wish-Heap-Dough, the famous Indian medicine man and Samaritan Sachem of the Seven Tribes. Mr. Peters is business manager and half owner. We needed a third man, so we looked around and found J. Conyngham Binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper. This Binkly has a disease for Shakespearian rÃ´les, and an hallucination about a 200 nights' run on the New York stage. But he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his William S. rÃ´les, so he is willing to drop to the ordinary baker's kind, and be satisfied with a 200-mile run behind the medicine ponies. Besides Richard III, he could do twenty-seven coon songs and banjo specialties, and was willing to cook, and curry the horses. We carried a fine line of excuses for taking money. One was a magic soap for removing <b>grease</b> <b>spots</b> and quarters from clothes. One was a Sum-wah-tah, the great Indian Remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the Great Spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men, the great chiefs McGarrity and Siberstein, bottlers, Chicago. And the other was a frivolous system of pick-pocketing the Kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction. Look ye! A pair of silk garters, a dream book, one dozen clothespins, a gold tooth, and 'When Knighthood Was in Flower' all wrapped up in a genuine Japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by Mr. Peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents, while Professor Binkly entertains us in a three-minute round with the banjo.|$|R

60|$|One cold {{morning at}} Penzance I {{got into an}} omnibus at the station {{to travel to the}} small town of St. Just, six or seven miles away. Just before we started, a party of eight or ten queer-looking people came hurriedly up and climbed to the top seats. They were men and women, with two or three children, the women {{carelessly}} dressed, the men chalky-faced and long-haired, in ulsters of light colours and large patterns. When we had travelled two or three miles one of the outside passengers climbed down and came in to escape from the cold, and edged into a place opposite mine. He was a little boy of about seven or eight years old, and he had a small, quaint face with a tired expression on it, and wore a soiled scarlet Turkish fez on his head, and a big pepper-and-salt overcoat heavily trimmed with old, ragged imitation astrachan. He was keenly alive to the sensation his entrance created among us when the loud buzz of conversation ceased very suddenly and all eyes were fixed on him; but he bore it very bravely, sitting back in his seat, rubbing his cold hands together, then burying them deep in his pockets and fixing his eyes on the roof. Soon the talk recommenced, and the little fellow, wishing to feel more free, took his hands out and tried to unbutton his coat. The top button--a big horn button-- resisted the efforts he made with his stiff little fingers, so I undid it for him and threw the coat open, disclosing a blue jersey striped with red, green velvet knickerbockers, and black stockings, all soiled like the old scarlet flower-pot shaped cap. In his get-up he reminded me of a famous music-master and composer of my acquaintance, whose sense of harmony is very perfect with regard to sounds, but exceedingly crude as to colours. Imagine a big, long-haired man arrayed in a bottle-green coat, scarlet waistcoat, pink necktie, blue trousers, white hat, purple gloves and yellow boots! If {{it were not for the}} fact that he wears his clothes a very long time and never has them brushed or the <b>grease</b> <b>spots</b> taken out, the effect would be almost painful. But he selects his colours, whereas the poor little boy probably had no choice in the matter.|$|R
40|$|Upholstery {{cleaning}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} problems regarding the inner maintenance of a vehicle. Finding solutions to the usual brewery <b>spots,</b> <b>grease</b> stains, sausage marks and their smells is complicated due to both the nature of the dirt and the tedious undo of seats. At the forefront of the nowadays use of carbon fluoride based products, we present here the development of a hydrophobic and stain-resistance fabrics by using nanotechnology. Hydrophobic fabrics are water-resistant, self-cleaning and guarantee a long lasting protection against dirt. The addition of nanoparticles into upholstery fabrics result in surfaces which keep the superficial tension of water or dirt drops.

6000|$|Frescobaldi's {{men were}} in {{possession}} everywhere they had turned the cook out of her kitchen and the waitress out of her pantry; the reluctant Irishman at the door was supplemented by a vivid Italian, who spoke French with the guests, and said, [...] "Bien, Monsieur," [...] and [...] "toute suite," [...] and [...] "Merci!" [...] to all, as he took their hats and coats, and effused a hospitality that needed no language but the gleam of his eyes and teeth and the play of his eloquent hands. From his professional dress-coat, lustrous with the <b>grease</b> <b>spotted</b> on it at former dinners and parties, they passed to the frocks of the elder and younger Dryfoos in the drawing-room, which assumed informality for the affair, but did not put their wearers wholly at their ease. The father's coat was of black broadcloth, and he wore it unbuttoned; the skirts were long, and the sleeves came down to his knuckles; he shook hands with his guests, and the same dryness {{seemed to be in}} his palm and throat, as he huskily asked each to take a chair. Conrad's coat was of modern texture and cut, and was buttoned about him as if it concealed a bad conscience within its lapels; he met March with his entreating smile, and he seemed no more capable of coping with the situation than his father. They both waited for Fulkerson, who went about and did his best to keep life in the party during the half-hour that passed before they sat down at dinner. Beaton stood gloomily aloof, as if waiting to be approached on the right basis before yielding an inch of his ground; Colonel Woodburn, awaiting the moment when he could sally out on his hobby, kept himself intrenched within the dignity of a gentleman, and examined askance the figure of old Lindau as he stared about the room, with his fine head up, and his empty sleeve dangling over his wrist. March felt obliged to him for wearing a new coat in the midst of that hostile luxury, and he was glad to see Dryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him, as if he wished to show him particular respect, though it might have been because he was less afraid of him than of the others. He heard Lindau saying, [...] "Boat, the name is Choarman?" [...] and Dryfoos beginning to explain his Pennsylvania Dutch origin, and he suffered himself, with a sigh of relief, to fall into talk with Kendricks, who was always pleasant; he was willing to talk about something besides himself, and had no opinions that he was not ready to hold in abeyance for the time being out of kindness to others. In that group of impassioned individualities, March felt him a refuge and comfort--with his harmless dilettante intention of some day writing a novel, and his belief that he was meantime collecting material for it.|$|R
