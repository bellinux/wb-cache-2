50|$|Boron (B) is the {{chemical}} element with atomic number 5, occurring as 10B and 11B. At standard temperature and pressure, boron is a trivalent metalloid that has several different allotropes. Amorphous boron is a brown powder {{formed as a}} product of many chemical reactions. Crystalline boron is a very hard, black material with a high melting point and exists in many polymorphs: Two rhombohedral forms, α-boron and β-boron containing 12 and 106.7 atoms in the rhombohedral unit cell respectively, and 50-atom tetragonal boron are the most common. Boron has a density of 2.34−3. Boron's most common isotope is 11B at 80.22%, which contains 5 protons and 6 neutrons. The other common isotope is 10 at 19.78%, which contains 5 protons and 5 neutrons. These are the only stable isotopes of boron; however other isotopes have been synthesised. Boron forms covalent bonds with other nonmetals and has oxidation states of 1, 2, 3 and 4.Boron does not occur naturally as a free element, but in compounds such as borates. The most common sources of boron are tourmaline, borax, Na2B4O5(OH)4·8H2O, and <b>kernite,</b> Na2B4O5(OH)4·2H2O. it is difficult to obtain pure boron. It can be made through the magnesium reduction of boron trioxide, B2O3. This oxide is made by melting boric acid, B(OH)3, which in turn is obtained from borax. Small amounts of pure boron can be made by the thermal decomposition of boron bromide, BBr3, in hydrogen gas over hot tantalum wire, which acts as a catalyst. The most commercially important sources of boron are: sodium tetraborate pentahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 5H2O, which is used in large amounts in making insulating fiberglass and sodium perborate bleach; boron carbide, a ceramic material, is used to make armour materials, especially in bulletproof vests for soldiers and police officers; orthoboric acid, H3BO3 or boric acid, used in the production of textile fiberglass and flat panel displays; sodium tetraborate decahydrate, Na2B4O7 · 10H2O or borax, used in the production of adhesives; and the isotope boron-10 is used as a control for nuclear reactors, as a shield for nuclear radiation, and in instruments used for detecting neutrons.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the mineral <b>kernite</b> has been reinvestigated, using {{a new set of}} accurate X-ray diffractometer data. The conventional least-squares refinement leads to a final value of R. (F) of 3. 6 percent (R(F) = 3. 4 Vo). Determination of the net atomic charges with the Extended L-shell (ELS) method gives partial positive charges for the sodium (0. 4 - 0. 5 units) and boron (0. 4 - 0, 7 units) and negative charges (0. 4 - 0. 5 units) for the oxygen atoms. No dif-ference in charge was detected between trigonal and tetrahedral boron and between bridging and hydroxylic oxygen atoms, The value of the least-squares scale factor is quite sensitive {{to the nature of the}} atomic scat-tering factors used. The result of an experimental measurement of the scale factor shows that the atomic densities in <b>kernite</b> are described better by contracted Slater-type orbitals than by isolated atom Hartree-Fock orbitals. Difference density maps based on high-order refinements (sin a/x> 0. 6 A-') show more density in the B-O than Na-O bonds, supporting the covalent nature of the bonds between boron and oxygen atoms...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} to study shock-release of volatiles from minerals. Impact-induced loss of bound water from hydrous minerals has been observed, using infrared absorption and X-ray powder diffractometer techniques. Serpentine (Mg 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and nontronite (. 5 Ca(0. 7) Fe 4 /(Si(7. 3) Al(0. 7)) O 20 /(OH) 4. nH 2 O) were shocked and recovered from pressures of up to 38 GPa, using one-dimensional shock reverberation techniques. <b>Kernite</b> (Na 2 B 4 O 7. 4 H 2 O) was impacted by a spherical pyrex projectile traveling at 4. 89 km/sec, which produced a peak pressure of approximately 33 GPa. The infrared absorption spectra indicate {{that some of the}} bound water from these three minerals was released as a result of shock compression and subsequent rarefaction. This evidence is supported by the recovery of small amounts of vapor from the serpentine shocked to 23. 5 GPa and the nontronite shocked to 18 GPa. The recovered vapor is inferred to be water from the shocked minerals. X-ray diffraction spectra indicate no major changes in the unit cell dimensions of the two silicates, except for a decrease in the lattice constant in the c-direction of the nontronite, consistent with the loss of interlayer water...|$|E
