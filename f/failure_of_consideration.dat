60|$|The {{hour was}} so early for general {{commerce}} that Nick immediately guessed his visitor {{had come on}} some rare errand; but this inference yielded to the reflexion that Peter might after all only wish to make up by present zeal for not having been near him before. He forgot that, as he had subsequently learned from Biddy, their foreign, or all but foreign, cousin had spent an hour in Rosedale Road, missing him there but pulling out Miriam's portrait, {{the day of his}} own last visit to Beauclere. These young men were not on a ceremonious footing and it was not in Nick's nature to keep a record of civilities rendered or omitted; nevertheless he had been vaguely conscious that during a stay in London elastic enough on Peter's part he and his kinsman had foregathered less than of yore. It was indeed an absorbing moment in the career of each, but even while recognising such a truth Nick judged it not impossible that Julia's brother might have taken upon himself to resent some suppositions <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>consideration</b> for that lady; though this indeed would have been stupid and the newly appointed minister (to he had forgotten where) didn't often make mistakes. Nick held that as he had treated Julia with studious generosity she had nothing whatever to visit on him--wherefore Peter had still less. It was at any rate none of that gentleman's business. There were only two abatements to disposing in a few frank words of all this: one of them Nick's general hatred of talking of his private affairs (a reluctance in which he and Peter were well matched); and the other a truth involving more of a confession--the subtle truth that the most definite and even most soothing result of the collapse of his engagement was, as happened, an unprecedented consciousness of freedom. Nick's observation was of a different sort from his cousin's; he noted much less the signs of the hour and kept throughout a looser register of life; nevertheless, just as one of our young men had during these days in London found the air peopled with personal influences, the concussion of human atoms, so the other, though only asking to live without too many questions and work without too many rubs, to be glad and sorry in short on easy terms, had become aware of a certain social tightness, of the fact that life is crowded and passion restless, accident and community inevitable. Everybody with whom one had relations had other relations too, and even indifference was a mixture and detachment a compromise. The only wisdom was to consent to the loss, if necessary, of everything but one's temper and to the ruin, if necessary, of everything but one's work. It must be added that Peter's relative took precautions against irritation perhaps in excess of the danger, as departing travellers about to whiz through foreign countries mouth in phrase-books combinations of words they will never use. He was at home in clear air and disliked to struggle either for breath or for light. He had a dim sense that Peter felt some discomfort from him and might have come now to tell him so; in which case he should be sorry for the sufferer in various ways. But as soon as that aspirant began to speak suspicion reverted to mere ancient kindness, and this {{in spite of the fact}} that his speech had a slightly exaggerated promptitude, like the promptitude of business, which might have denoted self-consciousness. To Nick it quickly appeared better to be glad than to be sorry: this simple argument was more than sufficient to make him glad Peter was there.|$|E

Finite element thermal stress analyses of anode models under spatially uniform temperature fields of increasing magnitude are performed, {{and the effects of}} temperature-dependent material properties and plasticity on mechanical integrity are investigated. Linear elastic material models are found to underestimate the probability <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the anode at high temperatures. Analyses of cathode models are performed to study the effects of temperature-dependent material properties and varying phase volume fractions. An approximate heuristic scheme based on boundary pixel modification is developed, validated, and used to derive a microstructure of varying composition from the original microstructure.

AIMS: To verify {{the value of a}} new exam two weeks into medical school as a predictor <b>of</b> <b>failure,</b> and explore the requirements for a preventative intervention. METHODS: Students who failed the two-week exam were invited to a series of large-group workshops and small-group follow-up meetings. Participants' subsequent exam performance was compared with non-participants. RESULTS: About 71 % of students who performed poorly in the new exam subsequently failed a course. Attendance at the workshops made no difference to short- or long-term pass rates. Attendance at more than three follow-up small group sessions significantly improved pass rates two semesters later, and was influenced by teacher experience. CONCLUSIONS: Close similarity between predictor task and target task is important for accurate prediction <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> <b>Consideration</b> should be given to dose effect and class size in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> at-risk students, and we recommend a systemic approach to intervention/remediation programmes, involving a whole semester of mandatory, weekly small group meetings with experienced teachers...|$|R

The use of performance indicators (PIs) can {{play a key role}} in the process of measuring the quality of service provided by the water utility, can simplify the comparison between different objectives, and help decision processes involved in the planning and management phases. The use of PIs like reliability, resiliency and vulnerability have been approved by many authors and researchers, and led to the achievement of wide numbers of research studies in multidisciplinary scientific fields (Hashimoto et al., 1982; Fiering, 1982 a; Merabtene et al., 2002). In reality, in WDS, different kinds <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> like that related to pressure, flow and water quality are linked with similar or same parameters. As a results, when one kind <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> occurred it also influences the other type <b>of</b> <b>failure.</b> Therefore, <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> holistic system performance with regards to various aspects will make the process more complicated but decision makers will potentially gain insights into the performance of the whole system as well as the information on the impacts of each component and aspect on improving the overall performance. The proposed methodology is based on a hierarchical system approach that begins by identifying two aspects namely; hydraulic and water quality aspects, which could be divided broadly into available nodal pressure and available flow, and available free residual chlorine concentration, respectively. Then, based on these services, three complementary reliability estimators (index) are adopted namely; demand-reliability, pressure-reliability, and quality-reliability. To reach the outcome of the proposed approach which is the overall reliability, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) coupled with fuzzy theory is then developed to bring all the reliability estimators into a unique platform and aggregate them into one index. The final model outcome is a single index that depicts the overall reliability which resembles both the hydraulic and water quality performances, and provides a comprehensive evaluation of the system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Integrated {{architectures}} in {{the automotive}} and avionic domain promise improved resource utilization and enable a better tactic coordination of application subsystems compared to federated systems. In {{order to support}} safety-critical application subsystems, an integrated architecture needs to support fault-tolerant strategies that enable the continued operation of the system in the presence <b>of</b> <b>failures.</b> The basis for the implementation and validation of fault-tolerant strategies is a fault hypothesis that identifies the fault containment regions, specifies the failure modes and provides realistic failure rate assumptions. This paper describes a fault hypothesis for integrated architectures, which {{takes into account the}} collocation of multiple software components on shared node computers. We argue in favor of a differentiation of fault containment regions for hardware and software faults.
