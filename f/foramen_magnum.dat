5|$|Lack of CSF {{pressure}} and volume can allow {{the brain to}} sag and descend through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> (large opening) of the occipital bone, {{at the base of}} the skull. The lower portion of the brain is believed to stretch or impact one or more cranial nerve complexes, thereby causing a variety of sensory symptoms. Nerves that can be affected and their related symptoms are detailed in the table at right.|$|E
5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum.</b> The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine. Like other lorisids, its snout does not taper towards {{the front of the}} face as it does in lemurs, making the face appear less long and pointed. Compared to the slender lorises, the snout of the slow loris is even less pointed. As with other members of Lorisidae, its interorbital {{distance}} is shorter than in lemurs. The skull has prominent crests (ridges of bone). A distinguishing feature of the slow loris skull is that the occipital bone is flattened and faces backward. The <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> (hole through which the spinal cord enters) faces directly backward. The brains of slow lorises have more folds (convolutions) than the brains of galagos.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn Malpolon monspessulana, the nervus oculomotorius {{arises from}} the ventral side of the pars peduncularis mesencephali of the {{midbrain}} by a single root. It runs closely applied to both the nervus abducens and the ramus nasalis of the nervus trigeminus. These nerves together with the nervus trochlearis leave the cranial cavity through the <b>foramen</b> orbitale <b>magnum.</b> Within this <b>foramen</b> the nervus oculomotorius divides into two rami: superior and inferior. The two rami innervate the rectus superior, rectus inferior, rectus medialis and the obliquus inferior muscles. The nervus trochlearis {{arises from the}} lateral side of the mesencephalon by a single root and passes to innervate the obliquus superior muscle. The nervus abducens arises from the ventral side of the medulla oblongata by a single root and passes for a distance through the vidian canal excavated in the parachordal cartilage. It innervates the rectus lateralis muscle. The eye muscle nerves carry special somatic motor fibres. The ciliary ganglion receives the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres from the ramus inferior of the nervus oculomotorius via the radix ciliaris brevis. Both the radix ciliaris longa and sympathetic root are absent. The ciliary ganglion is a well defined mass located in the postorbital region, irregular in shape formed of one type of neuron and gives off only one ciliary nerve...|$|R
40|$|Vibratory mode of {{the infant}} skull was {{observed}} and analysed by holography to elucidate the mechanism of bone-conduction hearing in the childhood. Three dried human infant skulls, one of six months, two of eight months postnatal age, were used. As the cranial suture was incomplete with the wide fonticulus remaining and the composition was not so dense or strong {{as that of the}} adult, very careful manipulation was needed in the experiment with the infant skull. Consequently, an acoustic loud-speaker was utilized to make the infant skull vibrate in the free sound field, instead of using direct vibrator conventionally attached to the adult skull for the measurement of vibration. An area around the <b>foramen</b> occipitale <b>magnum</b> was fixed by means of bolts, and the skull was stood on a table. Attempts were made to change the frequency and intensity of the test sounds during the experiment. The sound pressure level of the sound field was measured with a noise meter. The value measured {{at the site of the}} skull closest to the loud-speaker was regarded as the intensity of the test sound. The resulting pattern of vibration was recorded and reconstructed by holographic interferometry. As the light source for holography helium-neon laser was used. Interference fringes were observed at 110 phon or more of the intensities of the test sounds. When frequency of the test tone was low such that 500 Hz or less, interference fringes of parallel lines were observed in the hologram. This meant the skull was found to vibrate as a whole, and the sound signal seemed to be transmitted by "inertia bone-conduction" in the mechanism of hearing when the frequency of the test sound was 500 Hz or less. on the other hand, at 1 kHz and more of the test frequency, the vibratory pattern changed into concentric fringes with multiple maximum points of amplitude. Then, it was clarified that when the frequency was 1 KHz or more, "compression bone-conduction" was added up in the hearing mechanism. At about 3 KHz of test sound, the vibratory amplitude was larger than any other frequencies used, suggesting that 3 KHz was the closest to the resonance frequency {{of the infant}} skull...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} cattle slaughtering process {{includes some}} critical stages where a dissemination of Specified Risk Material (SRM: brain, spinal cord) within or onto the carcass {{and within the}} slaughterhouse environment can occur. These processes are captive bolt stunning, removal {{of the head and}} first of all carcass splitting (sawing the spine lengthways). Captive bolt (CB) stunning results in massive brain tissue damage with bleeding, and in some cases brain tissue also emerges from the CB hole. As the heart is still functioning, there is a risk of brain tissue particles being transferred v i a the blood flow to heart and lungs or even in the whole carcass. This contamination risk is actually assessed to be low, but a continuing leakage of Central Nervous System (CNS) material from the captive bolt aperture in the further slaughter process may lead to direct and indirect contamination of carcass, meat and equipment. Therefore alternative stunning methods like electrical stunning or concussion stunning are discussed. A further critical point is the treatment of the head. When the head is removed, the spinal cord is cut with a knife. There is a danger of cross contamination due to spinal protein that may adhere to the knife and because of liquid cerebralis, which leaks from the <b>foramen</b> occipitale <b>magnum.</b> Further head cleaning with hand-held hoses following skinning also includes the danger of cross contamination from cleaning water or aerosol. Therefore measures regarding the safe handling of head and harvesting of head meat are proposed. The most critical point in terms of contamination of the meat surface with SRM is the currently common practise of sawing the spine vertically in the middle with hand-guided belt-type saws. A m i x t u r e of sawing residues and rinsing water (sawing sludge) collects in the housing of the saw, and if it contains infectious material this leads to contamination of the subsequent carcasses. The most promising methods available at present for minimising this risk appear to be in manual cattle slaughtering boning the entire (not split) carcass, either still warm or refrigerated and in industrial beef cattle slaughtering extraction of the spinal cord by vacuum from the whole carcass followed by conventional sawing or completely sawing out the spine including spinal ganglia...|$|R
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum,</b> the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} arteries {{arise from}} the subclavian artery, and run through the transverse foramen of the upper six vertebrae of the neck. After exiting {{at the level of}} the first cervical vertebra, its course changes from vertical to horizontal, and then enters the skull through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum.</b> Inside the skull, the arteries merge to form the basilar artery, which joins the circle of Willis. In total, three quarters of the artery are outside the skull; it has a high mobility in this area due to rotational movement in the neck and is therefore vulnerable to trauma. Most dissections happen {{at the level of the}} first and second vertebrae. The vertebral artery supplies a number of vital structures in the posterior cranial fossa, such as the brainstem, the cerebellum and the occipital lobes. The brainstem harbors a number of vital functions (such as respiration) and controls the nerves of the face and neck. The cerebellum is part of the diffuse system that coordinates movement. Finally, the occipital lobes participate in the sense of vision.|$|E
5|$|The robust nasal bones, {{preserved}} {{in a single}} specimen, are widest at the front, a feature unusual among placentals that is also seen in armadillos, and are also unusually flat. The ethmoid labyrinth, in the nasal cavity, was large, suggesting that Plesiorycteropus had {{a good sense of}} smell. A much larger part of the nasal septum, which separates the left and right nasal cavities, is ossified than usual in other mammals; MacPhee could find a similar condition only in sloths, which have a very short nose. The lacrimal bone is relatively large. At it is a single lacrimal canal, which opens near the suture between the frontal and lacrimal bones, like in lipotyphlans. There is a small tubercle (absent in aardvarks) near this opening. The orbital cavity, which houses the eyes, is relatively short, similar to the situation in pangolins and armadillos. A distinct tubercle is present on the suture between the frontal and parietal bones in P.germainepetterae, but not P.madagascariensis. P.madagascariensis has a more expansive braincase and a less pronounced narrowing between the orbits. The foramen rotundum, an opening in the bone of the orbit, is present. The optic canal, which houses the nerves leading to the eyes, is narrow, suggesting that the eyes were small, similar to many other tenrecoids. As in pangolins and xenarthrans, little of the squamosal bone can be seen from above. The temporal lines on the braincase, which anchor muscles, are located lower in P.germainepetterae. Like in aardvarks, the parietals are relatively large. An interparietal bone is present. Unlike in anteaters and pangolins, the occiput (the back of the skull) is flat and vertical. Plesiorycteropus lacks notches above the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> (the opening that connects the brain to the spinal cord), which are present in aardvarks. The nuchal crest, a projection on the occiput, is straight in P.madagascariensis, but in P.germainepetterae it is interrupted in the middle, similar to the situation in armadillos and hyraxes.|$|E
40|$|Objective:  To {{evaluate}} {{variations in}} cerebellar tonsil position after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) in neurologically intact patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).   Methods: We retrospective evaluated 40 patients with AIS and no neurological symptoms that underwent PSF. Anteroposterior and sagittal standing radiographs, and sagittal hindbrain MRI were performed in all patients {{before and after}} spinal surgery.   The level of the cerebellar tonsil relative to the <b>magnum</b> <b>foramen</b> was measured according to the method described by Aboulezz (J Comput Assist Tomogr 1985). We evaluate variations in cerebellar tonsil position in relation to spinal correction and spinal elongation after PSF. Results: Mean preoperative magnitude of the curve was 53, 15 ° (SD 10, 46 °) and thoracic kyphosis was 35, 42 º (SD 12, 38 °). Mean postoperative values were 7, 45 º (SD 7, 33 °)   and 27, 87 º (SD 9, 03 °), respectively. This represents 86 % correction in the coronal plane (p< 0. 00001) and 25 % of kyphosis variation (p< 0. 00001). The average length of the spine in the coronal plane was 44, 5 cm (SD 5, 25 cm) in preoperative x-rays and 48, 27 cm (SD 4, 40 cm) in postoperative x-rays (p< 0. 00001).   The average length in the sagittal plane was 50, 87 cm (SD 4, 47 cm) in preoperative x-rays and 55, 13 cm (SD 3, 27 cm) in postoperative x-rays (p< 0. 00001). There {{was no significant difference}} in the position of the Cerebellar Tonsil before and after spinal correction (p= 0, 6042). In 10 (25 %) of the 40 patients, we observed caudal displacement in cerebellar tonsil position after PSF. Average displacement in these patients was 1, 22 mm (range 0. 1 - 2. 3 mm). In 21 patients we did not observe any variation and in 2 a cephalic displacement was measured. Conclusions:  In most AIS patients, position of the cerebellar tonsil does not change with PSF. We were not able to find any correlation between curve correction or spine elongation and variations in cerebellar tonsillar position...|$|R

Overall, the remainder of the cervical vertebrae are relatively short, being only 2.5 to 3 times {{as long as they are}} tall; they become increasingly shorter towards the back of the neck, like Lufengosaurus. Other basal sauropodomorphs, including Jingshanosaurus, have cervical vertebrae that are generally 3 to 4 times as long as they are tall. On the bottom of the centra of cervical vertebrae 4-9, there is a prominent keel as in Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, and other basal sauropodomorphs.

25|$|Although North American beavers are superficially {{similar to}} the European beaver (Castor fiber), several {{important}} differences exist between the two species. North American beavers tend to be slightly smaller, with smaller, more rounded heads; shorter, wider muzzles; thicker, longer, and darker underfur; wider, more oval-shaped tails; and longer shin bones, allowing them a greater range of bipedal locomotion than the European species. North American beavers have shorter nasal bones than their European relatives, with the widest point being at {{the middle of the}} snout for the former, and in the tip for the latter. The nasal opening for the North American species is square, unlike that of the European race, which is triangular. The <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> is triangular in the North American beaver, and rounded in the European.

500|$|The {{brainstem}} {{lies beneath}} the cerebrum {{and consists of}} the midbrain, pons and medulla.

2500|$|In {{tonsillar}} herniation, {{also called}} downward cerebellar herniation, transforaminal herniation, or [...] "coning", the cerebellar tonsils move downward through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> possibly causing compression {{of the lower}} brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as they pass through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum.</b> Increased pressure on the brainstem can result in dysfunction of the centers in the brain responsible for controlling respiratory and cardiac function.

2500|$|The {{signaling}} {{process to}} contract or relax the sternocleidomastoid begins in Cranial Nerve XI, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve nucleus {{is in the}} anterior horn of the spinal cord around C1-C3, where lower motor neuron fibers mark its origin. The fibers from the accessory nerve nucleus travel upward to enter the cranium via the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum.</b> The internal carotid artery to reach both the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the trapezius. After a signal reaches the accessory nerve nucleus in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the signal is conveyed to motor endplates on the muscle fibers located at the clavicle. Acetylcholine (ACH) is released from vesicles and is sent over the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic bulb. The ACH causes the resting potential to increase above -55mV, thus initiating an action potential which travels along the muscle fiber. Along the muscle fibers are t-tubule openings which facilitate {{the spread of the}} action potential into the muscle fibers. The t-tubule meets with the sarcoplasmic reticulum at locations throughout the muscle fiber, at these locations the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions that results in the movement of troponin and tropomyosin on thin filaments. The movement of troponin and tropomyosin is key in facilitating the myosin head to move along the thin filament, resulting in a contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{at least}} twelve {{distinct}} hypotheses as to how and why bipedalism evolved in humans, and also some debate as to when. Bipedalism evolved well before the large human brain or the development of stone tools. Bipedal specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago. Nonetheless, the evolution of bipedalism was accompanied by significant evolutions in the spine including the forward movement in position of the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum,</b> where the spinal cord leaves the cranium. Recent evidence regarding modern human sexual dimorphism (physical differences between male and female) in the lumbar spine has been seen in pre-modern primates such as Australopithecus africanus. [...] This dimorphism {{has been seen as}} an evolutionary adaptation of females to bear lumbar load better during pregnancy, an adaptation that non-bipedal primates would not need to make. Adapting bipedalism would have required less shoulder stability, which allowed the shoulder and other limbs to become more independent of each other and adapt for specific suspensory behaviors. [...] In addition to the change in shoulder stability, changing locomotion would have increased the demand for shoulder mobility, which would have propelled the evolution of bipedalism forward. The different hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and a number of selective forces may have acted together to lead to human bipedalism. It is important to distinguish between adaptations for bipedalism and adaptations for running, which came later still.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the nasal}} bones of Europasaurus, several are known, but few are {{complete}} or undistorted. The nasals are overlapped posteriorly by the frontal bones, and towards the side, they articulate bluntly with the prefrontals. Unlike the nasals of Giraffatitan, those in Europasaurus project horizontally forwards, forming {{a small portion}} of the skull roof over the antorbital fenestrae. Four frontals are known from Europasaurus, three being from the left and one being from the right. Because of their disarticulation, it is likely that the frontals never fused during growth, unlike in Camarasaurus. The frontals form a portion of the skull roof, articulating with other bones such as the nasals, parietals, prefrontals and postorbitals, and they are longer antero-posteriorly than they are wide, a unique character among a eusauropodan. Like in diplodocoids (Amargasaurus, Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus), as well as Camarasaurus, the frontals are excluded from the frontoparietal fenestra (or parietal fenestra when frontals are excluded). The frontals are also excluded from the supratemporal fenestra margin (a widespread character in sauropods more derived than Shunosaurus), and they only have a small, unornamented participation in the orbit. Several parietal bones are known in Europasaurus, which show a rectangular shape much wider than long. the parietals are also wide when viewed from the back of the skull, being slightly taller than the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> (spinal cord opening). The parietals comtribute to about half the post-temporal fenestra (opening above the very back of the skull) border, with the other region enclosed by the squamosal bones and some braincase bones. Parietals also form part of the edge of the supratemporal fenestra, which is wider than long in Europasaurus, like in Giraffatitan, Camarasaurus and Spinophorosaurus. Besides the before mentioned fenestra, the parietals also have a [...] "postparietal fenestra", something rarely seen outside of Dicraeosauridae. A triradiate postorbital bone is present in Europasaurus, which evolved as the fusion of the postfrontal and postosbital bone of more basal taxa. Between the anterior and ventrally projecting processes the postorbital forms the margin of the orbit, and between the posterior and ventral processes it borders the infratemporal fenestra.|$|E

The {{floor of}} the cranium {{consists}} {{of a series of}} cartilage bones, the basi-occipital (b.o.), basi-sphenoid (b.sp.), pre-sphenoid (p.sp.), and in front, the ethmoid (eth.), which sends down a median plate, not shown, in the figure, to form the nasal septum between right and left nasal passages. Like extended wings {{on either side of the}} basi-occipital are the ex-occipital (e.o.) (the bone is marked in Figure 4, but the letters are a little obscured by shading). Similarly the ali-sphenoids (a.s.), are wings to the basi-, and the orbito-sphenoids (o.s.), to the pre-sphenoid bone (p.sp.). Between the ex-occipital and ali-sphenoid there is wedged in a bone, the periotic (p.o.) containing the internal ear (Section 115). Above the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> the median supra-occipital bone completes what is called the occipital arch. A pair of parietals (pa.) come above the ali-sphenoids, and a pair of frontals (f.) above the orbito-sphenoids. At the side the brain case is still incomplete, and here the aquamosal (sq.) enters into its wall. In the external view (Figure 3) the bulla hides the periotic bone from without. The student should examine all four figures for these bones before proceeding.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} feature in bipedal mammals. One of the attributes of a bipedal animal’s <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> is a forward shift of the anterior border; this is caused by the shortening of the cranial base. Studies on the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> position have shown a connection to the functional influences of both posture and locomotion. The forward shift of the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> is apparent in bipedal hominins, including modern humans, Australopithecus africanus, and Paranthropus boisei. This common feature of bipedal hominins is the driving argument used by Michel Brunet that Sahelanthropus tchadensis was also bipedal, and may be the earliest known bipedal ape. The discovery of this feature has given scientists another form of identifying bipedal mammals.|$|E
50|$|The {{occipital}} bone articulates with the atlas near the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum.</b> The atlas articulates with the occipital condyle superiorly and the axis inferiorly. The spinal cord {{passes through the}} <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> providing continuity for {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Articulation of the neck includes: flexion, extension, (nodding yes), and rotation (shaking head no).|$|E
50|$|The <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> (great hole) {{is a large}} oval opening (foramen) in the {{occipital}} bone of the skull in humans and various other animals. It {{is one of the}} several oval or circular openings (foramina) in the base of the skull. The spinal cord, an extension of the medulla, passes through the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> as it exits the cranial cavity. Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the <b>foramen</b> <b>magnum</b> transmits the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the tectorial membranes and alar ligaments. It also transmits the spinal component of the accessory nerve into the skull.|$|E
