5|$|After graduating, Hartman studied art at Santa Monica City College, {{dropping}} out in 1969 {{to become a}} roadie with a rock band. He returned to school in 1972, this time studying <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> at California State University, Northridge. He developed his own <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> business, which he operated on his own, creating over 40 album covers for bands including Poco and America, as well as advertising and the logo for Crosby, Stills & Nash. In the late 1970s, Hartman made his first television appearance on an episode of The Dating Game; he won but was stood up by his date.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conformance level (PPML/GA) {{defines a}} level of PPML for {{increased}} interoperability. This conformance level requires a <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conformant PPML consumer to support: PostScript, PDF, TIFF and JPEG resources, and to process these files in a standardized manner. A PPML producer that generates a PPML dataset that conforms to the <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conformance level (PPML/GA) can then be printed using any <b>Graphics</b> <b>Art</b> Conforming consumer. Conformance of a PPML/GA dataset can be validated with the CheckPPML tool.|$|R
5|$|The Minneapolis–St. Paul area is {{the second}} largest {{economic}} center in the Midwest, behind Chicago. The economy of Minneapolis today is based in commerce, finance, rail and trucking services, health care, and industry. Smaller components are in publishing, milling, food processing, <b>graphic</b> <b>arts,</b> insurance, education, and high technology. Industry produces metal and automotive products, chemical and agricultural products, electronics, computers, precision medical instruments and devices, plastics, and machinery. The city at one time produced farm implements.|$|E
5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach <b>graphic</b> <b>arts,</b> printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably because one of main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E
5|$|Kraków hosts many annual and {{biannual}} artistic events, some {{of international}} significance {{such as the}} Misteria Paschalia (Baroque music), Sacrum-Profanum (contemporary music), the Cracow Screen Festival (popular music), the Festival of Polish Music (classical music), Dedications (theatre), the Kraków Film Festival (one of Europe's oldest short films events), Etiuda International Film Festival (the oldest international art-film event in Poland), Biennial of <b>Graphic</b> <b>Arts,</b> and the Jewish Culture Festival. Kraków was the residence of two Polish Nobel laureates in literature, Wisława Szymborska and Czesław Miłosz; a third Nobel laureate, the Yugoslav writer Ivo Andric, lived and studied in Kraków. Other former longtime residents include internationally renowned Polish film directors Andrzej Wajda and Roman Polanski, {{both of whom are}} Academy Award winners.|$|E

5|$|The IOC {{does not}} track medalists in Olympic art {{competitions}} in its database {{and thus the}} prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges {{were not required to}} distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem Ode to Sport under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, {{as if it were a}} joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} other art forms, a single {{painting}} category was on the program until 1928, when it was split out into three sub-categories: drawings, <b>graphic</b> <b>arts,</b> and paintings. The categories then changed {{at each of the}} following Olympic Games. In 1932, the three categories were: paintings, prints, and watercolors/drawings. Four years later, the prints category had disappeared, and had been replaced by <b>graphic</b> <b>arts</b> and commercial graphic art. At the final Olympic art competition, the three categories were applied arts and crafts, engravings/etchings, and oils/water colours.|$|E

40|$|The {{imaging and}} <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> {{industry}} {{is one of}} the higher GDP (Gross Domestic Product) generating industries in the UK. Generally, the quality of imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> products depends on the properties of the imaging fluids, which are, in turn, determined by the physico-chemical interactions within the fluid, the imaging system and the imaging substrate. Despite the fact that the imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> industry has been in existence for over one hundred years, it has thus far been difficult to understand many fundamental aspects of the physico-chemical interactions involved with the imaging process. To some extent, this has hindered the development of high quality imaging fluids, especially for more challenging imaging and <b>graphic</b> <b>art</b> work.
