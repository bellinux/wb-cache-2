25|$|Weta created {{numerous}} {{pieces of}} prosthetics, {{and would have}} to monitor them on set too. They created 1800 Orc body suits to go with 10,000 Orc heads, lasting six days and one day respectively. Weta also spent a year creating Hobbit feet that would look like furry feet yet act as shoes for actors. In total, 1800 pairs were used by the four lead actors during production. Actors would also <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> face casts to create pointed ears and false noses. Most extensive was John Rhys-Davies as Gimli, who would spend four-and-a-half hours in the morning to apply Dwarven prosthetics. Gino Acevedo also worked on created realistic skin tones for the actors, such as Bernard Hill's possessed Théoden and a younger Bilbo. Peter(s) King and Owen also led the make-up department in making numerous wigs and creating general dirt on the actors. As well as applying make-up, {{at the end of the}} day there was an hour of carefully removing the make-up and prosthetics.

IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as [...] "the best thing" [...] in a film that [...] "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles". Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, [...] "Iron Man is far more than playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [...] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wisdens Somerset {{notes for}} the 1927 season give {{a view of}} Case's batting style. [...] "Cramped in style, and with {{scarcely}} any free use of wrists or shoulders, Case yet batted far better than could {{be seen from the}} ring," [...] it said. [...] "His defence was very difficult to get through and, with little uplift of his bat, he put unexpected power into his drives and pulls." [...] A more recent account is more forthright: [...] "The kindest adjective to evoke his style was probably ugly," [...] wrote David Foot in a 1986 history of Somerset cricket. [...] "He didn't <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> back lifts and expansive sweeps of the blade; he didn't really <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> attacking shots at all. There was no athleticism in his movement." [...] Foot recounts a story from a match against Nottinghamshire in which Bill Voce was experimenting with leg theory bowling: [...] "(Case) missed the ball, fell in a ludicrous heap and then picked up a stump instead of the bat." ...|$|E
