40|$|BACKGROUND: Accurate {{measurement}} of food intake {{is the cornerstone}} of understanding the links between diet and optimal health status or risk of disease. The utilization of metabolomics approaches is revolutionizing the field of dietary assessment by associating metabolic profiles with intake of specific foods or dietary patterns and/or investigating human health status in nutritional trials. Combining dietary biomarkers with conventional dietary assessment methods is considered a potential strategy for tackling the complexity of dietary exposure fingerprinting. SCOPE AND APPROACH: We discuss existing approaches among dietary assessment methods and dietary biomarkers. A combined approach taking into consideration data from dietary questionnaires with measurements of dietary biomarkers is emphasized. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Trends in novel strategies for improving dietary exposure assessment will be influenced by the discovery and validation of dietary exposure biomarkers. Among different strategies, multi-metabolite biomarker panels enable more reliable <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> than does the traditional single-biomarker approach. Therefore, a combined approach using data from dietary questionnaires along with measurements of dietary biomarkers is considered an excellent strategy for improving dietary exposure assessment...|$|E
30|$|The present general {{opinion is}} that the main route of PFC uptake is dietary with {{contaminated}} fish and game, constituting {{a majority of the}} exposure. Nonetheless, the representative data that would allow an <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> is not available. Therefore, in 2009, the EU launched the research project, PERFOOD, with the aim of improving the level of awareness about PFCs in foods. Among other things, the migration of PFCs from packaging material into foodstuffs is also to be studied. Additionally, other less studied pathways such as skin contact with PFC-treated utensils and inhalation of indoor air in particular should also be further studied. Comparatively, little data is, however, presently available on these paths of exposure. According to previous studies, the total daily PFC uptake is in the range of 2 to 200 ng/kg BW/day for PFOS and 3 to 14 ng/kg BW/day for PFOA. Admittedly, other PFCs such as FTOH or FOSE/FOSA may contribute to the internal contamination of humans. As a result of their lower body mass and increased hand-to-mouth contact, it may be assumed that the internal PFC contamination per kilogram body mass of children is greater than that of adults. In addition, PFOS and PFOA can cross the placental barrier and can pass into breast milk.|$|E
40|$|Previous Korean total diet studies (KTDSs) have {{estimated}} dietary exposure to toxic chemicals based on 110 - 120 representative foods selected from over 500 foods {{appeared in the}} Korea National Health & Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), which {{would result in a}} possible underestimation. In order to find measures for a closer-to-real estimate of dietary exposure to heavy metals, this study examined the feasibility of mapping foods to the representative foods in the KTDS by comparing estimates. In mapping, those foods not analyzed in the 2009 KTDS (443 out of 559 foods appeared in the 2007 KNHANES) were mapped to the 114 representative foods used in the 2009 KTDS based on the closeness in regards to biological systematics and morphological similarity. Dietary exposures to total mercury and lead were re-estimated using the content of total mercury and lead in 114 foods analyzed in the 2009 KTDS, food intake, and individual’s own body weight for respondents in the 2007 KNHANES instead of mean body weight of Koreans used in the 2009 KTDS. The re-estimates of exposure with mapping were approximately 50 % higher than the original estimates reported in the 2009 KTDS. In addition, mapping enabled the comparison of percentile distribution of the exposure among populations of different age groups. In conclusion, estimates via mapping resulted in a more comprehensive <b>estimation</b> <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> to heavy metals present in foods that Koreans consume...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the variability of concentration levels of allyl hexanoate, considered as a case study, in two main food categories to which it is often added: pineapple juice-based beverages and yogurts containing pineapple. Thirty-four beverages and 29 yogurts, with pineapple fruit or juice and added flavourings declared as ingredients on the package, were purchased from the local market (in Rome) and analysed. Analytical methods based on the stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) technique for the isolation of the target analyte, and on GC-MS analysis for final determination, were developed for the two food categories. In beverages, allyl hexanoate concentrations ranged from less than 0. 01 to 16. 71 mg l(- 1), whereas in yogurts they ranged from 0. 02 to 89. 41 mg kg(- 1). Average concentrations in beverages and yogurts with pineapple as the main fruit ingredient (1. 91 mg l(- 1) for beverages, 9. 61 mg kg(- 1) for yogurts) were in fair agreement with average use level data reported from industry surveys for the relevant food categories (4. 5 and 6. 0 mg kg(- 1), respectively). Within the group of yogurts a single product was found to contain a level of allyl hexanoate more than 10 -fold higher than the average reported use level. The screening techniques developed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) using use level data provided by industry gave estimates of exposure that were of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for regular consumers who would be loyal to the pineapple yogurt and beverage products containing the highest observed concentration of the substance of interest.

40|$|AbstractUncertainty {{analysis}} {{is an important}} component <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> assessments in order to understand correctly the strength and limits of its results. Often, standard screening procedures are applied in a first step which results in conservative estimates. If through those screening procedures a potential exceedance of health-based guidance values is indicated, within the tiered approach more refined models are applied. However, the sources and types of uncertainties in deterministic and probabilistic models can vary or differ. A key objective of this work has been the mapping of different sources and types of uncertainties to better understand how to best use uncertainty analysis to generate more realistic comprehension <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure.</b> In <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> assessments, uncertainties can be introduced by knowledge gaps about the exposure scenario, parameter and the model itself. With this mapping, general and model-independent uncertainties have been identified and described, as well as those which can be introduced and influenced by the specific model during the tiered approach. This analysis identifies that there are general uncertainties common to point estimates (screening or deterministic methods) and probabilistic exposure assessment methods.

Longitudinal studies indicated that cardiovascular status in adolescence predicts cardiovascular risk marker values in adulthood. Several diet quality indices for adolescents have been developed in the past, but literature concerning associations between indices and biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> and cardiovascular status is rather sparse. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyse associations <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> indices with biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure</b> and cardiovascular status. Methods: For the present analysis, data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS 2003 – 2006) were used. The analysis included 5, 198 adolescents, aged 12 to 17 [*]years. The Healthy Food Diversity Index (HFD), the Healthy Nutrition Score for Kids and Youth (HuSKY), the Indicator Food Index (IFI) and a simple fruit/vegetable intake index were derived from food frequency questionnaire information to indicate a healthy diet. Adjusted mean values for homocysteine, uric acid, CRP, total cholesterol, HDL-C, ferritin, HbA 1 c, folate, vitamin B 12 and BMI were calculated using complex-samples general linear models for quintiles of the different indices. Furthermore, the agreement in ranking between the different indices was calculated by weighted kappa. All statistical analyses were conducted for boys and girls separately, and were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Folate was positively associated with the HFD, the HuSKY, and fruit/vegetable intake for both boys and girls and with IFI for boys. Among girls, positive associations were seen between vitamin B 12 and the IFI and between diastolic blood pressure and the IFI as well as fruit/vegetable intake. A negative association was found between homocysteine and the HFD, the HuSKY, and the IFI for both boys and girls and with fruit/vegetable intake for boys. Among boys, uric acid and HbA 1 c were negatively and prevalence of obesity positively associated with the IFI. Conclusions: Overall, the indices, even the simpler ones, seem to have a similar general capability in predicting biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>dietary</b> <b>exposure.</b> To predict risk <b>of</b> cardiovascular disease <b>dietary</b> indices may have to be more specific...|$|R
