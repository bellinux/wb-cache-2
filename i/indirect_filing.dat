40|$|Today, {{much of our}} {{sensitive}} information is stored inside mobile applications (apps), such as the browsing histories and chatting logs. To safeguard these privacy files, modern mobile systems, notably Android and iOS, use sandboxes to isolate apps' file zones from one another. However, we show in this paper that these private files can still be leaked by indirectly exploiting components that are trusted by the victim apps. In particular, we devise new <b>indirect</b> <b>file</b> leak (IFL) attacks that exploit browser interfaces, command interpreters, and embedded app servers to leak data from very popular apps, such as Evernote and QQ. Unlike the previous attacks, we demonstrate that these IFLs can affect both Android and iOS. Moreover, our IFL methods allow an adversary to launch the attacks remotely, without implanting malicious apps in victim's smartphones. We finally compare the impacts of four different types of IFL attacks on Android and iOS, and propose several mitigation methods.

40|$|A {{large part}} of digital data {{communication}} relies on transferring information across computer networks {{in the form of}} file transfers. The three most important considerations for file transfers are making them as efficient, reliable and user friendly as possible. Setting up explicit file transfers over a direct connection can be very complicated for non specialists because most programs provide a swarm of details. This gives users greater control over their transfers but increases the chance of errors occurring. <b>Indirect</b> <b>file</b> transfers, such as those found over instant messaging systems, can be easy to set up but, they fail to utilize the full potential of users ‟ connections which slows down transfers. This project simplifies setting up direct file transfers by making them as autonomous as possible and only asking for user input where absolutely necessary. A rapid cyclic development approach has been followed where the program has been constantly reviewed by users providing feedback which has been acted upon. The result is a program which is very small (about 276 times smaller than Windows Live Messenger), very fast (bringing the utilization of the user‟s bandwidth up to 100 % in the upload and/o...|$|R

In RSX, this light pattern was created by an idle task that ran at the system's lowest scheduling priority. The light pattern was produced when the processor displayed the contents CPU register R0 when the [...] "WAIT" [...] instruction was executed. The RSX-11M light pattern was two sets of lights that swept outwards to the left and right from the center of the light display (or inwards if the IND <b>indirect</b> command <b>file</b> processor program was currently running). By contrast, the IAS light pattern was a single bar of lights that swept leftwards. Correspondingly, a jumbled light pattern (reflecting memory fetches) was a visible indication that the computer was under load as this meant that the system idle task was not being run. Other PDP-11 operating systems such as RSTS/E had their own distinctive patterns in the console lights.|$|R

40|$|BitTorrent {{has turned}} into the most popular P 2 P file sharing {{protocol}} and is used for various purposes such as Video on demand and Media Streaming. The fundamental problem with P 2 P networks in general is that quality of service highly depends on altruistic resource sharing by participating peers. Many peers freeride on the good intentions of others and BitTorrent is no exception. Current solutions like reputation systems and sharing ratio enforcement are complex, exploitable, inaccurate or unfair at times. The need to design scalable mechanisms that mitigate such problems is evident. We demonstrate through measurements that BitTorrent peers are able to barter pieces of different <b>files</b> (<b>indirect</b> interaction) which is a previously unknown property of the BitTorrent protocol. We introduce a centralized extension for the BitTorrent protocol which we {{refer to as the}} indirect interaction mechanism (IIM). IIM incentivizes seeding and mitigates problems of unfairness and exploitation {{while at the same time}} achieving linear scalability. We provide game theoretical models of the mechanism and demonstrate through analysis and simulations that IIM improves BitTorrent performance for certain cases and that it does not degrade performance for others. We conclude that IIM is a practical solution to the fundamental problem of P 2 P networks like BitTorrent.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files.
