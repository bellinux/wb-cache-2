5|$|After the {{completion}} of the film's 175-day run, novelist S. P. Chary accused the film of being based on a novel that he had written and published as a serial under the title Chanderi in a monthly magazine in 1998. He demanded that filmmakers compensate him for using his idea without consent, and threatened to take legal action if the producers did not heed his demands, or remade the film in another language. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deserved to be credited for the story and alleged that Allu Arjun and Allu Sirish were trying to postpone his acknowledgment by discussing the issue with him.|$|E
5|$|On October 30, the {{batteries}} opened fire. In four hours, a breach was largely {{opened in the}} ramparts. Then, an emissary {{came out with a}} white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort’s surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated {{at the beginning of the}} month at Patras. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage. The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.|$|E
5|$|Luzzaschi's book of madrigals for one, two, {{and three}} sopranos with {{keyboard}} accompaniment, published in 1601, comprises works written throughout the 1580s. This music {{may have been}} kept back from publication {{in order to maintain}} the secrecy of Alfonso's musica secreta, and to maintain control over it. Newcomb considers this publication the exemplar of the ladies' signature musical style. In 1584, Alessandro Striggio, responding to requests from Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, described the ladies and composed pieces imitating their style so that Francesco could start his own concerto delle donne. Striggio mentioned an ornamented four voice madrigal for three sopranos and a dialogue with imitative diminutions for two sopranos. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had forgotten the intabulation for the madrigal in Mantua, and noted that the skilled singer Giulio Caccini could play the bass part on either lute or harpsichord. This indicates both that male singers were probably not used after Brancaccio, and that instrumental accompaniments were a common and acceptable means of filling in the counterpoint.|$|E

5|$|On 18 April Keeler was {{attacked}} {{at the home}} of a friend. She accused Gordon, who was arrested and held. According to Knightley and Kennedy's account, the police offered to drop the charges if Gordon would testify against Ward, but he refused. The effects of the police inquiry were proving ruinous to Ward, whose practice was collapsing rapidly. On 7 May he met Macmillan's private secretary, Timothy Bligh, to ask that the police inquiry into his affairs be halted. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been covering for Profumo, whose Commons statement was substantially false. Bligh took notes but failed to take action. On 19 May Ward wrote to Brooke, with essentially the same request as that to Bligh, to be told that the Home Secretary had no power to interfere with the police inquiry. Ward then gave details to the press, but no paper would print the story. He also wrote to Wilson, who showed the letter to Macmillan. Although privately disdainful of Wilson's motives, after discussions with Hollis the prime minister was sufficiently concerned about Ward's general activities to ask the Lord Chancellor, Lord Dilhorne, to inquire into possible security breaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle the American wounded were loaded onto wagons and carried back to Fort Harrison for medical care. Most of the militia was {{released}} from duty on November 9 and returned home, {{but many of the}} long-time soldiers remained in the area a bit longer. In his initial report to Secretary William Eustis, Harrison informed him of a battle having occurred near the Tippecanoe River, giving the battle the river's name; <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> feared an imminent reprisal. The first dispatch did not make clear which side had won the conflict, and the secretary interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the United States victory clear, and the defeat of Tecumseh's confederacy became more certain when no second attack occurred. Eustis replied with a lengthy note demanding to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp. Harrison replied that he had considered the position strong enough without fortification. This dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War; as a result, he resigned from the army in 1814.|$|E

25|$|However, in a {{television}} show later that same day, he went to state {{he did not think}} that he was qualified for office and not even for any elected office. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> pulled this stunt to show the government and the SCAF that the criteria of 30,000 signatures is not a true obstacle to prevent non-serious candidates.|$|E

25|$|Representative Brad Sherman {{argued that}} there exist at least five other {{countries}} with a visa refusal rate of over 3% which were allowed into the program, and these rates were higher than Israel's 5.4% refusal rate. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believes that accepting Israel to the visa waiver program wouldn't cause discrimination, but rather end it, and criticized opponents of the bill {{as members of a}} campaign to delegitimize the state of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{disaster}} in the fourth task, this task further influenced the decision in later series to give Sir Alan the chance to fire more than one candidate outside of the interview stage.

25|$|On 9 May 2005, {{shortly after}} Michael Howard {{announced}} {{his intention to}} resign {{as leader of the}} Conservative Party, Soames resigned from the shadow cabinet.

Lord Henry tells us how at first <b>he</b> {{imagined}} <b>that</b> here was some mummery, some surprise prepared for the bridal couple by Sir John's tenants or the folk of Smithick and Penycumwick, and <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was encouraged in this belief by the circumstance that not a single weapon gleamed in all that horde of outlandish intruders.|$|R
25|$|Hagel {{was rumored}} to be a {{possible}} running mate for Vice President for then Senator Barack Obama, in his 2008 presidential campaign. On June 20, 2008, Hagel said he would consider running with Obama if offered the VP spot, though <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not believe that}} Obama would pick him for the position. At the time he also was mentioned as a potential United States Secretary of Defense to succeed incumbent Robert Gates in the Obama administration. Hagel said that he would consider serving if asked.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{denied the}} reported arrests {{of the opposition}} leaders, saying that they had gone missing in rebel-controlled parts of the city, but it later acknowledged that Choua was being held with prisoners of war, and the French ambassador was allowed to visit him in a military prison. He was freed from prison before March. Eventually, Yorongar also reemerged: he was found in Cameroon on March 2. He reached France on March 6, and claimed to have fled from Chadian security forces that had captured him. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh being punched and kicked by the same forces, perhaps to death.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the 2010 PGA Championship at Whistling Straits (near Kohler, Wisconsin), Mickelson {{announced}} he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had started medical treatment, and had become a vegetarian in hopes of aiding his recovery. He maintains that both his short- and long-term prognosis are good, that the condition should have no long-term effect on his golfing career, and that he currently feels well. He also stated that the arthritis may go into permanent remission after one year of medical treatment. He went on to finish the championship T12, five shots behind winner Martin Kaymer.|$|E

25|$|On November 7, 2016, Rucker told ESPN that he {{had become}} a partner in MGC Sports, a sports agency that {{currently}} represents golfers (among them Steve Stricker and Kenny Perry), football players, and coaches. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was planning to reduce his performance commitments from 100 dates per year to about 30, and that he thought that his experience in the entertainment business would be an asset to potential clients. Rucker will be able to work without restrictions for golfers, but because he is not registered with the NFL players' union, he initially will only be able to meet with NFL players under very limited circumstances.|$|E

Orić said he passed the time by working out and learning English. <b>He</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed that the behavior of an indictee in the detention unit and in the courtroom would reflect the severity of the prison term one would receive.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign {{may have helped}} reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers {{by the tens of}} thousands were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, and a chance to escape Jim Crow laws and violence. By 1934, when the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year. In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically. By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.|$|E
