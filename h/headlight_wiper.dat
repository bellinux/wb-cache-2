5000|$|... #Caption: 1974 Swedish police Valiant (Canadian-built export version) with {{headlight}} bezels {{removed to}} clear added <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Features {{vary from}} country to country, such {{features}} include heated seats, electric windows, other differences although rarer include cup holders, umbrella holder embedded in the driver's side B pillar and <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... climate control, {{automatic}} <b>headlights,</b> rain-sensitive <b>wipers</b> became {{standard equipment}} ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 the 99 {{was given}} a larger and {{stronger}} engine, a 1.85 L engine giving [...] on the carbureted model and [...] for the fuel-injected model. The 1.75 L engine was now only available with a carburetor. Saab also introduced <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers,</b> as well as larger rear-view mirrors and an additional air inlet beneath the existing grille. The dashboard {{was given a}} redesign along with new instruments.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, as {{interest}} in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced {{high pressure fluid}} headlamp washers {{on a variety of}} their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers</b> across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.|$|R
50|$|The US {{cars were}} fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Buyers outside North America could also opt for <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers</b> and washers and/or {{headlights}} {{with a special}} vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. Separate glass windshields for headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, {{which is why the}} DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass windshields at the same time.|$|R
50|$|The Vauxhall Cavalier Mk1 {{was also}} sold in LHD in some European countries, {{including}} Denmark, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, Italy, Sweden, and Switzerland. The Coupe was available with the 1.3 engine and in Scandinavia the car came with Manta-style <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers.</b> Vauxhalls were {{at one time}} sold alongside Opels in Europe but Vauxhall announced they were {{pulling out of the}} 11 other countries where they sold cars on 6 December 1979 and sales stopped in 1981, allowing General Motors to concentrate on the Opel brand in these markets.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} wind velocity, the weather {{parameters}} do not contribute with direct resistive forces. They do affect how well the vehicle power source works and they indicate that other power users may also be needed (air conditioning, <b>headlights,</b> windscreen <b>wipers,</b> etc.).|$|R
50|$|A3 Cabriolet Sport Final Edition is {{a version}} of A3 Cabriolet Sport model for the UK market, commemorating the end of A3 Cabriolet's {{production}} run. It included Vienna leather upholstery, front seat heating, rear parking sensors, automatic <b>headlight</b> and <b>wiper</b> activation, cruise control, a Bluetooth mobile phone interface.|$|R
50|$|The 6.9 lacked {{expected}} luxury touches such as power-adjustable outside mirrors or front seats, {{although a}} unique power rear seat, heated seats and even orthopedically designed front seats were options. Buyers outside North America could also opt for <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers</b> and washers and/or headlights {{with a special}} vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. There was also a new standard feature in 1976: most Mercedes-Benz automobiles that year were equipped with a sophisticated electronic climate control system developed for Chrysler Corporation for use in their top models. The system turned on the heater, air conditioner or both, depending on the thermostat's setting and ambient temperature, automatically maintaining whatever temperature the driver selected. The compressor was an American import as well, supplied by the Harrison division of General Motors.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda Legend was {{introduced}} for the 1987 model {{year and was}} virtually identical in equipment offered and vehicle dimensions to the North American model, with one trim designation called the V6-2.5i. This means very few options were available other than the choice of transmission, and an air conditioning system identical to the North American version. The Europeans were offered an optional [...] "Special Equipment Pack" [...] that offered cruise control, aluminium alloy wheels, a driver's seat with power lumbar support, height, fore/aft and reclining adjusters, adjustable rear headrests, a 4 speaker stereo system provided by Philips and <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers.</b> Front and rear mud flaps were standard in undisclosed countries but not all. The radio volume control rocker switch and preset radio scan button installed on the instrument binnacle was not offered.|$|R
25|$|From March, {{features}} such as Xenon headlamps, rain-sensitive windshield <b>wipers,</b> <b>headlight</b> washers, GPS navigation, and upgraded audio became standard for US models.|$|R
5000|$|At launch {{two models}} were available, 33 1.3 and 33 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro. [...] Both engines were SOHC boxers fed by a twin-choke carburettor, carried {{over from the}} Alfasud along with its 5-speed gearbox: a 1,350 cc {{developing}} [...] at 6,000 rpm, and a 1,490 cc developing [...] at 5,800 rpm. Unlike on the Alfasud, fifth gear acted like an overdrive gear and top speed was reached in fourth.The luxurious 1.5 Quadrifoglio Oro (Gold Cloverleaf in the UK) was distinguished by a silver grille, two-tone paintwork (metallic paint upper body separated by a brown tape from the dark brown lower body and bumpers) and clear front turn indicator lenses outside; by beige Texalfa leatherette/cloth interior, a woodtone steering wheel and shifter knob inside. Standard equipment included bronze tinted glass, <b>headlight</b> <b>wipers,</b> passenger side wing mirror and a trip computer.|$|R
5000|$|The Cascada shares {{much of its}} {{interior}} design with the Opel Astra J on which it is based. Specifications vary between brands however standard features shared between brands include electric park brake, sport seats, DAB Radio, auto <b>headlights</b> and <b>wipers,</b> cruise control, electric folding roof and 7.0" [...] Intellelink Infotainment System branded as MyLink for the Holden.|$|R
50|$|The Premium {{variant of}} the Suprima comes with {{exclusive}} interior kit not offered in the Executive trim, in particular the Anthracite-shade leather seats, front parking sensors and a built-in reverse camera. It also receives several features previously offered in the Prevé's Premium trim, namely the steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic <b>headlights</b> and <b>wipers,</b> climate control, cruise control and push-start engine ignition.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was also redesigned to improve comfort and space. New equipment included automated digital climate control/air conditioning on most models except {{the most basic}} and a multi function display for warning messages, trip computer, radio and external temperature. There was a more extensive use of wooden trim, better quality plastics, including soft touch plastics, and in addition some models received electrically folding mirrors, with automatic <b>headlights</b> and <b>wipers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Scénic II {{includes}} folding rear {{passenger seats}} with integrated table, a folding front passenger seat (on certain trim levels), automatic <b>headlights</b> and windscreen <b>wipers,</b> 'Child minder' mirror, {{as well as}} front and rear electric windows.|$|R
5000|$|... 200 strikers {{confronted the}} first Greyhound bus {{to depart from}} Seattle since the strike began. The bus was being driven by a non union driver and was heading to Portland. 15 police {{officers}} clashed with picketers while police in riot gear stood by. The bus suffered damage to its <b>headlights</b> and windshield <b>wipers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Though a 2-seater {{roadster}} {{in general}} design, the rear decklid can be lifted to reveal two extra seats. One {{of the most}} desirable features of the Bengal is its voice activated controls. The car is able to distinguish over 100 commands given to it by voice, which can operate various things from the <b>headlights,</b> windshield <b>wipers,</b> and convertible top, to the heater, navigation system, seat adjustments, and cruise control. The system was named Quiet Servant and it was developed by Visteon Corporation. The dashboard is free of traditional gauges, everything instead is displayed on demand on a single flat panel screen.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the main battery, the Leaf also has an auxiliary 12-volt lead–acid battery that provides power to the car computer systems and accessories such as the audio system, supplemental restraint systems, <b>headlights</b> and windshield <b>wipers.</b> The small solar panel on the Leaf rear spoiler helps to charge this accessory battery. (In the United States models, only comes with SL trim.) ...|$|R
50|$|Advanced new {{technology}} was also made available, including power folding mirrors, automatic and 'home safe' <b>headlights,</b> automatic windscreen <b>wipers,</b> Bluetooth with voice control, Trip computer, MP3 player connectivity and the Electronic Stability Program. In the United Kingdom, {{the car was}} available in Style+, Zetec and Titanium trim levels. (1, 2, 3 and '+' were the trim levels for the original Fusion).|$|R

5000|$|The Consul Capri {{included}} Ford Classic De-Luxe features, {{including four}} <b>headlights,</b> variable speed <b>wipers,</b> 9.5 in front disc brakes, dimming dashboard lights, and a cigar lighter. The four-speed transmission was available {{with either a}} column or floor change. It was proclaimed as [...] "The First Personal car from Ford of Great Britain" [...] (Ford of Great Britain, sales literature, December 1961) ...|$|R
50|$|The Cougar {{continued}} to be a Mustang twin for seven years, and could be optioned as a muscle car. Nevertheless, the focus continued away from performance and toward luxury, evolving it into a plush pony car. The signs were becoming clear as early as 1970, when special options styled by fashion designer Pauline Trigère appeared, a houndstooth-patterned vinyl roof and matching upholstery, available together or separately. A facelift in 1971 did away with the hidden <b>headlights</b> and hidden <b>wipers</b> were adopted. Between 1969 and 1973, Cougar convertibles were offered.|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach to automotive safety systems The industry strategy for automotive safety systems has been evolving {{over the last}} 20 years. Initially, individual passive devices and features such as seatbelts, airbags, knee bolsters, and crush zones were developed for saving lives and minimizing injuries when an accident occurs. Later, preventive measures such as improving visibility, <b>headlights,</b> windshield <b>wipers,</b> and tire traction were deployed to reduce the probability of getting into an accident. Now {{we are at the}} stage of actively avoiding accidents as well as providing maximum protection to the vehicle occupants and even pedestrians. Systems that are on the threshold of being deployed or under intense development include collision detection/warning/intervention systems, lane departure warning, drowsy driver detection, and advanced safety interiors. In this article, Delphi researchers discuss the concept of the safety state diagram, a unified view of the automotive safety system, and the technologies required to implement this vision. Advanced ideas such as pre-crash sensing, anticipatory crash sensing, X-by-wire systems, advanced safety interiors, integrated vehicle electrical/electronics systems, data networks, and mobile multimedia (telematics) are also addressed...|$|R
5000|$|In the UK in November 2007 Ford {{announced}} the special edition 'Zetec Blue', introduced as a 'swan song' for the Mk6. The Zetec Blue was {{available as a}} 3 or 5-door, {{with a choice of}} the 1.25 and 1.4 petrol, and 1.4TDCi diesel engines. Prices started at £9,995; in between the existing Style Climate and Zetec Climate models. The seat trim was a unique blue derivative of the 'Kyoto' type featured in the Style Climate, and whilst the Zetec Blue didn't feature a chrome grille; the model was otherwise specified as the Zetec Climate model, adding additionally; 16" [...] 7-spoke alloy wheels, Sony CD audio system with remote controls and premium speakers, and co-ordinated blue bezel, air vent and gaiter surrounds. In order to boost final sales before the introduction of the Mk7, the specification of the Zetec Blue was increased in the summer of 2008, with the inclusion of Bluetooth and Voice Control, and the Technology Pack (automatic <b>headlights,</b> rain-sensing <b>wipers,</b> power-fold door mirrors) as standard, which was promoted until September 30, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The Suprima S {{shares a}} large {{majority}} of its body panels and parts with the Prevé saloon, its sister car which launched approximately 16 months prior, on 16 April 2012. The Suprima comes in a choice of five colours and two trim variants, the Executive and Premium trims respectively. Both variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro Turbo engine, paired to a seven-speed ProTronic CVT, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. All Suprimas come standard with 6 SRS airbags, an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Also standard is the Proton Infotainment System, an advanced Android OS-powered 7" [...] LCD touchscreen GPS head unit with DVD, Bluetooth, USB, iPod & 4G WiFi compatibility. The Premium trim is equipped with exclusive kit such as Anthracite-shade leather seats, two tweeter speakers, front parking sensors, a reverse camera and brighter LED daytime running lamps (DRLs) in addition to features previously offered in the Prevé's Premium trim, namely the steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic <b>headlights</b> and <b>wipers,</b> climate control, cruise control and push-start engine ignition. The Suprima S is priced between RM76,338 and RM79,988 respectively. Proton has since sold more than 835 Suprima S units between mid-August and the month of September.|$|R
5000|$|The new Argentine factory {{was built}} in the city of Santa Isabel in the {{province}} of Córdoba with the Kaiser Manhattan being rechristened the [...] "Kaiser Carabela" [...] — named after a type of Portuguese sailing ship. The US vinyl and fabric interior was replaced with a more rugged leather interior, the speedometer was recalibrated in kilometers with the temperature, oil, and fuel gauge annotations in Spanish and the spring rates were increased to accommodate unimproved Argentine roads. Oddly, the dash castings with annotations for vent, heater, <b>headlight</b> and <b>wiper</b> controls remained in English. No consideration was given to offering an automatic transmission due to the anticipated difficulty in obtaining service in remote towns. Production started on the Carabela on 25 July 1958 and, in the remaining months of that year, 2,158 cars were built. IKA was also building Jeep vehicles at the Cordoba factory and assembled 20,454 Jeeps in 1958 alone. The combined Carabela-Jeep production of 22,612 units was 81% of all vehicles manufactured in Argentina in 1958 with the only competition being the state-run utility vehicle manufacturer IAME. Many have questioned the wisdom of building IKA automobile factory in remote Santa Isabel which was far from ports and transportation hubs but the primary reason is that Córdoba was General San Martín's home province and he had a close, influential relationship with President Juan Perón.|$|R
25|$|The Proton Prevé {{was finally}} {{unveiled}} on 16 April 2012 at Seri Kembangan by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. It launched {{with a choice}} of six colours and three trim variants, the Executive MT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT respectively. Both Executive trim variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro IAFM+ engine. The Executive MT is paired with a five-speed manual gearbox whereas the Executive CVT is equipped with a six-speed CVT. The Premium trim is offered with the superior 1.6L turbocharged CamPro CFE engine, mated to a seven-speed CVT, also known as ProTronic, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. Safety-wise, the Executive variants are equipped with dual SRS airbags and an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) whereas the Premium trim features an additional two airbags, Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) on top of those offered in the Executive. The Premium variant is also equipped with exclusive kit such as steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic <b>headlights</b> and <b>wipers,</b> cruise control, climate control, a built-in touchscreen GPS head unit with Bluetooth, USB & iPod connectivity as well as push-start engine ignition. All Proton Prevés are equipped with a Smart Information Display system (SiD) that displays information such as average fuel consumption, battery health and distance to empty. Another standard feature is in-car WiFi, made possible by a collaboration between Proton and Malaysian ISP, Yes 4G. The Prevé is priced between RM59,540 and RM72,990 respectively. It received over 11,000 bookings within two months of its official launch and became the 7th best-selling car in Malaysia for the month of May 2012, topping all rivals in its category.|$|R

40|$|Evolution {{pretends to}} be biology but it plays us for fools because it {{provides}} no successful experimental documentation. Let’s {{see if there is}} one scintilla of scientific evidence to support evolution. Most biology textbooks show a glass apparatus in which the precursors for amino acids were boiled and electrically sparked for a week, and sure enough, there were trace amounts of a few amino acids. The implication is that if similar, unthinking processes were continued, then a living cell would evolve. Such logic is like stating that automobiles evolved long ago by means of rubber sap, sand, iron ore, and coal falling into a volcano. The iron ore and the carbon in the coal made steel, the sand melted and made glass, and the sap vulcanized and made rubber. Then after billions and billions of trials and errors, the text may say, there evolved spontaneously better and better pistons, cylinders, whole engines with spark plugs and transmissions, axles on four wheels with rubber tires under bodies of steel with glass windows, windshield <b>wipers,</b> <b>headlights,</b> and tanks full of gasoline. The text might state that th...|$|R
