Founded in 1832 by Bevin's great-great-great grandfather and remaining in the family continuously since, Bevin Bros. is the last American company that exclusively manufactures bells.

25|$|After taking office, Welsh was {{immediately}} {{confronted with the}} state's $18.2 million budget deficit. His predecessor, Harold Handley, had tackled the deficit {{with a combination of}} reforming the tax system, and an increase in the gasoline tax. The public, however, was not pleased with the tax increase, and was a factor Handley's defeat for the United States Senate in 1958. Despite the previous public reaction, Welsh recommended an additional tax increase to cover the deficit. The Indiana General Assembly, however, was divided with Republican strongly controlling the House, and the Democrats with only a two-vote majority in the Senate. This created deadlock on most of Welsh's taxing measures. He was able to advocate the passage of the Property Tax Assessment Act of 1961 which improved the efficiency of the revenue department, gaining the government money in administrative savings, and reimposing a small state property tax; the state property taxes had only recently been repealed in the state. A second reform bill was passed creating the Division of Tax Review which had power to review and reassess property taxes statewide. The Division of Audit was also created, which for the first time which allowed the government to audit tax data and forcibly collect it and also begin cross-checking state tax returns with federal tax returns. Warrant officers were hired who, with the assistance of a local sheriff, could seize money and property to pay <b>delinquent</b> <b>tax</b> debts. This led to thousands of individuals statewide having their unpaid back taxes seized by the government. Despite all the activity, state revenue still fell short forcing the government to use its reserve funds; an even larger deficit was predicted for the 1958 tax year.|$|E

5000|$|... the Teeter Plan (first enacted 1949) {{provides}} California counties with {{an optional}} alternative method for allocating <b>delinquent</b> property <b>tax</b> revenues.

For counties not under the Teeter Plan, interest and penalty are allocated to all agencies based on their pro rata share of the <b>delinquent</b> property <b>tax.</b> However, the county retains the penalty on <b>delinquent</b> property <b>taxes</b> if the delinquency is cleared up within the same fiscal year.|$|R
