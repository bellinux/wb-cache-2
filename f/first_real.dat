5|$|The {{game with}} Rose Polytechnic {{was seen as}} the <b>first</b> <b>real</b> test of the season.

5|$|After {{the last}} Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, both the Lithuanians and the Poles {{attempted}} to restore their independence. Lithuanians rebelled during the 1830 November Uprising and the 1863 January Uprising, but their <b>first</b> <b>real</b> opportunity arose when both Russia and Germany were weakened during World War I.|$|E

5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple digital computer from relays. His <b>first</b> <b>real</b> experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E

The badge encourages a Scout {{to participate in}} patrol activities. The Scout is required to have camped away from their normal Scout meeting place {{for at least five}} nights.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the <b>first</b> <b>real</b> American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{were the}} <b>first</b> <b>real</b> {{test for the}} Commodores, coming to Nashville as the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) {{defending}} champions and loaded with confidence. They were swamped, 35–0 as Curry and Turner ran for several yards. Curry once got away for 50 yards, the only touchdown of the first half. In the third quarter, Johnny Floyd ripped off 47 yards and Hubert Wiggs took it over.|$|E
5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt {{that was}} {{probably}} wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon saw their <b>first</b> <b>real</b> use on the European battlefield. Even then, cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.|$|E

He was not new to motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, Public Hero No. 1 (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of The New York Times {{as one of the}} year's ten best male performances.|$|E

5|$|Darlington {{were the}} first to settle with Gary Bannister a {{prominent}} player in midfield, but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the <b>first</b> <b>real</b> goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes. Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one-two with Michael Evans, but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken. Darlington's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match midway through the first half. He carved out the initial chance, having carried the ball half the length of the pitch, but team-mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert. The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, {{the network}} {{announced}} that The Real Housewives of Atlanta had been renewed for an eight-season, with both NeNe Leakes and Claudia Jordan departing from the show.

In September 2015, Bravo announced that Porsha Williams would be returning {{as a full-time}} housewife once again, along with newcomer actress Kim Fields. The network also announced that former housewife Whitfield, together with new cast member Shamea Morton, would join the series in a supporting capacity, with former cast members, Leakes, Hampton, Jordan and McKinney making guest appearances.|$|E
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his <b>first</b> <b>real</b> action in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E

5|$|Joan Elizabeth Strothers {{was born}} on 26 February 1916 in Swansea, Wales, the {{daughter}} of an optician, Charles William Strothers, and his wife, Margaret Beatrice, née Millington. She was educated at Swansea Girls' High School, and in 1934 won an open scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1935, she rowed for the ladies' university eight, in the <b>first</b> <b>real</b> Women's boat race against Oxford. She gained an honours degree in physics, which was not awarded because it was before women were allowed Cambridge degrees. In her seventies, in 1987, she was honoured with the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa by the University of Strathclyde.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is {{cynical and}} despairing over his recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his <b>first</b> <b>real</b> date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and the club's ambitions to build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their attentions back to the maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The <b>first</b> <b>real</b> modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922. The Bobbers Stand became all-seated, {{while the rest of the}} ground remained terracing. The new-look stand could only hold 1,539 seats, and as a result the capacity of the ground dropped to 22,601.|$|E
