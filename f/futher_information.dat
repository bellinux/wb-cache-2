40|$|The current report summarises the {{findings}} arising from focus group discussions regarding identifying high risk young drivers. The findings are discussed {{within the context}} of the peer-reviewed research literature, synthesising {{the findings}} with respect to a previous report and introducing new literature as relevant. The results highlight a number of mechanisms through which high risk young drivers can be identified, and this primarily is as a result of their behaviour which can occur both on and off the road.

40|$|Vaughan and Ritter (1970) have {{recently}} proposed that all {{components of the}} human, average, auditory evoked re-sponse (AER) to repetitive stimulation, including the long latency vertex potentials, can be ascribed to a dipole source reversing polarity {{at the level of}} the sylvian fissure. This asser-tion brings to the fore the need for <b>futher</b> <b>information</b> about the spatial distribution of vertex potentials over the surface of the head as determined with a remote, non-cephalic reference. Since a true sylvian phase reversal of the late components of the AER would have far-reaching theoretical nd clinical interpretive implications, we have been prompted to carry out studies especially relevant to this point.

40|$|Drink {{driving is}} widely {{recognised}} {{as a major}} road safety problem. In Australia, the maximum allowed blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is 0. 05. Despite the enforcement of this limit through random breath testing, during the inclusive period 2006 - 2010, 19, 413 crashes involved a drinking driver/rider. Of these crashes, 8. 3 % resulted {{in one or more}} fatalities, and 44. 9 % resulted in serious injuries. Health promotion messages in Australia encourage the monitoring of the number of standard drinks consumed prior to driving. As such, restaurant patrons may believe they will remain under the legal limit and therefore they may drive to the venue, and drive home, whilst intoxicated. Therefore the research aimed to investigate the commuting behaviour and BAC of diners at Sunshine Coast restaurants.

40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} an a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Upper Divison English at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014 and in this clip the interviewee is providing <b>futher</b> background <b>information</b> on Hi'iakaikapuliopele. Brief excerpt from interview: Hiʻiaka is Pele's [...] . favorite sister, but they fought like [...] . family [...] . They fought like crazy, but Pele referred to Hiʻiakaikapoliopele as her favorite sister. [Her name] actually meaning Hiʻiaka in the bosom of Pele, so {{it was like the}} sister, her youngest sister, that was closest to Pele. Pele is renowned. She's the goddess of Kīlauea on Hawaiʻi Island. They came from Tahiti or Kahiki, traveled here [to Hawaiʻi]. So Pele sets Hiʻiaka out on a journey to fetch [Pele's] husband, Lohiʻau on Kauaʻi. So this is the epic tale of Hiʻiakaikapoliopele where she journeys to Kauaʻi and back that I researched and used for my project [...] . In 2010, I think, that's when the first windmill, the wind farm, was constructed in Kahuku, and that kind of sparked my interest when our electricity bills weren't going down and when farmers were evicted from the land [...] . I heard about the wind farms on Lānaʻi, which all of the electricity is transported to Oʻahu, to Waikīkī, so I just thought that was total exploitation of land. So when these windmills were constructed, it just raised red flags, and I was like where's this power going? We're still paying a lot for electricity. It's farmland, so it's arable land that are being used for these industrial machines, so it just sparked interest in me, and that's when I started the Kahuku project of the windmills. And then it's just so relevant too, when I took this class, because they're in talks right now. Developers are trying to develop more wind farms...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{regarding the}} activity of profiling, which {{is defined by the}} Oxford Dictionary as the recording and analysis of a person’s psychological and behavioural characteristics, so as to assess or predict their capabilities in a certain sphere or to assist in identifying categories of people, is reviewed. A number of offender profiling approaches have been applied, with varying degrees of success; however {{the reliability and validity of}} these approaches is hampered by the retrospective nature of the technique, in addition to weaknesses in experimental studies. The literature regarding sexual offenders is reviewed, with a focus upon summarising profiling of offender groups including of rapists, child molesters, female sex offenders, and adolescent sex offenders. Similar reliability and validity issues apply within the domain of sexual offender profiling. The literature regarding juvenile delinquents is reviewed. A number of typology models are summarised, as are the personal factors, peer influences, and family factors which have been found to influence rates and types of juvenile delinquency. Finally, the literature regarding profiling of high risk young drivers is reviewed. The ‘problem young driver’ is placed within the context of the ‘young driver problem’, and a range of characteristics which are demonstrated by and apparent in high risk young drivers is discussed.

40|$|No one cultivates sloping land out of choice: hillsides are {{difficult}} to cultivate, especially with animals or tractors, and they are notoriously prone to water and soil erosion. To reduce or prevent erosion on steep slopes, where simply cultivating along the contour is not sufficient, construction of terraces has been a necessity. Not surprisingly farmers have often avoided, or tried to circumvent, the very considerable labour requirement of terrace construction and erosion has been the inevitable consequence. The alternative of a biological terrace-building system offers a minimum labour option to farmers on steep sloping land. The biological system of making terraces on steep land has been developed in Asia (Philippines, Nepal and Sri Lanka) and is applicable wherever there is adequate seasonal rainfall to support shrubby tree species such as acacia, leucaena, gliricidia and caliandra. Known as SALT - Sloping Agricultural Land Technology, it offers a promising minimum labour cost option for erosion control and land stabilization in moister areas of ACP countries where population pressure has forced cultivators to clear and crop hillsides. The objectives of SALT are threefold: to control erosion, to help restore soil structure and fertility, and to produce food efficiently. Other mechanical soil conservation measures not only require considerable labour and/or mechanization inputs for their construction but also for their maintenance. Moreover, while they control erosion they do not contribute to restoration of soil structure and fertility, and stone terraces and lock and spill drains usually require some land {{to be taken out}} of production. SALT is essentially a hedgerow agroforestry system, where leguminous fast-growing species are planted along the contour to trap soil washed downhill. Two rows of trees are plated one meter apart and the space between may be filled with stones. As the trees grow they provide a natural barrier to soil movement. The double row hedges are planted four to six metres apart and the intervening land is stabilized for cropping. Between the hedgerows the recommendation is to plant a combination of permanent, semi-permanent and annual crops. Crop combinations will vary according to local conditions and preferences but they should be chosen to enhance soil fertility, maximize yields, and allow farmers to have an efficient work schedule throughout the year. Two out of three 'alleys' (inter-hedgerow spaces) may be planted to annual crops and the third to permanent cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, tea, banana, citrus, other fruit or spices. In the annual crop alleys normal weeding and pest control should be done as normally practiced but in the permanent crop alleys weeding should be confined to spot treatment around the young plants until the hedgerow trees themselves have grown large enough to hold the soil in place. This permanent cropping across a further one third of the hillside acts as an additional barrier to soil movement. One refinement is that a fast growing grass species, which has a strong root system, may be planted in a narrow strip immediately below each hedgerow. The grass provides additional soil stabilization, especially {{in the early stages of}} hedgerow establishment. Also, the grass may be cut regularly for livestock fodder and to provide mulch and organic matter for the annual crop land. Hedgerows are also cut to provide livestock feed and for mulching bare soil and their foliage contributes nutrients to the soil. The ideal height for pruning is when the hedgerows are two metres high; they should be cut back to 50 cm to encourage vigorous coppice re-growth. In recent years the 'Fanya ju' terracing system developed in Kenya has received considerable publicity and there is occasionally confusion between the Fanya ju and SALT systems. The two systems are, however, quite distinct and have been contrasted for Spore by Dr M R Rao of the International Centre for Agroforesty, (ICRAF), Nairobi. 'Fanya ju and SALT are different. 'Fanya ju' is a mechanically established system where a ditch is dug along a contour and the soil is thrown to the up-slope side so as to form a bank (bund). 'Fanya ju' has been used mostly in Kenya. It might appear in other East African countries but not, to my knowledge, in the Caribbean or elsewhere. 'Fanya chin) ' is its counterpart because the soil dug from the ditch is thrown to the down-slope. 'Fanya ju' can be turned into an agroforestry system by planting trees on the bund or in the ditch. Usually grasses are allowed to grow on the bund stabilizing it. Fruit trees are often planted in the ditch because the soil is damper there than on the rest of the terrace and fertility is enhanced by litter and other debris. 'Fanya ju' is a labour intensive system to construct and takes quite a bit of land out of production. Some of these areas can be recouped if trees and appropriate shrubs are planted on the bunds or in the ditches. Conversely, all SALT techniques employ agroforestry methods right from the start. They rely greatly upon biological means to conserve the soil and improve its fertility with minimal labour input. The amount of land wasted, as compared with 'Fanya ju', is also reduced.
