30|$|Often, in interventional {{procedures}} {{parts of}} the thorax and abdomen have to be covered <b>with</b> sterile <b>drapes.</b> Movement of these drapes would result in an error in the depth measurements. This can be prevented by either using a <b>drape</b> <b>with</b> a large hole, and disinfecting a larger surface of the skin, or by using surgical incise <b>drape</b> <b>with</b> adhesive backing. This facilitates a larger ROI to be selected, without having to include loose fitting drapes.|$|R

5|$|Tyler's {{death was}} the only one in presidential history not to be officially {{recognized}} in Washington, because of his allegiance to the Confederacy. He had requested a simple burial, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis devised a grand, politically pointed funeral, painting Tyler as a hero to the new nation. Accordingly, at his funeral, the coffin of the tenth president of the United States was <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> a Confederate flag; he remains the only U.S. president ever laid to rest under a foreign flag.|$|E
5|$|For {{the month}} {{following}} Scalia's death, his {{chair in the}} Supreme Court chamber and {{the front of the}} bench where he sat were <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> black wool crêpe, with more over the court's entrance, a tradition dating from the death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase in 1873. Flags on the Court's front plaza were flown at half-staff for 30 days. Scalia's body lay in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court of the United States on February 19, 2016. His son Fr. Paul Scalia celebrated a Catholic funeral Mass and delivered the homily the next day at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The interment was private, at Fairfax Memorial Park in Fairfax, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Jewels include 16 silver {{trumpets}} {{dating from}} between 1780 and 1848. Nine {{of these are}} <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> red silk damask banners embroidered with coats of arms in gold, originally made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838. They have not been used since the Corps of State Trumpeters was disbanded by the Duke of Wellington as a cost-cutting measure in the 19thcentury. The trumpeters' main job was to sound a fanfare at key points in the coronation, and they also played at the banquet afterwards in Westminster Hall. Today, the Band of the Household Cavalry and the Central Band of the Royal Air Force play their own trumpets at state occasions.|$|E

5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship.

Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E

40|$|Methods and {{technologies}} that provide effective 3 D representation of drape could bridge {{both physical and}} communication barriers in the textile and apparel supply chain. This {{study was conducted to}} develop methods and techniques for capturing and evaluating drape in 3 D, and for accurate comparison of 3 D virtual <b>drape</b> <b>with</b> actual <b>drape</b> in a virtual environment. A methodical approach was developed for matching the simulated <b>drape</b> <b>with</b> actual <b>drape</b> using the fewest applicable fabric properties. A framework integrating different segments of this research was also built. Current methods and procedures used in evaluating drape for fabrics were studied from the published literature. An improved digital technique was developed to capture and eval-uate fabric drape, and a complex set of metrics needed to discriminate drape configuration in 3 D was devised. Drape variability for fabrics having varied mechanical properties was investigated, and a method of measuring drape by three dimensional scanning of draped fabric specimens was established. For apparel, two garment patterns were designed; a three-gore skirt and a princess skirt. The garments were draped on a mannequin in the three dimensional body scanner. Poin...|$|R

The Sai Baba temple in Shirdi is managed by the Shri Sai Baba Sansthan Trust. Sai Baba accepted the state of samadhi and attained nirvana in Dwarkamai.

Inside the temple, The statue of Sai Baba and the Samadhi is carved out of Italian marble and is seen <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> royal cloth, wearing a gold crown and adorned with fresh flower garlands.The interior, as well as the exterior (cone) of the temple, is covered with gold.

5|$|Huskisson's coffin {{was placed}} on a trestle table in the Town Hall, <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> black velvet and covered with {{feathered}} plumes. Between 9.00 and 10.00am a stream of mourners were guided to the coffin {{by a group of}} truncheon men. At 10.00 two mutes guided the mourners out of the town hall and mounted horses; the rain and hail had by now eased. The mutes led the procession, followed by the mourners from the town hall and around 1,100 other mourners who had waited outside. These mourners marched six abreast, and were followed by the funeral committee, 28 local clergymen and two more mutes. Behind this group marched Joseph Brandreth and the Rev Blackburne, and behind them came carriages carrying the pall-bearers, a group of local dignitaries who had known and worked with Huskisson, followed by two more mutes. Behind this pair of mutes was a hearse carrying the coffin, followed by Huskisson's colleagues and his surviving brothers Thomas and Samuel. These in turn were followed by around 900 locals in mourning dress who had decided to join the procession, bringing the cortège to around half a mile (0.8km) in length. The Duke of Wellington, pleading a prior commitment to attend a dinner in Birmingham, did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is <b>draped</b> <b>with</b> a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
