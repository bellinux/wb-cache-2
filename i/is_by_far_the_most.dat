Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999.

The +1 state <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common, {{followed by the}} reducing +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass.
