5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that somehow we could have done it another way." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. But to me, it was over. As I said to the Monaco officials, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E

G issued a clarification: [...] "I don't really know anything about the situation and my impromptu visit to the site was just part of an innocent walk around Hong Kong ... <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to share my wish for peace for Hong Kong and for all of China as I feel close to and care about China very much." ...|$|E

In 1941 she entered—and won—her first tournament, the American Tennis Association (ATA) New York State Championship.

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, <b>I</b> <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E
