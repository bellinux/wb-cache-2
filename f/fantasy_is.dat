Each development team was given the freedom to adapt the mythos to fit {{the context of a}} game's story.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fantasy</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} common LARP genres internationally and is the genre that the largest events use. Fantasy LARPs are set in pseudo-historical worlds {{inspired}} by fantasy literature and fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. These settings typically have magic, fantasy races, and limited technology. Many fantasy LARPs focus on adventure or on competition between character factions. In contrast, science fiction LARPs take place in futuristic settings with high technology and sometimes with extraterrestrial life. This describes a broad array of LARPs, including politically themed LARPs depicting dystopian or utopian societies and settings inspired by cyberpunk, space opera and post-apocalyptic fiction.|$|E

The original Final Fantasy video game, published in 1987, is a role-playing video game developed by Square, spawning {{a video game}} series that became the central focus of the franchise.

5|$|Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>is</b> a media {{franchise}} {{created by}} Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games, motion pictures, and other merchandise. The series began in 1987 as an eponymous role-playing video game developed by Square, spawning {{a video game}} series that became the central focus of the franchise. The music of the Final Fantasy series refers to the soundtracks of the Final Fantasy series of video games, {{as well as the}} surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series' music ranges from very light background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation leitmotifs.|$|E
5|$|Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>is</b> {{a science}} fiction and fantasy media {{franchise}} created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, and developed and owned by Square Enix (formerly Square). The franchise centers {{on a series of}} fantasy and science fantasy role-playing video games (RPGs). The eponymous first game in the series, published in 1987, was conceived by Sakaguchi as his last-ditch effort in the game industry; the title was a success and spawned sequels. The video game series has since branched into other genres such as tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm. The franchise has also branched out into other media, including CGI films, anime, manga, and novels.|$|E
5000|$|World of Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} and overseen by Square Enix, with development support provided by Tose. The initial concept for World of Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> created between series producer Shinji Hashimoto, and Square Enix staff member Hiroki Chiba. Chiba's previous {{work on the}} series had been as a scenario writer and event planner for several titles including Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Type-0, titles that had been noted for the dark tone and stories. Hashimoto and Chiba noticed that the series age demographic had shifted to adolescents and adults, with few young people coming to the series. World of Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> intended to [...] "lower the threshold" [...] for players so more people could enjoy the series. World of Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> Chiba's directorial debut. The original concepts that form part of World of Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>were</b> created for a simulation video game. When that project ran into difficulties, it was scrapped and its aesthetic elements reused in the smartphone title Pictlogica Final Fantasy.|$|R

Along with standard navigation, the player can navigate the game world using a fast-travel system, progressively unlocked as the player progresses through the story. Many of the features in the game, such as the leveling system and exploration, {{are similar to those}} from previous home console Final Fantasy games.|$|E

25|$|The {{parallel}} article History {{of fantasy}} deals mainly with fantasy {{literature in the}} English language. The history of French <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> covered in greater detail under Fantastique.|$|E
25|$|People {{can become}} aroused {{by the thought}} of sexual partners, acts, and {{situations}} that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.|$|E
25|$|The second {{difference}} is that the supernatural in <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> by design fictitious. In traditional tales {{the degree to which the}} author considered the supernatural to be real can span the spectrum from legends taken as reality to myths understood as describing in understandable terms more complicated reality, to late, intentionally fictitious literary works.|$|E
50|$|Adventures in <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} by Dave Arneson and Richard Snider. A playtest edition {{was published by}} Excalibre Games in 1978 as a limited edition of 164 photocopied pages; each page contains two pages of manuscript printed side by side. Adventures in <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> then published by Excalibre Games Inc. in 1979 as a boxed set containing a 64-page book, two 56-page books, three cardstock sheets, and a die. Arneson bought back rights to Adventures in Fantasy using settlement money from TSR, and his company Adventure Games put out a new edition in 1981. Adventures in <b>Fantasy</b> <b>was</b> one of several games that the Thieves' World RPG (1981) included rules for.|$|R
50|$|Deviant sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> sexual <b>fantasies</b> {{which involve}} illegal, nonconsensual, and sadistic themes. While people with {{paraphilia}} have deviant sexual <b>fantasies,</b> it <b>is</b> {{important to note}} that deviant sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> not atypical and/or paraphilic. DSM-5 defines paraphilia as intense and persistent atypical preferences for sexual activities or targets like spanking, whipping, binding with erotic targets like children, animals, and/or rubber etc. While DSM-5 recognizes that paraphillias don’t have to be pathological, psychiatrists still find it difficult to differentiate between paraphilic interests and paraphilic disorders, because the concept of normal of sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>is</b> subjective. It is based on factors like history, society, culture and politics. For example, masturbation, oral, anal and homosexual sex were illegal in some American states and even considered to be paraphilic disorders in earlier DSM revisions.|$|R
50|$|Sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> {{increasingly}} {{viewed as}} a necessary component to a healthy relationship. Accordingly, theorists have argued that <b>fantasies</b> may <b>be</b> used to encourage and promote sexual pleasure between partners. Researchers have additionally found {{a positive correlation between}} instances of sexual fantasising and increased orgasm, arousal, and general contentment. The relative benefits of sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> summarised in a statement by Stroller; “sexual fantasises are a private pornography in which we rehearse over and over again needs that are nearly impossible to fulfil in actual sex”. Sexual fantasising therefore allows an individual to fulfil desires that cannot be realistically achieved. In this sense, researchers assert that fantasising about extra-marital, or multiple-partner sex is positively correlated with long-term partnerships. As such, sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>are</b> viewed as means to combat sexual dissatisfaction.|$|R
25|$|An early {{version of}} the Fellowship's {{encounter}} with the Watcher is found in The Return of the Shadow, part of The History of Middle-earth series, wherein the textual development of Tolkien's Middle-earth-related <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> discussed and analyzed by his son and literary executor, Christopher Tolkien. This particular volume focuses upon The Lord of the Rings.|$|E
25|$|Actual <b>Fantasy</b> <b>is</b> {{an album}} {{released}} in 1996 by Dutch multi-instrumentalist Arjen A. Lucassen {{and is the}} second album of his Ayreon project. It is the only Ayreon release that does not feature a single overarching story concept, but instead draws on science fiction and fantasy films for inspiration, as well as stories written by Arjen himself.|$|E
25|$|Sexual fantasies are {{distinct}} from limerent fantasies. Limerent <b>fantasy</b> <b>is</b> rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under {{more or less}} voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation, a sensation of viewing the world with rose-tinted glasses, leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.|$|E
