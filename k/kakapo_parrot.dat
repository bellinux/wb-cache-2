5|$|The kakapo (Māori: <b>kākāpō</b> {{or night}} <b>parrot),</b> Strigops habroptila (Gray, 1845), also called owl parrot, is {{a species of}} large, flightless, nocturnal, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family Strigopoidea, endemic to New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} lories and lorikeets are kept as pets but are quite messy, and often more popular as aviary birds. Hanging parrots and fig parrots are {{normally}} kept as aviary birds {{and not as}} pets. Some species as pygmy <b>parrots</b> and <b>kakapos,</b> night <b>parrots,</b> and {{about half of the}} species of parrotlet, are not considered companion parrots due to difficult dietary requirements or unavailability.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} Wild Life Service {{conservation program}} {{to save the}} <b>Kakapo</b> <b>parrot</b> from extinction has permitted the collection of feeding data in Fiordland and on the sancturary, Maud Island in Pelorus Sound, between November 1974 and March 1977. Four expeditions, each of 4 to 6 weeks between January 1975 and March 1977 enabled my spending over 4 months in the Fiordland Kakapo areas and a further 6 weeks was spent in the Kakapo search on Stewart Island in July and August 1977. A total of 15 occupied Kakapo territories in Fiordland were found over the {{two and a half}} year period. Kakapo from 3 of these territories were moved to Maud Island and monthly visits between September 1975 and August 1976 enabled regular collection of droppings for faecal analysis study. A combined appraisal of feeding sign and faecal content, using cuticle analysis techniques has enabled a more accurate understanding of the Kakapo's diet and its seasonal variations to be determined. The mobility of the Kakapo could also be roughly estimated and on Maud Island it appeared the Kakapo were learning to obtain new foods. Investigation of faecal material has confirmed early reports that Kakapo are herbivorous. No insect or animal parts were found in fresh droppings. The variety of plants fed upon was extensive. In Fiordland 79 + species of herbs, grasses, shrubs and trees have been identified and on Maud Island 28 + species. Roots, rhizomes, twigs, leaves, buds, flowers, flower-stems, fruits and seeds are utilized. Feeding areas in Fiordland have all been found {{in the vicinity of the}} male Kakapo's track and bowl systems. These are generally located about tree line at approximately 1050 meters. The tree line in many areas is lower than expected, however, due to terrain and avalanche damage. Kakapo feeding areas, associated with track and bowl systems extend from 550 meters to 1200 meters above sea level. On Maud Island feeding sign and droppings found were concentrated on or close to recently excavated roads, although it was apparent the birds were covering an extensive area from the coast to the summit (350 m). The Kakapo bill is adapted to crushing and extracting nutrients and enables a large proportion of fibre to be retained in the bill. The fibre is frequently squashed into a kidney shaped pellet which is expelled from the mouth. A preliminary investigation into nutrient values of Kakapo food plants is presented and it is suspected the birds select the most nutritious plant species and plant parts as food. On Maud Island the vegetation available as food for Kakapo in preliminary analyses appears to be of greater nutritional value than in Fiordland...|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} <b>parrots,</b> <b>kakapos</b> {{have a variety}} of calls. As well as the booms (see below for a recording) and chings of their mating calls, they will often loudly skraark to {{announce}} their location to other birds.|$|R
50|$|Considerable {{funds are}} donated {{annually}} to conservation projects that support habitats, recovering species and clean-up initiatives. An annual Birds of the Feather charity ball organised by Real Journeys helps fundraise for the Department of Conservation’s (DOC) {{work in the}} area. In 2015 the inaugural ball raised $40,000 {{for the preservation of}} the endangered kakapo (Māori: <b>kākāpō</b> or night <b>parrot).</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{common names}} for species {{in this family}} {{are the same as}} the {{traditional}} Māori names. The word kākā derives from the ancient Proto-Polynesian word meaning <b>parrot.</b> <b>Kākāpō</b> is a logical extension of that name, as pō means night, resulting in kākā of the night or night parrot, reflecting the species' nocturnal behaviour. The etymology of kea in Māori is less clear, and might be onomatopoeic of its call kee-aah.|$|R
5000|$|Te Wahipounamu {{is home to}} many {{indigenous}} {{animals and}} contains {{the largest and most}} significant population of forest birds in the country. The total wild population, which is only about 170 birds, of the takahe is found in a few mountain valleys in the Fiordland harbor. Along the south-west coast, most of New Zealand’s Fur Seals are found. Also found in this region are Southern Brown Kiwis, Great Spotted Kiwis, Red deer, Yellow-crowned parakeets, Fiordland Penguins, New Zealand falcons, and the pateke/Fiordland brown teal. The world’s rarest and heaviest <b>parrot,</b> <b>kakapo,</b> was found in this region until the early 1980s. It is now believed that it is extinct on the mainland.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, Carinatae {{were defined}} as all birds whose sternum (breast bone) has a keel (carina). The keel is a strong median ridge running {{down the length of}} the sternum. This is an {{important}} area for the attachment of flight muscles. Thus, all flying birds have a pronounced keel. Ratites, all of whom are flightless, lack a strong keel. Thus, living birds were divided into carinates (keeled) and ratites (from ratis, [...] "raft", referring to the flatness of the sternum). The difficulty with this scheme phylogenetically was that some flightless birds, without strong carinae, are descended directly from ordinary flying birds with carinae. Examples include the <b>kakapo,</b> a flightless <b>parrot,</b> and the dodo, a columbiform (the pigeon family). None of these birds are ratites. Thus, this supposedly distinctive feature was easy to use, but had nothing to do with actual phylogenic relationship.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are many}} species of birds on Stewart Island/Rakiura that {{have been able to}} {{continue}} to thrive because of the relative absence of the cats, rats, stoats, ferrets, weasels and other predators that humans brought to the main islands. There are even more species of birds, including huge colonies of sooty shearwater and other seabirds, on The Snares and the other smaller islands offshore. The birds of Stewart Island include weka, kākā, albatross, the flightless Stewart Island kiwi, silvereyes, fantails, and kererū. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin has a significant number of breeding sites here [...] while the large colonies of sooty shearwaters on the offshore Muttonbird Islands, are subject to muttonbirding, a sustainable harvesting program managed by Rakiura Māori. Meanwhile, a small population of the <b>kakapo,</b> a flightless <b>parrot</b> which is very close to extinction, was found on Stewart Island in 1977 and the birds subsequently moved to smaller islands (Codfish Island) for protection from feral cats. The South Island saddleback is similarly preserved.|$|R
40|$|The play {{behavior}} of the critically endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus; Aves: Psittaciformes: Psittacidae) is here {{compared to that of}} its closest relatives, the kea (Nestor notabilis) and the kaka (Nestor meridionalis). Contrasting kakapos, which are relatively solitary, with the more social Nestor parrots provides an attractive test of the relative contributions of phylogeny and sociality to the evolution of play. Overlapping cluster analysis of play sequences using a hypergeometric similarity metric indicated that kakapo play is generally less complex, lacking the intensity, duration, structure, and reciprocity of play in the Nestor <b>parrots.</b> <b>Kakapos</b> have a later age of first reproduction than the comparison species, but they lack the well-developed social interactions between post-fledging young and adults that are characteristic of keas and kakas. Social play in parrots appears to be most readily predicted from their patterns of social development, emerging within a constellation of behaviors associated with independent young that remain in the vicinity of adult groups...|$|R
40|$|Stewart Island moths {{have not}} been intensively studied but Howes (1914) listed species from Ruggedy and Halfmoon Bay while Patrick et al. (1989) {{reported}} on the Mason Bay fauna and later on the alpine fauna of Stewart Island (Patrick et al. 1992). This brief report list the moths, together with annotations from six excellent collections from Codfish Island between April 1992 and April 1993 received from Rhys Buckingham, Hamish Leary and Simon Ton.

5000|$|Kakapo Recovery is {{a project}} of the New Zealand Department of Conservation utilising the skills of scientists, rangers and volunteers to protect and boost the numbers of the {{endangered}} <b>Kakapo,</b> a flightless <b>parrot.</b> From only 18 individuals in the 1970s, the projects breeding and research program has boosted numbers to a population 157 adults living on a predator-free islands. [...] Since February 2016, surviving kākāpō are kept on three predator-free islands, Whenua Hou/Codfish, Anchor and Hauturu-o-Toi/Little Barrier islands, where they are closely monitored. In 2016 a record 47 chicks hatched and 33 were fledged. Digby promoted the idea to crowd fund a project to sequence the genome of every living adult kakapo {{as well as the}} genomes of 55 long-dead museum specimens from around the world.

40|$|New Zealand {{has been}} {{considered}} a classic among the world 2 ̆ 7 s natural laboratories where free-roaming wild mammals demand, and obtain, a rather overwhelming national attention. The enormous devastation by erosion processes is the consequence of intentionally introducing exotic species of mammals, for food, for sport and for fur. By its isolation in the Pacific, the flora of New Zealand evolved {{in the absence of}} a grazing and browsing fauna. There were no native mammals, save for the seals and two species of bats. The land has been the home of a most diverse fauna of flightless birds -kiwis, the giant moa, the rails, such as pukeko and <b>kakapo,</b> and flightless <b>parrots.</b> Many of its flighted bird species nest near the ground. It supports one of the oldest known reptiles - tuatara.

40|$|Good phylogenetic {{trees are}} {{required}} to test hypotheses about evolutionary processes. We report four new avian mitochondrial genomes, which together with an improved method of phylogenetic analysis for vertebrate mt genomes give results for three questions in avian evolution. The new mt genomes are: magpie goose (Anseranas semipalmata), an owl (morepork, Ninox novaeseelandiae); a basal passerine (rifleman, or New Zealand wren, Acanthisitta chloris); and a <b>parrot</b> (<b>kakapo</b> or owl-parrot, Strigops habroptilus). The magpie goose provides an important new calibration point for avian evolution because the well-studied Presbyornis fossils are on the lineage to ducks and geese, after {{the separation of the}} magpie goose. We find, as with other animal mitochondrial genomes, that RY-coding is helpful in adjusting for biases between pyrimidines and between purines. When RY-coding is used at third positions of the codon, the root occurs between paleognath and neognath birds (as expected from morphological and nuclear data). In addition, passerines form a relatively old group in Neoaves, and many modern avian lineages diverged during the Cretaceous. Although many aspects of the avian tree are stable, additional taxon sampling is required. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{critically}} endangered <b>kākāpō,</b> an herbivorous <b>parrot</b> {{endemic to}} New Zealand, {{is subject to}} intensive management to increase its population size. Key aspects of the management program include supplementary feeding and translocation of kākāpō between different predator-free islands to optimize the genetic composition of the breeding populations. While these practices have helped boost the kākāpō population, {{their impact on the}} kākāpō fecal microbiota is uncertain. Previous studies have found that the kākāpō possesses a low-diversity fecal microbiota, typically dominated by Escherichia/Shigella spp. However, {{the question of whether the}} low diversity of the kākāpō fecal microbiota is an inadvertent consequence of human interventions has yet to be investigated. To that end, we used high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene amplicons obtained from fecal material of 63 kākāpō representing different diets, islands, and ages. Remarkably, neither supplementary feeding nor geographic location were associated with significant differences in the overall fecal microbial community structures of adult kākāpō, suggesting that the kākāpō's low-diversity fecal microbiota is both inherent to this species and robust to these external influences...|$|R
50|$|The kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; {{the adult}} can measure from 58 to 64 cm in length, and weight {{can vary from}} 0.95 to 4 kg at maturity. Males are larger than females. Twenty-eight males were found to average 2 kg in one study, and 39 males were found to average 2.06 kg in another. In the same studies, 28 females were found to average 1.5 kg and 18 females {{averaged}} 1.28 kg. However, one source states that females will not breed until they attain a threshold weight of 1.5 kg. They are the heaviest living species of parrot; while the largest males attain much heavier weights than any other extant <b>parrot,</b> <b>kakapos</b> average about 400 g more than a hyacinth macaw. The kakapo cannot fly, having short wings for its size and lacking the pronounced keel bone (sternum) that anchors the flight muscles of other birds. It uses its wings for balance, support, and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat to store energy, making it the heaviest parrot.|$|R
500|$|The {{conservation}} of the kakapo {{has made the}} species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing {{the plight of the}} kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being Two in the Bush, made by Gerald Durrell for the BBC in 1962. A feature-length documentary, The Unnatural History of the Kakapo won two major awards at the Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by NHNZ, are <b>Kakapo</b> – Night <b>Parrot</b> (1982) and To Save the kakapo (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the kakapo, including a sequence with Sir David Attenborough in The Life of Birds. It {{was also one of the}} endangered animals Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine set out to find for the radio series and book Last Chance to See. An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which Stephen Fry and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kakapo on Codfish Island. Footage of a kakapo named Sirocco attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming [...] "spokes-bird" [...] for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010, as part of the International Year of Biodiversity. The kakapo was featured in the episode [...] "Strange Islands" [...] of the documentary series South Pacific, originally aired on 13 June 2009, in the episode [...] "Worlds Apart" [...] of the series The Living Planet, and in episode 3 of the BBC's New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands.|$|R
40|$|Kākāpō (Strigops habroptilus) are a {{critically}} endangered parrot species endemic to New Zealand that exhibit a reproductive strategy linked to “masting” years. Crucial to their survival is increased reproductive success. It has been hypothesised that their pattern of reproduction is synchronised with a steroidal “trigger” present in plants during intensive masting. If {{this hypothesis is}} valid, then Kākāpō and other closely related NZ parrots might be receptive to these masting plants in a manner {{different from that of}} other avian species. The aims of this study were firstly, to identify whether unique amino acid motifs were present in the ligand binding domains (LBD) for the steroid receptors oestrogen receptor α (ER-α), oestrogen receptor β (ER-β), androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) for the New Zealand <b>parrots</b> <b>Kākāpō,</b> Kākā, Kākāriki and Kea. These LBD amino acid sequences were compared with those in an Australian parrot, the Cockatiel, as well as in Chicken and Japanese Quail. Moreover, the role of these amino acid changes on the binding of ligands (both the native ligand and other steroidogenic compounds) for ER-α was assessed by in silico modelling by comparing the most favourable binding position of the ligands in the three-dimensional structure of Kākāpō ER-α with that of human ER-α. The second aim was to test extracts of New Zealand native plants known to be a food source for Kākāpō for their seasonal variation in oestrogenic activity and hence possible involvement in the reproductive cycle of Kākāpō. The LBD for ER-β and AR of the parrot species (New Zealand and Australian) displayed 100 % identity whilst those for ER-α and PR had variations. When the parrot sequences were compared with those for other avian species and human, {{there were a number of}} amino acid differences present, with the greatest disparity present in the LBD of ER-α. From in silico modelling studies, the amino acid substitutions in this receptor were predicted to have an indirect influence on the binding position of both 17 β-oestradiol and a number of phytoestrogens through changes in the structure of this region. Consequently, this could have an effect on the binding affinity of certain plant chemicals for ER-α and thus their potency. Plants extracts from the foliage and fruit of native New Zealand species were screened for oestrogenic activity in a yeast bioassay transfected with the human isoform of ER-α. The results from these experiments indicated that all the plants tested (excluding Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) exhibited detectable oestrogenic activity and a number also displayed variable and sometimes seasonal trends in activity. In summary, the results in this study identified ER-α LBD amino acid motifs unique to New Zealand parrots. For the other steroid receptors, the ER-β LBD had a three amino acid combination of M, V and L that was only present in the parrot species whilst both the AR and PR LBD displayed much greater inter-species conservation. These changes, particularly those in the ER-α LBD, may influence the binding of steroidogenic compounds, known to be present in the plants consumed by Kākāpō as demonstrated by in silico modelling. Thus, this research provides evidence that the diet of Kākāpō may influence their reproductive pattern. However, it remains to be determined whether the steroidogenic potency of these plant extracts is modified when interacting with the unique LBD of native NZ parrots...|$|R
