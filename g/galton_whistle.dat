Echolocation in bats was discovered by Lazzaro Spallanzani in 1794, when he demonstrated that bats hunted and navigated by inaudible sound and not vision. Francis Galton in 1893 invented the <b>Galton</b> <b>whistle,</b> an adjustable whistle which produced ultrasound, which he used to measure the hearing range of humans and other animals, demonstrating that many animals could hear sounds above the hearing range of humans. The first technological application of ultrasound was an attempt to detect submarines by Paul Langevin in 1917. The piezoelectric effect, discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880, was useful in transducers to generate and detect ultrasonic waves in air and water.|$|E

They are particularly useful in connection with microwaves because the latter's wave length can be easily duplicated with sound waves, making it possible to obtain the same diffraction pattern for both when confronted by the same metal obstacles. Thus, if a diffraction grating is chosen as a means of determining the wave length of microwaves, the wave length of the sound which produces the same diffraction pattern as the microwaves will be the wave length of the latter. Using sound with a wave length of three centimeters, the diffraction pattern for a grating of five slits was experimentally determined and compared with the calculated patterns for Fresnel and for Fraunhofer diffraction. The sound was produced {{in the back of a}} sound-absorbing box by either a <b>Galton</b> <b>whistle</b> or a small speaker driven by an oscillator; detection was by a microphone whose signal appeared on an oscilloscope...|$|E
