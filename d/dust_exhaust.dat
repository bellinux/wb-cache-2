40|$|Introduction: Endotoxin {{exposure}} {{associated with}} organic dust exposure {{has been studied}} in several industries. Coffee cherries that are dried directly after harvest may differ in dust and endotoxin emissions to those that are peeled and washed before drying. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure personal total dust and endotoxin levels and to evaluate their determinants of exposure in coffee processing factories. Methods: Using Sidekick Casella pumps at a flow rate of 2 l/min, total dust levels were measured in the workers’ breathing zone throughout the shift. Endotoxin was analyzed using the kinetic chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. Separate linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate exposure determinants for dust and endotoxin. Results: Total dust and endotoxin exposure were significantly higher in Robusta than in Arabica coffee factories (geometric mean 3. 41 mg/m³ and 10 800 EU/m 3 versus 2. 10 mg/m³ and 1400 EU/m³, respectively). Dry pre-processed coffee and differences in work tasks explained 30 % of the total variance for total dust and 71 % of the variance for endotoxin exposure. High exposure in Robusta processing is associated with the dry pre-processing method used after harvest. Conclusions: Dust and endotoxin exposure is high, in particular when processing dry preprocessed coffee. Minimization of dust emissions and use of efficient <b>dust</b> <b>exhaust</b> systems are important to prevent the development of respiratory system impairment in workers. </p...|$|E

Patients and methods: Data of 16, 486 subjects who had undergone spirometry with pre-bronchodilator and post-bronchodilator lung function assessment were retrieved from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007 – 2012 database. After excluding 2, 638 subjects with missing spirometry values, data of 13, 336 subjects were included for analysis. Factors associated with occupational inhalation, FeNO levels and COPD were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results: COPD was associated with occupational exposures to mineral <b>dusts,</b> organic <b>dusts,</b> <b>exhaust</b> fumes, other fumes, and second-hand smoking (P 50 ppb (ORs 0. 058 and 0. 210, respectively). Conclusion: Occupational exposures to airborne pollutants carries higher risk of COPD than non-exposure and the risk is higher the longer the duration of exposure. Exposure–response relationships are inconsistent in subjects with suspected asthmatic airway inflammation (FeNO ≥ 50 ppb). More careful risk assessment is needed in occupational inhalation exposure, since COPD with asthmatic airway inflammation, or asthma-COPD overlapping syndrome, may have the distinguishing features of both COPD and asthma.

The use of high- effective dust capturing devices, reducing leakage degree of dust particles thrown out from aspiration cutting dust schemes {{is one of the most}} promising and effective ways to decrease dust emissions at the cement producing enterprises. The article shows some summary results of the field power determination for dust emission, dust of sand and expanded clay, leak out of equipment, workplaces and aspiration schemes of expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. The results of the analysis of dust particles with various dimensions and the experimental determination of the degree of dust separating apparatuses’ leaking out was used for design and development of the new wet dust cleaner -separator. The experiments were carried out to get the leakage's degree of dust particles thrown out from this new wet cleaner’ modification at the industrial plants. The statistical treatment of the experimental results allowed us to get dependence of the leakage of dust's particles in these wet dust cleaners - separators within the studied aerodynamic range of work regime. The results showed that the proposed wet scrubbing dust cleaners provide a significant reduction of dust emissions (expanded clay and sand) into the atmosphere from expanded clay and cement manufacturing enterprises. It is recommended to use the results of the development of dust wet cleaning devices in decreasing of dust aspiration schemes in the building construction industry...|$|R
