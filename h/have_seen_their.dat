5|$|After an {{impressive}} underdog triumph {{in making the}} playoffs in 2010, and Joe Sacco finishing third in Jack Adams Trophy voting, the Avs failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in 2011. Earning only 68 points in the standings, setting a franchise record for losing and winless streaks after the All-Star break, the Avalanche <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> worst season yet since moving to Denver. One point less than their previous worst season in 2008–09. They finished 29th in the 30-team NHL, besting only their division mates, the Edmonton Oilers. Matt Duchene set a franchise record as the youngest scoring leader in Quebec/Colorado history with 67 points, sharing the club goals-leader title with David Jones, each with 27 tallies. Former Avs great Peter Forsberg attempted a comeback in the NHL with Colorado mid-season. After two games, zero points and compiling a plus-minus rating of –4, however, Forsberg announced his retirement from professional hockey. Captain Adam Foote also retired after the final game of the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro has led to extensive discussion about its possible effect on inflation. In the short term, there was a widespread impression in the population of the eurozone that the {{introduction of}} the euro had led to an increase in prices, but this impression was not confirmed by general indices of inflation and other studies. A study of this paradox found that this was due to an asymmetric effect of the {{introduction of the}} euro on prices: while it had no effect on most goods, it had an effect on cheap goods which <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> price round up after the {{introduction of the euro}}. The study found that consumers based their beliefs on inflation of those cheap goods which are frequently purchased. It has also been suggested that the jump in small prices may be because prior to the introduction, retailers made fewer upward adjustments and waited for the introduction of the euro to do so.|$|E
5|$|Desperately {{trying to}} figure out a {{connection}} between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there immediately. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins in extreme detail. Graham determines which employees that match their profile information have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. At Dollarhyde's home, Reba is terrified as he contemplates what to do with her. As he struggles to kill Reba with a piece of broken mirror glass, police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone inside with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is quickly subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to wound Crawford and kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen to shoot Graham, but misses because of his injuries and is killed himself when Graham returns fire. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics before Graham returns home and retires permanently.|$|E

25|$|Geologically {{one of the}} {{youngest}} inhabited territories on Earth, Easter Island, located in the mid-Pacific Ocean, was, for most of its history, one of the most isolated. Its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, have endured famines, epidemics of disease and cannibalism, civil war, slave raids, various colonial contacts, and <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> population crash on more than one occasion. The ensuing cultural legacy has brought the island notoriety out of proportion to the number of its inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} many villages, cities and {{mountains}} all over Catalonia, like Santa Susanna, Sant Sadurní d'Anoia, or Sant Llorenç del Munt, {{as well as}} a great number of chapels and hermitages spread all over the territory, remain as a testimony of the ancestral faith of the Catalans.

25|$|Among {{advanced}} players, {{there is}} little argument about whether technological changes have enabled higher scoring. The general consensus has been that they have. Yet {{there are those who}} <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> scores decline, often because they did not change their technique or bowling balls appropriately. Some argue that such high technology unfairly affects competition, making high scores too dependent on how much money one spends on equipment. The USBC, for various reasons, has struggled to regulate these changes well enough to protect the integrity of their honor score award program.|$|E

25|$|The {{parliamentary}} constituency of Cambridge covers {{most of the}} city. Daniel Zeichner (Labour) {{was elected}} Member of Parliament (MP) at the 2015 general election, replacing Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat. He was re-elected in the 2017 general election. One area of the city, Queen Edith's ward, lies in the South Cambridgeshire constituency, whose MP is Heidi Allen (Conservative). Allen was also elected in 2015, succeeding Andrew Lansley, and was re-elected in 2017. The city had previously elected a Labour MP from 1992 to 2005 and prior to this, usually elected a Conservative after the Second World War.

25|$|Misdeal: A misdeal is a deal {{in which}} all players have not {{received}} {{the same number of}} cards or a player has dealt out of turn. A misdeal may be discovered immediately by counting the cards after they are dealt, or it may be discovered during play of a hand. If a single card is misdealt and discovered before players in question <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> cards the player that is short a card can pull a card at random from the player with an extra card. Otherwise a hand is misdealt, the hand is considered void and the hand must be redealt by the same dealer (unless the reason for the redeal is the hand was dealt out of turn).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the years}} 1970, the {{beginning}} of the oil sands operation {{in the vicinity of the}} localities of Mboukou, Tchikanou, Loango first by the oil company SPAEF became later ELF, then by Maurel and Prom, and finally by ENI (formerly AGIP research), it could have been expected that the living conditions of the populations improved. It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, sanitary and school infrastructure worthy of the name has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> area of activity polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields (cassava, yams, plantains) that allow Pointe-Noire to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit for food use. ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated. Even this distribution is done at the head of the customer by favoring those who have relationships or money.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of claim jumpers {{is seen as}} problematic by some regulars in the lower series, who complain about more accomplished Cup drivers taking the top prize money and thus leading to loss of sponsorship for their efforts. Cup drivers often run in cars fielded by or affiliated with their Cup Series teams, giving them superior equipment and increased resources. The {{presence of}} the Cup teams have driven up the costs of competition, forcing many independent Nationwide Series teams to shut their doors. Many sponsors are hesitant to put financial backing behind an unproven driver, insisting that Cup drivers run in {{at least part of}} the schedule, which has led to several incidents of young drivers receiving part-time schedules or being pulled from an entry before (or during) a race in favor of a Cup driver. In 2008, for example, Kelly Bires was forced to sit out the Daytona season opener due to contractual obligations with JR Motorsports' sponsor Unilever stating that Dale Earnhardt Jr. drive a certain number of races for the team. Other criticisms of Buschwacking cite the lack of Busch Series veterans left in the series. Long-time series regulars and champions (such as Steve Grissom, David Green, Randy LaJoie, Jason Keller, Casey Atwood, and Ashton Lewis, Jr.) <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> exit from the series in the 2000s, while 2000 champion Jeff Green has driven primarily in start and park entries since 2011.|$|E
500|$|While {{there had}} been legislatures with more than two {{chambers}} (tricameral and tetracameral ones), nowadays there are only unicameral and bicameral ones. Additionally, there are also differences {{in the degree of}} bicameralism.

There is a slight trend towards unicameralism; some upper houses <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> powers reduced or proposals to that end. Belgium's system has been reduced from a perfectly bicameral one to a nowadays de facto unicameral system. In 2009, Romania voted in favour of unicameralism, on a plebiscite, however the country still has a bicameral system, as of [...] On the other hand, Ireland narrowly voted against abolishing their upper house in 2013, and Italy voted not to reduce its Senate's powers in 2016.|$|E
500|$|Watership Downs {{universal}} motifs {{of liberation}} and self-determination {{have led to}} the tendency of minority groups to read their own narrative into the novel, despite the author's assurance (in 2005) that it [...] "was never intended to become some sort of allegory or parable." [...] Rachel Kadish, reflecting on her own superimposition of the founding of Israel onto Watership Down, has remarked [...] "Turns out plenty of other people <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>their</b> histories in that book...some people see it as an allegory for struggles against the Cold War, fascism, extremism...a protest against materialism, against the corporate state.
