5000|$|In Germany, <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> (literally circle-free city) is the {{equivalent}} term for a city with the competences of both the Gemeinde (municipality) and the Kreis (district, literally circle) administrative level. The directly elected {{chief executive officer of}} a <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> is called Oberbürgermeister (literally Superior Burgomaster, in English [...] "Chief Mayor" [...] or [...] "Lord Mayor").The British counties have no directly corresponding counterpart in Germany. This German system corresponds to statutory cities in Austria and in the Czech Republic.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 (latest data available) the GDP per {{inhabitant}} was €68,460. This {{places the}} <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> 7th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €36,691).|$|R
5000|$|In Germany, {{several states}} have the <b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> (literally [...] "district-free town" [...] or [...] "district-free city") as {{administrative}} sub-division. In Baden-Württemberg such a division is called Stadtkreis ("urban district").|$|R
50|$|The City Council of Dresden is {{the elected}} {{representative}} {{body of the}} citizens of Dresden that administers the affairs of Dresden a self-governing city <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> in the Free State of Saxony.|$|R
50|$|In 1889, Forchheim {{became a}} <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt,</b> conferring on it certain {{enhanced}} local powers. It lost this status in 1972 under Bavarian regional government reform, and was united with Landkreis Forchheim, the local district.Since then its title is Große Kreisstadt.|$|R
50|$|Flensburg (Flensborg, Low Saxon: Flensborg, North Frisian: Flansborj, South Jutlandic: Flensborre) is an {{independent}} town (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> {{in the north of}} the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. Flensburg is the centre of the region of Southern Schleswig. After Kiel and Lübeck it is the third largest town in Schleswig-Holstein.|$|R
50|$|A Gemeindestraße is a {{local road}} in Germany that is the {{responsibility}} of the municipality or parish (Gemeinde) or of the town (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> to build and/or maintain. In the official ranking of roads by importance a Gemeindestraße falls below a Kreisstraße and, unlike the latter, it is not numbered.|$|R
5000|$|Schwabach (...) is a German town {{of about}} 40,000 {{inhabitants}} near Nuremberg in {{the centre of the}} region of Franconia in the North of Bavaria. The city is an autonomous administrative district (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt).</b> Schwabach is also the name of a river, which runs through the city prior joining the Rednitz.|$|R
50|$|As {{a larger}} mid-sized city, Marburg, like six other such cities in Hessen, {{has a special}} status as {{compared}} to the other municipalities in the district. This means that the city takes on tasks more usually performed by the district so that in many ways it is comparable to an urban district (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The City of Hanover was {{not part}} of the {{district}} until 2001, when the old Hanover District and the city (then known officially as <b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> Hannover, which means [...] "District Free city of Hanover") were merged in order to form the new Region Hannover district (not to be confused with the former Regierungsbezirk Hannover).|$|R

It {{has a population}} of 74,500 and is located 10 km west of downtown Bremen with which it forms a contiguous urban area, whereas the city of Oldenburg is 25 km to the northwest. The city has a total area of and a population density of approx. 1200 inhabitants per km².|$|R
50|$|Frankfurt {{is one of}} five {{independent}} district-free cities (kreisfreie Städte) in Hesse, {{which means}} that it does not form part of another general-purpose local government entity, in this case it is not part of a Landkreis. The other four cities are the second to fifth largest cities in Hesse: Wiesbaden, Kassel, Darmstadt and Offenbach am Main. A <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> has territorial sovereignty within its defined city limits.|$|R
50|$|Bamberg is {{an urban}} district, or <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt.</b> Its town council (Stadtrat) and its Mayor (Oberbürgermeister) are elected every six years, {{though not in}} the same year. Thus, the last {{municipal}} election for the town council was in 2014, for the Mayor in 2012. As an exception to the six-year term, the term starting in 2012 will take eight years to synchronize the elections with those in the rest of Bavaria.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, {{under the}} Prussian local {{government}} reforms, {{the cities of}} Gelsenkirchen and Buer along with the Amt of Horst together became a new <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> called Gelsenkirchen-Buer, effective on 1 April that year. From that time, the whole city area belonged to the governmental district of Münster. In 1930, on the city's advice, the city's name was changed to Gelsenkirchen, effective 21 May. By this time, the city was home to about 340,000 people.|$|R
5000|$|Becoming {{effective}} on 21 October 2009, the Städteregion Aachen (literally: [...] "cities region" [...] Aachen) was formed {{from the former}} district Aachen (Kreis Aachen) {{and the city of}} Aachen. This is the first Städteregion that was formed in North Rhine-Westphalia. Its status {{is similar to that of}} the district Hanover (Region Hannover) in Lower Saxony, in that the powers of the city of Aachen are slightly less than those of an district-free city (<b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt).</b>|$|R
50|$|Schneeberg’s {{more than}} 500-year-long {{history has been}} shaped by mining more than {{anything}} else, laying the very groundwork for the town’s founding. The original silver mining also yielded cobalt and bismuth mining by the mid 16th century. When uranium mining was being undertaken between 1946 and 1958, the town’s population quickly rose, leading to Schneeberg’s status as a district-free town (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> between 1952 and 1958. Afterwards it once again belonged to the district of Aue.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{runs through}} various rural {{counties}} (Landkreise): The stations from Neustadt an der Weinstrasse to Rohrbach and from Steinfeld to Schweighofen are - {{with the exception}} of the independent towns (<b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> of Neustadt an der Weinstrasse and Landau - in the county of Südliche Weinstrasse, the stations from Steinweiler to Maximiliansau Eisenbahnstrasse and Schaidt in the county of Germersheim; the stations from Maxau to Karlsruhe Hauptbahnhof in the city of Karlsruhe, and Wissembourg in the French county (Arrondissement) of Wissembourg in the Département of Bas-Rhin.|$|R
5000|$|... is a <b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> (urban district) in the German {{state of}} Saxony-Anhalt. It is {{situated}} at {{the confluence of the}} rivers Elbe and Mulde. The town was formed by merger of the towns of Dessau and Roßlau {{in the course of the}} [...] "Kreisreform Sachsen-Anhalt" [...] (Sachsen-Ahalt Regional Boundary Reforms) on 1 July 2007. The reform involved a reduction in the number of rural districts in Sachsen-Anhalt to from 21 to 11 and reflected an expected continuation of the significant population decline being experienced.|$|R
50|$|On 1 April 1889, Flensburg {{became an}} {{independent}} city (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> within the Province of Schleswig-Holstein, {{and at the}} same time still kept its status as seat of the Flensburg district. In 1920, the League of Nations decided that the matter of the German-Danish border would be settled by a vote. As a result of the plebiscite, and the way the voting zones were laid out, some of Flensburg's northern neighbourhoods were ceded to Denmark, whereas Flensburg as a whole voted with a great majority to stay in Germany.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1973 Celle {{lost its}} status as an {{independent}} town (<b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt)</b> and became the largest municipality in the new district (Kreis) of Celle. It also became the largest town in the new region (Regierungsbezirk) of Lüneburg. At {{the same time the}} localities of Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn were incorporated into Gifhorn district. Since then the parish of Hohne has looked after six villages (Hohne, Helmerkamp, Spechtshorn, Ummern, Pollhöfen and Hahnenhorn) in two rural districts. The town of Celle has also incorporated a number of villages from the surrounding area.|$|R
5000|$|A Kreisstraße (literally: [...] "{{district}} road" [...] or [...] "county road") is a {{class of}} road in Germany. It carries traffic between the towns and villages within a Kreis or district or between two neighbouring districts. In importance, the Kreisstraße ranks below a Landesstraße (or, in Bavaria and Saxony, a Staatstraße, i.e. a state road), but above a Gemeindestraße or [...] "local road". Kreisstraßen are usually {{the responsibility of the}} respective rural district (Landkreis) or urban district (<b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt),</b> with the exception of high streets through larger towns and villages. Kreisstraßen are usually dual-lane roads but, in a few cases, can be built as limited-access dual carriageways in densely populated areas.|$|R
5000|$|Landesstraßen (singular: Landesstraße) are {{roads in}} Germany and Austria that are, as a rule, the {{responsibility}} of the respective German or Austrian federal state. The term may therefore be translated as [...] "state road". They are roads that cross the boundary of a rural or urban district (Landkreis or <b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt).</b> A Landesstraße is thus less important than a Bundesstraße or federal road, but more significant than a Kreisstraße or district road. The classification of a road as a Landesstraße is a legal matter (Widmung). In the free states of Bavaria and Saxony - but not, however, in the Free State of Thuringia - Landesstraßen are known as Staatsstraßen.|$|R
50|$|In 1885, after Bochum {{district}} was split up, Gelsenkirchen became {{the seat of}} its own district (Kreis), which would last until 1926. The cities of Gelsenkirchen and Wattenscheid, {{as well as the}} Ämter of Braubauerschaft (in 1900, Bismarck), Schalke, Ückendorf, Wanne and Wattenscheid all belonged to the Gelsenkirchen district. A few years later, in 1896, Gelsenkirchen split off from Gelsenkirchen district to become an independent city (<b>kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt).</b> In 1891, Horst was split off from the Amt of Buer, which itself was raised to city status in 1911, and to an independent city status the next year. Meanwhile, Horst became the seat of its own Amt. In 1924, the rural community of Rotthausen, which until then had belonged to the Essen district, was made part of the Gelsenkirchen district.|$|R
40|$|The European ICT Poles of Excellence (EIPE) {{research}} {{project is a}} joint project of DG CNECT and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies that established the conditions for defining, identifying, analysing and monitoring the existence and progress of current and future European ICT Poles of Excellence (EIPE), in order to distinguish these among the many European ICT clusters, observe their dynamics and offer an analysis of their characteristics. A case study report investigates 5 selected EIPEs – Inner London East, Paris, <b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> Darmstadt, Dublin and Byen Kobenhavn. It presents and interprets the data collected {{during the course of}} the project to understand the actual facts, context and story of each location, i. e. its R&D, innovation and business activity. The case study report is complemented by 4 short notes, which offer the summarised views of local experts on the role played by public policies in the emergence and the sustainability of ICT activity in their region. The present note is on Copenhagen. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the EIPE case study report {{is to provide a}} more {{thorough}} analysis of five EIPEs, presenting and interpreting the data collected within the course of the project to understand the actual facts, context and story of each location, i. e. its R&D, innovation and business activity. This way, each case study gives a detailed picture of the type of activity and actors located in each EIPE organized along the methodological dimensions (activities and characteristics) explained in the methodological EIPE Report 2 (De Prato and Nepelski 2013 b). This exercise is meant to cast more light on the type of activity and actors in each location and to reveal their strengths and weaknesses. This information is expected to give a better overview of the ICT environment in each of the location and to help to understand their role in the European ICT landscape. The report attempts to give a detailed overview of ICT-related activity in five selected regions: •	Inner-London East (UKI 12), •	Paris (FR 101), •	<b>Kreisfreie</b> <b>Stadt</b> Darmstadt (DE 711), •	Dublin (IE 021), •	Byen Kobenhavn (DK 011).
