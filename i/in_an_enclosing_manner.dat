40|$|DE 102008048655 A 1 UPAB: 20100331 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a {{transport}} network, a heat transfer medium, where thermodynamic state and/or physical- and/or chemical-properties {{of the medium}} are changed by heat absorption at a heat source. The heat transfer medium is arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> container (2) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> <b>manner,</b> where the container has a heat-conducting internal structure that allows thermal conduction between the medium and heat source and/or a heat sink. The heat transfer medium is made of zeolites, silica gel, activated carbon, metal oxide compound, aluminophosphate, silico-aluminophosphate or layered silicate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for transporting heat using a transport system. USE - Automated transport system for transporting a heat transfer medium on a truck and/or rail vehicle for a heating and cooling system, a solar system and solar thermal power plant (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The heat transfer medium is arranged in the container <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>enclosed</b> <b>manner,</b> where the container has the heat-conducting internal structure that allows thermal conduction between the medium and heat source and/or the heat sink, thus providing automated exchange of the heat within building. The system is scalable from the milliliter to the ton scale...|$|R
