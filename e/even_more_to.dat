German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy have hit a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role in the student body's social landscape. In the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations began to rise to prominence.|$|E

Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along the Monroe County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow virtually identical northeasterly alignments.|$|E

For example, in Europe recordings for years required playback with a bass turnover setting of 250–300Hz and a treble roll-off at 10,000Hz ranging from 0 to −5dB or more. In the US there were more varied practices and a tendency to use higher bass turnover frequencies such as 500Hz as well as a greater treble rolloff like −8.5dB and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> record generally higher modulation levels on the record.|$|E

25|$|Understanding a {{particular}} musical style's treatment of dissonance—what is considered dissonant and what rules or procedures govern how dissonant intervals, chords, or notes are treated—is key in understanding that particular style. For instance, harmony is generally governed by chords, which are collections of notes defined as tolerably consonant by the style. (There is likely, however, to be {{a hierarchy of}} chords, with some considered more consonant and some more dissonant.) Any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony is considered dissonant. A given style typically pays attention to how its musical structure approaches dissonance (in steps is less jarring, a leap is more jarring), and <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> how they resolve (almost always by step), to how they fit within the meter and rhythm (dissonances on strong beats are more emphatic, those on weaker beats less vital), and to how they lie within the phrase (dissonances tend to resolve at phrase's end).|$|E

Though Sojourner did not have any warrior skills to speak of, Artemis stood by her friend and tutored her as a novice Amazon. For unknown reasons Artemis left the Hellenders and aided Diana in Gateway City as a fellow crime fighter. She also became close friends with Cassie Sandsmark. Artemis' {{previous}} teacher/mentor relationship with Sojourner was later expanded as Wonder Woman asked Artemis to take Cassie on as a new pupil. It was with Artemis' Amazon training lessons that Cassie was able to hone her skills in becoming the new Wonder Girl. Later still, Artemis' teacher/mentor resume would expand <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> even include the combat training of Supergirl. It was during the initial meeting with Supergirl that Artemis would gain her revenge against Batman for his hostile attitude towards her when she attempted to join the Justice League.

500|$|Sholay was {{the first}} Indian film to have a {{stereophonic}} soundtrack {{and to use the}} 70mm widescreen format. However, since actual 70mm cameras were expensive at the time, the film was shot on traditional 35mm film and the 4:3 picture was subsequently converted to a 2.2:1 frame. Regarding the process, Sippy said, [...] "A 70mm [...] format takes the awe of the big screen and magnifies it <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> make the picture even bigger, but since I also wanted a spread of sound we used six-track stereophonic sound and combined it with the big screen. It was definitely a differentiator." [...] The use of 70mm was emphasised by film posters on which the name of the film was stylised to match the CinemaScope logo. Film posters also sought to differentiate the film from those which had come before; one of them added the tagline: [...] "The greatest star cast ever assembled– the greatest story ever told".|$|E

500|$|Breaking {{through the}} Narva Isthmus {{situated}} between the Gulf of Finland and Lake Peipus was of major strategic {{importance to the}} Soviet Armed Forces. The success of the Estonian operation would have provided an unobstructed lane to advance along the coast to Tallinn, forcing the German Army Group North to escape from Estonia for fear of getting cornered. For the Baltic Fleet trapped in an eastern bay of the Gulf of Finland, Tallinn was the closest exit to the Baltic Sea. The ejection of the Army Group North from Estonia would have made Finland subject to air and amphibious attacks originating from Estonian bases. The prospect of an invasion of East Prussia through Estonia appealed <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Stavka, as it could bring German resistance to a standstill.

Des McAnuff, who directed the musical at both La Jolla Playhouse and on Broadway, decided to bring many actors from the original cast with him despite weeks of auditions with thousands of actors trying out for the roles in front of him.
