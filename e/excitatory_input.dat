5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> from the {{pyramidal}} cells {{and then give}} an inhibitory feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic spines usually receive <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> from axons {{although}} sometimes both inhibitory and excitatory {{connections are}} made onto the same spine head.|$|E
50|$|Eventually <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> {{from the}} cortex results in net {{inhibition}} of {{upper motor neurons}} thus preventing them from initiating a movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} {{pyramidal}} neurons to integrate information {{depends on the}} number and distribution of the synaptic inputs they receive. A single pyramidal cell receives about 30,000 <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> and 1700 inhibitory (IPSPs) <b>inputs.</b> <b>Excitatory</b> (EPSPs) <b>inputs</b> terminate exclusively on the dendritic spines, while inhibitory (IPSPs) inputs terminate on dendritic shafts, the soma, and even the axon. Pyramidal neurons can be excited and inhibited by the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA, respectively.|$|R
40|$|SummaryOrientation {{selectivity}} (OS) is an emergent {{property in}} the primary visual cortex (V 1). How OS arises from synaptic circuits remains unsolved. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse V 1 revealed that simple cells received broadly tuned excitation and even more broadly tuned inhibition. Excitation and inhibition shared a similar orientation preference and temporally overlapped substantially. Neuron modeling and dynamic-clamp recording further revealed that <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> alone would result in membrane potential responses with significantly attenuated selectivity, due to a saturating input-output function of the membrane filtering. Inhibition ameliorated the attenuation of excitatory selectivity by expanding the input dynamic range and caused additional sharpening of output responses beyond unselectively suppressing responses at all orientations. This “blur-sharpening” effect allows selectivity conveyed by <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> to be better expressed, which may be a general mechanism underlying the generation of feature-selective responses {{in the face of}} strong <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> that are weakly biased...|$|R
25|$|The {{subthalamic nucleus}} is a diencephalic gray matter {{portion of the}} basal ganglia, and the only portion of the ganglia that {{produces}} an excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. The role of the subthalamic nucleus is to stimulate the SNr-GPi complex and {{it is part of}} the indirect pathway. The subthalamic nucleus receives inhibitory input from the external part of the globus pallidus and sends <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> to the GPi.|$|E
25|$|However, the BOLD signal cannot {{separate}} {{feedback and}} feedforward active networks in a region; the slowness of the vascular response means the final signal is the summed {{version of the}} whole region's network; blood flow is not discontinuous as the processing proceeds. Also, both inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> to a neuron from other neurons sum {{and contribute to the}} BOLD signal. Within a neuron these two inputs might cancel out. The BOLD response can also be affected by a variety of factors, including disease, sedation, anxiety, medications that dilate blood vessels, and attention (neuromodulation).|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also {{discovered}} that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). [...] This phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only {{by the kind of}} neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. [...] In the case of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, the result is a reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. [...] DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. [...] Both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. [...] Some groups show that both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, can still be evoked in the knock-outs (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). [...] The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown cannabinoid receptor. [...] Interestingly, some work has shown that anandamide can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. [...] This receptor is present in the brain, and anandamide actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002). [...] However DSE is currently a largely unexplored phenomenon and {{more research is needed to}} draw any firm conclusions.|$|E
40|$|Neurons of the {{cochlear}} nuclei are anatomically and physiologically specialized to optimally encode temporal and spectral information about sound stimuli, {{in part for}} binaural auditory processing. The avian cochlear nucleus magnocellularis (NM) integrates <b>excitatory</b> eighth nerve <b>inputs</b> and depolarizing GABAergic inhibition such that temporal fidelity is enhanced across the synapse. The biophysical mechanisms of this depolarizing inhibition, {{and its role in}} temporal processing, are not fully understood. We used whole-cell electrophysiology and computational modeling to examine how subthreshold <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> are integrated and how depolarizing IPSPs affect spike thresholds and synaptic integration by chick NM neurons. We found that both depolarizing inhibition and subthreshold <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> cause voltage threshold accommodation, nonlinear temporal summation, and shunting. Inhibition caused such large changes in threshold that subthreshold <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> were followed by a refractory period. We hypothesize that these large shifts in threshold eliminate spikes to asynchronous inputs, providing a mechanism for the enhanced temporal fidelity seen across the eighth nerve/ cochlear nucleus synapse. Thus, depolarizing inhibition and threshold shifting hone the temporal response properties of this system s...|$|R
50|$|<b>Excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> to the VB are medial lemniscal (ML) and corticothalamic (CT) glutamatergic synapses. The ML is a sensory afferent {{input and}} the CT is from layer VI {{of the primary}} sensory cortex.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{and precise}} role of intracortical circuits in generating orientation tuned responses in visual cortical neurons is still controversial. To address this question, {{the relationship between}} excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections and orientation maps in ferret striate cortex was investigated by combining in vivo optical imaging and in vitro scanning laser photostimulation. <b>Excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>inputs</b> to pyramidal cells originated preferentially from regions with similar orientation preference. Prominent cross-orientation inhibition was not observed, arguing against crossorientation models of orientation selectivity. The tuning of inhibitory inputs was significantly broader in both layer 2 / 3 and layer 5 / 6 pyramidal neurons compared to the tuning of <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs.</b> Local <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> were more prominent in the 0 – 20 ° tuning difference range between pre- and postsynaptic cells than inhibitory inputs, whereas inhibition dominated in the 20 – 40 ° tuning difference range. These differences in tuning of <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>inputs</b> onto individual cells {{are consistent with the}} predictions of recurrent models of orientation selectivity...|$|R
50|$|Cerebellar granule cells receive <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> from 3 or 4 mossy fibers {{originating}} from pontine nuclei. Mossy fibres make an excitatory connection onto granule cells which cause the granule cell to fire an action potential.|$|E

50|$|These fibers provide very powerful, <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> to the {{cerebellum}} {{which results}} in the generation of complex spike excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in Purkinje cells. In this way climbing fibers (CFs) perform {{a central role in}} motor behaviors.|$|E
40|$|Striatal spiny {{projection}} neurons (SPNs) receive convergent <b>excitatory</b> synaptic <b>inputs</b> {{from the}} cortex and thalamus. Activation of spatially clustered and temporally synchronized <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> at the distal dendrites could trigger plateau potentials in SPNs. Such supralinear synaptic integration {{is crucial for}} dendritic computation. However, how plateau potentials interact with subsequent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs remains unknown. By combining computational simulation, two-photon imaging, optogenetics, and dualcolor uncaging of glutamate and GABA, we demonstrate that plateau potentials can broaden the spatiotemporal window for integrating <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> and promote spiking. The temporal window of spiking can be delicately controlled by GABAergic inhibition in a celltype–specific manner. This subtle inhibitory control of plateau potential depends on the location and kinetics of the GABAergic inputs and is achieved by the balance between relief and reestablishment of NMDA receptor Mg 2 + block. These findings represent a mechanism for controlling spatiotemporal synaptic integration in SPNs...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{inhibitory}} input to single neuronal models, {{such as the}} FitzHugh–Nagumo model and the Hodgkin–Huxley model, can sometimes increase their firing rates, a phenomenon which we term inhibition-boosted firing (IBF). Here we consider neuronal models with diffusion approximation inputs, i. e. they share the identical first- and second-order statistics of the corresponding Poisson process inputs. Using the integrate-and-fire model and the IF-FHN model, we explore theoretically how and when IBF can happen. For both models, it is shown {{that there is a}} critical input frequency at which the efferent firing rate is identical when the neuron receives purely <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> or exactly balanced inhibitory and <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs.</b> When the input frequency is lower than the critical frequency, IBF occurs...|$|R
40|$|Neurons in {{the medial}} {{superior}} olive (MSO) enable sound localization by their remarkable sensitivity to submillisecond interaural time differences (ITDs). Each MSO neuron {{has its own}} "best ITD" to which it responds optimally. A difference in physical path length of the <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> from both ears cannot fully account for the ITD tuning of MSO neurons. As a result, it is still debated how these inputs interact and whether the segregation of inputs to opposite dendrites, well-timed synaptic inhibition, or asymmetries in synaptic potentials or cellular morphology further optimize coincidence detection or ITD tuning. Using invivo whole-cell and juxtacellular recordings, we show here that ITD tuning of MSO neurons {{is determined by the}} timing of their <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs.</b> The inputs from both ears sum linearly, whereas spike probability depends nonlinearly on the size of synaptic inputs. This simple coincidence detection scheme thus makes accurate sound localization possible...|$|R

5000|$|Ultimately, {{these cells}} {{contribute}} to mechanisms underlying visual perception. A simple end-stopped cell will display length selectivity {{as well as}} orientation selectivity. In terms of cortical architecture, it may receive input from ordinary simple cells of identical orientation. [...] For example, the activating region could consist of a simple cell that sends <b>excitatory</b> <b>input,</b> while the antagonistic region could consist of simple cells that provide inhibitory input. A complex end-stopped cell would select for orientation, motion, and direction, but also for length. It could receive input from a set of complex cells, {{in a similar fashion}} to the scheme previously mentioned. The activating region could consist of a complex cell that sends <b>excitatory</b> <b>input</b> and the antagonistic region could consist of complex cells that send inhibitory input.|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} among <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> {{arising from the}} prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, and innervating nucleus accumbens neurons were studied using in viva intracellular recording techniques. Neurons recorded in the accumbens displayed one of three activity states: (1) silent, (2) spontaneously firing at low, constant rates, or (3) a bistable membrane potential, characterized by alternating periods of activity and silence occurring in concert with spontaneous transitions between two steady-state membrane potentials (average,- 77. 3 & 7. 1 mV base,- 63. 0 t 7. 4 mV plateau). These neurons also exhibited {{a high degree of}} convergence of responses elicited by stimulation of each of the three <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> tested.

All 4 Gls received only <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> from a group of filiform hairs on the ipsilateral cercus. In addition to the ipsilateral <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs,</b> Gls 8 - 1 and 9 - 1 received weak excitatory and strong inhibitory inputs from a group of filiform hairs on the contralateral cercus. Gl 9 - 2 received only inhibitory inputs filiform hairs on the contralateral cercus. Gl 9 - 3 received <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> from filiform hairs on the contralateral cercus and no inhibitory input was confirmed. In addition to such simple excitatory and inhibitory connections, the rebound motion of cercal filiform hairs had some role in organizing the receptive fields of Gls 9 - 2 and 9 - 3. Furthermore, the possibility of using a rebound depolarization of the membrane potential for mediating the long latency response in Gls 8 - 1 and 9 - 2 will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Layer 2 / 3 (L 2 / 3) {{pyramidal}} cells receive <b>excitatory</b> afferent <b>input</b> {{both from}} neighbouring pyramidal cells and from cortical and subcortical regions. The efficacy of these <b>excitatory</b> synaptic <b>inputs</b> is modulated by spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Here {{we report that}} synaptic connections between L 2 / 3 pyramidal cell pairs are located proximal to the soma, at sites overlapping those of <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> from other cortical layers. Nevertheless, STDP at L 2 / 3 pyramidal to pyramidal cell connections showed fundamental differences from known STDP rules at these neighbouring contacts. Coincident low-frequency pre- and postsynaptic activation evoked only LTD, independent {{of the order of}} the pre- and postsynaptic cell firing. This symmetric anti-Hebbian STDP switched to a typical Hebbian learning rule if a postsynaptic action potential train occurred prior to the presynaptic stimulation. Receptor dependence of LTD and LTP induction and their pre- or postsynaptic loci also differed from those at other L 2 / 3 pyramidal cell <b>excitatory</b> <b>inputs.</b> Overall, we demonstrate a novel means to switch between STDP rules dependent on the history of postsynaptic activity. We also highlight differences in STDP at excitatory synapses onto L 2 / 3 pyramidal cells which allow for input specific modulation of synaptic gain...|$|R

The synaptic mechanisms underlying intensity tuning remain unclear. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in rat auditory cortex revealed that intensity-tuned neurons, mostly clustered in a posterior zone, receive imbalanced tone-evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic <b>inputs.</b> <b>Excitatory</b> <b>inputs</b> exhibit nonmonotonic intensity tuning, whereas with tone intensity increments, the temporally delayed inhibitory inputs increase monotonically in strength. In addition, this delay reduces {{with the increase of}} intensity, resulting in an enhanced suppression of excitation at high intensities and a significant sharpening of intensity tuning. In contrast, non-intensity-tuned neurons exhibit covaried <b>excitatory</b> and inhibitory <b>inputs,</b> and the relative time interval between them is stable with intensity increments, resulting in monotonic response-level function.
