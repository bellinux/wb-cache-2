Using a two-stage model to segregate the discretionary part in the <b>estimated</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of derivatives and based on information from {{the third quarter of}} 2002 to the fourth quarter of 2010, the empirical results confirm the reversing nature of these discretionary actions, show that banks utilize this type of action as a mechanism for earnings smoothing, and disclose that this practice is more common in private institutions, smaller in asset size and with lower capitalization.

40|$|When {{evaluating}} {{a pension}} arrangement one must {{account for the}} risks to that arrangement. This study does this for the Canada Pension Plan. To do so we estimate the fair value and private cost structure contribution rates. The fair value rate is the actuarially fair contribution rate consistent with the CPP’s risk characteristics. The private cost structure rate is the rate that a fully-funded CPP would need to charge if it faced the administrative and adverse selection costs of private annuity providers. <b>Estimated</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> rates range between 8 and 9 per cent, depending on assumed plan risk and equilibrium default-free returns. This range {{is lower than the}} statutory rate of 9. 9 per cent and the sustainable rate of 9. 8 per cent that ensures long-run asset-expenditure ratio sustainability. The sustainable rate is above the fair value rate because the CPP faces an unfunded liability cost as long as default-free returns exceed the expected growth of contributory earnings. Private cost rates range from 11 to 12 per cent and are above the fair value rate because of high private administrative cost and adverse selection costs that affect private annuity markets. Private cost rates are higher than the sustainable rate because private adverse selection and administrative costs exceed the CPP unfunded liability cost. ...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{indicating}} {{the development of}} household wealth in Germany are typically based on nominal values and do not take account of price rises and thus the actual purchasing power of those assets. DIW Berlin took inflation into account in a recent evaluation {{and concluded that the}} average net worth of households in Germany decreased in real terms by almost 15 percent from 2003 to 2013. This figure, based on the German Income and Expenditure Survey (Einkommens- und Verbrauchsstichprobe, EVS) of the Federal Statistical Office, is confirmed by data from the German Socio- Economic Panel (SOEP) study and shows that real assets declined by more than 11 percent between 2002 and 2012. In particular, the weak performance of the <b>estimated</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of owner-occupied real estate is likely to have contributed to this decline. In contrast to DIW Berlin's findings, the national accounts system (Volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnungen, VGR) indicated an increase in real net worth of around 19 percent between 2003 and 2013. This discrepancy is likely due to the different valuation methods used. The development of wealth held by the most affluent individuals {{is not likely to be}} responsible for the decline in the overall volume of real assets: Although the EVS and SOEP samples do not provide any details concerning the development of wealth held by the most affluent individuals, because these are either not meaningful or did not appear in the surveys at all, an analysis of the fortunes asset-holders based on information provided by manager magazin suggests that between 2007 and 2012 their assets stagnated on average. The relevant factors for successful wealth accumulation are regular saving, capital gains, and, in particular, inheritances and gifts. In addition, net asset values held by private households rise considerably whenever debtors pay off their liabilities in accordance with contracts...|$|E

50|$|Level Three: The FASB {{describes}} Level 3 inputs as “unobservable.” If inputs from levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB {{acknowledges that}} <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measures of many {{assets and liabilities}} are less precise. Within this level, <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> is also <b>estimated</b> using a valuation technique. However, significant assumptions or inputs used in the valuation technique are based upon inputs that are not observable in the market and, therefore, necessitates the use of internal information. This category allows “for situations {{in which there is}} little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.” FASB explains that “observable inputs” are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect assumptions made by market participants.In contrast, “unobservable inputs” are not based on independent sources but on “the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use.” The entity may only rely on internal information if the cost and effort to obtain external information is too high. In addition, financial instruments must have an input that is observable over the entire term of the instrument. While internal inputs are used, the objective remains the same: <b>estimate</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> using assumptions a third party would consider in <b>estimating</b> <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> Also known as mark to management. Despite being “assumptions about assumptions,” Level 3 inputs can provide useful information about <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> (and thus future cash flows) when they are generated legitimately and with best efforts, without any attempt to bias users’ decisions.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} investigates {{whether the}} extent to which <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are used in financial reports is related to the earnings quality measures in Eastern European countries over 2002 - 2011 periods. It is expected that companies (banks) in Eastern Europe will more often <b>estimate</b> <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> by using valuation techniques (i. e. mark-to-model) than companies (banks) in market developed countries, due to lack of market data. This gives opportunity to managers to manipulate with estimation values and therefore could lead to lower quality of reported earnings. Six earnings quality approximations are examined: persistence, predictability, smoothness, accruals quality, value relevance and conservatism. Furthermore, an aggregate earnings quality measure is formed based on six earnings attributes. Exposure to <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting is measured by income statement approach. First, for both banks and companies in the selected sample, two alternative measures of reported income are compared: net income and comprehensive income, because other comprehensive income consists mainly of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> adjustments.
