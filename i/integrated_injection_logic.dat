40|$|Abstract. High {{performance}} computing (HPC) is increasingly subjected to faulty computations. The frequency of silent data corruptions (SDCs) {{in particular is}} expected to increase in emerging machines requiring HPC applications to handle SDCs. In this paper we, propose a robust fault in-jector structured through an LLVM compiler pass that allows simulation of SDCs in various applications. Although fault injection locations are enumerated at compile time, their activation is purely at runtime and based on a user-provided fault distribution. The robustness of our fault injector is in the ability to augment the runtime <b>injection</b> <b>logic</b> on a per application basis. This allows tighter control on the spacial, temporal, and probability of injected faults. The usability, scalability, and robust-ness of our fault injection is demonstrated with injecting faults into an algebraic multigird solver. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>injection</b> <b>logic</b> (IIL, I2L, or I2L) is a {{class of}} digital {{circuits}} built with multiple collector bipolar junction transistors (BJT). When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. Although the logic voltage levels are very close (High: 0.7V, Low: 0.2V), I2L has high noise immunity because it operates by current instead of voltage. It is sometimes also known as merged transistor logic.|$|E

Various alternatives to <b>integrated</b> <b>injection</b> <b>logic</b> are discussed and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each are outlined. The <b>integrated</b> <b>injection</b> <b>logic</b> structure is introduced and its advantages over other solutions are described. Those device characteristics necessary for successful operation of the <b>integrated</b> <b>injection</b> <b>logic</b> gate are established, and the physical mechanisms controlling D. C. and A.

The behaviour of the I 2 L gate is shown to be very dependent on the characteristics of the epitaxial emitter and the intrinsic base region of the device. In an extension to the basic device theory it is shown that the device characteristics can be related to the transistor characteristics in the conventional mode of operation. As the technique is primarily for large scale integration a considerable effort has been placed on yield studies. These yield studies have included work on the following: parametric control, photoengraving and silicon crystallographic defects. Silicon crystallographic defects are shown to be a major yield hazard and appropriate actions to eliminate them as failure mechanisms are described...|$|E

This makes them an excellent choice for lightweight automotive components to reduce mass and increase fuel efficiency, while maintaining the functionality of traditional thermosetting prepreg (and mechanical characteristics) and with a production cycle time and recyclability suited to mass production manufacturing. Currently, the aerospace and automotive sectors struggle to carry out accurate Finite Elements (FE) component analyses and in some cases are unable to validate the obtained results.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{theoretical}} and experimental concentration and temperature dependent band gap narrowing in uncompensated n-type silicon is studied. Electron-electron and electron-impurity interaction energies {{are used to}} calculate the theoretical band gap narrowing in the plasmon-pole approximation. These reveal an increase of 14 meV in the band gap narrowing at 300 K for a donor concentration of 3. 10 (^ 19) cm(^- 3) above the zero temperature value of 95 meV. For higher concentrations the degeneracy deepens and the zero and finite temperature band gap narrowing curves converge. Localized states in the band gap resulting from local fluctuations in the electron-impurity interaction, a result of the random position of the impurities, are also considered. When the analysis includes the effect on the host band of the electron-impurity interactions calculated above the resulting density of states in the band tail of uncompensated silicon is found to be ten times smaller than is usually imagined. Using published values for the minority carrier mobility both the band gap narrowing and the minority carrier lifetime are experimentally determined in the buried n-type layer of an <b>Integrated</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>Logic</b> transistor. The transport factor in the base of a parasitic pnp transistor formed by the p-type substrate, buried layer and p-type <b>Integrated</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>Logic</b> transistors base region is calculated by monitoring the substrate current density and minority carrier injection into the buried layer.

40|$|An {{overview}} of the literature regarding the most recent and innovative developments in microfluidic devices for pressure-driven chromatographic separations is given, {{with a focus on}} proteomics and metabolomics applications. The applications can be considered as the main driving force for the developments in this research field, since they put high demands on the analytical technology such as for throughput, efficiency, and sensitivity and for the possibilities to interface with mass spectrometry. The developments are evaluated based on the feasibility for use in work flows for the analysis of biologically relevant samples. The literature up to the first half of 2011 is covered. Electrophoretic separations are not within the scope of this review. Several strategies have been described to obtain a retentive phase in microfluidic channels. Open channels with the stationary phase bound to the walls appear to be relatively easy to make. However, the retention in such channels is generally very low for separations of relevant samples. Microfabrication of perfectly ordered topographic structures is the most innovative of the methods discussed for the creation of stationary phases in narrow channels. Several groups work on the improvement of the surface-to-volume ratio in such channels, using different methods, and the developments towards real applications are promising. Channels packed with spherical particles and in situ polymerized monoliths for pressure-driven separations are the most frequently applied. Microfluidic devices with an <b>integrated</b> <b>injection</b> system, a (packed) separation column and a spray tip for coupling to a mass spectrometer are already commercially available, and used in practice in proteomics and metabolomics. Finally, the inherent advantages of microfluidic devices for multidimensional separations have been shown in practice in a number of studies.
