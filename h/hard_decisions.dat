Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making <b>hard</b> <b>decisions</b> under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of a new hybrid vector {{quantizer}} called Switched Multi stage vector quantization (SWMSVQ) technique using <b>hard</b> and soft <b>decision</b> schemes, for coding of narrow band speech signals. This technique is a hybrid of Switch vector quantization technique and Multi stage vector quantization technique. SWMSVQ quantizes the linear predictive coefficients (LPC) in terms of the line spectral frequencies (LSF). The spectral distortion performance, computational complexity and memory requirements of SWMSVQ using <b>hard</b> and soft <b>decision</b> schemes are compared with Split vector quantization (SVQ) technique, Multi stage vector quantization (MSVQ) technique, Switched Split vector quantization (SSVQ) technique using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> scheme, and Multi Switched Split Vector quantization (MSSVQ) technique using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> scheme. From results it is proved that SWMSVQ using soft decision scheme is having less spectral distortion, computational complexity and memory requirements when compared to SVQ, MSVQ, SSVQ and SWMSVQ using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> scheme, but high when compared to MSSVQ using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> scheme. So from results it is proved that SWMSVQ using soft decision scheme is better when compared to SVQ, MSVQ, SSVQ and SWMSVQ using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> schemes in terms of spectral distortion, computational complexity and memory requirements but is having greater spectral distortion, computational complexity and memory requirements when compared to MSSVQ using <b>hard</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|R

500|$|According to {{an account}} {{published}} by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted {{of his own}} heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and claimed he had eaten a baby raw. Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone, which he reiterated {{in an interview with}} a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, in spite of their circumstances {{and the fact that he}} eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners. [...] Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of [...] "common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton. Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion [...] "extravagant moralism", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices. Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, [...] "more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of <b>hard</b> <b>decisions</b> that were neither heroic nor villainous".|$|E

40|$|Impulse Radio (IR) is an ultra-wide bandwidth, time-hopping, Code DivisionMultiple Access (CDMA) {{technology}} that possesses unique characteristics {{that make it}} a promis-ing candidate for future tactical military radio networks. In this paper, we present {{an analysis of the}} bit error perfor-mance of IR using <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> detection and soft decision detection techniques in an environment with dense multiple access interference and large near- far ratios, including se-vere interference from several local transmitters and a large number of distant interferers and thermal noise. The results show that <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> detection performs better than soft decision detection in the presence of several large interfer-ers. We discuss the tradeos between <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> detection and soft decision detection, and we also compare the perfor-mance of <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> detection and soft decision detection with blanking. In the soft decision detection with blanking scheme, the input signal is blanked during any interval when an interfering pulse overlaps the desired pulse. This blank-ing scheme requires knowledge of the time-hopping pattern of the interfering users and a corresponding increase in the complexity needed to achieve synchronization. Our analysis shows that the performance of the <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> detection receiver is nearly equivalent to the performance of the soft decision detection receiver with blanking without an increase in complexity...|$|R

30|$|The major {{advantage}} of the classical <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> tree construction algorithm is that its terminal nodes can be split independently.

This advantage causes the algorithm to be computationally tractable. However, in the soft decision tree construction procedure, the different terminal nodes may cover overlapped regions of the contextual space and splitting a leaf using a soft question affects the parameters of all other leaves. Consequently, as opposed to the conventional <b>hard</b> <b>decision</b> tree structure, here, after splitting a leaf, it is required to update all values obtained for all terminal nodes, and it needs tremendous amount of computations.|$|R
