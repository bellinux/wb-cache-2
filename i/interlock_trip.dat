40|$|High {{availability}} interlocks {{and controls}} {{are required for}} the ILC (International Linear Collider) L-Band high power RF stations. A new F 3 (Fast Fault Finder) VME module has been developed to process both fast and slow interlocks using FPGA logic to detect the <b>interlock</b> <b>trip</b> excursions. This combination {{eliminates the need for}} separate PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) control of slow interlocks. Modules are chained together to accommodate as many inputs as needed. In the next phase of development the F 3 ’s will be ported to the new industry standard ATCA (Advanced Telecom Computing Architecture) crate (shelf) via a specially designed VME adapter module with IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). The goal is to demonstrate autofailover and hot-swap for future partially redundant systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. fuse <b>trip</b> <b>interlock</b> line {{fixed plate}} and front plate {{reinforcing}} ribs interference problems often occur in assembly, analyzed the data by field measurement,, establish project objectives, quantitative targets, through causal analysis, cause analysis, find the reason, {{the main reason}} to find the improvement scheme, and finally establish control plan, monitor the production situation, {{in order to control}} the situation in production. According to the investigation on the interference problem of fuse <b>trip</b> <b>interlock</b> line in installation, detailed analysis of the process, the question gives effective solutions, and dynamic quality assurance measures, provided the reference method for solving this kind of problems. At the assembly station of SAFE, in fuse <b>trip</b> <b>interlock</b> cable mounting plate assembly process, frequent interlock cable fixing plate and cabinet front panel stiffener interference problems. Key issue is the actual assembly process, the front plate screws distance between the ribs is too small, and the interlock cable fixing plate couldn’t put into. In this case, the field assembly action: release the front pane’s ribs fixing nut ， moving the ribs to the left adjustment screw until the interlock cable fixing plate screw can be placed, and then fixing ribs, and fixed fix plate. Field adjustment operation impacts analysis...|$|R
50|$|Fixed type gas {{detectors}} may be {{used for}} detection of one or more gas types. Fixed type detectors are generally mounted near the process area of a plant or control room, or an area to be protected, such as a residential bedroom. Generally, industrial sensors are installed on fixed type mild steel structures and a cable connects the detectors to a SCADA system for continuous monitoring. A <b>tripping</b> <b>interlock</b> can be activated for an emergency situation.|$|R
40|$|Analyzing {{the causes}} of various trip events is helpful to improve {{reliability}} of a synchrotron light source. To identify {{the causes of}} trips at Taiwan Light Source (TLS), various diagnostics tools were employed. These diagnostic tools can capture beam <b>trips,</b> <b>interlock</b> signals of superconducting RF system, waveforms of the injection kickers, quench and interlock signals of the superconducting insertion device, and instability signals of the stored beam for post-mortem analysis. These diagnostic systems can routinely monitor signals and record beam trip events. Features of trip diagnostic tools are available now. System configuration and experiences will be summarized in this report...|$|R
40|$|During high {{intensity}} extraction on 25 / 10 / 04 an incident occurred {{in which the}} vacuum chamber of the TT 40 magnet QTRF 4002 was badly damaged. The beam was a 450 GeV full LHC injection batch of 3. 4 1013 p+ in 288 bunches, and was extracted from SPS LSS 4 with the wrong trajectory. Prior to the fatal extraction, problems had occurred over several hours during the setting-up, with beam-induced noise causing the extraction septum <b>interlock</b> to <b>trip</b> the power convertor, and also with the bumped beam position interlock. Deficiencies in the extraction setting-up process, in the interlocking and in the operational procedures used for the high-intensity test were contributing factors. In this note the incident causes are identified, the details reconstructed from the logged data, and {{the damage to the}} vacuum chamber analysed. The remedial measures which have already been taken are explained, and further recommendations made concerning the interlocking system performance and tests, as well as the operational procedures which must be adopted when commissioning with high intensities...|$|R
