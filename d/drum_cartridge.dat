40|$|Abstract. In seeking further {{efficiency}} in production preparation, {{it is common}} to examine assembly sequences using digital manufacturing. The assembly sequences affect the product evaluation, so it is necessary to test several assembly sequences before actual production. However, because selection and testing of assembly sequences depends on the operator’s personal experience and intuition, {{only a small number of}} assembly sequences are actually tested. Nevertheless, there is a systematic method for generating assembly sequences using a contact-related figure. However, the larger the number of parts, the larger the number of assembly sequences geometric becomes. The purpose of this study is to establish a systematic method of generating efficient assembly sequences regardless of the number of parts. To generate such assembly sequences selectively, a “Tournament Tree, ” which shows the structure of an assembly sequence, is formulated. Applying the method to assembly sequences of a water valve, good assembly sequences with the same structure as the Tournament Tree are identified. The structure of such a Tournament Tree tends to have fewer steps than the others. As a test, the structure is then applied for a <b>drum</b> <b>cartridge</b> with 38 parts. In all the assembly sequences generated from the contact-related figures, the best assembly sequence is generated by using the Tournament Tree...|$|E

50|$|Mosman did {{the bronze}} sculptures (three muskets, a <b>drum,</b> knapsack, <b>cartridge</b> box, and canteen) for the 10th Massachusetts Infantry Monument. The {{monument}} marks {{the position of}} the 10th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment on the Gettysburg Battlefield on July 3, 1863. It was dedicated on October 6, 1885. That same year, another one of his sculptures, a civil war monument, was erected in Court Square in Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|R
25|$|Test strips: A {{consumable}} element containing {{chemicals that}} react with glucose in {{the drop of}} blood is used for each measurement. For some models this element is a plastic test strip with a small spot impregnated with glucose oxidase and other components. Each strip is used once and then discarded. Instead of strips, some models use discs, <b>drums,</b> or <b>cartridges</b> that contain the consumable material for multiple tests.|$|R
2500|$|Military {{users of}} the M1928A1 had {{complaints}} about the [...] "L" [...] fifty-round drum magazine; the British Army officially criticised [...] "their excessive weight, the rattling sound they made" [...] and shipped thousands back to the U.S. in exchange for box magazines. The Thompson had to be cocked, bolt retracted ready to fire, to attach the drum. It attached and detached by sliding sideways, which made magazine changes slow and also created difficulty in clearing a cartridge malfunction ("jam"). Reloading an empty <b>drum</b> with <b>cartridges</b> was an involved process.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{loading and}} after firing, the feed clip {{is filled with}} spacer rounds that are an {{integral}} part of the magazine. The upper half of the top spacer round is tapered to allow the weapon bolt to close after the last round is fired. The length of the string-set depends on the customized feed clip for the individual weapon. [...] During loading, cartridges are inserted on top of the spacer rounds, through the feed clip and into the <b>drums.</b> The <b>cartridge</b> column splits at the juncture of the feed clip and the housing to distribute the ammunition evenly into the drums in two concentric rows. [...] During firing, spring-driven rotors advance the <b>cartridges</b> in both <b>drums</b> until they meet at a cam blade that merges the cartridges into a single column that feeds up through the feed clip and into the weapon.|$|R
5000|$|The Type 87 (also {{known as}} QLZ87) 35 mm {{automatic}} grenade launcher (AGL) is an air-cooled, gas operated fully automatic weapon and is crew transportable (12~20 kg) with limited amounts of ammunition. It can fire {{a variety of}} 35 mm grenades stored in the 6-or 15-round <b>cartridge</b> <b>drum.</b> The Type 87 is described by NORINCO as [...] "Mini Infantry Artillery". The 35 mm grenade pierces armour up to 80 mm thick and produces fragments to kill or wound personnel within 10 meters of the point of impact. The Type 87 can fire on a tripod or by using the bipod fixed on the barrel. It can also be mounted on armoured vehicles or helicopters. The launcher is capable of attacking low-flying air targets as well as targets on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|For most {{conspicuous}} bravery, skill and determination, on 7 November 1915, in France. He was patrolling in a Vickers Fighting Machine, with First Class Air Mechanic T. H. Donald as gunner, when a German machine was sighted, pursued, and attacked near Achiet.The German pilot led the Vickers machine over a rocket battery, but with great skill Lieutenant Insall dived {{and got to}} close range, when Donald fired a <b>drum</b> of <b>cartridges</b> into the German machine, stopping its engine. The German pilot then dived through a cloud, followed by Lieutenant Insall Fire was again opened, and the German machine was brought down heavily in a ploughed field 4 miles south-east of Arras.On seeing the Germans scramble out of their machine and prepare to fire, Lieutenant Insall dived to 500 feet, thus enabling Donald to open heavy fire on them. The Germans then fled, one helping the other, who was apparently wounded. Other Germans then commenced heavy fire, {{but in spite of}} this, Lieutenant Insall turned again, and an incendiary bomb was dropped on the German machine, which was last seen wreathed in smoke. Lieutenant Insall then headed west in order to get back over the German trenches, but as he was at only 2,000 feet altitude he dived across them for greater speed, Donald firing into the trenches as he passed over.The German fire, however, damaged the petrol tank, and, with great coolness, Lieutenant Insall landed under cover of a wood 500 yards inside our lines. The Germans fired some 150 shells at our machine on the ground, but without causing material damage. Much damage had, however, been caused by rifle fire, but during the night it was repaired behind screened lights, and at dawn Lieutenant Insall flew his machine home with First Class Air Mechanic T. H. Donald as a passenger." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} past and present {{recycling}} efforts on the Hanford site and options for future improvements in the recycling program. Until 1996, recycling goals were voluntarily set by the waste generators: this year, DOE has imposed goals for all its sites to accomplish by 1999. Hanford is presently meeting the voluntary site goals, but {{may not be able to}} meet all the new DOE goals without changes to the program. Most of these new DOE goals are recycling goals: * Reduce the generation of radioactive (low-level) waste from routine operations 50 percent through source reduction and recycling. * Reduce the generation of low-level mixed waste from routine operations 50 percent through source reduction and recycling. * Reduce the generation of hazardous waste from routine operations 50 percent through source reduction and recycling. * Recycle 33 percent of the sanitary waste from all operations. * Increase affirmative procurement of EPA-designated recycled items to 100 percent. The Hanford recycling program has made great strides-there has been a 98 percent increase in the amount of paper recycled since its inception in 1990. Hanford recycles paper, chemicals cardboard, tires, oil, batteries, rags, lead weights, fluorescent tubes, aerosol products, concrete, office furniture, computer software, <b>drums,</b> toner <b>cartridges,</b> and scrap metal. Many other items are recycled or reused by individual groups on a one time basis without a formal contract. Several contracts are closed-loop contracts which involve all parts of the recycle loop. Considerable savings are generated from recycling, and much more is possible with increased attention and improvements to this program. General methods for improving the recycling program to ensure that the new goals can be met are: a Contract and financial changes 0 Tracking database and methods improvements 0 Expanded recycling efforts. Specifically, the Hanford recycling program would be improved by: 0 Establishing one overall DOE recycling contract at the Hanford site and a central group to control the contract. 0 Using a BOA or MTS contract as a way to get proceeds from recycling back to site facilities to provide incentives for recycling.. Upgrading tracking mechanisms to track and recycle construction waste which is presently buried in onsite pits.. Establishing contract performance measures which hold each project accountable for specific waste reduction goals. * Recycling and reusing any material or equipment possible as buildings are dismantled...|$|R
