500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path."

She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews.

As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it?

ActionTrip praised the new campaign as being a challenge for players: [...] "even on the normal difficulty setting, Viking Invasion is a very challenging game", a view shared by other critics. The pre-battle screen was commended by GameSpot, calling it a [...] "handy new feature." [...] GameSpot also praised the new additions to the original campaign, mentioning they have [...] "made castle sieges more interesting".

Overall, the expansion was received well by critics in the industry. IGN concluded by saying fans [...] "won't be disappointed with the Viking Invasion", while Actiontrip finished stating; [...] "the graphics are beginning to look old" [...] but the challenge made the expansion [...] "worth it".

And you hear talking and laughing. There are two pots brewing and colleagues join for a chat and to have coffee. And of course there is often a bowl of rusks, muffins and strawberries. Food is a way of bringing people together, and I live the metaphor of breaking bread together. Room 5 - 52 is more than just an office. It is a space of sharing, of becoming and of being. It is a space where stories are told, meetings take place, and colleagues co-write. It is a space where new colleagues are invited and welcomed, a space that alumni students return to. In such moments when colleagues and post graduate students get together in my office and in the Marc Room next to my office, these casual talks often evolve into new initiatives that continually expand the boundaries of what we do in academia.
