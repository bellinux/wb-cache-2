500|$|In 1993, after U. S. President Bill Clinton pledged [...] "to {{reducing}} our {{emissions of}} greenhouse gases to their 1990 levels by the year 2000," [...] GCC's executive director said it [...] "could jeopardize the economic health of the nation." [...] GCC's lobbying was key to the defeat in the United States Senate of Clinton's 1993 BTU tax proposal. In 1994, after United States Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary said the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change needed to be strengthened, and that voluntary carbon dioxide reductions may not be enough, GCC said it was: [...] "disturbed by the implication that the President's voluntary climate action plan, which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> under way, will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 6 is {{occasionally}} seen as [...] "redundant" [...] to the series. GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the [...] "cheesiest" [...] {{among the}} NES titles: [...] "If you're looking for mega-laughs, {{you might want}} to try this one out." [...] 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game's [...] "inane" [...] storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups. The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original {{back in the days when}} the letters 'N E S' meant something. Now the game <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a little disappointed that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|WALL-E won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was {{nominated}} for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to Slumdog Millionaire (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), The Dark Knight (Sound Editing), and Milk (Original Screenplay). Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, {{but it was not}} nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL-E to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that [...] "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." [...] Only three animated films, 1991's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar's next two films, 2009's Up and 2010's Toy Story 3, have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually [...] "The line [...] <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's going to be tougher and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Riddick is {{captured}} {{and transferred to}} the [...] "double-max" [...] security area. Gaining {{the trust of the}} inmates by participating in fighting matches, Riddick eventually kills the champion of the fighting matches, a guard named Bam. This leads him to be taken to a room where no surveillance is seen and several guards await to kill Riddick. Abbott walks into the room, fully healed, holding a baseball bat. Shirah returns to him and tells him that the fury of all of his kind is within him, and he can release it if he chooses. A blast of energy called the 'Rage of Furya' kills all the guards around him except Abbott, who hides and then panics and attacks Riddick. Riddick kills Abbott and proceeds to find another way to escape. Using a secret entrance to an elevator, he infiltrates a mining facility. He meets an inmate of great influence in the area named Jagger Valance (Ron Perlman), who wishes to escape with him. He makes a bomb and plants it in a mining site with a massive gas leak. However, Riddick is discovered and caught by the guards. During his transfer to another section, the prison is disrupted by an outbreak of creatures called [...] "Xeno", due to the bomb Riddick planted, in order to create the confusion necessary for his escape, and Riddick attempts to escape with Valance. His plans are foiled again by Johns. After a fist fight, Riddick and Johns are both shot by Valance (who only meant to hit Johns) and Valance is killed by the guards. After meeting again with the warden, and telling him that he <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> started, Riddick is placed in the [...] "triple-max" [...] area, where inmates are kept in cryonic sleep. They are awakened daily for two minutes of exercise; during this time, Riddick discovers a flaw in the system and escapes. He then hijacks a large robot and fights his way through Butcher Bay to reach Hoxie.|$|E

2500|$|In May, Gunn {{said the}} sequel would feature fewer {{characters}} {{than the first}} film, {{and that he had}} planned to introduce two major new characters in the script—Mantis and Adam Warlock. Talks had begun with an actor Gunn had in mind to portray Mantis, while he had decided to remove Warlock due to the film [...] "getting too busy", explaining, [...] "one of the main things with Guardians of the Galaxy is not to add a bunch of characters, not to make it bigger in that way but to go deeper with the characters… and getting to know them more emotionally… everything <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> too sprawling and too crazy for me in these superhero comic book movies." [...] Gunn added, [...] "I adored what we had done with him. I think we did something really creative and unique with Adam Warlock. But it was one character too many and I didn't want to lose Mantis and Mantis was more organically part of the movie anyway." [...] He noted that Warlock could appear in future Guardians films, and is considered [...] "a pretty important part" [...] of the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character's future introduction is hinted at in one of the film's mid-credits scenes. Gunn noted that Marvel gave him [...] "some blowback" [...] for including the Warlock teaser because they felt fans would believe the character would be appearing in [...] and its sequel, which was not the case. By including the scene, Gunn promised Marvel he would use his social media presence to clarify for fans that the character would not be seen in either Avengers film.|$|E
