5000|$|In {{the overall}} {{intrinsic}} {{quality of the}} instrument, Skinner crafted the final piece to include a four manual, one hundred and seven stop, sixty-three rank and four-thousand five hundred and forty-two pipes organ. All together, the organ comprises one Great Organ, a Swell Organ, a Choir Organ featuring a 16-foot Contra <b>Dulciana,</b> Choir Organ Echo, a Solo Organ, Solo Organ Echo, an Arch Organ outfitted with an 8-foot Arch Clarion, a 64-foot Gravissima and a 32-foot Bourdon Profunda, {{in addition to the}} final traps that were enclosed in the choir: Bass drum, castanets, Chinese block, crash cymbal, gong snare drum (f), snare drum (ff), and a tambourine triangle. Like other Skinner-built organs, the instrument was designed to replicate the whole symphony.|$|E
5000|$|The 1849 organ was {{described}} being capable of playing eleven musical (major) keys from the ordinary keyboard in pure intonation by furnishing multiple pipes for each physical key, with foot pedals operating intermediate levers {{inserted into the}} tracker works to switch between pairs of pallet valves furnished for each note. The inventors described great benefits due the tuning - they even claim it stayed in tune better - and argued how these balanced its greater size (up to 8 feet wider) and reduction in loudness compared with instruments of similar cost and number of pipes. They estimated one having [...] "two Diapasons, the Trumpet, the Oboe, the <b>Dulciana,</b> the Flute and the Clarabella, in perfect tune" [...] to cost between $4000 and $5000, and one third more if a Great Organ was desired.|$|E

The museum organ, which is housed inside the museum above the main galleries, has 4 manuals and pedals, 7 divisions, 63 ranks, {{with a total of}} 4,526 pipes. Symphonic music is especially effective on the museum organ with its battery of pneumatically operated percussion instruments and set of tubular chimes. A thunder pedal is used for the musical representation of storms. All together, the organ comprises one Great Organ, a Swell Organ, a Choir Organ featuring a 16-foot Contra <b>Dulciana,</b> Choir Organ Echo, a Solo Organ, Solo Organ Echo, an Arch Organ outfitted with 8-foot Arch Clarion, a 64-foot Gravissima and a 32-foot Bourdon Profunda, in addition to the final Traps that were enclosed in the Choir: Bass drum, castanets, Chinese block, crash cymbal, gong snare drum (f), snare drum (ff), and a tambourine triangle.|$|E
