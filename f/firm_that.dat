40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} firms’ characteristics in the years prior to bankruptcy filing and bankruptcy outcome for firms filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions. Our results indicate that, {{up to three years}} prior to bankruptcy filing, the characteristics of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> liquidate differ from those of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> reorganize. Three years prior to bankruptcy, the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> subsequently reorganize are larger and have higher leverage than the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> subsequently liquidate. (This relationship remains constant for all three years studied.) Two years prior to bankruptcy filing, <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> eventually reorganize are more solvent and have higher levels of discretionary accruals than <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> eventually liquidate. In the year prior to filing, <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> subsequently liquidate {{are more likely to have}} positive discretionary accruals.

Repurchases are increasingly used in place of dividends, even for <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> continue to pay dividends. While other factors help explain the timing of repurchases, the overall level of repurchases is fundamentally determined by earnings. The results suggest that repurchases are now the dominant form of payout. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{last few}} decades has seen many studies and {{articles}} about export dynamics – how firms and industries change when opening up for trade, how firms and industries might potentially change when opening up for trade, and how firms and industries behave according to their current trade situation. Articles have been published and used to support or justify trade agreements, while other articles have been published to impair or demote the same agreements. A unifying tendency for most of these articles is that only export behaviour is analyzed, completely excluding the behaviour of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import. This thesis {{is an attempt to}} shed more light on the behaviour of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import, by using many of the same procedures as when analyzing <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> export. Previous research has focused mainly on exporting firms, whereas this paper both describes the behaviour of importing firms, as well as exporting firms through comparisons and descriptive studies. Econometric methods are used to derive results and conclusions from a large dataset of the Norwegian industry in 2004. In the first part I do a descriptive study of the firms in the dataset, and see how variables such as wage per worker, revenues, and trade values differ between <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> do not trade, only import, only export, and both import and export. From these summary statistics it is evident <b>that</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> only import are a substantial part of the entire selection of <b>firms,</b> and <b>that</b> they are both more numerous than <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> only export, and generating higher revenues, wages, and value added than <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> only export and <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> do not trade. This alone would be a potential reason for assessing the significance of <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import in an economy – in lines with <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> export. Further I perform OLS regressions to find <b>that</b> <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> only import seem to be situated in sectors that perform well when it comes to revenues and value added. The sector affiliation is exploited further in part II. Part II examines the sector affiliation, and whether <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import seem to situate in the same sectors. This part also gives a picture of the Norwegian industry, and why it is plausible for <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import to locate in one sector or the other. Some of the most “well-known” Norwegian sectors are reoccurring, such as metal-production, chemicals production, and pulp, paper and cardboard production. These sectors might not necessarily have the highest number of firms, but rather stand out in total import values and total export values. In the last part I use many of the same procedures as in Eaton et al (2007), to see if <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import behave in a different way than <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> export {{when it comes to the}} number of firms and trade partners, trade values and trade partners, and domestic sales and trade partners. By using figures one can easily compare the results between <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import and <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> export, and I mostly find the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> import and the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> export to behave in a similar way. Last I see how a handful of sectors trade with different countries, to discover that import origins are often different from export destinations, which supports an inclusion of the behaviour of importing firms when performing research and making policy decisions. I have used Stata 11 to produce all the tables and figures of the thesis, while the dataset is collected by Statistics Norway...|$|R

The results show that from a total of 21 <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> were classified as domestic in 2004 and internationalized in 2009, only a single firm withdrew from apprenticeship training after being internationalized. Conversely, the training participation remained unchanged for 19 out of 25 <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> were classified as internationalized in 2004 but domestic in 2009. From the 6 <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> incurred a change in status, there were 3 <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> started to train apprentices and 3 <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> withdrew from training apprentices. Thus these results suggest that the internationalization of firms {{does not appear to have}} strong effects on a firm’s training participation. However, the <b>firms</b> <b>that</b> could be observed over time are larger in size than an average firm, thus these results may be seen as complementary to the cross-sectional analysis of large firms (where descriptive statistics show no differences in the training participation among domestic and internationalized firms) and not used as evidence against the observed lower training probability of small internationalized firms. Thus representative panel data would be needed to identify a causal effect of the internationalization on the training participation of small firms.|$|R
