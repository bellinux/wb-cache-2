For example, a typical zinc <b>die-casting</b> <b>alloy</b> such as Zamak 3 can be used but will solidify too rapidly from a molten state when cast with centrifugal force. This typically results in incomplete filling of the mold {{as well as a}} rough, porous finish, called orange peel. Zamak 2, of a slightly different composition, was originally developed as a gravity-cast alloy with greater finished strength but was found to work well with spin-casting. Its extra copper content encourages the eutectic behaviour and gives a lower freezing point. It has become known as 'Kirksite' and has given rise to a range of dedicated spin-casting alloys, some with additional components such as magnesium, to control the surface finish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Microstructural and {{mechanical}} characteristics of Al- 6 Si- 2 Cu alloy for engine mount bracket prepared by gravity casting (as-cast) and die-casting (as-diecast) process have been investigated. For the microstructural characterization, the {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), optical microscope (OM), scan-ning electron microscope (SEM) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) analyses are conducted. For the inter-metallic phases, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) are also conducted with quantitative and qualitative analysis. Micro Vickers hardness and static tensile test are achieved in order to mea-sure mechanical properties of alloys. Secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) of as-cast and as-diecast show 37 um and 18 um, respectively.

Different alloys {{have been produced}} by systematically varying the Fe, Mn, and Cr contents within the composition tolerance limits of the standard EN AC- 46000 alloy. The microstructure shows primary α-Alx(Fe,Mn,Cr) ySiz sludge particles, with polyhedral and star-like morphologies, although the presence of primary β-Al 5 FeSi phase is also observed at the highest Fe:Mn ratio.

40|$|Abstract. High {{pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) {{is widely}} used as a cost-effective way to mass-produce metal components that are required to have close dimensional tolerances and smooth surface finishes. Approximately 50 %, by mass, of the aluminium castings produced worldwide are made by this manufacturing route. However, HPDC components are relatively porous compared {{with other types of}} castings and so cannot usually be conventionally heat treated to improve mechanical properties. This follows because during solution treatment (e. g. at 540 °C for 8 h), the pores expand, resulting in unacceptable surface blisters, distortion and poor mechanical properties. Recent work within the CSIRO Light Metals Flagship has revealed a heat treatment procedure by which the problems of blistering and distortion can be avoided [1]. As a result, large improvements in strength have been achieved, as compared with the as-cast condition. One uncertainty is the behaviour of heat treated HPDCs under cyclic stress and this paper investigates the fatigue properties of a common high pressure <b>die-casting</b> <b>alloy,</b> A 380 (Al- 8. 5 Si- 3. 5 Cu). Comparisons are made between as-cast, T 4 and T 6 conditions. Fatigue strength is highest for the alloy aged to a T 6 temper and ratios of fatigue strength to tensile strength for the as-cast, T 4 and T 6 conditions are constant at a value of approximately 0. 6, which is particularly high for aluminium alloys...|$|E
