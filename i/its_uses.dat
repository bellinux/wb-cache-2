5|$|Bismuth {{compounds}} {{account for}} about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea. Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of <b>its</b> <b>uses,</b> such as in casting of printing type. Bismuth has unusually low toxicity for a heavy metal. As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently {{about a third of}} bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its celebrity guests and its contributions to political parlance, the Blackstone has a place in popular culture. Among <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> in cinema, it hosted the banquet where Al Capone smashes a guest's head {{with a baseball bat}} in the Brian De Palma film The Untouchables, a party in The Hudsucker Proxy, and Tom Cruise's pre-pool tourney stay in The Color of Money. Also, the 1996–2000 television series Early Edition was set in this building, featuring a man (Kyle Chandler) who lives in the hotel and receives the newspaper a day in advance.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe <b>its</b> <b>uses.</b> In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

5|$|Like spot welding, {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E
5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding of aluminum, and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> {{in thinking about}} social change, humanistic psychology {{is considered to be}} the main theoretical and methodological source of humanistic social work.|$|E
50|$|It {{has also}} {{been used in the}} setting of {{uncontrollable}} hemorrhage, but its role in this setting is controversial with insufficient evidence to support <b>its</b> <b>use</b> outside of clinical trials. The first report of <b>its</b> <b>use</b> in hemorrhage was in an Israeli soldier with uncontrollable bleeding in 1999. Risks of <b>its</b> <b>use</b> include an increase in arterial thrombosis.|$|R

25|$|The Icelandic {{state flag}} (Ríkisfáni), {{known as the}} Tjúgufáni, was first flown on 1 December 1918 from the house of {{ministry}} offices, although laws regarding <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> had not been finished. It wasn't until 12 February 1919 that such a law was enacted.|$|E
25|$|This {{technique}} {{yields a}} unique curve for each atomic nucleus from 1 to92, allowing identification {{of both the}} charge and energy of the cosmic ray that traverses the plastic stack. The more extensive the ionization along the path, the higher the charge. In addition to <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> for cosmic-ray detection, the technique {{is also used to}} detect nuclei created as products of nuclear fission.|$|E
500|$|The Language Movement ( [...] Bhasha Andolôn) was a {{political}} movement in former East Bengal [...] (today Bangladesh) advocating {{the recognition of the}} Bengali language as an official language of the then-Dominion of Pakistan in order to allow <b>its</b> <b>use</b> in government affairs, the continuation of <b>its</b> <b>use</b> as a medium of education, <b>its</b> <b>use</b> in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the Bengali script.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{there is}} a {{difference}} between the value of labour power and the value produced by that labour power in <b>its</b> <b>use.</b> Unlike other commodities, in <b>its</b> <b>use,</b> labour power produces new value beyond that <b>used</b> up by <b>its</b> <b>use.</b> This difference is called surplus value and is for Marx the source of profit for the capitalists. The appropriation of surplus labor is what Marx denoted the exploitation of labour.|$|R
50|$|Their {{music has}} been {{compared}} to that of Enya due to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> of traditional instruments and ambient approach, but differs in <b>its</b> <b>use</b> of language. Enya sings in Irish whereas Ceredwen sing entirely in Welsh.|$|R
25|$|Triclosan (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as TCS), {{similar in}} <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> and {{mechanism of action}} to triclocarban, is an antibacterial and antifungal agent found in some consumer products, including toothpaste, soaps, detergents, toys, and surgical cleaning treatments. Its efficacy as an antimicrobial agent, the risk of antimicrobial resistance, and its possible role in disrupted hormonal development remain controversial. Additional research seeks to understand its potential effects on organisms and environmental health.|$|E
25|$|Player {{characters}} {{can often}} restore their health points by consuming certain items, {{such as health}} potions, food or first-aid kits. Staying a night at an inn fully restores a character's health in many role-playing video games. In general, the different methods of regenerating health has <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> in a particular genre. In action games, this method is very quick, whereas role-playing games feature slower paced methods to match the gameplay and realism.|$|E
25|$|The dulcian is a {{flexible}} instrument, {{capable of being}} loud enough to play in outdoor bands, quiet enough for chamber music, and expressive enough to join in with the choir. <b>Its</b> <b>uses</b> would have included playing dance music with the shawms and sackbuts of the city watch, chamber music, and the grand polychoral repertoire from Venice and Germany, such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Heinrich Schütz. There are explicit dulcian parts in the sonatas by Dario Castello.|$|E

25|$|Gases are {{produced}} in landfills {{due to the}} anaerobic digestion by microbes. In a properly managed landfill this gas is collected and used. <b>Its</b> <b>uses</b> range from simple flaring to the landfill gas utilization and generation of electricity. Landfill gas monitoring alerts workers {{to the presence of}} a build-up of gases to a harmful level. In some countries, landfill gas recovery is extensive; in the United States, for example, more than 850 landfills have active landfill gas recovery systems.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Australians have a {{long history}} with the flora of Western Australia. They have for over 50,000 years {{obtained}} detailed information on most plants. The information includes <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> as sources for food, shelter, tools and medicine. As Indigenous Australians passed the knowledge along orally or by example, most of this information has been lost, along many of the names they gave the flora. It was not until Europeans started to explore Western Australia that systematic written details of the flora commenced.|$|E
25|$|Grothendieck's {{emphasis}} {{on the role of}} universal properties across varied mathematical structures brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among <b>its</b> <b>uses,</b> category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems. His notion of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.|$|E

5000|$|While {{in theory}} pitmatic was spoken {{throughout}} the Great Northern Coalfield, from Ashington in Northumberland to Fishburn in County Durham, early references apply specifically to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> by miners {{especially from the}} Durham district (1873) and to <b>its</b> <b>use</b> in County Durham (1930).|$|R
25|$|PCR has {{a number}} of advantages. It is fairly simple to {{understand}} and to use, and produces results rapidly. The technique is highly sensitive with the potential to produce millions to billions of copies of a specific product for sequencing, cloning, and analysis. qRT-PCR shares the same advantages as the PCR, with an added advantage of quantification of the synthesized product. Therefore, it has <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> to analyze alterations of gene expression levels in tumors, microbes, or other disease states.|$|E
25|$|The compact {{cassette}} {{technology was}} originally designed for dictation machines, but improvements in fidelity led the Compact Cassette to supplant the Stereo 8-track cartridge and reel-to-reel tape recording in most non-professional applications. <b>Its</b> <b>uses</b> ranged from portable audio to home recording to data storage for early microcomputers. The first cassette player (although mono) {{designed for use}} in car dashes was introduced in 1968. Between the early 1970s and the early 2000s, the cassette {{was one of the}} two most common formats for prerecorded music, first alongside the LP record and later the compact disc (CD).|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} that follows describing the other {{various types of}} creosote materials and <b>its</b> <b>uses</b> {{should be considered as}} primarily being of only historical value. This history is important, because it traces the origin of these different materials used during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Furthermore, it must be considered that these other types of creosotes –- lignite-tar, wood-tar, water-gas-tar, etc. –- are not currently being manufactured and have either been replaced with more economical materials, or replaced by products that are more efficacious.|$|E
25|$|Dorothea Hast {{has stated}} that until the mid-twentieth century the bodhrán was mainly used as a tray for {{separating}} chaff, in baking, as a food server, and for storing food or tools. She argues that <b>its</b> <b>use</b> as musical instrument was restricted to ritual use in rural areas. She claims that while the earliest evidence of <b>its</b> <b>use</b> beyond ritual occurs in 1842, <b>its</b> <b>use</b> as a general instrument did not become widespread until the 1960s, when Seán Ó Riada used it.|$|R
50|$|The Stabat Mater {{was well}} known {{by the end of}} the 14th century and Georgius Stella wrote of <b>its</b> <b>use</b> in 1388, while other historians note <b>its</b> <b>use</b> later in the same century. In Provence, about 1399, it was used during the nine days' processions.|$|R
