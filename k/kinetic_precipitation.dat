40|$|The {{presence}} of copper impurities {{is known to}} deteriorate the bulk minority carrier lifetime of silicon. In p-type silicon, the degradation occurs only under carrier injection (e. g., illumination), but {{the reason for this}} phenomenon called copper-related light-induced degradation (Cu-LID) has long remained uncertain. To clarify the physics of this problem, a mathematical model of Cu-LID was introduced in Paper I of this article. Within the model, <b>kinetic</b> <b>precipitation</b> simulations are interlinked with a Schottky junction model for electric behavior of metallic precipitates. As this approach enables simulating precipitation directly at the minority carrier lifetime level, the model is verified in this second part with a direct comparison to the corresponding degradation experiments and literature data. Convincing agreement is found with different doping and Cu concentrations as well as at increased temperature, and in the dark, both simulated degradation and measured degradation are very slow. In addition, modeled final lifetimes after illumination are very close to experimental final lifetimes, and a correlation with the final precipitate size is found. However, the model underestimates experimentally observed differences in the degradation rate at different illumination intensities. Nevertheless, the results of this work support the theory of Cu-LID as a precipitate formation process. Part of the results also imply that heterogeneous nucleation sites play a role during precipitate nucleation. The model reveals fundamental aspects of the physics of Cu-LID including how doping and heterogeneous nucleation site concentrations can considerably influence the final recombination activity.

40|$|Copper {{contamination}} causes {{minority carrier}} lifetime degradation in p-type silicon bulk under illumination, leading to considerable efficiency losses in affected solar cells. Although {{the existence of}} this phenomenon has been known for almost two decades, ambiguity prevails about the underlying defect mechanism. In Paper I of this two-part contribution, we propose the first comprehensive mathematical model for Cu-related light-induced degradation in p-type silicon (Cu-LID). The model is based on the precipitation of interstitial Cu ions, which is assumed to be kinetically limited by electrostatic repulsion from the growing Cu precipitates. Hence, growth and dissolution rates of individual Cu precipitates are derived from the drift-diffusion equation of interstitial Cu and used in a <b>kinetic</b> <b>precipitation</b> model that is based on chemical rate equations. The kinetic model is interlinked to a Schottky junction model of metallic precipitates in silicon, enabling accurate calculation of the injection-dependent electric field enclosing the precipitates, as well as the precipitate-limited minority carrier lifetime. It is found that a transition from darkness to illuminated conditions can cause an increase in the kinetics of precipitation by five orders of magnitude. Since our approach enables a direct connection between the time evolution of precipitate size-density distribution and minority carrier lifetime degradation under illumination, a procedure for calculating the Cu-LID-related lifetime as a function of illumination time is included {{at the end of this}} article. The model verification with experiments is carried out in Paper II of this contribution along with a discussion of the kinetic and energetic aspects of Cu-LID. Peer reviewe...|$|E

So far many strategies have been explored to effectively assemble multivalent neoglycoconjugates. This work contains a discussion of the design and transition metal-mediated synthesis of terminal galactoside-carrying glycoclusters and glycodendrimers in detail. Propargyl alpha-galactoside antigen monomer was synthesized using conventional glycosidation methods. Then analogues of alpha-galactoside antigen clusters were prepared utilizing the Sonogashira reaction as the key step. Various conditions for the Sonogashira have been investigated and an interesting finding is that this reaction does occur with Cu (I). These synthetic alpha-galactoside antigens have shown enhanced binding affinity toward human anti-alpha-galactoside antigen antibodies in biochemical assays. Likewise, galactoclusters were prepared as potential galectin inhibitors. However, these fully deprotected compounds were barely soluble in aqueous conditions. To solve this problem, analogues of lactoclusters, having an extra glucosyl residue, with various valencies and structural features were synthesized. <b>Kinetic</b> <b>precipitation</b> tests demonstrated that most lactoclusters cross-linked with galectin- 3 formed insoluble complexes quickly and this phenomenon was observed for the first time, thus suggesting the clustering of the receptors upon contact.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 One of the {{critical}} problems that exist in a Very Large Scale Integrated circuit (VLSI) process modeling today is the prediction and simulation of arsenic behavior in silicon during the integrated circuit fabrication. This work is focused on understanding and modeling of the physical processes which occur during arsenic diffusion and deactivation. Arsenic deactivation is a complicated process due to fast kinetics and strong interstitial ejection which accompanies deactivation. We have used ab-initio calculations {{in order to gain}} insight into the fundamental processes involved in arsenic activation/deactivation. It has been proposed that several second nearest neighbor As atoms (two or more) may kickout an adjacent Si atom forming an electrically inactive arsenic-vacancy cluster and a self-interstitial. A physical model based on this mechanism was derived and used successfully to match a variety of electrical data as well as interstitial supersaturation data measured during deactivation. This model was applied to understanding and prediction of the ultra shallow junction formation. Several effects such as rapid As diffusion at high concentrations and the existence of grown-in vacancies after amorphous/crystalline regrowth must be included to account for the discrepancies between {{what seems to be a}} mobile fraction of the profile and the electrically active fraction. An integral part of this work involves the simulation of self-interstitial cluster formation. Total energy calculations based on empirical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in order to study the energetics of interstitial aggregates as a function of size and configuration.

The ageing kinetics in CuÂ¿Cr and CuÂ¿Cr/Al 2 O 3 can be described using JohnsonÂ¿MehlÂ¿Avrami (JMA) and SestakÂ¿Berggren (SB) models, respectively. These different behaviors have been discussed in details. It was found that in presence of Al 2 O 3 reinforcement, the ageing activation energy is decreased and the overall ageing process is accelerated. This behavior is probably due to higher dislocation density previously obtained during ball milling and Al 2 O 3 Â¿Cu interface.

40|$|Interaction between {{fluid in}} the porous medium and the {{conjugate}} free flow is observed in many natural and technical applications. In these applications, the flow and transport {{processes in the}} porous medium and in the free flow display strong interdependency. This is also influenced by the mechanisms of interaction at the common interface between the porous medium and the free flow. Studying these mechanisms {{plays a significant role}} in understanding the interaction behavior of these systems. Moreover, it is also important for the numerical modeling of such systems. An environmental example of such a system is evaporative drying of the shallow sub-surface subjected to the atmospheric free flow. As it significantly influences the terrestrial water balance and soil salinization, developing a detailed understanding about such a coupled system is very important. Furthermore, salt precipitation associated with evaporation from the shallow sub-surface directly affects the fertility of the soil. This becomes significantly important in the arid, semi-arid or coastal regions, where water from the deep hydrological systems is largely used for irrigation. Literature review shows that the soil salinization associated with the promoted irrigation is a major problem for farmers worldwide, as it directly influences the crop yield. In such systems, the evaporative salinization is influenced by the ambient air velocity, temperature and humidity on the free flow side and, by the soil properties and properties of water used for irrigation on the porous-media side. Therefore, for studying the evaporation and salinization dynamics in such systems, developing a detailed understanding of the underlying processes is very important and, elaborations using the modeling tools are very crucial. The main focus of this PhD thesis is to study evaporative salinization in the shallow sub-surface exposed to the adjacent atmospheric free flow. For this purpose, {{in the first part of}} this work, we develop a coupled model concept which describes a two-phase compositional porous-media system coupled with a single-phase compositional free flow. The developed REV scale model is robust and capable of comprehensive analysis of the exchange processes for mass, momentum and energy between the free flow and the porous medium. The developed model concept is implemented in the numerical framework of the open source porous-media simulator DuMux. In a natural hydrogeochemical system mixed salt precipitates is frequently observed. Therefore, in the second part, the model is extended to describe reactive transport of dissolved ionic species. Here, chemistry driven approaches are used to describe the salt precipitation processes. In addition to this, the model also accounts for solid salt accumulation driven changes in the porous media properties. Moreover, it provides the flexibility to analyze the influence of different free flow and porous media processes and parameters on evaporation and salinization dynamics. Evaporative salinization experiments was performed by the research group of Professor Nima Shokri at the University of Manchester. During these experiments saline-water saturated sand-columns were exposed to drying in an environmental chamber. The data from these experiments is used for model validation in this work. The first validation study is carried out using the simplified model for stage SS 1 of evaporative salinization. Here, dissolved salt (NaCl) is assumed to be a single component and equilibrium based approach is used for salt precipitation. Thus, during evaporation, spontaneous salt precipitation is expected as dissolved salt in the solution reaches its solubility limit. For this approach, the validation study has shown excellent agreement between the model results and experimental observations. This simplified model is then applied for all stages of saline water evaporation. The comparison between numerical and experimental results was promising. However, the numerical results has shown divergence from the experimental observations in late stage SS 1 and during transition to stage SS 2. To understand these differences, a details parameter analysis is carried out. For this, influence of the free flow, porous medium and their interface on evaporation and salinization dynamics is analyzed. The parameter analysis highlighted that the variation in individual parameters or processes in the free flow, porous medium or at their interface can significantly influence evaporation and salt precipitation behavior. In the second validation study, the extended model is applied to analyze precipitation dynamics in a mixed salt (NaCl-NaI) system. Here, in order to account for salt precipitation process both equilibrium and kinetic reaction based approaches are developed. These approaches are first validated using the available experimental data for single salt (NaCl) precipitation. This validation indicated that both the equilibrium and <b>kinetic</b> <b>precipitation</b> approaches are well in accordance with the experimental observations. Furthermore, for mixed salt precipitation (NaCl-NaI), the simulation results are found to be in good accordance with the phenomenological explanations discussed in the literature. Due to lack of experimental data, the mixed salt precipitation model will be validated in the near future. We conclude that the developed model concept offers a comprehensive and robust framework for modeling dissolved salt transport and precipitation processes in the drying shallow subsurface interacting with the free flow. Moreover, the validation studies indicate that the model is reliable to study and analyze the reactive transport and mixed salt precipitation processes in a naturally occurring hydrogeochemical system. Furthermore, generic nature of the developed model allows direct extension to other salinization applications where salt precipitation is observed at the interface between free flow and porous medium...|$|E

Different series of samples have been synthesized with different Mg doping level (from 0 to 5 atomic % of calcium atoms substituted) and different temperature of calcinations (from 500 to 1100 Â°C). All the powdered samples were systematically treated by Rietveld refinement to extract the quantitative phase analysis, the structural and microstructural parameters, to locate the Mg crystallographic sites and to refine the composition of the Mg-substituted phases. The temperature dependence of the weight amount ratio between HAp and beta-TCP is not monotonic due to the formation of minor phases as Ca 2 P 2 O 7, CaO, MgO, CaCO 3 and certainly an amorphous phase. On the other hand the Mg stabilizing feature on the whitlockite phase has been evidenced and explained. The mechanism of stabilization by small Mg 2 + is different to this by big Sr 2 +. Nevertheless, in both cases, the whitlockite stabilisation is realised by an improvement of the environment of the Ca 4 site unusually face coordinated to a PO 4 tetrahedron. The substitution of Mg atom in the Ca 5 site allows to improve considerably the bond valence sum of the unusual Ca 4 polyhedron. The temperature of calcinations combined with the amount of introduced Mg atoms allow to monitor the phases composition of the BCP ceramic as well as their microstructural properties.

Inputs of both electromagnetic energy (Poynting flux) and <b>kinetic</b> energy (particle <b>precipitation)</b> are closely correlated with these outflows. We assess the importance of processes thought to drive ionospheric outflows. These begin with the diffuse effects of photoionization and thermal equilibrium of the ionospheric topside, enhancing Jeans' escape, with ambipolar diffusion and acceleration. Auroral outflows begin with dayside reconnexion and resultant field-aligned currents and driven convection. These produce plasmaspheric plumes, collisional heating and wave-particle interactions, centrifugal acceleration, and auroral acceleration by parallel electric fields, including enhanced ambipolar fields from electron heating by precipitation particles. Solar wind energy dissipation is concentrated by the geomagnetic field into auroral regions with an amplification factor of 10 - 100, enhancing heavy species plasma and gas escape from gravity, and providing more current carrying capacity. Internal plasmas thus enable electromagnetic driving via coupling to the plasma and neutral gas.

The calcium carbonate 2 D distribution clearly shows that vaterite, the least stable of the three CaCO 3 polymorphs, is mostly located in a 500 mm wide ring ahead of the carbonation zone.

The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the characteristics and differences of the nanoparticle layers developed on lead rich and lead free glasses. Copper luster layers obtained using the ancient recipes and methods are analyzed by means of elastic ion backscattering spectroscopy associated with other analytical techniques. The depth profile of the different elements is determined, showing that the luster layer formed in lead rich glasses is 5 â 6 times thinner and 3 â 4 times Cu richer. Therefore, the metal nanoparticles are more densely packed in the layer and this fact is related to its higher reflectivity. It is shown that lead influences the structure of the metal nanoparticle layer through the change of the <b>precipitation</b> <b>kinetic...</b>|$|R

Each strain, known to be unable to oxidize As(III), was inoculated in sterilized acid mine drainage water containing hundreds of mg per litre of Fe(II) and tens mg per litre levels of arsenic, mainly in the As(III) form. Iron and arsenic speciation were followed in the dissolved phase, and microbial Fe(II) oxidation products were identified using XRD and EXAFS spectroscopy. Arsenite was found to coprecipitate with amorphous phases, with schwertmannite, and/or to be incorporated in tooeleite (Fe- 6 (AsO 3) (4) SO 4 (OH) (4) center dot H 2 O) -Precipitation of As-poor jarosite also occurred {{at the end of}} the experiments. The nature, proportion and sequence of the biominerals differed from one strain to another and as a function of the inoculum size.

As(III) -rich schwertmannite formed when the lag period was lower than one day, while tooeleite formed during extended (>= 9 days) lag period. After more than 15 days, jarosite precipitated upon complete Fe(II) oxidation, in agreement with the highest thermodynamic stability of this phase.

The aim of this work was thus to explore Technologies for the precipitation of valuable metals, such as nickel using such sulfides (as either Na 2 S or biogenic sulfide). The recovery of nickel sulfide was improved when the initial pH of the solution containing each metal was set to 7. In such a condition the removal efficiency of nickel was 99. 9 %, corresponding to a residual level of 0. 13 mg /L for nickel in solution. <b>Kinetic</b> parameters for <b>precipitation</b> were determined from the particle size distributions (produced in an MSMPR reactor) using the method of moments, where the growth and nucleation rates, as well the agglomeration kernel, were calculated. The precipitation of nickel at an initial pH of 7 showed a nucleation rate value of 8. 16 x 1018 #m^- 3 s^- 1, the highest volumetric growth rate (1. 03 x 10 ^ 1 um^- 3 s^- 1) and agglomeration kernel of 9. 71 x 10 ^- 23 m 3 #^- 1 s^- 1. The biogenic sulfide was a suitable alternative to sodium sulfide for nickel removal.

40|$|Acid-sulfate {{alteration}} of basalt by SO 2 -bearing volcanic vapors {{has been proposed}} as one possible origin for sulfate-rich deposits on Mars. To better define mineralogical signatures of acid-sulfate alteration, laboratory experiments were performed to investigate alteration pathways and geochemical processes during reaction of basalt with sulfuric acid. Pyroclastic cinders composed of phenocrysts including plagioclase, olivine, and augite embedded in glass were reacted with sulfuric acid at 145 Â°C for up to 137 days at a range of fluid : rock ratios. During the experiments, the phenocrysts reacted rapidly to form secondary products, while the glass was unreactive. Major products included amorphous silica, anhydrite, and Fe-rich natroalunite, along with minor iron oxides/oxyhydroxides (probably hematite) and trace levels of other sulfates. At the lowest fluid : rock ratio, hexahydrite and an unidentified Fe-silicate phase also occurred as major products. Reaction-path models indicated that formation of the products required both slow dissolution of glass and <b>kinetic</b> inhibitions to <b>precipitation</b> {{of a number of}} minerals including phyllosilicates and other aluminosilicates as well as Al- and Fe-oxides/oxyhydroxides. Similar models performed for Martian basalt compositions predict that the initial stages of acid-sulfate {{alteration of}} pyroclastic deposits on Mars should result in formation of amorphous silica, anhydrite, Fe-bearing natroalunite, and kieserite, along with relict basaltic glass. In addition, analysis of the experimental products indicates that Fe-bearing natroalunite produces a MÃ¶ssbauer spectrum closely resembling that of jarosite, suggesting that it should be considered an alternative to the component in sulfate-rich bedrocks at Meridiani Planum that has previously been identified as jarosite...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} Î´ 44 / 42 Ca of laboratory-precipitated calcite {{grown in}} an experimental setup that closely replicates stalagmite formation. Calcium solutions were dripped onto two different substrates in tightly-controlled conditions and calcite precipitated due to rapid CO 2 degassing. With seeded glass slides as the substrate, we observe a Ca isotope ratio in the calcite which is â¼ 0. 5 â° per amu {{lower than that}} in the growth solution. This fractionation is generally almost twice that observed in previously published calcite growth experiments and indicates a large kinetic effect on Ca isotopes in the stalagmite growth environment. The precipitate forming near {{the spot where the}} drip lands shows slightly greater solution-to-precipitate fractionation than calcite further from the drip reflecting a decrease in this <b>kinetic</b> fractionation as <b>precipitation</b> continues. We interpret these results {{in the context of the}} model of Fantle and DePaolo (2007) which involves surface entrapment of light Ca isotopes to decrease calcite Î´ 44 / 42 Ca, and depletion of Ca from the solution in the direct vicinity of the growing calcite to increase calcite Î´ 44 / 42 Ca. In the stalagmite setting, the second of these effects is minimized so that calcite Ca isotope ratios are unusually light. This interpretation suggests that stalagmite Ca isotope ratios should decrease with the saturation state of the drip water (i. e. with the growth rate of calcite). Ca isotopes might therefore allow reconstruction of surface entrapment of trace metals and isotopes more generally and might, for instance, allow an assessment of the appropriate relationship between oxygen isotope fractionation and temperature for periods of past growth in stalagmites.

40|$|Simultaneous {{simulation}} of HXR and MW emission {{with the same}} populations of electrons is still a great challenge for interpretation of observations in real events. In this paper we apply the FP <b>kinetic</b> model of <b>precipitation</b> of electron beam with energy range from 12 keV to 1. 2 MeV to the interpretation of X-ray and microwave emissions observed in the flare of 10 March 2001. Methods. The theoretical HXR and MW emissions were calculated by using the distribution functions of electron beams found by solving time-dependent Fokker-Planck approach in a converging magnetic field (Zharkova at al., 2010; Kuznetsov and Zharkova, 2010) for anisotropic scattering of beam electrons on the ambient particles in Coloumb collisions and Ohmic losses. The simultaneous observed HXR photon spectra and frequency distribution of MW emission and polarization were fit by those simulated from FP models which include the effects of electric field induced by beam electrons and precipitation into a converging magnetic loop. Magnetic field strengths in the footpoints on the photosphere were updated with newly calibrated SOHO/MDI data. The observed HXR energy spectrum above 10 keV is {{shown to be a}} double power law which was fit precisely by the photon HXR spectrum simulated for the model including the self-induced electric field but without magnetic convergence. The MW emission simulated for different models of electron precipitation revealed a better fit to the observed distribution at higher frequencies for the models combining collisions and electric field effects with a moderate magnetic field convergence of 2. The MW simulations were able to reproduce closely the main features of the MW emission observed at higher frequencies. Comment: 17 pages, 10 figures in press; A&A 201...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a series of cloud-resolving radiative-convective {{equilibrium}} (RCE) simulations are presented. The RCE simulations, used as an idealization for the mean tropical climate, are run {{for a wide range of}} prescribed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), from 21 [superscript o]C to 36 [superscript o]C, representing the range of past, present, and, possibly, future mean tropical SSTs. The RCE with constant Coriolis parameter f is contrasted with nonrotating RCE. The Coriolis parameter is artificially increased from typical values in the Tropics by about one order of magnitude to allow multiple tropical cyclones (TCs) to coexist in a relatively small 2300 Ã 2300 km[superscript 2] domain with a 3 km horizontal grid spacing. Nonrotating RCE is also simulated, but using a substantially smaller, 384 Ã 384 km[superscript 2] domain. Rotating RCE, which we nickname âTC World,â contains from 8 to 26 TCs with the average number of TCs monotonically decreasing with increasing SST. At the same time, the TCs' size, intensity, and per-TC precipitation rate tend to increase in response to increasing SST. For example, the average per-TC <b>kinetic</b> energy and <b>precipitation</b> rate tend to double for every 6 [superscript o]C SST increase. These results are consistent with scaling laws in which TC velocities and inner core diameters scale with the potential intensity and its ratio to the Coriolis parameter, respectively, while the separation between cyclone centers appears to scale with the deformation radius. It is also found that the outflow temperature of TC's, as defined as the height of the local maximum of the upper-troposphere cloud fraction, remains relatively invariant with SST. The cold-point tropopause height in TC World is found to be about 2 km higher than the corresponding height in nonrotating RCE. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant AGS 1032244...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of Asphaltene to deposit and block tubing can potentially lead to production loss and significant cost of remediation. Unlike other deposits, the deposition behavior of Asphaltene {{is still not}} fully understood and is hindered by asphaltene complex nature. This thesis will {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of Asphaltene deposition through a better understanding of its thermodynamics and kinetics. Despite the contribution made by this thesis to better understand its behaviors, asphaltene still represents an ongoing challenge. Generally, a lengthy and time consuming characterization is required to obtain the optimum parameters before using EOS for crude oils. Therefore, an automatic characterization has been developed. In this thesis, a comparison between CPA and PC-SAFT EOSs is presented to illustrate their potential and limitations on the prediction of asphaltene phase behavior, and PVT properties over a range of pressure and temperature. With an optimized characterization, both EOSs give acceptable predictions of the asphaltene precipitation tendency. However, PC-SAFT is superior in the prediction of derivative properties especially at high pressures. As gas injection is crucial part of enhanced oil recovery, the effect of various gases on asphaltene phase behavior is presented. Nitrogen is shown to be the strongest precipitant while hydrogen sulfide stabilizes asphaltene. The addition of polystyrene to a mixture of asphaltene and toluene causes phase separation into two liquids due to depletion flocculation and is modeled using PC-SAFT EOS. The effects of temperature, pressure and polystyrene MW on the mixture phase behavior are investigated. The phase behavior was not sensitive to the range of pressures studied; however, increasing temperature or reducing polystyrene MW caused the one phase region to expand. The paper demonstrates that a solution model with rigorous physics can capture the depletion flocculation mechanism typically presented as colloidal behavior. This thesis also introduces Asphaltene Deposition Tool by incorporating both asphaltene kinetics and thermodynamics. The asphaltene phase behavior is described by PC-SAFT EOS while transport equations are coupled with <b>kinetic</b> rates of <b>precipitation,</b> aggregation and deposition.

40|$|Barite-(pyrite) mineralizations {{from the}} thermal springs of Wiesbaden, Rhenish Massif, Germany, {{have been studied}} to place {{constraints}} on the geochemical evolution of the hydrothermal system in space and time. The thermal springs, characterized by high total dissolved solids (TDS) contents and predominance of NaCl, ascend from aquifers at 3 - 4 km depth and discharge at a temperature of 65 - 70 degC. The barite-(pyrite) mineralization is found in upflow and discharge zones of the present-day thermal springs {{as well as at}} elevations up to 50 m above the current water table. Hence, this mineralization style constitutes a continuous record of the hydrothermal activity, linking the past evolution with the present state of this geothermal system. The sulphur isotope signatures of the mineralization indicate a continuous decrease of the Î´ 34 S of sulphate from + 16. 9 â° in the oldest barite to + 10. 1 â° in the present-day thermal water. The Î´ 34 S values of barite closely resemble various recently active thermal springs along the southern margin of the Rhenish Massif and contrast strongly with different regional ground and mineral waters. The mineralogical and isotopic signatures, combined with calculations based on uplift rates and the regional geological history, indicate a minimum activity of the thermal spring system at Wiesbaden of about 500 000 years. This timeframe is considerably larger than conservative models, which estimate the duration of thermal spring systems in continental intraplate settings to last for several 10 000 years. The calculated equilibrium sulphur isotope temperatures of coexisting barite and pyrite range between 65 and 80 degC, close to the discharge temperature of the springs, which would indicate apparent equilibrium <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Kinetic</b> modelling of the re-equilibration of the sulphate-sulphicle pair during water ascent shows that this process would require 220 Myr. Therefore, we conclude that pyrite is formed from precursor Fe monosulphide phases, which rapidly precipitate in the near- surface environment, preserving the isotope fractionation between dissolved sulphate and sulphide established in the deep aquifer. Equilibrium modelling of water-mineral reactions shows slight supersaturation of barite at the discharge temperature. Pyrite is already strongly supersaturated at the temperatures estimated for the aquifer (110 degC) and processes in the near-surface environment are most probably related to contact of the thermal water with atmospheric oxygen, resulting in formation of oxidized intermediate sulphur species and precipitation of Fe monosulphide phases, which subsequently recrystallize to pyrite...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study investigates calcium isotope {{variations}} (Î´ 44 / 40 Ca) in late Silurian marine carbonates {{deposited in}} the Prague Basin (Czech Republic), which records {{one of the largest}} positive carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of the entire Phanerozoic, the mid-Ludfordian CIE, which is associated with major climatic changes (abrupt cooling) and global sea-level fluctuations. Our results show that during the onset of the CIE, when Î´ 13 C increases rapidly from â¼ 0 â° to â¼ 8. 5 â°, Î´ 44 / 40 Ca remains constant at about 0. 3 Â± 0. 1 â° (relative to NIST 915 a), while 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in well-preserved carbonates are consistent with a typical Ludfordian seawater composition (ranging from â¼ 0. 70865 to â¼ 0. 70875). Such decoupling between Î´ 13 C and Î´ 44 / 40 Ca trends during the onset of the CIE is consistent with the expected order-of-magnitude difference in the residence times of Ca (â¼ 106 yr) and C (â¼ 105 yr) in the open ocean, suggesting that the mid-Ludfordian CIE was caused by processes where the biogeochemical pathways of C and Ca in seawater were mechanistically decoupled. These processes may include: (i) near shore methanogenesis and photosynthesis, (ii) changes in oceanic circulation and stratification, and/or (iii) increased production and burial of organic C in the global ocean. The latter, however, is unlikely {{due to the lack of}} geological evidence for enhanced organic C burial, and also because of unrealistic parameterization of the ocean C cycle needed to generate the observed CIE over the relatively short time interval. In contrast, higher up in the section where Î´ 13 C shifts back to pre-excursion baseline values, there is a correlated shift to higher Î´ 44 / 40 Ca values. Such coupling of the records of Ca and C isotope changes in this part of the study section is inconsistent with the abovementioned differences in oceanic Ca and C residence times, indicating that the record of Î´ 44 / 40 Ca changes does not faithfully reflect the evolution of the oceanic Ca reservoir, but rather some local processes in the Prague Basin. These can be related to restricted elemental/sediment cycling involving mixing of isotopically distinct Ca sources and carbonate polymorphs (calcite vs. aragonite), and/or possible kinetic Ca isotope effects due to changes in the rate of marine carbonate formation. Evidence supporting the âkineticâ effect in the studied mid-Ludfordian carbonates is indicated by correlated Î´ 44 / 40 Ca and Sr-concentration data (rs=â 0. 76, p< 0. 001, n= 41) yielding a slope of â 0. 00097, which is indistinguishable from the âkineticâ slope of abiotic calcite <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Kinetic</b> processes are integral to the model of rapid carbonate precipitation recently proposed by KozÅowski (2015), to explain the origin of the mid-Ludfordian CIE, involving intense methanogenesis/photosynthesis in near shore settings coupled with rapid CaCO 3 precipitation (i. e., massive whitings events) and eustatically-controlled carbonate hypersaturation of seawater. More Ca isotope studies are needed to shed light on the question of whether kinetics or mineralogy controls the coupled variations in carbonate Î´ 44 / 40 Ca and Î´ 13 C records observed in this study and other large positive CIEs in geological record...|$|R
