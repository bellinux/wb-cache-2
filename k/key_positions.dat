5|$|A libertinus was not {{entitled}} to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but he could play a priestly role in {{the cult of the}} emperor. He could not marry a woman from a family of senatorial rank, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held <b>key</b> <b>positions</b> in the government bureaucracy, so much so that Hadrian limited their participation by law. Any future children of a freedman would be born free, with full rights of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions.

5|$|The Courtier-Liberal {{alliance}} held near absolute {{sway over}} Brazilian politics for several years.

PedroII called upon the Party of Order {{to form a new}} cabinet in September 1848.|$|E
5|$|The Franklin D. Roosevelt {{administration}} {{proposed the}} New Deal {{to combat the}} depression. ACLU leaders were of mixed opinions about the New Deal, since many felt that it represented an increase in government intervention into personal affairs, and because the National Recovery Administration suspended anti-trust legislation. Roosevelt was not personally interested in civil rights, but did appoint many civil libertarians to <b>key</b> <b>positions,</b> including Interior Secretary Harold Ickes, {{a member of the}} ACLU.|$|E
5|$|When the MCC {{abolished}} amateur {{status in}} cricket in 1963, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change. In 1963, {{he was appointed}} as MCC President. When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he {{was appointed to the}} influential role of MCC Treasurer, a position he filled until 1976. During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of <b>key</b> <b>positions.</b> He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to <b>key</b> <b>positions.</b> Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of eligibility rules for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968. He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new Test and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC, and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.|$|E

Heavy fighting reduced Jülich Sportplatz and the Hasenfeld Gut on 8 December.|$|E
5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which {{could be used as a}} base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and to pacify the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified <b>key</b> <b>positions</b> to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Eisenhower favored Shoup {{because he}} feared other {{officers}} {{spent too much}} time in political affairs, and felt Shoup would reduce the influence of the military industrial complex. Immediately after his appointment, Shoup sought to place new officers in <b>key</b> <b>positions,</b> in an attempt to overhaul the leadership of the Marine Corps. He and Pate disagreed over some of the new appointments, as Shoup transferred many senior officers and encouraged others to retire. Shoup later wrote he felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had an undue weight in the direction of military strategy. He also sought to curtail politicking by lower-level Marine officers seeking career advancement.|$|E

The political tide turned markedly during the more than six years he was there, and following Cromwell's death and Vane's execution, Wheelwright returned to New England to become the minister in Salisbury, Massachusetts, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was characterized as being contentious and unbending, but also forgiving, energetic and courageous. His sincere piety was never called into question, even by those whose opinions differed greatly from his.|$|E
5|$|In April 1945, {{after months}} of {{lobbying}} by Potts—who was keen {{to get back into}} action himself after having been relieved of his previous command during the Kokoda campaign—the 7th Battalion was transferred to Torokina on Bougainville Island, where the Japanese garrison was still holding out. In June they moved up the Numa Numa Trail to Pearl Ridge in the central sector of the island where they relieved the 27th Battalion. Almost immediately they began aggressive patrols in order to dominate the Japanese in their area of operations and were tasked with the capture of several <b>key</b> <b>positions</b> including Wearne's Hill, Base Point 3, Tokua and Sisivie and to establish a forward position in the Wakunai Valley. Over {{the course of the next}} three months until the end of the war, the battalion captured 25 positions and killed around 200 Japanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese-Palauans assumed <b>key</b> <b>positions</b> in {{the public}} service sector and politics. At least one ethnologist, Mark Peattie, {{suggested}} that the strong representation of Japanese-Palauans in leading positions in society {{could be attributed to}} the mainstream Japanese education which they had received in their youth. Palau's first president, Kuniwo Nakamura—who was half-Japanese—fostered closer diplomatic ties between Japan and Palau during his Presidency. During a state visit to Japan in 1996, Emperor Akihito personally received Nakamura, and the visit was commended by Palauans and Japanese alike. Nakamura's visit prompted Japan to channel monetary aid to Palau to facilitate repair work on the Koror-Babeldaob Bridge and securing special trade agreements with Japan.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's <b>key</b> <b>positions,</b> {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, {{it was decided}} that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|The February Revolution was {{positively}} {{accepted by the}} Armenians because it ended the autocratic rule of Nicholas II. The Special Transcaucasian Committee (known as OZAKOM) {{was set up in}} the South Caucasus by the Russian Provisional Government. In April 1917, Andranik initiated the publication of the newspaper Hayastan (Armenia) in Tiflis. Vahan Totovents became the editor of this non-partisan, Ottoman Armenian-orientated newspaper. Until December 1917, Andranik remained in the South Caucasus where he sought to help the Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire in their search for basic needs. The provisional government decree of 9 May 1917 put Turkish Armenia under civil administration, with Armenians holding <b>key</b> <b>positions.</b> About 150,000 local Armenians began to rebuild devastated Turkish Armenia; however the Russian army units gradually disintegrated and many soldiers deserted and returned to Russia.|$|E
5|$|The LM {{sought to}} {{seize control of}} the LCL agenda by winning <b>key</b> <b>positions</b> on the state {{executive}} at the annual general meeting in September, but this was difficult as the malapportionment towards rural groups was entrenched at party level, and because the conservatives had anticipated the LM's plans. The LM President Alex Perryman challenged McLachlan for the party presidency and in a high-profile contest received 47% {{of the vote in}} a narrow defeat. He received around 90% among urban delegates and around 33% of the rural votes, the latter figure shocking the conservatives. The LM later generated more publicity by inquiring about alleged impropriety in the balloting process.|$|E
