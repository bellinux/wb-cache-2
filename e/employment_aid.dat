The second was convened on July 9 to consider authorizing Albert Lea to spend federal revenue sharing funds, and to consider providing <b>employment</b> <b>aid</b> to the Iron Range from the Northeast Minnesota Economic Protection Fund. The final special session of the 72nd Minnesota Legislature met from December 7, 1982 to December 10, 1982, and considered reductions in appropriations, reducing employer and increasing employee contributions to various retirement funds, adding two members to the investment advisory board, and so forth.|$|E
5000|$|Roosevelt came {{to office}} in 1928 as a reform Democrat, but with no overall plan. He tackled {{official}} corruption by dismissing Smith's cronies and instituting the New York Public Service Commission. He addressed New York's growing need for power {{through the development of}} hydroelectricity on the St. Lawrence River. He reformed the state's prison administration and built a new state prison at Attica. He had a long feud with Robert Moses, the state's most powerful public servant, whom he removed as Secretary of State but kept on as Parks Commissioner and head of urban planning. When the Wall Street crash in October 1929 ushered in the Great Depression, Roosevelt started a relief system that later became the model for the New Deal's Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). Roosevelt followed President Herbert Hoover's advice and asked the state legislature for $20 million in relief funds, which he spent mainly on public works in the hope of stimulating demand and providing <b>employment.</b> <b>Aid</b> to the unemployed, he said, [...] "must be extended by Government, not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of social duty." [...] In his first term, Roosevelt famously said, [...] "The United States Constitution has proved itself the most marvelously elastic compilation of rules of government ever written." [...] He was referring to the belief he had that the Federal government would need to use more power in order to bring the country out of the Depression.|$|E

40|$|Industry {{collapse}} {{has become}} an important phenomenon in China's recent economic growth fluctuation. This paper develops a simple model to analyze this phenomenon. Our analysis focuses on an external demand decline-caused industry collapse. The model reveals {{that the combination of}} large-scale decline in external demand with a horizontal domestic supply curve causes the domestic export industry to undergo a sharp decrease in output {{in a short period of}} time, which further leads to a sharp decline in employment. The conventional stabilization policy is less effective in coping with this sudden industry collapse. The Chinese Government needs to formulate an appropriate structural industry stabilization policy to cope with the sudden industry collapse, and, in particular, to implement a direct <b>employment</b> <b>aid</b> program to deal with unemployment resulting from the industry collapse.

40|$|An {{environmental}} and cultural history of cities between 1870 and 1930 s, "Winters in America" explores the changing material and cultural relationship that Americans formed with {{winter in the}} urban spaces of the country. During this period of immense demographic, social, and technological change most Americans encountered winter nature in the industrial city, and subsequently formed their environmental experiences {{and knowledge of the}} season through city life. Using case studies of five cities - Boston, Chicago, St. Paul, Tucson and Phoenix - this study shows how winter labor, leisure, and culture in the Gilded Age city not only informed built environments but was also marshaled by Americans to interpret the appearance of the season, resulting in an emerging urban {{environmental and}} seasonal culture. Indeed, the growth of cities in combination with social and technological changes {{played a significant role in}} reorienting how many residents experienced and understood winter in their lives. Access to and control over winter narratives were not inclusive, however, and the evolving culture of winter typically favored particular classes of citizens. Winter celebrations, <b>employment</b> <b>aid,</b> work, and winter health resorts, for example, shifted the experiences and social values injected into the season. Ultimately, an examination of winter in the city during this period demonstrates the continued environmental power of season in the lives of urban Americans, while exposing the cultural power many Americans ascribed to the coldest season...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the world}} the idea of {{sustainable}} cities (SCs) is gaining momentum in both academia and practice. Sustainable cities {{can be defined as}} urban areas that balance social, ecological and economic goals {{in such a way that}} they may, in principle, be continued into the foreseeable future. While worded as universal truths, theories about how to create such cities appear to have a Western bias. However, as Hofstede (2001) shows, it is highly questionable whether such Western-based theories are applicable across cultures. This thesis addresses the universality of the SC debate by comparing the way SCs are created in the EU and China. China - which shows large cultural differences with the EU - has grown into a critical player in global affairs and has also embarked on the development of SCs. This raises questions about the applicability of SC theory in this very different context: Will an autocratic government allow its citizens to dictate policy, or team up with non-governmental organizations? Will the power of the Chinese government lead to more mandatory policies? And could a focus on the individual lead to slower, more incremental developments in the EU? Such questions show how culture may be expected to influence the way SC projects are given shape. Thus an answer to the following research question was sought: To what extent do differences in culture account for any perceived differences in the process and content of sustainable city projects in the EU and China? 	In this thesis, UNEP’s Melbourne Principles for Sustainable Cities (MPs) are used as a summery of the most important aspects of SCs, focusing on both process and content. Hofstede’s (2001, and Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005) distinction between five aspects of culture – power distance, individuality vs. collectivism, masculinity vs. femininity, uncertainty avoidance and long-term vs. short-term orientation – is used as a model of culture. By linking relevant cultural characteristics pertaining to these five indexes to the MPs, the following five hypotheses were deducted. The relevant cultural indexes are named in parentheses. H 1 : While the EU will seek collaboration with a broad array of stakeholders (including NGOs and citizens); China will seek active participation only of consultants and powerful (government and business) interests (because of differences in power distance, individuality and masculinity). H 2 : While the EU will have broad, vague measures of progress; China will use narrower and quantitative assessment criteria (because of differences in masculinity). H 3 : While the EU aims for incremental technological- and land-use changes; China will create mega-projects and large transformations of space (because of differences in long-term orientation). H 4 : While the EU aims to create incentives for voluntary behavioral change through communication and mobilization strategies, China is more forceful, utilizing bans and penalties (because of differences in power distance and long-term orientation). H 5 : While the EU devotes much of its resources to welfare provisions (education, <b>employment,</b> <b>aid,</b> recreation, etc.); China invests only in prestigious physical projects and business interests (because of differences in masculinity) In this exploratory, qualitative study these hypotheses were tested for six cases; three in the EU - Almere, Leicester and Hammarby Sjöstad-Stockholm - and three in China - Dongtan, Tianjin and Rizhao. In addition to analyzing the influence of culture, the type of development – new city or area or retrofit of an existing city - was controlled for. The qualitative nature of the study also allowed for the finding of additional important variables. 	Both culture and the type of development were found to have an influence on the way SCs are given shape. Cultural differences appear to lead to differences concerning the use of mandatory measures (H 4). The large power distance and collective nature of Chinese culture may then lead to more forceful policies than in the EU, where only voluntary approaches were found. The relationship between culture and assessment criteria (H 2) and the choice of an incremental versus a rapid, large-scale approach (H 3) is less clear. While there were some interesting differences between the EU and China, qualitative assessment and a large-scale approach appear to be the norm in both contexts. The type of SC project was shown to be related to the level of inclusion of stakeholders (1) as well as the importance of welfare provisions (H 5), with both being more pronounced in retrofit cases. Additionally, this study showed the importance of economic variables and the amount of discretionary space of municipalities...|$|E
