40|$|Logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> {{represent}} {{very significant}} infrastructure {{elements of the}} macro-logistic system. The creation of the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> and their connection into a wide (global) network {{have resulted in the}} creation of conditions for an adequate distribution of labour and significant increase in the productivity of all the logistics elements and processes, noting that the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> in this concept have a superregional significance. This paper represents the summary (results) of the research that was carried out on a large number of logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> with the aim of considering the complexity and the issues related to the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> and the <b>distribution</b> network, their elements and action of the subsystems according to the following criteria: spatial, technical, technological, and organizational, with the aim of defining the categorisation model of the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres.</b> The analysis of the selected data collected during the research has resulted in defining of the categorisation model of the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> which foresees six categories. Each of the foreseen categories has been defined according to the set model by the mentioned traffic, technical and technological, and organisational characteristics and the level of service. This is precisely where the application of the categorisation model of the logistics and <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> can be found, which will define the relevant categories of the centres applicable in the creation of effective distributio...|$|R

To understand the opportunities for Flanders to attract new <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> and to help companies to further develop their logistic activities, we develop a typology of logistic real estate.

This paper reports on the literature review, which served {{as the basis for}} a questionnaire currently sent out to the European <b>Distribution</b> <b>Centres</b> in Flanders. Based on the results of this survey, which will be presented at the Conference of the Flemish Economic Association on 14 November 2008, {{we will be able to}} provide concrete recommendations for manufacturers and logistic service providers...|$|R

The BP section of the site {{is a good way}} from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} British canals, the Manchester Ship Canal was never nationalised. In 1984 Salford City Council used a {{derelict}} land grant {{to purchase the}} docks at Salford from the Ship Canal Company, rebranding the area as Salford Quays. Principal developers Urban Waterside began redevelopment work the following year, by which time traffic on the canal's upper reaches had declined {{to such an extent}} that its owners considered closing it above Runcorn. In 1993 the Ship Canal Company was acquired by Peel Holdings; as of 2014 it is owned and operated by Peel Ports, which also owns the Port of Liverpool. The company announced a £50billion Atlantic Gateway plan in 2011 to develop the Port of Liverpool and the Manchester Ship Canal as a way of combating increasing road congestion. Their scheme involves the construction of a large <b>distribution</b> <b>centre</b> to be named Port Salford and an additional six sites along the canal for the loading and unloading of freight. Peel Ports predict that the number of containers transported along the canal could increase from the 8,000 carried in 2010 to 100,000 by 2030.|$|E

Due {{to the number of}} recent acquisitions by Chicago Pneumatic Division, the number of <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> has increased, making its structure more complex. The main question studied are how many <b>distribution</b> <b>centres</b> the division should operate and how the product companies best will supply the <b>distribution</b> <b>centres,</b> today {{as well as in the}} future. Four distribution models are created, with consideration to goods flow as well as financial and environmental aspects, both in present and future situation. The thesis also includes bench-marking with Atlas Copco Tools and Assembly Systems, Electrolux and Dell. The analysis showed that the division should operate three <b>distribution</b> <b>centres,</b> carrying inventory of products from all production companies. This model is also sustainable environmentally and brings the benefit of one consolidated shipment to the customers...|$|R
