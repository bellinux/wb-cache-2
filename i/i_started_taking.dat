25|$|Macrinus {{refused the}} {{extensive}} {{demands of the}} Parthians and war was restarted and its peak was in a three-day battle in Nusaybin. Although there is controversy about {{the result of the}} battle in the views of the ancient world's historians, the aftermath of the battle was obviously Roman defeat. After the end of the war, peace negotiations began and resulted in a peace treaty in 218 according to which the Romans paid 50 million Dinars to the Parthians and kept Armenia and Northern Mesopotamia. It was probably in about 220 that the local Persian governors (Ardashir <b>I)</b> <b>started</b> <b>taking</b> far and close lands. At the time, Artabanus did not pay much attention to his actions and decided to fight him when it had become too late. Eventually, Ardashir ended the life of the House of Arsaces in the Battle of Hormozdgan and founded the Sasanian dynasty. However, the end of the Parthian dynasty did not mean an endpoint for all Parthian houses. Movses Khorenatsi, Armenian historian, has quoted some reports of the roles and aids of some Parthian houses, like Suren and Ispahbudhan, in Ardashir's uprising.|$|E

Initially <b>I</b> <b>started</b> by <b>taking</b> many photos of the washing machine. This was followed by physcially taking apart the washing machine in order to examine each component and to study its location within the framework of the machine. I carefully documented this stage of the process. To add an extra dimension, I went to the Indesit Washing Machine factory in North Wales where my machine was originally manufactured. As is usual in factories, repetition was a very prominent theme, and I later I used this as one of the cores of the project. From the washing machine I created visual relationships based on the components themselves, and then I took this relationship to a 3 D medium which led me to some very interesting ideas.
