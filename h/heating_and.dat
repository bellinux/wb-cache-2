40|$|Recently, <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass {{transfer}} simulation {{is more and}} more important in various engineering fields. In order to analyze how <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> {{mass transfer}} in a thermal environment, <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer simulation is needed. However, it is too much time-consuming to obtain numerical solutions to <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer equations. Therefore, in this paper, one of acceleration techniques developed in the graphics community that exploits a graphics processing unit (GPU) is applied to the numerical solutions of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer equations. The nVidia Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming model provides a straightforward means of describing inherently parallel computations.

Our experimental results clearly show that GPU can accurately perform <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer simulation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} efficiency of humidification in available <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchanger models under conditions of varying tidal volume, respiratory rate, and flow rate. INTRODUCTION: Inspired gases are routinely preconditioned by <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers to provide a <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> water content similar to that provided normally by the nose and upper airways. The absolute humidity of air retrieved from {{and returned to the}} ventilated patient is an important measurable outcome of the <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers' humidifying performance. METHODS: Eight different <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers were studied using a respiratory system analog. The system included a heated chamber (acrylic glass, maintained at 37 °C), a preserved swine lung, a hygrometer, circuitry and a ventilator. Humidity and temperature levels were measured using eight distinct interposed <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers given different tidal volumes, respiratory frequencies and flow-rate conditions. Recovery of absolute humidity (%RAH) was calculated for each setting. RESULTS: Increasing tidal volumes led to a reduction in %RAH for all <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers while no significant effect was demonstrated in the context of varying respiratory rate or inspiratory flow. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers are more efficient when used with low tidal volume ventilation. The roles of flow and respiratory rate were of lesser importance, suggesting that their adjustment has a less significant effect on the performance of <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> moisture exchangers...|$|R
