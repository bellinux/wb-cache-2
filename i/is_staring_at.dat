500|$|The {{episode was}} written by March 10, 2008 and was done {{alongside}} [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever". [...] Shooting began by March 24, alongside filming of the previous episode and continued through April 4. [...] The flashforwards were written partially to explain what led Jack to become the drug addict {{that he is in}} third-season finale's flashforwards, who believes that his father is alive. [...] Matthew Fox stated that the fourth season is [...] "starting to close the loop on the end of [...] season. [...] Jack in the future is a man marked by weakness, but the Jack [...] is strong. [...] how he made that transition." [...] When asked why Hurley does not take drugs to see Charlie, but Jack starts his drug addiction to try not to see Christian, Edward Kitsis said that [...] "Jack has … always been a man of science, and there has to be something logical. [...] The scene where Jack <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life right now is pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her. [...] In the flashforwards … there's a sense of purpose to her, there's some clarity to her. [...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of Quagmire's wedding, Lois' breasts have gotten very large after {{deciding}} to wean Stewie, {{on the advice of}} Brian. While at the reception, the top of her shirt rips open. Peter notices that Quagmire <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> Lois' huge breasts, and deliberately spills champagne on them. Peter then [...] "helps" [...] Lois by shaking her, which makes her large breasts jiggle. This arouses Quagmire, and he realizes that he has made a mistake by marrying Joan. He informs Joan that some of his friends think they should get an annulment after discussing it with Peter, Joe and Cleveland, but she threatens to cut herself and him if he annuls their marriage. As a result, Peter decides to help Quagmire fake his death. He shows Joan a video of Quagmire being attacked by a ninja (Joe), a Nazi (Cleveland), a [...] "pots and pans" [...] robot (Peter), and the body being consumed by a dinosaur held by Peter (to the theme of Jurassic Park). Joan is unconvinced by the video. Peter and his friends then operate plan B, which consists of Quagmire pretending to suffer a heart attack and die. Quagmire is buried in a coffin with enough oxygen to last him {{a short period of time}} so Peter can return after the funeral has finished and dig him up. However, when Mayor West announces that all coffins must be buried in concrete (to guard against zombies), Peter exclaims that Quagmire is not dead, and brings him out of the coffin, alive. Death shows up to retrieve his body. Joan pleads for Quagmire's life, and touches Death's arm, which kills her instantly. Death takes Joan instead, as [...] "she was suicidal and her last name was Quagmire." [...] However, before he leaves, Quagmire asks Death to leave the body for another five minutes, thus turning him back into his old usual self.|$|E
2500|$|Horn's first {{photographic}} installation, You Are The Weather (1994-1996), {{a photographic}} cycle featuring 100 close-up {{shots of the}} same woman, Margret, {{in a variety of}} Icelandic geothermal pools, deals with the enigma of identity captured through a series of facial expressions dictated by imperceptible weather changes. Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, I was curious to see if I could elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a Subject Index that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the Subject Index, [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face smudges the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E

As she looks at him, she becomes deadly pale. There is no mistaking her expression: a revelation of some fatal error utterly unexpected, has suddenly appalled her {{in the midst of}} tranquillity, security and victory. The next moment a wave of color rushes up from beneath the creamy fichu and drowns her whole face. One can see that she is blushing all over her body. Even the lieutenant, ordinarily incapable of observation, and just now lost in the tumult of his wrath, can see a thing when it is painted red for him. Interpreting the blush as the involuntary confession of black deceit confronted with its victim, he points to it with a loud crow of retributive triumph, and then, seizing her by the wrist, pulls her past him into the room as he claps the door to, and plants himself with his back to it.) ...|$|E

6000|$|This is {{the meaning}} of that almost insane {{happiness}} {{in the eyes of the}} mediaeval saint in the picture. This {{is the meaning}} of the sealed eyes of the superb Buddhist image. The Christian saint is happy because he has verily been cut off from the world; he is separate from things and <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them in astonishment. But why should the Buddhist saint be astonished at things?-- since there is really only one thing, and that being impersonal can hardly be astonished at itself. There have been many pantheist poems suggesting wonder, but no really successful ones. The pantheist cannot wonder, for he cannot praise God or praise anything as really distinct from himself. Our immediate business here, however, is with the effect of this Christian admiration (which strikes outwards, towards a deity distinct from the worshipper) upon the general need for ethical activity and social reform. And surely its effect is sufficiently obvious. There is no real possibility of getting out of pantheism, any special impulse to moral action. For pantheism implies in its nature that one thing is as good as another; whereas action implies in its nature that one thing is greatly preferable to another. Swinburne in the high summer of his scepticism tried in vain to wrestle with this difficulty. In [...] "Songs before Sunrise," [...] written under the inspiration of Garibaldi and the revolt of Italy he proclaimed the newer religion and the purer God which should wither up all the priests of the world: ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{about this}} time the island {{was caught in a}} swarm of pirates; and the shepherds had to turn {{themselves}} into rude warriors and seamen; and at first they were utterly broken down in blood and shame; and the pirates might have taken the jewel flung up for ever from their sacred fount. And then, after years of horror and humiliation, they gained a little and began to conquer because they did not mind defeat. And the pride of the pirates went sick within them after a few unexpected foils; and at last the invasion rolled back into the empty seas and the island was delivered. And for some reason after this men began to talk quite differently about the temple and the sun. Some, indeed, said, [...] "You must not touch the temple; it is classical; it is perfect, since it admits no imperfections." [...] But the others answered, [...] "In that it differs from the sun, that shines on the evil and the good and on mud and monsters everywhere. The temple is of the noon; it is made of white marble clouds and sapphire sky. But the sun is not always of the noon. The sun dies daily, every night he is crucified in blood and fire." [...] Now the priest had taught and fought through all the war, and his hair had grown white, but his eyes had grown young. And he said, [...] "I was wrong and they are right. The sun, the symbol of our father, gives life to all those earthly things that are full of ugliness and energy. All the exaggerations are right, if they exaggerate the right thing. Let us point to heaven with tusks and horns and fins and trunks and tails so long as they all point to heaven. The ugly animals praise God as much as the beautiful. The frog's eyes stand out of his head because he <b>is</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> heaven. The giraffe's neck is long because he is stretching towards heaven. The donkey has ears to hear--let him hear." ...|$|E
