5|$|Patton {{personally}} pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, {{and brought}} with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for {{other members of the}} 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it. Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to Général d'armée Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked Général de division Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> fear that he might meet a similar fate.|$|E

Please cite only version {{published}} in Analysis (online 2013) We <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> condemn lying {{more strongly than}} misleading and to condemn bullshit assertion less harshly than lying but more harshly than misleading. We each <b>have</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> mislead rather than make bullshit assertions, but to make bullshit assertions rather than lie. This is because these forms of deception damage credibility in different ways. We can trust the misleader to assert only what {{they believe to be}} true. We can trust the bullshitter not to assert what they believe to be false. We cannot trust the liar at all. 1 / 13 Successful lying and misleading are both forms of intentional deception by means of language. The liar deceives by false assertion, the misleader by false conversational implicature. I argue that society <b>has</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> respond with greater opprobrium to the liar than to the misleader, that each member of society <b>has</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> disdain lying more than mere misleading, and that each of us would be wise to avoid the greater dishonour of being branded a liar.

25|$|Jackson posted $3million bail, later {{requesting}} a reduced amount. The prosecution opposed this reduction, arguing that Jackson might relocate {{to another country}} as a fugitive and citing Andrew Luster as an example: Luster had fled to Mexico, notwithstanding his $1million bail bond. Many argued that Jackson <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be angered at the excessive bail, as Phil Spector had to pay only $1million in his murder trial. To some, the high amount also indicated racism. After Jackson's acquittal, the judge ordered that the bail be returned to Michael.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option {{ideals of}} {{political}} and economic distinctiveness that was briefly lost to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and distinctiveness of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau’s creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be optimistic in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau’s policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any potential growth beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half. Despite this setback, Canadian investment in the region remained high and the government of Canada remained committed to the pursuit of mutually beneficial relations between the two regions.|$|E
25|$|Paul IV's reforms did not abolish nepotism, however – 3 of the {{cardinals}} at the conclave were Paul's nephews, {{the most influential}} being Carlo Carafa {{and the other two}} being Diomede Carafa and Alfonso Carafa. On the model of pope Alexander VI (one of the Borgia popes, who had died on the same date as Paul 56 years earlier), Paul had tried to build up his family's power in Italy, mainly {{at the expense of the}} Colonna family, whose many lands (including the imperial Palia fiefdom) were seized and handed over to the Carafa family. Paul's nephews ruled even more brutally than him and abused their power so much that at one point Paul was forced to step in, stripping Carlo of power early in 1559. Carlo never regained his uncle's favour and after Paul's death he and Paul's other two cardinal-nephews <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> fear their enemies would now take revenge.|$|E

25|$|Lucas was a {{prime suspect}} {{in the killing of}} Rich. A few months later, in June 1983, he was arrested on charges of {{unlawful}} possession of a firearm by Texas Ranger Phil Ryan. Lucas reported that he was roughly treated by bullying inmates in prison and attempted suicide. Lucas claimed that police stripped him naked, denied him cigarettes and bedding, held him in a cold cell, and did not allow him to contact an attorney. After four days, Lucas confessed to the murder of Rich, which confession investigators <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe was genuine; in addition, he confessed to killing Powell. When he started confessing to numerous unsolved cases, he was initially credible; police knew that he had truthfully admitted committing two killings. Some interrogators, including Ryan, thought many of Lucas's confessions were made to get out of his cell and improve his living conditions. They did, however, treat dozens as potentially genuine.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Robert Foley {{wrote that}} Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) had {{recently}} been severely criticised by Martin Kitchen, who had written that Schlieffen was a narrow-minded technocrat, obsessed with minutiae. Horst Bucholz had called Moltke too untrained and inexperienced to understand war planning, which prevented him from having a defence policy from 1906 to 1911; it was the failings of both men, that caused them to maintain a strategy that was doomed to fail. Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke (the Younger) <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> retain Vernichtungsstrategie {{as the foundation of}} their planning, despite their doubts as to its validity. Schlieffen had been convinced that only in a short war was there the possibility of victory and that by making the army operationally superior to its potential enemies, Vernichtungsstrategie could be made to work. The unexpected weakening of the Russian army in 1904–1905 and the exposure of its incapacity to conduct a modern war was expected to continue {{for a long time and}} this again made a short war possible. Since the French had a defensive strategy, the Germans would have to take the initiative and invade France, which was shown to be feasible by war games, in which the French border fortifications were outflanked.|$|E

500|$|The {{indictment}} {{against the}} two board members was dropped in 1977, {{and only a}} single issue, regarding the disappearance of NOK1.8 million from the books though a cheque swindle, was retained against Tjøntveit. The long waiting time caused Verdens Gang to describe the case as a [...] "justice scandal." [...] The court case started at Oslo District Court on 13 November 1978. Only two of the seven counts were related to Trans Polar; the others regarded other business transaction undertaken by Tjøntveit, such as selling aircraft he did not own. During the court proceedings, the prosecutor withdrew all counts related to Trans Polar. Tjøntveit was acquitted on 30 November, but the court stated that the police <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> investigate the airline and had understanding of the long time frame, pointing {{to the fact that}} there were practically no accounts and difficulties interviewing the involved parties. The court also took into consideration that Tjøntveit was an aviator and had no education in management. Tjøntveit followed up by suing the state for NOK2.8 million in damages, but the case was dismissed by Oslo District Court in September 1979.|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she was tired and not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E
500|$|Minh Mạng disliked Duyệt {{because he}} was one of many {{high-ranking}} mandarins who opposed Gia Long's succession plan. Duyệt and many of his southern associates tended to be favourable to Christianity, and supported the installation of Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh's descendants. As a result, Duyệt was held in high regard by the Catholic community. Historian Mark McLeod said that [...] "As the head of a region enjoying substantial autonomy, Lê Văn Duyệt <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> prefer that the empire be ruled after Gia-long's death by an immature or malleable monarch." [...] According to McLeod, as Duyệt was not from a scholar-gentry background and lacked a classical Confucian education, he did not place a great emphasis on tradition and was more concerned with military needs, and that as a result, he would be more interested in maintaining strong relations with Europeans so that he could acquire weapons from them, rather than worrying about the social implications of Westernization. There was also speculation that Gia Long was worried that Cảnh's 18-year-old heir was too young and could have been manipulated, and that he would forget his Eastern roots, whereas the more mature Minh Mạng—aged 26—would not. Gia Long was {{aware of the fact that}} Catholic clergy were opposed to the installation of Minh Mạng.|$|E

500|$|Manning {{was subject}} to anxieties {{bordering}} on paranoia throughout her life. She <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be concerned about Reggie, however, who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German Lufthansa airline – Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to Axis countries. He arrived safely, however, bringing a rucksack, a suitcase full of books, but no appropriate clothes for work. Reggie relaunched his hectic social life, but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community, focussing instead on her writing. Nevertheless, this was a happy time for Manning; [...] "Romania is abroad," [...] said Manning, [...] "but Greece is home". Manning had her admirers, including Terence Spencer, a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Reggie was busy with other activities – he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in Friends and Heroes, the third book of The Balkan Trilogy. Soon after their arrival, Greece entered {{the war against the}} Axis. [...] In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces, by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans; in a later poem Manning recalled the [...] "horror and terror of defeat" [...] of a people she had grown to love. The British Council advised its staff to evacuate, and on 18 April Manning and Reggie left Piraeus for Egypt on the Erebus, the last civilian ship to leave Greece.|$|E
500|$|Shellenberger and {{his fellow}} {{bondholders}} <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> seek control of the railroad. After their failure to deliver control {{of the road to}} Langdon, he brought suit against them. In exchange for his dropping the suit, they agreed to lease the Altoona and Beech Creek to the Pittsburgh, Johnstown, Ebensburg and Eastern Railroad, a holding company formed by Langdon, on highly favorable terms. The new company was to operate the Altoona & Philipsburg Connecting, planning to convert to standard gauge and extend the two railroads to a junction at East Frugality, near Dougherty. The PJE would be extended further south through Ebensburg and then down to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Johnstown. During this period, the line was known as the [...] "Altoona Division" [...] of the PJE On December 17, 1898, Langdon chartered the Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal Railroad, which would extend the Altoona and Beech Creek from Juniata to a new terminal at 9th Street and 15th Avenue in Altoona. However, he was unable to carry out these plans, and his lease was invalidated on March 27, 1900. Through appeals and legal maneuvers, Langdon was able to hold out until December 27, 1901, when the Sheriff of Blair County ejected the PJE employees and returned the Altoona and Beech Creek to its stockholders. The Altoona and Beech Creek Terminal was dissolved in 1905–6.|$|E
500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he <b>had</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them to be hanged again. Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him {{to go along with the}} story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|E
