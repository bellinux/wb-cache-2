The court ruled against Maryland, and Chief Justice John Marshall, Hamilton's longtime Federalist ally, wrote the opinion, which stated that while the Constitution did not explicitly give permission to create a federal bank, it conferred upon Congress an <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> to do so under the Necessary and Proper Clause so that Congress could realize or fulfill its express taxing and spending powers.

5000|$|The {{holder of}} a legal {{mortgage}} also has a power of sale over the assets. Every mortgage contains an <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> of sale. [...] This <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> exists even if the mortgage is not under seal.

Neither <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> of sale requires a court order, although the court can usually also order a judicial sale. The secured party has a duty to get the best price reasonably obtainable, however, this does not require the sale to be conducted in any particular fashion (i.e. by auction or sealed bids). What the best price reasonably obtainable will be will depend upon the market available for the assets and related considerations. The sale must be a true sale - a mortgagee cannot sell to himself, either alone or with others, even for fair value; such a sale may be restrained or set aside or ignored. [...] However, if the court orders a sale pursuant to statute, the mortgagee may be expressly permitted to buy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Implied</b> <b>powers,</b> in the United States, {{are those}} powers {{authorized}} by the Constitution that, while not stated, seem to be <b>implied</b> by <b>powers</b> expressly stated. When George Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to defend {{the constitutionality of the}} First Bank of the United States against the protests of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for <b>implied</b> <b>powers.</b> [...] Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends. Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means which it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies. Hamilton noted that the [...] "general welfare clause" [...] and the [...] "necessary and proper clause" [...] gave elasticity to the constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed his Bank Bill into law.|$|R

The executive veto and the <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> of judicial review, which was later made explicit by the US Supreme Court, created further obstacles to absolute majority rule.|$|E
50|$|Consistent with Justice Wilson's explanation, {{the power}} to issue writs of certiorari is {{invested}} in the highest court of every Commonwealth jurisdiction, in some way, shape, or manner.

[...] The ICC deduced that if all charges must be reasonable, and Congress had not determined what was reasonable, then the ICC must determine which rates are reasonable, in order to perform its legal obligation {{to ensure that all}} rates would be reasonable and just. Therefore, they argued, the only reasonable interpretation of the statute was that Congress intended them to exercise the power to set rates.|$|E

50|$|Later, {{directly}} {{borrowing from}} Hamilton, Chief Justice John Marshall invoked the <b>implied</b> <b>powers</b> {{of government in}} the court decision of McCulloch v. Maryland.

50|$|Federalist {{policies}} {{called for}} a national bank, tariffs, and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the Jay Treaty negotiated in 1794. Hamilton developed the concept of <b>implied</b> <b>powers</b> and successfully argued the adoption of that interpretation of the United States Constitution. Their political opponents, the Democratic-Republicans led by Thomas Jefferson, denounced most of the Federalist policies, especially the bank and <b>implied</b> <b>powers,</b> and vehemently attacked the Jay Treaty as a sell-out of republican values to the British monarchy. The Jay Treaty passed, and the Federalists won {{most of the major}} legislative battles in the 1790s. They held a strong base in the nation's cities and in New England. After the Democratic-Republicans, whose base was in the rural South, won the hard-fought election of 1800, the Federalists never returned to power. They recovered some strength by their intense opposition to the War of 1812, but they practically vanished during the Era of Good Feelings that followed {{the end of the war}} in 1815.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the states}} were preexisting {{political}} entities, the U.S. Constitution {{did not need}} to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government. The federal government has certain express powers (also called enumerated powers) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In addition, the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the <b>implied</b> <b>power</b> to pass any law [...] "necessary and proper" [...] for the execution of its express powers. Other powers - the reserved powers - are reserved to the people or the states. The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819), amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War, and by some later amendments—as well as the overall claim of the Civil War, that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, world {{domination}} has been thought of {{in terms of}} a nation expanding its power to the point that all other nations are subservient to it.

However, domination can also be achieved by direct military force.
