5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the United States went to {{war against}} Mexico and sent a naval and land {{expedition}} to conquer Alta California. At first they had an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> of it capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For {{the next several months}} the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1 the Americans garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner's Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny's battered and blockaded command.|$|E

25|$|Roy Heffernan was {{a native}} Australian, born in Lithgow NSW, and was an avid {{weightlifter}} and bodybuilder in his teens. He was trained by his father, {{who was also a}} bodybuilder, and won the Mr. Australia title before making his wrestling debut at the age of twenty. Heffernan did not have an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> moving up the ranks in Australian pro wrestling, as the belief at the time was that a wrestler really had to go overseas to North America and learn to be a pro before the bookers would even consider moving them up the rankings of the promotion. After working on the lower cards in Australia, Heffernan left his home country in 1953 to come to America in the hopes of attaining more success there.|$|E
25|$|Cobb {{never had}} an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> as husband and father. His {{children}} {{found him to be}} demanding, yet also capable of kindness and extreme warmth. He expected his sons to be exceptional athletes in general and baseball players in particular. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. flunked out of Princeton (where he had played on the varsity tennis team), much to his father's dismay. The elder Cobb subsequently traveled to the Princeton campus and beat his son with a whip to ensure against future academic failure. Tyrus Raymond, Jr. then entered Yale University and became captain of the tennis team while improving his academics, but was then arrested twice in 1930 for drunkenness and left Yale without graduating. Cobb helped his son deal with his pending legal problems, but then permanently broke off with him. Even though Tyrus Raymond, Jr. finally reformed and eventually earned an M.D. from the Medical College of South Carolina and practiced obstetrics and gynecology in Dublin, Georgia, until his premature death at 42 on September 9, 1952, from a brain tumor, his father remained distant.|$|E
500|$|While Rodin was {{beginning}} to be accepted in France {{by the time of}} The Burghers of Calais, he had not yet conquered the American market. Because of his technique and the frankness of some of his work, he did not have an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> selling his work to American industrialists. [...] Fortunately, he came to know Sarah Tyson Hallowell (1846–1924), a curator from Chicago who visited Paris to arrange exhibitions at the large Interstate Expositions of the 1870s and 1880s. Hallowell was not only a curator but an adviser and a facilitator who was trusted by a number of prominent American collectors to suggest works for their collections, the most prominent of these being the Chicago hotelier Potter Palmer and his wife, Bertha Palmer (1849–1918).|$|E

500|$|Kennedy had an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> {{with his}} {{re-election}} to the Senate in 2000, as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur Jack E. Robinson III was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him. Kennedy got 73percent {{of the general}} election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with Libertarian Carla Howell. [...] During the long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000, Kennedy supported Vice President Al Gore's legal actions. After the bitter contest was over, many Democrats in Congress {{did not want to}} work with incoming President George W. Bush. Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation. Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the National Education Association did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education. The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002. [...] Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9billion short of the $29billion authorized. Kennedy said, [...] "The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not," [...] and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter. Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him. The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.|$|E

[...] In 1997, the Patriots still won the AFC East with a 10-6 record, but some key losses (including a loss to Parcells' Jets and a 4th-quarter collapse against the Pittsburgh Steelers) meant the team had to play in the wild card round in the playoffs. After having an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> with the Miami Dolphins 17-3 in Foxboro, the injury-plagued Patriots met the Steelers in Pittsburgh for a rematch of the previous year's divisional playoff.

[...] The series shifted to Maple Leaf Gardens for the next two games, and the teams once again split the games, as Toronto won the third game by a 3–1 score, and Chicago took the fourth game, holding off the Leafs for a 4–3 win. [...] The fifth game returned to Chicago, however, it was Toronto who took a 3–2 series lead, beating Chicago 4–2.

Amato is located {{to the north of the}} Catanzaro Isthmus at an altitude of 480 metres above sea level, between the gulfs of Sant'Eufemia and Squillace. This new town appears to have been built during the Middle Ages when the Normans came to the Amato Plains. In fact, thanks to the Normans the Amato Plains were fortified against pirate attacks. They built castles at Nicastro, Maida, Feroleto, Lamezia Terme and one also at Amato. Some of these Norman castles still exist today.

2500|$|The Papillon {{is a very}} {{intelligent}} and self-assured dog that has a very <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> learning new tricks. This dog can be sociable with children and strangers but is generally reserved around new people. [...] They can also be socialized to get along well with other pets, but care should be taken with rambunctious pets or cats with claws as they may injure it. If not properly socialized, Papillons can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Papillons may also be very playful and affectionate. Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy {{to keep up with}} active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. The Papillon can withstand heat but is more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.|$|E

2500|$|The MCC team left {{austerity}} Britain on 31 August 1946 on the SS Stirling Castle {{and sailed}} to Australia, arriving in Perth, Western Australia in September 1946, {{three weeks before}} their first scheduled match. They used this time to acclimatise and practice in the nets, but also to put on weight. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of rationing Australia was a 'land flowing with milk and honey' and Hammond promised his men [...] "the happiest six months of their lives". Everyone in the team put on weight, one [...] "consuming more in one day in Perth than his full weekly ration in London" [...] and the big bowlers Bill Voce and Dick Pollard adding up to two stone (28 lbs) in weight. [...] The team sent home food parcels from each city they visited and in general took an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> of it. A Saturday Night Club was organised in which the team would don bow-ties in MCC colours and sit down to a full dinner together. Aware that this would affect their mobility in the field physical training was organised, {{but it was not}} kept up. In general the atmosphere was that of a holiday, with the feeling that this was a goodwill tour to re-establish cricketing relations ten years after the last tour of Australia, and that a serious cricket would not begin until the 1948 Ashes series. The English and Australian press praised them for their sporting attitude and dwelt on the batting prowess of Wally Hammond, Len Hutton, Denis Compton and the bowling abilities of Alec Bedser and Doug Wright.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tourists}} {{came down}} with a bump when they met another first class team, in what was billed as a Mini-Test. Bill Lawry won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and must have been satisfied to see them out for 142 on the first day. The Test hopeful Alan Thomson took 6/80 and only John Edrich (44) offered any resistance. Lawry was bowled for a duck by John Snow, but Ian Redpath (68) and Paul Sheahan (71) added 89 for the third wicket before Sheadon ran out his partner and then himself. All the other batsmen got into double figures and Victoria declared for 304/8 {{at the end of}} the second day. Geoff Boycott and Brian Luckhurst both made 40 as they put on 79 for the first wicket, and Edrich 42. Colin Cowdrey made a slow 101 (he was likened to a beached whale), his only century of the tour. They reached 327/5, but the Victorian all-rounder Alan Sieler took his best first class haul of 4/18 with his slow left arm bowling and the MCC collapsed to 341 all out. Needing 180 to win Victoria had an <b>easy</b> <b>time</b> of it as Lawry (38) and Redpath (57) added 77 for the first wicket before Ray Illingworth had them both out. Alan Ward took 2/25 and Victoria lost two late wickets, but Paul Sheahan's 57 not out saw them home by 6 wickets. The Prime Minister of Australia Sir Robert Menzies and Premier of Victoria Sir Henry Bolte watched the match and Richard Whitington noted [...] "The Ashes have never looked safer". Ray Illingworth commented [...] "It is better to start at the bottom and work up from there".|$|E
