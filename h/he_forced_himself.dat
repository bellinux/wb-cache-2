5|$|Kiedis had {{remained}} sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, {{and that was}} beginning to grate on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a back brace {{for the next few}} shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E
25|$|Ellis had exaggerated {{fears of}} {{speaking}} {{in public and}} during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens {{over a period of}} a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.|$|E

500|$|Tchaikovsky {{allowed the}} first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the {{composer}} had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. <b>He</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, [...] "There were five of you; now there are six". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this {{so many times that}} he learned to perform it from memory.|$|E
500|$|Herbert Tremenheere Hewett {{was born}} at Norton Court in Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton on 25 May 1864, the only son of William Henry and Frances M Hewett. Although he was the couple's only son, they had at least four daughters; in 1871 two older sisters, Emily Louisa and Helen G {{are listed in the}} census, along with one younger sister, Florance Ethel. By 1891, Mary W is also listed as a younger sister, {{although}} by this date both older sisters are no longer registered at the address nor their father William Henry. He was initially educated at Hillside, Godalming where he was captain of the cricket and rugby teams. On leaving Hillside in 1879 he went to Harrow School. In 1881 he had a trial for the school cricket eleven mainly on the strength of his bowling, having taken all ten wickets for 22 runs in a house match. Hewett was part of the school's cricket first eleven in 1882 and 1883, and appeared in the annual contest against Eton College in both years, but did little on either occasion, his highest score being six, made in the first-innings in 1882. In all matches for Harrow he had a batting average of just 7.4 in 1883 and 9.5 in 1884 while his bowling average in 1884 was 32.10. Hewett also appeared in the school association football eleven in 1883. On completion of his studies at Harrow, he attended Trinity College, Oxford. In his reminiscences, W. G. Grace suggests that Hewett [...] "first won some little renown in Public School and 'Varsity cricket, {{but it was not until}} he joined Somersetshire that <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to a prominent place in County Cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had gotten}} his way, {{but he still}} {{understood}} that his troops were tired from the fighting in Shanghai. He therefore decided to advance slowly {{with the aim of}} securing the city within two months. Nevertheless, his subordinates refused to play along and instead raced with one another {{to be the first to}} Nanking. Matsui revised his plans only upon discovering that his own armies were well ahead of their scheduled operational targets. It is again argued that Matsui was unable to restrain the men under his command, and that, since Matsui was an elderly general pulled from retirement, most of his younger and brasher subordinates had little respect for his orders and assumed that he would be back in the reserves and shortly out of their way. Matsui's command problems were made further complicated by the fact that, between December 5 and December 15, he was frequently bedridden due to bouts of malaria, which he had first shown symptoms of on November 4. Though ill, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to press on with his duties, issuing orders from his sickbed. On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou in order to be closer to the frontlines, and on December 9 he ordered that a [...] "summons to surrender" [...] be dropped by airplane over Nanking. Because the Chinese Army defending Nanking did not respond, the next day Matsui approved an all-out attack on the city. The CCAA suffered significant casualties fighting along the mountainous terrain just north of the city because Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there to prevent any damage from coming to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Although the Chinese garrison defending Nanking collapsed under pressure of the Japanese attack within a few days, instead of formally surrendering the Chinese soldiers simply threw away their uniforms and weapons and then merged with the city's civilian population. The Japanese occupied Nanking on the night of December 12/13. Japanese soldiers in the city then massacred prisoners of war and engaged in random acts of murder, looting, and rape which are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E

2500|$|Joe Pesci didn't judge his {{character}} but found {{the scene where}} he kills Spider for talking back to {{his character}} hard to do, because he had trouble justifying the action until <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to feel the way Tommy did. Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because {{it was such a}} male-dominated cast, and she realized if she did not make her [...] "work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor". When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 June he {{shot down}} an Albatros D.III {{for his second}} victory and on the 9 June claimed a {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and an Albatros D.V but did not received credit. On 14 June he was sent home on leave owing to exhaustion and spent two weeks in England. On 12 and 13 July he received credits for a DFW C.V taking his total to four. On the later date he claimed a third DFW but was denied official recognition for lack of witnesses. Mannock went to view his third victory which had fallen in friendly lines. The observer had survived but the pilot was dead. <b>He</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to search the wreck and discovered the remains. The sight of a little black terrier mascot—dead in the observers seat—upset Mannock for days. He wrote in his diary, [...] "I felt exactly like a murderer." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{married on}} May 1, 1967, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and {{daughter}} Lisa Marie was born {{nine months later}} on February 1, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. In her book, Elvis and Me, Priscilla describes her daily life with her husband. She also says that Presley became fascinated with the occult and metaphysical phenomena and an addict to prescription drugs, which dramatically changed his personality from playful to being passive and introverted. The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, and divorced on October 9, 1973, agreeing to share custody of their daughter. When Priscilla left him for her karate teacher Mike Stone, the singer's [...] "ego was damaged beyond repair. ... Considering Presley's status as a universal sex symbol ..., it is unlikely {{he was able to}} put this situation in any type of perspective other than having not been 'man enough' to hold his woman." [...] According to Billy Stanley, he [...] "wasn't the same person" [...] as before. Priscilla says that she confronted Elvis about the divorce. According to her account, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> upon her; [...] "'This is how a real man makes love to a woman,' he said." ...|$|E

2500|$|In interviews, he also {{described}} {{the experiences of}} fear that were common among the soldiers, and lamented {{the way in which}} films portrayed combat experiences. When it came to cannon shells, for example, the impact was not immediate, but approached with a gradual and frightful sound. He referred to the chances of the shell exploding as the [...] "lottery of death." [...] While he remembers many soldiers turning to liquor to quell their fears, Orelli always refused it when offered. In order to mentally prepare himself for an attack, overcome this fear and keep a clear head, <b>he</b> <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to purge his mind of all thoughts of home and family. Orelli was eventually wounded in the right leg, an injury that ended his military career and sent him home. Despite having vivid memories of the war itself, he recalled little of the events immediately following his injury. During a confrontation with a group of Austrian soldiers, he was wounded in the leg and the left ear, a wound that was only a few inches away from being fatal. After being taken to a nearby farmhouse, he {{spent the rest of the}} war recovering from infection in hospitals, of which he remembered little.|$|E
