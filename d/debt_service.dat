5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

40|$|The article aims to {{investigate}} {{some of the}} important factors contributing to the fiscal deficit in Pakistan {{for the period of}} 1976 to 2010. International trade, economic growth, total <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and broad money supply are considered as foremost factors affecting fiscal deficit in Pakistan. The empirical findings reveal that only economic growth has an insignificant impact on fiscal deficit in the long run but has significant impact in the short run. Whereas, all other factors such as international trade, total <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and broad money supply affect fiscal deficit significantly in both short run {{as well as in the}} long run. Moreover, it is found that there exists univariate Granger causality which runs from economic growth to fiscal deficit, from total <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> to fiscal deficit, and there exists bivariate causality between money supply and fiscal deficit in the short run. Also, in the long run all the factors Granger cause to fiscal deficit. The study has also found the existence of joint causality among fiscal deficit, trade, economic growth, total <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and money supply. </p...|$|R
40|$|The study {{looks at}} the impact of {{external}} <b>debt</b> and <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> on economic growth. Issues of external debt {{and their impact on}} economic growth have been gaining considerable momentum in the past decades. Zimbabweâ€™s debt situation has been a major cause for concern and recent efforts have seen the country agree to an IMF Staff Monitored Programme to try and rid the economy of this debt. The study makes use of Granger Causality tests, and Vector Autoregression (VAR) analyses which employ the impulse response functions and variance decomposition analysis. Granger Causality tests show that there is uni-directional causal relationship between external debt and economic growth, whilst between <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and growth there is a bi-directional causal relationship. Findings from impulse response tests show that a negative relationship exists among the variables external <b>debt,</b> <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and growth. These findings are consistent with the Debt Overhang Theory. Estimates from variance decompositionshow that there are statistically significant relationships that exist between external <b>debt,</b> <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> and economic growth. Furthermore external debt impacts on investments and productivity thereby impacting directly and indirectly on economic growth...|$|R
5|$|To {{ameliorate}} {{the situation}} the old Republic maintained {{a policy of}} severe austerity during the century, especially economizing on its defense outlays (which in large part explains why its military and political role declined so much). Up to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War this policy succeeded in bringing down the level of debt, but this war brought a large uptick in the public debt: between 1780 and 1794 the province of Holland alone issued 120 million guilders of new bonds. In 1795, its total debt stood at 455 million guilders. To this should be added the debts of the United East India Company and its sister, the WIC, and the five Dutch Admiralties {{for a total of}} about 150 million guilders. The other provinces owed 155 million guilders. The grand total in 1795, {{at the beginning of the}} Batavian Republic, came to 760 million guilders; this imposed a <b>debt</b> <b>service</b> of 25 million guilders annually. The indemnity of the Treaty of The Hague immediately added 100 million guilders to this total, and the maintenance of the French army of occupation added about 12 million annually (while the other funding requirements of the republic added another 20 million annually). In 1814 the public debt stood at 1.7 billion guilders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{relationship between}} external debt and economic growth. Data collections are mainly secondary {{over the period}} of 1980 to 2010.

Collected data were regressed using OLS technique and Augmented Dickey Fuller to test for the stationarity of the variables. Findings indicate a negative relationship between external debt and economic growth while that of <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> conforms with the apriori expectation of positive relationship. Hence, it is therefore recommended that Nigeria has to narrow down its international trade {{in order to save}} its balance of payment (BOP) to meet <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> needs of the country.

40|$|Pakistan’s {{total debt}} has reached to 115 percent of GDP in 2001 [Pakistan (2001) ]; per capita debt {{exceeded}} per capita GDP. The outstanding stock of public debt was roughly 400 percent of government revenue in 1980 and it increased to 624 percent by mid- 2000 [Pakistan (2001) ]. It {{is the only}} country in South Asia, classified as “severely indebted low-income country” by the World Bank (2001). <b>Debt</b> <b>servicing</b> is more problematic than debt. It has been 2. 5 percent of GNP during seventies and increased to 3. 5 percent of GNP during eighties. In 2001, <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> consumes more than seventy percent government revenue and leaves less than thirty percent for every thing else [The News (2001) ]. This increase in <b>debt</b> and <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> has affected creditworthiness of the country and raised the concern about its future growth prospects. The deterioration in all the indicators, like debtexport ratio, debt-GDP ratio, <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> to GDP ratio etc. raised the risk of default and increased vulnerability of the country to external and internal shocks. One possible way out is the rescheduling of debt to minimise total loss to creditor countries as well as subside the burden of debtor country.

The variables used in the study included external public debt receipts, external public <b>debt</b> <b>servicing,</b> and exchange rate. The theoretical models adopted in the study were the monetary model of exchange rate determination and the monetary approach to international capital movements. The strategies for accomplishing stated objectives were specified to include the use of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) multiple regression and cointegration test, which would have helped in determining the short-run and long-run relationships, respectively, between the specified variables, based on secondary data sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Debt Management Office (DMO) statistical publications for the period under review. The findings of the study showed that external debt receipts and external <b>debt</b> <b>servicing</b> have positive short and long-run relationships with naira exchange rate fluctuations.
