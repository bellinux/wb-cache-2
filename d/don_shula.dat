5|$|Former Colts and Dolphins {{head coach}} <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> {{presented}} the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Colts after the game, and Peyton Manning was named MVP.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{approach}} influenced {{future generations}} of coaches down to the present day. Men he worked directly with, including <b>Don</b> <b>Shula,</b> Weeb Ewbank, Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh, all adopted his system to some degree.|$|E
5|$|Fed up {{with the}} {{attitude}} {{that he had to}} prove himself in the NFL, McKay once drunkenly needled <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> by saying, “I think pro coaches should have to prove themselves by winning four national championships in the colleges”. He later admitted to having ruffled some feathers in the NFL, but said, “it wasn’t as if they didn’t deserve it”.|$|E
50|$|Brudzinski played 125 {{games with}} 94 starts for <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> Dolphins from 1981 though 1989, {{recording}} 14½ sacks {{to bring his}} career total to 23½ to go with his nine interceptions.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Miami Dolphins {{season was}} the franchise's 30th {{season in the}} National Football League. This was coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> last season as head coach before retiring. They lost the AFC Wild Card Playoffs to the Buffalo Bills 37-22.|$|R
50|$|During {{practice}} {{the day before}} Super Bowl VII, the Dolphins' five foot seven, 150 pound kicker, Garo Yepremian, relaxed by throwing 30-yard passes to Dave <b>Shula,</b> <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> son. During the pre-game warmups, he consistently kicked low line drives and couldn't figure out why.|$|R
5|$|Kentucky's {{football}} program was overshadowed by its successful basketball program during Collier's tenure. Collier was also criticized for his poor recruiting skills, a crucial factor for college coaches. Many fans wrote {{the university to}} complain about him and his staff. Still, several future star coaches served as assistants under Collier at Kentucky, including <b>Don</b> <b>Shula,</b> Chuck Knox, Howard Schnellenberger and Bill Arnsparger. Standout players under Collier included All-Americans Lou Michaels and Schnellenberger.|$|E
5|$|Traditional rivals of the FIU Panthers include Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami. The Panthers {{football}} team competes {{in the annual}} Shula Bowl, a yearly football game played for the <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> Award against in-state rival Florida Atlantic University. Due to this competition in the Shula Bowl, the rivalry between the two schools has grown, with the rivalry extending into the men's baseball and basketball teams as well.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 19 head coaches for the Colts franchise. Keith Molesworth {{became the first}} coach of the Baltimore Colts in 1953, but he was reassigned to a {{different}} position with the team following the season. In terms of tenure, Weeb Ewbank has led the team for more games (112) and more complete seasons (nine) than any other head coach. He led the team to two of their NFL championships. Three Colts head coaches; Ewbank, <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> (3), and Ted Marchibroda, have been named {{coach of the year}} by at least one major news organization. Ewbank and Shula are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1978 and 1997 respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Shula {{family moved}} to Detroit in 1960 and Baltimore in 1963, {{following}} <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> career in the NFL. The family settled in Miami Lakes, Florida in 1970, where Dave Shula {{was a high school}} football and baseball player at Hollywood Chaminade High School.|$|R
50|$|The {{season ended}} with Super Bowl XXX, when the Dallas Cowboys {{defeated}} the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 at the Sun Devil Stadium. They {{became the first}} team in NFL history to win three Super Bowls in four years. This season was legendary Miami Dolphins head coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> last season as coach.|$|R
25|$|With {{the victory}} in the 2011 AFC Championship Game Brady and head coach Bill Belichick became the first quarterback-head coach {{combination}} to reach the Super Bowl five times, surpassing the record held by Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers' 1970s Super Bowl teams. Belichick tied Tom Landry for second most appearances {{as a head coach}} in the Super Bowl, behind only <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> six.|$|R
5|$|As {{a product}} tie-in with the 2005–2006 NFL season, Burger King {{introduced}} a 36 piece party pack as {{a limited time}} offer. This promotion was more general and featured the BK mascot, the Burger King, digitally superimposed into NFL game footage so appeared {{to be involved in}} the game. Some of the players the King replaced include Steve Young, Deion Sanders, and Moe Williams. He has also been depicted performing the Lambeau Leap and dumping Gatorade on the head of former Miami Dolphins head coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula.</b> The primary packaging was altered to include the NFL logo; the party pack designed to mimic the texture of a football, included the NFL logo and a humorous comment along the line of those found on BK packaging at the time.|$|E
5|$|As the stadium's {{construction}} got underway, the NFL {{began to}} search for an owner for the team, which the league decided would be an expansion franchise March 23, 1998. A litany of potential owners lined up, including Kosar and a group backed partly by HBO founder Charles Dolan, comedian Bill Cosby and former Miami coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula.</b> The ultimate winner was Al Lerner, the Baltimore man who had helped Modell in 1986 by buying a small stake in the Browns. A seven-member NFL expansion committee awarded the team to Lerner for $530 million in September 1998. Lerner, then 65 years old, had a majority share, while Carmen Policy, who helped build the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, owned 10% of the team and was to run football operations.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won every}} {{game in the}} 1948 season, a feat that went {{unmatched}} until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple <b>Don</b> <b>Shula)</b> did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC championship {{for the fourth time}} in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, {{due in part to the}} Browns' dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up a few good former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown's team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.|$|E
50|$|The 1976 Miami Dolphins {{season was}} the team's 11th, and seventh {{as a member}} of the National Football League (NFL). The Dolphins failed to improve on their {{previous}} season's output of 10-4, winning only six games. One of these wins came over their new in-state rivals, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — who proceeded to lose all 14 games that year. The 6-8 finish marked the first losing record of head coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> career.|$|R
5000|$|The Miami Dolphins chose Hampton in {{the first}} round (twenty-seventh pick overall) in the 1985 NFL Draft, and he played for coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> Dolphins for five years from [...] to [...] [...] Hampton started in thirty-three of the seventy games in which he played, and {{finished}} his career with 500 carries for 1,949 rushing yards and twenty-two touchdowns, 123 receptions for 954 receiving yards and six touchdowns, and ninety-six kickoff returns for 2,025 yards.|$|R
50|$|After {{suffering}} a losing season the previous season, the 1995 Bills won the AFC East, {{and made the}} playoffs for the seventh time in eight seasons. They defeated the Miami Dolphins in the Wild Card Game in <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> final game as an NFL head coach. The following week they lost to the eventual AFC Champions, the Pittsburgh Steelers. The playoff win over Miami represents the last time to date that the Bills have won a playoff game.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} a {{defensive}} struggle. At halftime, the Jets led 7–0 on a Matt Snell touchdown run; New York's defense frustrated Baltimore, and the Colts were scoreless despite repeated opportunities. Jim Turner added two field goals {{to make the}} score 13–0, and Colts coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> inserted Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas in Morrall's place. Unitas initially failed to move the Colts' offense, and Turner gave the Jets a 16–0 lead with his third field goal. Unitas managed to lead the Colts to a touchdown with less than four minutes left. A second drive (after a successful onside kick) fell short, and the Jets were able to run out the clock for a 16–7 victory, {{one of the greatest}} upsets in football history.|$|E
25|$|JCU plays football, {{lacrosse}} {{and soccer}} in <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> Stadium, named after alumnus and winningest coach in NFL history <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> '51. Shula {{contributed to the}} stadium's construction, as did former Washington Redskins star and JCU alumnus London Fletcher '98.|$|E
25|$|On December 23, 2007, with a {{win over}} the Houston Texans, Dungy won his 72nd game as Colts head coach, passing <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> to become the winningest coach in {{franchise}} history.|$|E
50|$|In Buffalo's {{first playoff}} game since losing the Super Bowl two seasons earlier, the Bills handled Miami easily. Although Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino {{completed}} 33 out of 64 passes for 422 yards, the Bills jumped to a 27-0 lead {{going into the}} fourth quarter, and rushed for an NFL playoff record 341 yards. It was {{the final game of}} <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> coaching career with the Dolphins. As of 2016, this was the last time that the Bills won a playoff game.|$|R
50|$|On October 2 {{history was}} made at Riverfront Stadium, when Dave Shula and the Bengals faced father <b>Don</b> <b>Shula’s</b> Miami Dolphins in the first father-son {{coaching}} match up in NFL history. The elder Shula would emerge victorious 23-7, as the Bengals {{were in the midst}} of a 0-8 start for the third time in four years. As of the 2016 season, the 1993 and 1994 Bengals are the most recent franchise to be the last winless NFL team in consecutive seasons.|$|R
50|$|Namath {{is known}} for boldly guaranteeing a Jets' victory over <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> NFL Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III (1969), then making good on his {{prediction}} with a 16-7 upset (the win remains the Jets' only Super Bowl championship). Already a celebrity, he was now established as a sports icon. He subsequently parlayed his notoriety into success with endorsement deals and as a nightclub owner, talk show host, pioneering advertising spokesman, theater, motion picture, television actor, and sports broadcaster. He remained a highly recognizable figure {{in the media and}} sports worlds nearly half a century after his brashness cemented his identity in the public mind.|$|R
25|$|Dan Reeves {{became the}} fourth head coach to lose four Super Bowls, joining Bud Grant, <b>Don</b> <b>Shula,</b> and Marv Levy. Reeves lost Super Bowls XXI, XXII, and XXIV while {{coaching}} the Broncos.|$|E
25|$|<b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> (born 1930), Former {{head coach}} and player with the Baltimore Colts, who also led the Miami Dolphins to the only perfect season in NFL history. Holds NFL record for most wins as a head coach.|$|E
25|$|The Dolphins {{made their}} final {{addition}} to the staff on February 4, hiring Dan Henning as offensive coordinator. Henning, who had most recently served as offensive coordinator for the Carolina Panthers from 2002 to 2006, had previous worked for the Dolphins under <b>Don</b> <b>Shula</b> as quarterbacks and wide receivers coach in 1979–1980.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} notable for {{featuring}} {{the coach of}} one team who had replaced the other as head coach; Patriots head coach Bill Belichick was hired in 2000 to replace Pete Carroll, {{who went on to}} become the coach of the Seahawks. This is only the fourth time this has occurred. The other three times were in Super Bowl III (Weeb Ewbank's New York Jets vs. Ewbank's former team, <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> Baltimore Colts), Super Bowl XXXIII (Dan Reeves's Atlanta Falcons vs. Mike Shanahan's Denver Broncos), and Super Bowl XXXVII (Jon Gruden's Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Gruden's former team, Bill Callahan's Oakland Raiders). The only previous time that the old coach's former team had won was in Super Bowl XXXIII.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} played on a wet, muddy field which largely negated the Jets' speed {{advantage}} at the skill positions, and emphasized the Dolphins' strengths; the Killer B's Defense and a solid power running attack. The Dolphins defense held Jets quarterback Richard Todd to only 15 of 37 completions for 103 yards and intercepted five of his passes. Dolphins linebacker A. J. Duhe led Miami with three interceptions, scoring a 35-yard touchdown and setting up the other Dolphins score in the 14-0 victory. Afterwards, the Jets complained about Dolphins coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> decision not to place the tarp over the Miami Orange Bowl's grass field before the game. The Dolphins completed a three-game sweep of the Jets with this victory, {{the first time this}} was accomplished in NFL history, and deepening the already bitter Dolphins-Jets rivalry.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Isaac Curtis rule" [...] {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the [...] "Mel Blount rule", which was a stricter revising of [...] "The Isaac Curtis Rule". Because Isaac Curtis had world-class speed, there weren't defensive backs that could keep up with Curtis and all teams would double and sometimes even triple cover him. In 1973 in his first year, the Bengals won the Central Division and faced the eventual Super Bowl Champions, the Miami Dolphins. <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> defensive backs didn't have the speed to cover Curtis and decided that he would have them push, bump, and hold him down the field. After that game, NFL defenses including the Steelers started doing the same thing to stop Curtis. Paul Brown wanted the rule changed, telling the NFL Competition Committee, [...] "What good is it for us to have performers, if they aren't allowed to perform." ...|$|R
25|$|Baltimore {{finished}} with a 9–3 record {{for the second year}} in a row in 1959 and repeated as NFL champions. The team's performance fell off in subsequent years, however, and Rosenbloom fired Ewbank after the 1962 season. He was replaced by former player <b>Don</b> <b>Shula,</b> who by then was a 33-year-old assistant with the Lions.|$|E
25|$|Madden's overall winning {{percentage}} including playoff games ranks second in league history. He won a Super Bowl {{and never had}} a losing season {{as a head coach}}. Madden had a winning record as a head coach against Tom Landry, <b>Don</b> <b>Shula,</b> Chuck Noll and Bud Grant, who are generally regarded as the top coaches of his era.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{struggled}} in Ewbank's first years as head coach, posting records of 3–9 in 1954 and 5–6–1 in 1955. In 1956, however, the team signed quarterback Johnny Unitas {{after he was}} cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Ewbank brought in Otto Graham to tutor Unitas, who complemented an improving team that included Berry, fullback Alan Ameche, halfback Lenny Moore and defensive back <b>Don</b> <b>Shula.</b>|$|E
50|$|Green was {{selected}} as the seventh overall pick of the first round by the Buccaneers in the 1981 NFL Draft. He was a 1982 All-Pro and 1983 All-Pro and was elected to the Pro Bowl twice in his career, in 1982 and 1983. Later in his career he suffered several injuries, including a car accident {{in the middle of the}} 1984 season for a fracture near the eye. He was traded to the Miami Dolphins in the middle of the 1985 season. In the 1985 season he was on to a career-high in sacks and ended the season getting 7.5 while playing all 16 games despite the mid-season trade. In Miami, Green played six more solid seasons before retiring. He was a member of <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> teams which were often playoff contenders and Green was a starter on those teams, racking up 7.5 sacks in 1989, to tie a career-high, for example.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first game}} in the series in the 1993 season, in Rich Stadium, saw an {{incident}} where Miami linebacker Bryan Cox gestured at Bills fans, having previously {{said that he would}} [...] "retire from football if I am ever traded up there." [...] Multiple Dolphins players later said the spectators responded in a similar fashion towards them. After a 22-13 Dolphins victory over the Bills, sportswriter Bill Plaschke called the game [...] "a considerable step toward making their rivalry the ugliest in the league". The teams met twice more in the playoffs during the 1990s. On December 30, 1995, Buffalo broke the league record for rushing yards in a game with 341, winning 37-22. This was Dolphins head coach <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> last {{game in the}} NFL. Three seasons later, the teams met at Pro Player Stadium on January 2, 1999 for their fourth playoff game of the decade, which the Dolphins won 24-17 after forcing five Bills turnovers. In regular season games during the decade, the Bills held a 10-8 win-loss advantage.|$|R
50|$|David Woodley {{started the}} team's first five games but despite wins over Buffalo, New England, and Kansas City the offense didn't move to <b>Don</b> <b>Shula's</b> liking so in Week Six hosting the Bills the rookie Marino started. Marino had {{completed}} two touchdown throws in relief of Woodley in a 27-14 {{loss to the}} Raiders and then replaced Woodley during a 17-7 loss to the Saints with a touchdown and an interception, so the game against Buffalo was the third of his career but his first start. The game {{proved to be a}} wild affair as Robb Riddick of the Bills fumbled the opening kickoff at their 17 but Marino was intercepted by Steve Freeman on the next play. The Bills clawed to a 14-7 halftime lead but the Dolphins behind Marino stayed toe to toe as Marino threw for 370 yards and four touchdowns while handing off to Mark Clayton on an option pass for a touchdown to Mark Duper. The Bills tied the game in the final seconds and two Uwe von Schamann field goal attempts missed before Joe Danelo ended the game in a 38-35 Bills win.|$|R
