5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E

The either physical (wind, water, sun, soil type) or biological (plant roots, insects, animals) environmental factors and the <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> induce post-mortem changes in teeth, which are relevant to forensic investigation in terms of estimating the post-mortem interval or of elucidating {{the conditions in which}} the body stood after death.

25|$|The <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> {{itself is}} called a Fourier transformation. Its output, the Fourier transform, is often given a more {{specific}} name, which depends on the domain and other properties of the function being transformed. Moreover, the original concept of Fourier analysis has been extended over time to apply {{to more and more}} abstract and general situations, and the general field is often known as harmonic analysis.

25|$|Thousands of men, {{women and}} {{children}} interned at prisoner of war camps were subjected to vivisection, often without anesthesia and usually ending {{with the death of}} the victim. Vivisections were performed on prisoners after infecting them with various diseases. Researchers performed invasive surgery on prisoners, removing organs to study the effects of disease on the human body. These were conducted while the patients were alive because it was feared that the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> would affect the results. The infected and vivisected prisoners included men, women, children, and infants.|$|E

25|$|Scavengers and {{carnivores}} such as wolves, dogs, cats, beetles, {{and other}} insects feeding on {{the remains of}} a carcass can make determining the time of insect colonization much harder. This is because the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> has been interrupted by factors that may speed up decomposition. Corpses with open wounds, whether pre or post mortem, tend to decompose faster due to easier insect access. The cause of death likewise can leave openings in the body that allow insects and bacteria access to the inside body cavities in earlier stages of decay. Flies oviposit eggs inside natural openings and wounds that may become exaggerated when the eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding.|$|E

At lower temperatures, however, the production rate of P atoms on Ta was higher than that on W, while that for Mo was lower, suggesting that the <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> are not thermal but catalytic.

40|$|By {{studying}} spectrochemically the <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> of carohemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and carboxyemoglobin in {{the presence}} of 1 -ascorbic acid and molecular oxygens the author obtained the following results. 1. In the case of carbohemoglobin besides tha already-known absorption peaks of 556 mμ and 430 mμ it shows another absoorption peak at 760 mμ, and its EmM is 1. 4 - 2. 0. 2. The absorption curve of the 670 mμ and 630 mμ substances at the time of deoxydation by sodium dithionite and causatic soda show the absorption peak at 618 mμ and 760 mμ. 3. The decomposition of caroxyhemoglobin takes similar <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> as taken by oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin, producing the 670 mμ and 630 mμ substances. In other words, it seems that caroxyhemoglobin is reduced to hemoglobin by liberating carbon monoxide and then it enters into <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes,</b> and its <b>decomposition</b> is extremely slow as compared with that of oxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. 4. CO-choleglobin is not an intermediate product of carboxyhemoglobin decomposition but it is produced at the time when choleglobin comes in contact with carbon monoxide. 5. CO-choleglobin is split into carbon monoxide and choleglobin {{in the presence}} of 1 -ascorbic acid and molecular oxygens...|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} traditional, in Mumbai and Karachi at least, for dead Parsis {{to be taken}} to the Towers of Silence where the corpses are quickly eaten by the city's vultures. The reason given for this {{practice}} is that earth, fire, and water are considered sacred elements which should not be defiled by the dead. Therefore, burial and cremation have always been prohibited in Parsi culture. The problem today, though, is that in Mumbai and Karachi the population of vultures has been drastically reduced due to extensive urbanization and the unintended consequence of treating humans and livestock with antibiotics, and the anti-inflammatory diclofenac, both of which harm vultures. As a result, the bodies of the deceased are taking much longer to decompose, and this has upset certain sectors of the community. Solar panels have been installed in the Towers of Silence to speed up the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process,</b> but this has been only partially successful. In Peshawar a Parsi graveyard was established in the late 19th century, which still exists and this cemetery is unique as there is no Tower of Silence and the community preferred to bury their dead. There is a debate raging in the Parsi community {{as to whether or not}} the prohibition on burials and cremations should be lifted.|$|E

Sets of wavelets are generally needed to analyze data fully. A set of [...] "complementary" [...] wavelets will decompose data without gaps or overlap so that the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> is mathematically reversible. Thus, sets of complementary wavelets are useful in wavelet based compression/decompression algorithms where it is desirable to recover the original information with minimal loss.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes,</b> {{digestion}} and composting, was compared {{on the quality}} of the final residue from two substrates: hay and straw. The digestion was done by using dwarf goats on digestion crates and the composting process was simulated in buckets. Composting was allowed to continue to the same level of organic matter loss as achieved in a digestibility trial. The results indicated that the pattern of biomass decomposition, as measured by the fibre analysis in the Goering and Van Soest method, was similar between both processes and substrates. Absolute amounts of acid detergent lignin (ADL) did not change significantly throughout both <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes,</b> but the quantity of other fibre components decreased. Chemically, the ADL fraction made up a large part of the humus in the soil and though the results were variable, they suggested that the initial ADL content of a substrate indicates its humus building capacity. Concerning the nitrogen fractions, however, there were larger differences between the <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> and substrates. Digestion left less nitrogen in the organic matter than composting, and the composting of straw even resulted in a net increase in nitrogen content...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} understand, and alter, the {{behaviour}} of wood in a fire, {{it is necessary}} to know in as much detail as possible about its <b>process</b> of <b>decomposition.</b> Such <b>processes</b> are often highly dependent on various parameters including changes to the gas composition (air, nitrogen, air/nitrogen, oxygen), temperature, heating rate, sample shape and sample size. The sensitivity to these parameters can help the analyst identify the <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> occurring, and provide them with significant clues to interpret the fire behaviour.|$|R
2500|$|According to the RCC, low ordered {{sites are}} small shaded streams where {{allochthonous}} inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers. [...] As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change. [...] Ample sunlight should reach {{the bottom in}} these systems to support significant periphyton production. [...] Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1nbsp&mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1nbsp&mm) to these downstream ecosystems. [...] Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity {{and a lack of}} substrate to support plants or periphyton. [...] Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing. [...] Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> and through lateral inputs from floodplains.|$|E
2500|$|This {{high rate}} of {{decomposition}} {{is the result of}} phosphorus levels in the soils, precipitation, high temperatures and the extensive microorganism communities. In addition to the bacteria and other microorganisms, there are an abundance of other decomposers such as fungi and termites that aid in the process as well. Nutrient recycling is important because below ground resource availability controls the above ground biomass and community structure of tropical rainforests. These soils are typically phosphorus limited, which inhibits net primary productivity or the uptake of carbon. The soil contains microbial organisms such as bacteria, which break down leaf litter and other organic matter into inorganic forms of carbon usable by plants through a process called decomposition. During the <b>decomposition</b> <b>process</b> the microbial community is respiring, taking up oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. The decomposition rate can be evaluated by measuring the uptake of oxygen. High temperatures and precipitation increase decomposition rate, which allows plant litter to rapidly decay in tropical regions, releasing nutrients that are immediately taken up by plants [...] through surface or ground waters. [...] The seasonal patterns in respiration are controlled by leaf litter fall and precipitation, the driving force moving the decomposable carbon from the litter to the soil. Respiration rates are highest early in the wet season because the recent dry season results in a large percentage of leaf litter and thus a higher percentage of organic matter being leached into the soil.|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{importance}} of litter diversity to <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> have examined effects of species richness, and have not considered the other important aspect of biodiversity, namely evenness (relative abundance of species). Using microcosms, we investigated how changes in species evenness and identity of litters (taken from a regenerating Betula pendula forest) affected <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes.</b> We showed that single litter species varied in their rate of decomposition (bilberry 44. 4 %, willow 49. 9 %, rowan 53. 7 % and birch 54. 8 % weight loss after 234 days). However, when in mixtures, changes in the evenness of these litters and the identity of the dominant species had no detectable effect on measures of decomposition such as weight loss (42. 6 – 56. 6 % after 234 days), microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen release. Dissolved organic nitrogen release was found to be significantly greater from high evenness litter mixtures, 0. 236 mg l− 1, than the single species treatments, 0. 145 mg l− 1, but only during the initial stages of the experiment. These results, therefore, provide no support for the idea that changes in evenness of litter inputs and the identity of dominant litters will affect <b>decomposition</b> <b>processes</b> and soil nutrient availability...|$|R
