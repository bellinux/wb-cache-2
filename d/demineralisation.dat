25|$|However {{oral hygiene}} is {{probably}} more effective at preventing gum disease (periodontal disease) than tooth decay. Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fueled acid <b>demineralisation</b> where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva {{have no access to}} remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise demineralised tooth like on other more accessible tooth surfaces. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90% of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Chewing fibre like celery after eating forces saliva inside trapped food to dilute any carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised tooth. The teeth at highest risk for carious lesions are the permanent first and second molars due to length of time in oral cavity and presence of complex surface anatomy.|$|E

50|$|Tooth {{demineralization}} is {{a chemical}} {{process by which}} minerals (mainly calcium) are removed {{from any of the}} hard tissues—enamel, dentine, and cementum. The process of demineralization begins at the crystal surface found inside the hard tooth tissue and may progress into cavitation unless arrested or overridden by remineralisation. The effect of <b>demineralisation</b> can be reversed if there is sufficient time to allow remineralisation to occur to counteract the acids in the oral cavity. Together, <b>demineralisation</b> and remineralisation contribute towards a dynamic process.|$|E

50|$|Fragoso, et al. (2011) found that {{applying}} fluoride paste on enamel surface after microabrasion {{process provides}} higher hardness & more enamel smoothness. in addition , Segura et al {{found that the}} treated enamel surface become more resistant to <b>demineralisation</b> than untreated enamel and less colonisation of bacteria occur.|$|E
50|$|Fissure {{sealants}} applied {{over the}} chewing surfaces of teeth, block plaque from being trapped inside pits and fissures. The sealants make brushing {{more effective and}} prevent acid <b>demineralisation</b> and tooth decay. A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates will reduce the buildup of plaque on teeth.|$|E
50|$|Tooth decay can {{be managed}} by modifying {{behaviour}} and controlling its causative factors, i.e. reducing the intake frequency of fermentable carbohydrates from food. This will reduce the chance of the dental biofilm developing into cariogenic biofilm. The bacteria in cariogenic biofilm produce organic acids when carbohydrates, especially sugar, are eaten. When enough acid is produced so that the pH goes below 5.5, the acid dissolves carbonated hydroxyapatite, {{the main component of}} tooth enamel, in a process known as <b>demineralisation.</b> After the sugar is gone, the mineral loss can be recovered—or remineralised—from ions dissolved in the saliva. Cavities result when the rate of <b>demineralisation</b> exceeds the rate of remineralisation and the latticework is destroyed, typically in a process that requires many months or years.|$|E
5000|$|Oral hygiene {{practices}} {{involve the}} mechanical removal of plaque from hard tissue surfaces [...] Cariogenic bacteria {{levels in the}} plaque determine whether caries will occur or not, therefore, effective removal of plaque is paramount. The removal of plaque inhibits <b>demineralisation</b> of teeth, and reversely increases opportunities for remineralisation.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{processing}} may {{be carried}} out. For example, cream {{has a tendency}} to produce oily globules (called [...] "feathering") when added to coffee. The stability of the cream may be increased by increasing the non-fat solids content, which can be done by partial <b>demineralisation</b> and addition of sodium caseinate, although this is expensive.|$|E
50|$|Saliva, {{being the}} watery {{substance}} that constantly circulates the oral cavity, {{is capable of}} impacting both the remineralisation and <b>demineralisation</b> processes. It is secreted through the major salivary glands including the parotid, submandibular, sublingual and Von Ebner's glands {{as well as the}} hundreds of minor salivary glands that are located throughout the oral cavity.|$|E
50|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the implementation}} of artificial fluoride in public water supplies with the intentions to halt the progression of dental diseases. Fluoride {{has the ability to}} interfere with the <b>demineralisation</b> and remineralisation process that occurs on the tooth surface and improves the mineral intake when the pH level may reduce below the neutral pH level.|$|E
50|$|This is {{relatively}} straightforward. It involves correction of the acidemia with oral sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate or potassium citrate. This will correct the acidemia and reverse bone <b>demineralisation.</b> Hypokalemia and urinary stone formation and nephrocalcinosis {{can be treated}} with potassium citrate tablets which not only replace potassium but also inhibit calcium excretion and thus do not exacerbate stone disease as sodium bicarbonate or citrate may do.|$|E
5000|$|Nanofiltration is a {{relatively}} recent membrane filtration process used most often with low total dissolved solids water such as surface water and fresh groundwater, {{with the purpose of}} softening (polyvalent cation removal) and removal of disinfection by-product precursors such as natural organic matter and synthetic organic matter.

50|$|Decay is {{the process}} or result of <b>demineralisation</b> (softening) of an area of dental tissue, {{creating}} a decayed lesion on the tooth. The process of restoring decay begins with {{an analysis of the}} decayed lesions together with their location and severity, with particular regard to the state of reversibility. Where decay is reversible, it is referred to as non-cavitated decay, where healing is possible by the hardening process of remineralisation. Where a cavity has formed from excessive <b>demineralisation,</b> the decay has reached {{the point of no return}} where the tooth structure has been lost and the decay is permanent and non-reversible. In this situation of cavitated decay, the cavity will have to be filled to restore the tooth. Minimal intervention dentistry is focused on filling only cavitated regions, leaving non-cavitated decay to be remineralised, thus restoring the tooth while removing as little of the tooth structure as possible, enhancing the strength and aesthetics of the restoration. Classifications of the location and severity of decay are made in order to establish guidelines for suitable treatment methods.|$|E

50|$|Remineralization {{occurs on}} a daily basis after an acidogenic {{challenge}} through the presence of saliva. Calcium, phosphate and fluoride found in saliva, are required for effective remineralization and maintenance of the enamel surface integrity. Therefore, as saliva is rich in calcium and phosphate ions, It can act as a natural buffer to neutralise acid and allow demineralised tooth tissues to be remineralised. If there is reduced saliva flow or reduced saliva quality, this will increase the risk of demineralization and create the need for treatment in order to prevent <b>demineralisation</b> progression.|$|E

5000|$|Sialogogues {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of xerostomia (the subjective feeling of having a dry mouth), to stimulate any functioning salivary gland tissue to produce more saliva. Saliva has a bactericidal effect, so when low levels of it are secreted, the risk of caries increases. Not only this, but fungal infections such as oral candidosis also can be a consequence of low salivary flow rates. The buffer effect of saliva is also important, neutralising acids that cause tooth enamel <b>demineralisation.</b> The following are used in dentistry to treat xerostomia: ...|$|E
50|$|Demineralization {{is caused}} by {{bacteria}} excreting acids {{as a product of}} their metabolism of carbohydrates. By reducing the intake frequency of carbohydrates in an individual's diet, remineralization is increased and demineralization is decreased. Diet control is an important aspect in promoting remineralization to occur naturally. A loss of the tooth enamel structure and cavitation may occur if the demineralization phase continues {{for a long period of}} time. This disturbance of <b>demineralisation</b> caused by the presence of fermentable carbohydrates continues until the saliva has returned to a normal pH and had sufficient time to penetrate and neutralize the acids within any cariogenic biofilm present.|$|E
5000|$|Isomaltulose is ‘kind to teeth’. The {{fermentation}} {{of carbohydrates}} by oral bacteria {{is responsible for}} the formation of dental plaque and oral acids, which initiate tooth <b>demineralisation</b> and dental caries (tooth decay). Isomaltulose largely resists hydrolysis, digestion, and fermentation by oral bacteria and is the first carbohydrate of its kind to show negligible acid production on teeth by pH telemetry. The evidence is strong and has provided the basis for ‘toothkind’ claims approved by both the Food and Drug Administration in the USA [...] and the European Authorities with a respective claim following a positive opinion from the European Food Safety Authority in the EU.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>demineralisation</b> process continues, the pH of {{the mouth}} becomes more acidic which {{promotes}} the development of cavities. Dissolved minerals then diffuse out of the tooth structure and into the saliva surrounding the tooth. The buffering capacity of saliva greatly impacts the pH of plaque surrounding the enamel, thereby inhibiting caries progression. Plaque thickness {{and the number of}} bacteria present determine the effectiveness of salivary buffers. The high salivary concentrations of calcium and phosphate which are maintained by salivary proteins may account for the development and remineralisation of enamel. The presence of fluoride in saliva speeds up crystal precipitation forming a fluorapatite- like coating which will be more resistant to caries.|$|E

Prior to his work {{there had been no}} commercially viable desalination process that involved continuous flow; plants had to be stopped and emptied of accumulated salt from time to time, such as when a passenger liner using desalination was in port. Silver performed a thermodynamic analysis showing that reverse osmosis and multistage flash were the optimal processes. As reverse osmosis technology was inadequate in the mid-20th century he designed multistage flash equipment, of which the first large-scale installation was in Kuwait.|$|E

50|$|Sucrose (table sugar) is most {{commonly}} associated with cavities. The amount of sugar consumed {{at any one time}} is less important than how often food and drinks that contain sugar are consumed. The more frequently sugars are consumed, the greater the time during which the tooth is exposed to low pH levels, at which point <b>demineralisation</b> occurs (below 5.5 for most people). It is important therefore to try to encourage infrequent consumption of food and drinks containing sugar so that teeth have a chance to be repaired by remineralisation and fluoride. Limiting sugar-containing foods and drinks to meal times is one way to reduce the incidence of cavities. Sugars from fruit and fruit juices, e.g., glucose, fructose, and maltose can also cause cavities.|$|E
50|$|To prevent <b>demineralisation</b> in the mouth, it is {{important}} for an individual to ensure they have a well-balanced diet, including foods containing calcium and foods that are low in acids and sugars. The individual should have a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes, seeds and nuts. Sugary snacks including lollies, fruit bars, muesli bars, biscuits, dried fruit, cordials, juices and soft drinks should be limited as they contribute to dental decay and dental erosion. Additionally, excessive starchy foods (such as bread, pasta, and crackers), fruits and milk products consumed frequently can cause the growth of dental plaque and bacteria. Therefore healthy eating, healthy drinking and proper maintenance of oral hygiene {{is the best way to}} promote and maintain sound tooth structure for an individual.|$|E
50|$|Glass ionomer cement is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} prevention of dental caries. This dental material has good adhesive bond properties to tooth structure, allowing it to form a tight seal between the internal structures of the tooth and the surrounding environment. Dental caries is caused by bacterial production of acid during their metabolic actions. The acid produced from this metabolism results in the breakdown of tooth enamel and subsequent inner structures of the tooth, if the disease is not intervened by a dental professional, or if the carious lesion does not arrest and/or the enamel re-mineralises by itself. Glass ionomer cements act as sealants when pits and fissures in the tooth occur and release fluoride to prevent further enamel <b>demineralisation</b> and promote remineralisation. Fluoride can also hinder bacterial growth, by inhibiting their metabolism of ingested sugars in the diet. It does this by inhibiting various metabolic enzymes within the bacteria. This leads to a reduction in the acid produced during the bacteria’s digestion of food, preventing a further drop in pH and therefore preventing carious.|$|E
