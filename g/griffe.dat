5|$|These two styles do not exhaust all of {{the musical}} {{influences}} found in the British metal music of the early 1980s, because many bands were also inspired by progressive rock (Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, Blitzkrieg, Demon, Saracen, Shiva, Witchfynde), boogie rock (Saxon, Vardis, Spider, Le <b>Griffe)</b> and glam rock (Girl, Wrathchild). Doom metal bands Pagan Altar and Witchfinder General were {{also part of the}} NWOBHM and their albums are considered among the best examples of that already established subgenre.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} nine years, Méliès {{personally}} created over 30 new illusions that brought more comedy and melodramatic pageantry to performances, much like those Méliès had seen in London, and attendance greatly improved. One of his best-known illusions was the Recalcitrant Decapitated Man, in which a professor's head is cut off {{in the middle of}} a speech and continues talking until it is returned to his body. When he purchased the Théâtre Robert-Houdin, Méliès also inherited its chief mechanic Eugène Calmels and such performers as Jehanne D'Alcy, who would become his mistress and, later, his second wife. While running the theatre, Méliès also worked as a political cartoonist for the liberal newspaper La <b>Griffe,</b> which was edited by his cousin Adolphe Méliès.|$|E
25|$|For {{historical}} {{reasons the}} structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues. The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at <b>Griffe</b> Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.|$|E

2500|$|There was one {{independent}} area {{within the}} Wapentake, <b>Griffe</b> Grange, near Brassington, {{held by the}} Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at {{the dissolution of the}} religious houses by Henry VIII. The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them. Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at Elton, where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him [...] "to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton. This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.|$|E

Homberg and Jousselin call 'the law of Home Rule!'), fortified his house, and went armed. Probably there really were designs to kidnap him, just as a regular plot was laid for the kidnapping of de la Motte, at Newcastle, after the affair of the Diamond Necklace.
