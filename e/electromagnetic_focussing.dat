40|$|Introduction The {{inspection}} of weldments in critical pressure vessel joints {{is a major}} concern in the nuclear power industry. Corrosive environments can speed the fatigue process and access to the critical area is often limited. Eddy current techniques have begun to be used to help overcome these obstacles [1]. As direct contact and couplants are not required, remote areas can be inspected by simply snaking an eddy current coil into the intake tube of the vessel. The drawback of the eddy current method has been the high sensitivity to small changes in the conductivity and permeability of the test piece which are known to vary at weldments [1]. The flaw detection mechanism of the flux <b>focusing</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> probe can help alleviate these difficulties and provide a unique capability for detecting longitudinal fatigue cracks in critical tube structures.

40|$|The Courant-Snyder theory gives a {{complete}} {{description of the}} uncoupled transverse dynamics of charged particles in <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>focusing</b> lattices. In this paper, the Courant-Snyder theory is generalized {{to the case of}} coupled transverse dynamics with two degrees of freedom. The generalized theory has the same structure as the original Courant-Snyder theory for one degree of freedom. The four basic components of the original Courant-Snyder theory, i. e., the envelope equation, phase advance, transfer matrix, and the Courant-Snyder invariant, all have their counterparts, with remarkably similar expressions, in the generalized theory presented here. In the generalized theory, the envelope function is generalized into an envelope matrix, and the envelope equation becomes a matrix envelope equation with matrix operations that are noncommutative. The generalized theory gives a new parametrization of the 4 D symplectic transfer matrix that has the same structure as the parametrization of the 2 D symplectic transfer matrix in the original Courant-Snyder theory. All of the parameters used in the generalized Courant-Snyder theory correspond to physical quantities of importance, and this parametrization can provide a valuable framework for accelerator design and particle simulation studies. A time-dependent canonical transformation is used to develop the generalized Courant-Snyder theory. Applications of the new theory to strongly and weakly coupled dynamics are given. It is shown that the stability of coupled dynamics can be determined by the generalized phase advance developed. Two stability criteria are given, which recover the known results about sum and difference resonances in the weakly coupled limit...|$|R
