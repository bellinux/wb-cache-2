5|$|South-pointing chariot: Although {{the claim}} of Wei Dynasty {{mechanical}} engineer and statesman Ma Jun (fl. 220–265) that the south-pointing chariot was first invented by the mythological Yellow Emperor are dubious, his south-pointing chariot was successfully designed and tested in 255 AD with many later models recreated in subsequent dynasties; this device was a wheeled vehicle with differential gears that ensured a mounted wooden figurine would always point in the southern direction {{no matter how the}} vehicle turned, in essence a non-magnetic compass. The Book of Song written in the 6th century states that the device was successfully reinvented by the mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429–500) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479). The Japanese historical text Nihon Shoki, compiled by 720, states that the device was crafted and presented as a gift to Emperor Tenji (661–672) on two different occasions (658 and 666) by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) Chinese Buddhist monks Zhi Yu and Zhi You. The wheeled vehicle device was described in intricate detail in the historical text covering the Song Dynasty (960–1279), i.e. the Song Shi (compiled 1345); for example, it revealed the number of gear teeth on each mechanical gear wheel, the diameter of each gear wheel, and how these <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were properly positioned.|$|E
25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|E

25|$|The {{machinery}} differs if the windmill is {{used for}} other applications than milling grain. A drainage mill uses another set of <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> on the bottom end of the upright shaft to drive a scoop wheel or Archimedes' screw.

25|$|Type 57s used a twin-cam 3,257cc engine {{based on}} that of the Type 49 but heavily {{modified}} by Jean Bugatti, unlike the single cam engines of the Type 49 and earlier models. The engines of the Type 50, 51 used bevel gears {{at the front of}} the engine to transmit power from the crankshaft, whereas the Type 57 used a train of spur gears at the rear of the engine, with fiber <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> on the camshafts to achieve more silence in operation.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} incline {{was put to}} work, one of the <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> in the {{mechanism}} fractured. However, it proved possible to operate {{one side of the}} incline, of course without the benefit of the counterbalancing, the steam engines taking the whole of the load of the ascending caisson. This was done {{for the rest of the}} autumn; even with this serious temporary limitation, 30 boats a day were taken up, a total of 1124 including a few descending, until the beginning of November when the dry season ended.|$|E
25|$|The basic design, {{common to}} both models, {{was that of}} a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction with side-by-side seating for two in a fully enclosed cabin. The main <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> of the undercarriage were retractable, and the tailwheel was steerable. The aircraft structure incorporated a framework built up of welded steel tube which extended lengthwise from the engine firewall {{to the rear of the}} cabin, and spanwise from one undercarriage well to the other. Around this framework was a conventional, monocoque fuselage. The MAC-125 was powered by a single 125-hp engine while the MAC-145 production model had a 145-hp engine instead and a larger tail fin.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version had two cabane struts of long chord length supporting the upper wing. Four similar type interplane struts were used between the upper three wings, {{all of which}} had ailerons. The bottom wing had a shorter span with pairs of struts and cut outs for the landing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> Because the axle was the same height as the lower wing, the tailskid was very tall to prevent that wings trailing edge from contacting the ground. When tested in mid 1916 the aircraft had difficulty taking off due to shallow wing incidence and displayed dangerous tendencies {{because of a lack}} of yaw control and a major redesign was required.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{powerful}} horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus supporting the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses.|$|R

25|$|On 5 November 1997, after {{numerous}} attempts to shake free the jammed {{main landing gear}} of an Airbus A340-300 (G-VSKY) failed, the aircraft en route from Los Angeles to Heathrow, made an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport. The aircraft sustained major damage to the undersides of engines one, two and four, which made contact with the runway surface during landing. The runway surface was also damaged and several runway lights were broken as the right main landing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> broke up during the deceleration. The aircraft was evacuated safely. Two crew members and five passengers sustained minor injuries during the evacuation. The damaged aircraft was repaired after the incident and was retired from the Virgin Atlantic fleet in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The SOCATA TBM is a single-engined turboprop-powered low-wing monoplane, {{capable of}} seating {{a maximum of}} seven people. It is {{composed}} mainly of aluminium and steel construction, but with the tail surfaces built of Nomex honeycomb. The wing features a very effective Fowler flap, comprising 80 per cent of the trailing edge's span, {{for the purpose of}} lowering the aircraft's stall speed. The TBM 700 is outfitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear arrangement, newer models feature stronger main landing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> and tougher tyres. The TBM 900 model features automatic torque limiting for “set and forget” power management, which is of particularly use during takeoffs; according to Aviation Week, while this function does reduce the high workload associated with managing the PT6A engine, it is not as capable as a full FADEC arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic Loom was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power loom. It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate the loom it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the loom are connected via crankshaft and <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> Because the loom is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain loom. The cast metal chair, manufactured along with the loom, can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver treadles the loom.|$|E

25|$|Gears {{inside a}} {{windmill}} convey {{power from the}} rotary motion of the sails to a mechanical device. The sails are carried on the horizontal windshaft. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron poll end (where the sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron. The brake wheel is fitted onto the windshaft between {{the front and rear}} bearing. It has the brake around the outside of the rim and teeth {{in the side of the}} rim which drive the horizontal gearwheel called wallower on the top end of the vertical upright shaft. In grist mills, the great spur wheel, lower down the upright shaft, drives one or more stone nuts on the shafts driving each millstone. Post mills sometimes have a head and/or tail wheel driving the stone nuts directly, instead of the spur gear arrangement. Additional <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> drive a sack hoist or other machinery.|$|E

500|$|The MiG-1 was a low-wing {{monoplane}} with a tailwheel undercarriage {{of mixed}} construction. Due to shortages of light alloys, the rear fuselage {{was made from}} wood, but the front fuselage, from the propeller {{to the rear of}} the cockpit, was a welded steel tube truss covered by duralumin. The bulk of the wing was wooden, but the center section was all-metal with a steel I-section main spar. The wing used a Clark YH profile. It was evenly tapered with rounded tips and the outer wing panels had 5° of dihedral. All three landing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> retracted hydraulically; the main units inwards into the wing center section. The cockpit was situated well aft, which seriously limited forward vision when landing and taxiing. The AM-37 engine was not yet available and the less powerful V-12 Mikulin AM-35A had to be substituted. It had six exhaust ejectors, one for each pair of cylinders, that provided some additional thrust. It drove a VISh-22Ye controllable-pitch propeller [...] in diameter. The air intakes for the supercharger were in the wing roots and the oil cooler was on the port side of the engine cowling. The radiator was underneath the cockpit. Armament included two fuselage-mounted [...] ShKAS machine guns and one [...] UBS machine gun.|$|E
