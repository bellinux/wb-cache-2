Across the continent, female Aboriginal children, some {{as young}} as three years of age, were employed as domestic servants. Male Aboriginal children, mostly aged between ten and twelve years, <b>labored</b> predominantly <b>in</b> the burgeoning pastoral industry. A substantial number of Aboriginal children were also employed in the pearling and beche-de-mer (sea cucumber) industries off the coasts of Queensland and Western Australia. There are also accounts of Aboriginal children working as guides and interpreters, on the gold fields, as errand boys, as laborers, in circuses, and as jockeys. Although {{it is apparent that}} large numbers of Aboriginal children worked for Europeans in colonial Australia, {{it was not until the}} sweeping social changes of the 1960 s that historians began to consider the experiences of Aboriginal workers. Until recently, however, very little attention has been paid to the employment of Aboriginal children. This void is attributable to the disregard that Australian historians have generally shown toward children and childhood. Since the turn of the millennium, though, this historiographical trend has started to change, with greater numbers of historians recognizing the importance of Aboriginal child <b>labor</b> <b>in</b> Australia 2 ̆ 7 s past.

During emergencies and extreme events of natural or manmade origin <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> sites, saving <b>labors</b> lives is the primary objective. Therefore, the contractors are required to establish effective emergency plans which have to be improved to aid for rapid egress from construction sites. To support emergency evacuation planning, {{it is critical to}} estimate labor evacuation times during project execution. This paper presents a framework that utilizes building information modeling (BIM) and computer simulation to plan the evacuation of <b>labors</b> <b>in</b> <b>construction</b> sites during project execution and to visualize evacuation times of labors at emergency conditions at any time from project duration. The proposed framework utilizes MassMotion software as the simulation platform that enables predicting the labor evacuation times under various conditions. In addition, the evacuation time calculated from computer simulation is used to develop and evaluate the plan. A case study is worked out to demonstrate a simulation of emergency evacuation from a housing building during its construction to demonstrate the use of the proposed framework. Finally, the paper presents the simulation results of <b>labors</b> evacuation <b>in</b> the housing building construction sites...|$|R
