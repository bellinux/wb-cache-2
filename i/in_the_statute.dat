5|$|Only {{two people}} were ever {{degraded}} – Lord Cochrane in 1813 and General Sir Eyre Coote in 1816, both for political reasons, rather {{than any of the}} grounds given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute.</b> Lord Cochrane was subsequently reinstated, but Coote died a few years after his degradation.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} devolved {{arrangements}} of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently colonise North Wales instead. The remaining royal family of Llwelyn and Dafydd was crushed and their lands divided amongst major English nobles. The governance of Wales was reformed, and the arrangements set out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3March 1284. Wales {{was divided into}} counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west: Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting {{the import of}} foreign books to also prohibit the import of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Frauds was {{originally}} enacted, the sections of, and the clauses of section 4 of, that Act were not numbered. They were numbered when the Act was republished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statutes</b> at Large. <b>The</b> <b>Statute</b> at Large, Cambridge Edition published <b>in</b> 1770 divided <b>the</b> Act into 25 sections. The {{section on the}} sale of goods was section 17. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statutes</b> of <b>the</b> Realm published <b>in</b> 1818, <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Frauds was divided into 24 sections. The section {{on the sale of}} goods became section 16. This article uses the same numbering system as <b>the</b> <b>Statutes</b> of <b>the</b> Realm.|$|R

5|$|As simple {{ultra vires}} {{concerns}} the exact powers conferred upon government ministers and statutory bodies, statutory interpretation {{is arguably the}} most important exercise the courts need to engage in to determine the scope of powers laid out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute.</b> Hence, the cases decided are fact-specific and depend upon each court's interpretation of the relevant statute, making success of the judicial review somewhat unpredictable. The UK case of Attorney General v. Fulham Corporation (1921), illustrates this concept. The defendant was a statutory body establishing washhouses and baths for residents who could not afford their own washing facilities. When it subsequently established a laundry service, the defendant was declared to have acted ultra vires since its statutory purpose was not to carry on a business. Even though the business was carried out at a substantial loss, the statute in question did not give the defendant such a power to do so. Accordingly, the plaintiff was entitled to succeed.|$|E
5|$|In 1414, {{six years}} before the Treaty of Troyes, a statute of Henry V of England gave {{directions}} to the goldsmiths {{in terms of the}} troy pound. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used for weighing metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower pound in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, in a {{district}} court case, Deady {{ruled in favor of}} Marcus Neff in a lawsuit against Sylvester Pennoyer concerning unpaid legal fees to John H. Mitchell and a sheriff's auction of Neff's land to Pennoyer. The case would become the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision of Pennoyer v. Neff that helped define the law of personal jurisdiction. In 1885, Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon, though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds. Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar.|$|E

5|$|In February 1995, SINTEF {{handed over}} a report {{ordered by the}} {{commission}} which revealed several absent safety procedures in Widerøe. The report {{was based on a}} recommendation by the International Civil Aviation Organization to take into consideration the organizational structure the aircraft operate within when investigating aviation accidents. In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and next of kin needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays. Similar delays had occurred after Partnair Flight 394 in 1989, which had resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>statute</b> of limitations having come into effect by the time the report was published. A temporary report was presented to the survivors and next of kin on 20 March 1996; the report laid the responsibility for the accident on the airline. The final report was published on 10 July 1996 and laid the responsibility for the accident on the company and its operating routines. The report contained 26 recommendations for improvements for the company. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority decided in September 1997 not to charge Widerøe for the accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings of}} England and the Welsh princes had vied {{for control of}} North Wales since the 1070s and the {{conflict}} had been renewed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales {{for the second time}} during his reign in 1282. Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward decided to permanently colonise North Wales and provisions for its governance were set out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Statute</b> of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west, Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey. New towns with protective castles were established at Caernarfon and Harlech, the administrative centres of the first two shires, with another castle and walled town built in nearby Conwy, and plans were probably made to establish a similar castle and settlement near the town of Llanfaes on Anglesey. Llanfaes was the wealthiest borough in Wales and largest in terms of population, an important trading port and on the preferred route from North Wales to Ireland. The huge cost of the building the other castles, however, meant that the Llanfaes project had to be postponed.|$|E
