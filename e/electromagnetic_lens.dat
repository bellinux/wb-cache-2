5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a typical electron-beam processing device are illustrated in the figure. An electron gun (consisting of a cathode, grid, and anode) is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam. A magnetic optical (focusing and deflection) system is used for controlling {{the way in which}} the electron beam impinges on the material being processed (the [...] "workpiece"). In operation, the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode (grid and anode) configuration used. The electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground-plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage (gun operating voltage) being applied to the cathode. This use of a direct high voltage to produce a high-energy electron beam allows the conversion of input electrical power to beam power at greater than 95% efficiency, making electron-beam material processing a highly energy-efficient technique. After exiting the gun, the beam passes through an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lens</b> and deflection coil system. The lens is used for producing either a focused or defocused beam spot on the workpiece, while the deflection coil is used to either position the beam spot on a stationary location or provide some form of oscillatory motion.|$|E

The transmission electron microscope (TEM) uses <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> to efficiently focus electrons and can provide direct images with atomic (< 0.2  nm) resolution. Besides image formation, electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and x-ray emission spectroscopy are routinely carried out in the TEM, adding to its analytical power.

Inherent aberrations of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> and other instrumental factors affect the structure factors, however, resulting in decreased accuracy in the determined three-dimensional reconstruction.

However, the use of very large antenna arrays brings new issues, such as the significantly increased hardware cost and signal processing cost and complexity. In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and yet reduce its cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system design by integrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna array, termed <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lens</b> antenna (ELA). An ELA has the capability of focusing the power of any incident plane wave passing through the EM lens to a small subset of the antenna array, while the location of focal area {{is dependent on the}} angle of arrival (AoA) of the wave. As compared to conventional antenna arrays without the EM lens, the proposed system can substantially reduce the number of required radio frequency (RF) chains at the receiver and hence, the implementation costs. In this paper, we investigate the proposed system under a simplified single-user uplink transmission setup, by characterizing the power distribution of the ELA as well as the resulting channel model. Furthermore, by assuming antenna selection used at the receiver, we show the throughput gains of the proposed system over conventional antenna arrays given the same number of selected antennas.

30|$|For {{the various}} {{placement}} strategies discussed thus far, the placement precision is, at best, {{determined by the}} precision with which the templates (physical, molecular, or electrostatic) are defined on the substrate. Recently, {{there has been a}} lot of effort to develop new strategies that enable placement with much higher precision than the templates are defined [206]. These strategies have a common theme, which may be termed “focused placement”, since the nanoscale building blocks are guided or focused onto targeted locations via electrostatic or mechanical forces. An analogy may be found in the operation of an electron microscope, where electron beam can be focused with sub-nanometer resolution although the guiding <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> are defined on the centimeter scale. In this section, we will review some recent advances in this approach including (1) electrostatic funneling, (2) directed assembly using molecular gradient patterns, (3) electrodynamic focusing of charged aerosols, and (4) guided placement combining capillary effect and electrostatic forces. In addition, precision placement of nanoparticles utilizing polymer micelles via template-assisted placement will be presented. Although this scheme might not be considered as truly focused placement, we will discuss this approach in this section because the nanoparticle placement is confined to a small area in the center of a template, allowing precision placement using much coarser templates.|$|R

40|$|Planar <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> {{like the}} Rotman lens are {{attractive}} candidates for beambeam forming networks forming networks {{because of their}} high bandwidth of operation and their capability to form multiple beams at lower cost as comparable electronic phase shifting networks. The principles of Rotman lenses have been studied for several decades and examples have been successfully built using different technologies, including parallel plate cavities fed by rectangular waveguides or microstrip lines on dielectric substrate. Due to the true time delay nature of Rotman lenses they theoretically exhibit extremely large bandwidth. However, lenses with rectangular waveguides as ports suffer from propagation of higher order modes inside the waveguide which limits the bandwidth to less than one octave in practical applications. Higher order waveguides, e. g. single or double ridged waveguides, allow for the propagation of a transversal electromagnetic (EM) mode and thus incorporate a larger bandwidth. But the symmetric nature of the TEM mode {{and the presence of}} the ridge complicate integration in the lens. The proposed paper outlines the design of a novel feed network based on higher order waveguides suited for multi- octave operation in Radar or Electronic Support Measures (ESM) applications.

40|$|Electron {{crystallography}} {{has evolved}} {{as a powerful}} method for structural characterization {{of a wide range}} of materials. It has two significant advantages over other methods for structure determination, e. g. X-ray diffraction. Electrons interact much more strongly with matter compared to X-rays and they can be focused by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>lenses</b> to form images with atomic resolution. These advantages make electron crystallography a unique tool for characterization of crystalline materials suffering from small crystal size and complex or disordered structures.      Zeolites are a class of microporous materials with significance in several applications. They often possess complex and disordered structures, which demand large efforts in the structure determination.      Over the last years, two new electron crystallographic methods have been developed; the rotation electron diffraction (RED) and the structure projection reconstruction from a through-focus series of high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images. In this thesis, they will be applied for structure determination of four new zeolite structures, including EMM- 25 and EMM- 23 with two ordered structures, and ITQ- 39 and ITQ- 38 with disordered structures. Each of the structure solutions have different challenges to overcome. The high silica borosilicate EMM- 25 was solved by the RED method. The aluminosilicate EMM- 23 was solved by a combination of HRTEM and RED. The structure solution of two materials with disordered structures, ITQ- 39 and ITQ- 38, will be described. For materials containing disorders, structure projection images are of utmost importance.      Furthermore, the mesoporosity inside hierarchically porous ZSM- 5 crystals was studied by a combination of focused ion beam (FIB) and HRTEM imaging.
