Like the 11-cell, it is also universal, being the only polytope with hemi-dodecahedral <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> hemi-icosahedral vertex figures.

40|$|Purpose This study {{examined}} bivariate, unique, and multivariate associations between psychopathy <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> other Personality Disorders (PDs). Method 76 incarcerated males were assessed with clinical interviews measuring psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) {{was used to}} examine multivariate associations between dimensional scores of psychopathy <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> other PDs. Results Preliminary analyses of bivariate and partial associations revealed that much of the covariation between psychopathy and PD traits reflected shared variance among psychopathy <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> among PD traits. After controlling for the shared variance, unique relationships were limited to positive relationships between Narcissistic PD <b>and</b> interpersonal <b>facet</b> <b>and</b> between Paranoid PD <b>and</b> antisocial <b>facet</b> ratings. Canonical Correlation Analysis yielded two pairs of functions that explained the shared variance between psychopathy and PDs. In the first pair of functions, elevations on the interpersonal <b>and</b> antisocial <b>facets</b> were associated with symptoms of Paranoid, Narcissistic, Histrionic, and Antisocial PDs. In the second pair of functions, high levels of the antisocial <b>facet</b> <b>and</b> low levels of the interpersonal facet were related to Borderline PD. Conclusion Results suggest that associations between psychopathy and DSM- 5 PDs go beyond established links with Antisocial and Narcissistic PDs to include associations with Histrionic, Borderline, and Paranoid PDs.

40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that one can obtain <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> valid inequalities for the {{knapsack}} polytope by lifting simple inequalities associated with minimal covers. We study the complexity of lifting. We show that recognizing integral lifted facets or valid inequalities can be done in O(n 2) time, even if the minimal cover from which they are lifted is not given. We show that the complexities of recognizing nonintegral lifted <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> valid inequalities are similar, respectively, to those of recognizing general (not necessarily lifted) <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> valid inequalities. Finally, we show that recognizing valid inequalities is in co- NPC while recognizing facets is in Dn. The question of whether recognizing facets is complete for Dn is open...|$|R

25|$|There {{are several}} older {{modified}} brilliant cuts of uncertain age that, while no longer widely used, are notable for history's sake. They are all round in outline and modify the standard round brilliant by adding <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> changing symmetry, either {{by dividing the}} standard facets or by placing new ones in different arrangements. These cuts include: the King and Magna cuts, both developed by New York City firms, with the former possessing 86 <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> 12-fold symmetry and the latter with 102 <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> 10-fold symmetry; the High-Light cut, developed by Belgian cutter M. Westreich, with 16 additional facets divided equally between the crown and pavilion; and the Princess 144, introduced in the 1960s, with 144 <b>facets</b> <b>and</b> 8-fold symmetry. Not {{to be confused with}} the mixed Princess cut, the Princess 144 cut makes for a lively stone with good scintillation; the extra facets are cut under the girdle rather than subdivided. The extra care required for these sub-girdle facets benefits the finished stone by mitigating girdle irregularity and bearding (hairline fracturing).|$|R
