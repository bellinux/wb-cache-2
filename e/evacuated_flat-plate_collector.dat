For the direct integration of solar collectors into the building facade, a simple collector-facade model has been used (TRNSYS) while indirect integration with a naturally ventilated air gap between collector and facade has been investigated with a newly developed collector-facade model representing the air flow in the gap induced by wind or buoyancy (TRNFLOW).

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} in evacuated-tube solar collectors with heat-pipe absorbers is {{compared with that}} for similar collectors with flow-through absorbers. In systems that produce hot water or other heated fluids, the heat-pipe absorber suffers a heat transfer penalty compared with the flow-through absorber, {{but in many cases}} the penalty can be minimized by proper design at the heat-pipe condenser and system manifold. The heat transfer penalty decreases with decreasing collector heat loss coefficient, suggesting that evacuated tubes with optical concentration are more appropriate for use with heat pipes than <b>evacuated</b> or non-evacuated <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collectors.</b> When the solar collector is used to drive an absorption chiller, the heat-pipe absorber has better heat transfer characteristics than the flow-through absorbers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic simulation {{model of a}} novel prototype of a 6 kWe solar power plant. The system {{is based on the}} coupling of innovative solar thermal collectors with a small Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), simultaneously producing electric energy and low temperature heat. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the solar collector field, which is based on stationary <b>evacuated</b> <b>flat-plate</b> solar thermal <b>collectors</b> capable to achieve the operating temperatures typical of the concentrating solar thermal collectors. The solar field consists of about 73. 5 m 2 of <b>flat-plate</b> <b>evacuated</b> solar <b>collectors,</b> heating a diathermic oil up to a maximum temperature of 230 °C. A diathermic oil storage tank is employed in order to mitigate the fluctuations due to the variability of solar energy availability. The hot diathermic oil exiting from the tank passes through an auxiliary gas-fired burner which provides eventual additional thermal energy. The inlet temperature of the diathermic oil entering the ORC system varies {{as a function of the}} availability of solar energy, also determining an oscillating response of the ORC. The ORC was simulated in Engineering Equation Solver (EES), using zero-dimensional energy and mass balances. The ORC model was subsequently implemented in a more general TRNSYS model, including all the remaining components of the system. The model was used to evaluate the energy and economic performance of the solar CHP system under analysis, in different climatic conditions. The results show that the efficiency of the ORC does not significantly vary during the year, remaining always close to 10 %. On the other hand, the efficiency of the solar collectors is very high in summer (> 50 %) and significantly lower during the coldest winter days (down to 20 %). Pay-back periods are extremely attractive in case of feed-in tariffs (about 5 years), whereas the profitability of the system is scarce when no public funding is available. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, in order to determine the combination of system/design parameters able to maximize the thermo-economic performance of the system. It was found that the system may be economically feasible for the majority of locations in the Mediterranean area (pay-back periods around 10 years), whereas the profitability is unsatisfactory for Central-Europe sites...|$|R

40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} {{of the performance of}} a solar <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector</b> operating in nonboiling, boiling, and superheated regimes is presented. The performance of the collector under these single and multiphase conditions is governed by the axial fractional channel lengths of the subcooled (nonboiling) and the superheated regions. The overall thermal loss coefficient, the dimensionless capacitance rate, and collector efficiency factors for various collector operating regions are defined. A new "Generalized Heat Removal Factor," Fs, and a new overall thermal loss coefficient, UL, for <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collectors</b> under any operation mode are developed. The thermal efficiency a <b>flat-plate</b> <b>collector,</b> whether under nonboiling, boiling, or superheated conditions, is evaluated using, Fs and UL.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{simulation}} {{model of a}} novel solar heating and cooling system based on innovative high temperature flat plate evacuated solar thermal collector is presented. The system configuration includes: <b>flat-plate</b> <b>evacuated</b> solar <b>collectors,</b> a double-stage LiBr-H 2 O absorption chiller, gas-fired auxiliary heater, a closed loop cooling tower, pumps, heat exchangers, storage tanks, valves, mixers and controllers. The novelty of this study lies in the utilization of <b>flat-plate</b> stationary solar <b>collectors,</b> manufactured by TVP Solar, rather than concentrating ones (typically adopted for driving double-stage absorption chillers). Such devices show ultra-high thermal efficiencies, even at very high (about 200 °C) operating temperatures, thanks to the high vacuum insulation.

The design of a solar energy system is generally concerned with obtaining maximum efficiency at minimum cost. The aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} design tool for predicting the performance of a <b>flat-plate</b> solar <b>collector.</b> A very detailed thermal analysis of a <b>flat-plate</b> solar <b>collector</b> was carried out to predict the thermal performance. The analysis is based on the established theory about flat-plate solar collector: the radiation absorption, heat loss from the collector, and temperature distribution on the plate. The calculation of useful energy and top heat loss from the collector is based on the aperture area to make a more accurate prediction of collector performance. The net-radiation method was employed to obtain the radiation component of top heat loss from the general collector cover system. The correlation for natural convection heat transfer between the covers and between the plate and cover was selected with the consideration of the low conductivity of plastics. The semi-gray radiation model was adopted to determine the optical properties of the collector cover and absorber plate. Results comparing the design tool calculations with experiments showed good agreement. The collector tests were performed by Florida Solar Energy Center.
