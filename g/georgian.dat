5|$|<b>Georgian</b> scripts {{are unique}} in their {{appearance}} and their exact origin {{has never been}} established; however, in strictly structural terms, their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, {{with the exception of}} letters denoting uniquely <b>Georgian</b> sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, <b>Georgian</b> is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are currently obsolete in that language. The number of <b>Georgian</b> letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. The Mingrelian language uses 36, 33 of which are current <b>Georgian</b> letters, one obsolete <b>Georgian</b> letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan. That same obsolete letter, plus a letter borrowed from Greek (making 35 letters total), are used in writing the Laz language. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses <b>Georgian</b> letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete <b>Georgian</b> letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels.|$|E
