5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form intimate relationships with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else when the weather <b>is</b> <b>nice,</b> but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit {{comes out of his}} body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E

25|$|This series {{expansion}} is extremely useful in solving partial differential equations. In this article, {{we will not}} be concerned with convergence issues; it <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to note that all Lipschitz-continuous functions have a converging Fourier {{series expansion}}, and nice enough discontinuous functions have a Fourier series that converges to the function value at most points.|$|E

25|$|Note: Taking {{the trace}} {{tells you that}} only closed orbits contribute, the {{stationary}} phase approximation gives you restrictive conditions each time you make it. In step 4 it restricts you to orbits where initial and final momentum are the same i.e. periodic orbits.

25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the foul line. A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E

[...] The adaptation includes twelve songs of various styles.|$|E

Originally, she had made his speech more of a supportive pep talk; however one of those acquaintances said that would not happen: [...] "o-one in that world <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to each other ... There's no reason to be, and they don't have time." [...] she quoted him as saying.|$|E
