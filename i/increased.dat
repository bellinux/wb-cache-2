40|$|Abstract- Thin mono-layer {{polypropylene}} (PP) {{films were}} produced {{to study the}} effects of processing parameters. Main difference in the crystalline structure of the PP films is considered to be caused by the orientation of the crystal blocks. As the temperature <b>increases,</b> film thickness decreases.

As the temperature <b>increases,</b> tear strength of the films <b>increases</b> in MD but decreases in CD. Tear strength <b>increases</b> in CD with <b>increasing</b> SMS. As WS <b>increases,</b> tear strength in MD decreases. As the temperature <b>increases,</b> tensile strength <b>increases</b> in MD.
