25|$|A <b>flushometer,</b> or royal <b>flushometer</b> is a water {{pressure}} system that uses an inline handle to flush toilets and urinals. By using pressurized water {{directly from the}} supply line, there is a faster recycle time between flushes. The <b>flushometer</b> is still in use today in homes and public restrooms around the world. The <b>flushometer</b> was invented in 1906 by American businessman and inventor William Elvis Sloan.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>flushometer</b> models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve {{allowing}} mains-pressure water to flow directly into the toilet bowl or urinal. Other <b>flushometer</b> models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual <b>flushometer</b> to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|In America, the chain-pull indoor toilet was {{introduced}} in the homes of the wealthy and in hotels, soon after its invention in England in the 1880s. Flush toilets were introduced in the 1890s. William Elvis Sloan invented the <b>Flushometer</b> in 1906, which used pressurized water directly from the supply line for faster recycle time between flushes. The <b>Flushometer</b> is still in use today in public restrooms worldwide. The vortex-flushing toilet bowl, which creates a self-cleansing effect, was invented by Thomas MacAvity Stewart of Saint John, New Brunswick in 1907. Philip Haas of Dayton, Ohio, made some significant developments, including the flush rim toilet with multiple jets of water from a ring and the water closet flushing and recycling mechanism similar to those in use today.|$|E

50|$|A <b>flushometer</b> {{is usually}} {{installed}} in a commercial setting, as it provides a high-pressure and better-performing wash and flush than a normal gravity toilet.However, a <b>flushometer</b> requires that the building have a larger supply line than is normally found in small to medium residential buildings, and therefore such buildings typically use tank-type toilets.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded by William Elvis Sloan in Chicago, Illinois in 1906 with the {{introduction}} of the Royal <b>flushometer,</b> a valve to release a measured amount of water to flush a urinal or toilet. Initial sales were very poor: only a single Royal model <b>flushometer</b> was sold in 1906, and two were sold in 1907. Fortunately, in 1908, the company sold 150 units. Initially, potential customers were wary of adjusting to his invention. Even some plumbing fixture manufacturers wouldn't sell their products if they were furnished with Sloan's flushometers. However, the original 1906 design has proven so reliable that as of 2012, parts are still available to repair any <b>flushometer</b> ever made.|$|E

50|$|William Elvis Sloan I (October 1867 - June 25, 1961) {{invented the}} <b>Flushometer</b> {{flushing}} mechanism for toilets and urinals. It is installed {{in millions of}} commercial, institutional and industrial restrooms worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The {{company is}} {{producing}} the dual-flush Uppercut <b>flushometer</b> {{with a green}} handle. Pressing the lever down produces a regular 1.6-gallon flush, while lifting the lever up produces a 1.1 gallon flush.|$|E

50|$|Public toilets {{by their}} nature see heavy usage, {{so they may}} rely on a <b>flushometer</b> with a {{stronger}} and louder flush than a home toilet. Some high-vandalism settings, such as beaches or stadiums, will use metal toilets. Public toilets generally contain several of the following fixtures.|$|E
50|$|New toilets {{that use}} similar pressure-assist {{technology}} {{along with a}} bowl and trapway designed to enhance the siphon effect use only 0.8 gal L per flush, or 0.5 gal L / 0.95 gal L for dual flush models.

50|$|In {{addition}} to its flush valves based on diaphragm technology, Sloan also introduced piston-type flushometers, including the Crown and the GEM 2. A special piston-type <b>flushometer,</b> called the Naval, was built for marine applications. In 1976, Sloan introduced the Optima line of sensor-activated flushometers (the first few were installed at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport); battery-powered equivalents under the name Optima Plus followed in 1991. Sloan also now has solar-powered models with a battery back-up that operate using any artificial or natural light source.|$|E
5000|$|Experiments to test {{bioaerosol}} production usually involve seeding {{a toilet}} with bacteria or virus particles, or fluorescent microparticles, and then testing for their presence on nearby surfaces {{and in the}} air after varying amounts of time. [...] The amount of bioaerosol varies {{with the type of}} flush toilet. Older wash-down toilet designs produce more bioaerosol than modern siphoning toilets. [...] Among modern toilets, bioaerosol production increases as qualitative flush energy increases, from low-flush gravity-flow toilets common in residences, to pressure-assisted toilets, to <b>flushometer</b> toilets often found in public restrooms.|$|E

40|$|Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is {{developing}} a computer model and spreadsheet tool for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to help estimate the water savings attributable to their WaterSense program. WaterSense has developed a labeling program for three types of plumbing fixtures commonly used in commercial and institutional settings: <b>flushometer</b> valve toilets, urinals, and pre-rinse spray valves. This National Water Savings-Commercial/Institutional (NWS-CI) model is patterned after the National Water Savings-Residential model, which was completed in 2008. Calculating the quantity of water and money saved through the WaterSense labeling program requires three primary inputs: (1) the quantity of a given product in use; (2) {{the frequency with which}} units of the product are replaced or are installed in new construction; and (3) the number of times or the duration the product is used in various settings. To obtain the information required for developing the NWS-CI model, LBNL reviewed various resources pertaining to the three WaterSense-labeled commercial/institutional products. The data gathered ranged from the number of commercial buildings in the United States to numbers of employees in various sectors of the economy and plumbing codes for commercial buildings. This document summarizes information obtained about the three products' attributes, quantities, and use in commercial and institutional settings that is needed to estimate how much water EPA's WaterSense program saves...|$|E
