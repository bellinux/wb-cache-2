5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management.

The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{velocity}} of dripline <b>flushing</b> in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems affects system design, cost, management, performance, and longevity. A 30 ‐day field {{study was conducted}} at Kansas State University to analyze the effect of four targeted <b>flushing</b> velocities (0. 23, 0. 30, 0. 46, and 0. 61 m/s) for a fixed 15 min duration of <b>flushing</b> and three <b>flushing</b> frequencies (no <b>flushing</b> or <b>flushing</b> every 15 or 30 days) on SDI emitter discharge and sediments within the dripline and removed in the <b>flushing</b> water. At {{the end of the}} field experiment (371 h), the amount of solids carried away by the <b>flushing</b> water and retained in every lateral were determined as well as laboratory determination of emitter discharge for every single emitter within each dripline. Greater dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities, which also resulted in greater <b>flushing</b> volumes, tended to result in greater amounts of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water, but the differences were not always statistically significant. Neither the frequency of <b>flushing</b> nor the interaction of <b>flushing</b> frequency and velocity significantly affected the amount of solids in the <b>flushing</b> water. There was a greater concentration of solids in the beginning one‐third of the 90 m laterals, particularly for treatments with no <b>flushing</b> or with slower dripline <b>flushing</b> velocities. As <b>flushing</b> velocity and concurrently <b>flushing</b> volume increased, there was a tendency for greater solids removal and/or more equal distribution within the dripline. At the end of the field study, the average emitter discharge as measured in the laboratory for a total of 3970 emitters was 0. 64 L/h. which was significantly less (approximately 2. 5 %) than the discharge for new and unused emitters. Only six emitters were nearly or fully clogged, with discharges between 0 % and 5 % of new and unused emitters. <b>Flushing</b> velocity and flushin...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be <b>flushed</b> into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often fatal to sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings <b>flushed</b> into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Attention {{to water}} quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a {{widespread}} algal bloom occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered {{to be the}} result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were <b>flushed</b> into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys periphyton, one of the basic building blocks of marl in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with peat; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive cattails that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of phosphorus by 1992.|$|E
5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being <b>flushed</b> into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system.

40|$|Hydraulic <b>flushing</b> is {{the most}} widely used method for {{sediment}} removal in sewer.
