5|$|The {{army was}} well {{organised}} {{and this was}} the reason for PulakeshinII's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatabala when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were in the}} heart of the North East coal field, which at the time of their opening <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> collieries. Coal was delivered straight to the stations by rail. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway was used for the South station, where 22railway sidings were built. Trains could only enter the sidings when travelling in a westerly direction.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by {{a large percentage of the}} male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it always}} <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> competitors, Standard Oil {{gradually}} gained dominance of oil refining and sales as {{market share in}} the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E

25|$|By 347 AD, oil was {{produced}} from bamboo-drilled wells in China. Early British explorers to Myanmar documented a flourishing oil extraction industry based in Yenangyaung that, in 1795, <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> hand-dug wells under production. The mythological {{origins of the}} oil fields at Yenangyaung, and its hereditary monopoly control by 24 families, indicate very ancient origins.|$|E

25|$|McCarron {{was elected}} secretary-treasurer of the Southern California Council of Carpenters in 1987. He quickly reorganized the union, a move {{which became a}} {{hallmark}} of his later career as international union president. At the time, the Southern California carpenters' union <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> mostly autonomous local unions which managed their own affairs (some well, some not), set their own work rules, competed with one another for jobs, and ran their own hiring halls. The district council had little power. Employers, however, {{wanted to work with}} just the district council, one set of rules and one wage structure.|$|E
25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|Cao Chun and his elder full brother, Cao Ren, {{were younger}} second cousins of Cao Cao. Their {{grandfather}} Cao Bao (曹襃) and father Cao Chi (曹熾) {{served in the}} government of the Eastern Han dynasty. Their father died when Cao Chun was 13 years old, so Cao Chun and Cao Ren lived with another family. They inherited their family fortune when they became older; they were wealthy and <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> servants and retainers. Cao Chun was known for being a strict, rule-abiding and fair leader among his followers. His fellow townsfolk regarded him highly. A well-read man who respected scholars, Cao Chun was also popular among the literati, many of whom flocked to him and became his retainers.|$|E

25|$|In August 1914, the Belgian Army used dogs to {{pull their}} Maxim Guns on wheeled {{carriages}} and supplies or reportedly even wounded in their carts. The use of dogs {{for this purpose}} ceased {{with the advent of}} trench warfare after the first two months of the conflict. The French had 250 dogs at the start of World War I. The Dutch army copied the idea and <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> dogs trained and ready by the end of World War I (the Netherlands remained neutral). The Soviet Red Army also used dogs to drag wounded men to aid stations during World War II. The dogs were well-suited to transporting loads over snow and through craters.|$|E
25|$|Electric Pencil, {{released}} in December 1976, {{was the first}} word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based word processors running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated word processors, and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|E
25|$|Climate is a {{key factor}} that has been studied in the colony {{productivity}} of P. snelleni. Since there is always one founding queen in a P. snelleni nest, the denominator of colony productivity is always one. Productivity was found to vary drastically {{with a couple of}} very large nests that were found in Kanto, Japan. These nests <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> cells in comparison to the usually 100 cells. In these nests, there was a female-biased sex ratio, which lines up with the resource availability hypothesis. This hypothesis states that colonies with better resources should be more heavily female based. The numbers of first brood workers in these nests were not greater than other nests, but there were a lot more females, so the sex ratio was heavily female.|$|E

25|$|In 1841, Jardines had 19 {{intercontinental}} clipper ships, {{compared to}} close rival Dent and Company with 13. Jardines also <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> small ships, lorchas and small smuggling crafts for coastal and upriver smuggling. The trading concerns of Jardine's included smuggling opium into China from India, trading spices and sugar from the Philippines, importing Chinese tea and silk into England, handling cargo papers and cargo insurance, renting of dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing and other numerous {{lines of business}} and trade. During the mid-1830s, trade with China was becoming more difficult due to the Qing government's increasing restrictions on the narcotic trade in part to control the worsening outflow of silver. This trade imbalance stemmed {{from the fact that}} Western traders were importing more opium into China than they were exporting teas and silk.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Capone {{sent two}} {{more of his}} men, Frank Rio and Willie Heeney, to demand that Touhy once again hand over control of his operations. Touhy himself had no armed men among his gang members. Realizing that Capone would try to use force after his refusal, Touhy {{approached}} local law enforcement officers and others to ask for their support. He explained that he simply wanted to sell beer, while domination by the Capone gang would bring lawlessness, gambling and prostitution. Local leaders agreed to help him. Merchants refused to use Capone's gambling punchboards or buy his own low-quality beer. When Rio and Heeney met with Touhy, off-duty police and local farmers were lounging about in the building. This show of force unnerved Capone's gunmen, who reported that Touhy's gang must have <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> armed men.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, SAS sold {{half of its}} 40% {{stake in}} British Midland to Lufthansa, which was seeking a {{stronger}} position at London Heathrow, following which British Midland joined Star Alliance. At the time, British Midland chairman Sir Michael Bishop owned a 50% share of the company. Between 1999 and 2004, Lufthansa sought to sell {{some or all of}} its share in the airline. Virgin Atlantic hoped to buy the shares to then merge both airlines, as BMI was already Virgin's preferred feeder airline into Heathrow. Virgin argued that the merger would have brought together two airlines with combined ticket sales of more than £2billion, forming a powerful force in the aviation industry. BMI was believed to have initiated the talks after it began losing money following the 11 September 2001 attacks. A merger would have strengthened Virgin Atlantic's base at Heathrow, where BMI <b>had</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> highly valued take-off and landing slots, to increase the competition with British Airways.|$|E
