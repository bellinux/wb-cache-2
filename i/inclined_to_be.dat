25|$|Some {{ecological}} economists prioritise adding {{natural capital}} {{to the typical}} capital asset analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from mathematical economics as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the precautionary principle.|$|E
25|$|Gender-specific theory {{developed}} in the Malleus Maleficarum laid the foundations for widespread consensus in early modern Germany on the evil nature of women as witches. Later works on witchcraft have not agreed entirely with the Malleus {{but none of them}} challenged the view that women were more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> witches than men. It was perceived as intuitive and all-accepted so that very few authors saw the need to explain why women are witches. Those who did, attributed female witchery to the weakness of body and mind (the old medieval explanation) and a few to female sexuality.|$|E
25|$|Palmer was {{the younger}} brother of the Somerset and England all-rounder Ken Palmer and, like him, a {{right-handed}} batsman and a fast-medium right-arm bowler. Unlike Ken, Roy Palmer's batting was normally no better than lower-order, and though he made 84 batting at No 9 against Leicestershire in 1967, he never again passed 50. His bowling, too, was <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expensive. His best season was 1969, when Somerset finished bottom of the County Championship: handed the new ball {{for much of the}} season, he took 60 wickets, but at a cost of almost 32 runs per wicket. When, in 1970, that average moved upwards to beyond 37 runs per wicket, he was not re-engaged.|$|E

25|$|Throughout this decades-long career, Weiser's {{knowledge}} of Native American languages and culture {{made him a}} key player in treaty negotiations, land purchases, and the formulation of Pennsylvania's policies towards Native Americans. Because of his early experiences with the Iroquois, Weiser was <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sympathetic to their interpretation of events, as opposed to the Lenape or the Shawnee. This may have exacerbated Pennsylvanian-Lenape/Shawnee relations, with bloody consequences in the French and Indian Wars. Nevertheless, for many years, he helped to keep the powerful Iroquois, or Six Nations, allied with the British as opposed to the French. This important service contributed to the continued survival of the British colonies and the eventual victory of the British over the French in the French and Indian Wars.|$|E
25|$|However {{eighteenth-century}} society {{struggled with}} the relation between drunkenness and responsibility especially when crime was involved. On one hand, {{it was believed that}} intoxication could alter a person's nature leading him to criminal behaviour, and consequently the judges and jurors were <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tolerant towards these infractions. On the other hand, both citizens and law authorities shared the opinion that drunkenness was an unacceptable excuse, so if a crime was committed in such a state the felon must be fully prosecuted. With the harsh punishments of the Bloody Code pending on the head of the offender, English judges and jurors were usually willing to admit a plea for drunkenness. It was often regarded as an extenuating circumstance and most frequently resulted in the possibility of mitigation, acquittal, or pardon.|$|E

Lawrence and the forces of the Arab Revolt based on Aqaba had blown up lengths of rail track, bridges and Ottoman supply trains with explosives. In early March Sherifian Arabs led by the Emir Feisal and guided by Lawrence were raiding Ottoman units south of El Kutrani and were in some force about Tafila on 11 March but withdrew a week later. In response the Ottoman Army sent a strong force including a German infantry battalion south from Amman to defend the railway and the important town of Ma'an. The Bedouin near Madaba were <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hostile to the Ottoman Army and it was hoped that the planned attack on Amman might attract their support.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950 season, Berry was {{not even}} first-choice left-arm spinner for Lancashire, his long-time friend Malcolm Hilton being often {{preferred}} as the spin alternative to the off-spin of Roy Tattersall. Hilton was reckoned as the more devastating bowler on a turning wicket, and could also bowl flatter and faster than Berry, which meant that he was at times used to open the bowling. Berry was known for flight and spin, but was also <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more expensive than Hilton. Nonetheless, it was Berry who was picked for the 1950–51 MCC tour to Australia and New Zealand under Freddie Brown. He had a poor tour on pitches not designed for spin and was not chosen for any of the Test matches, with Doug Wright being preferred. Hilton was picked for the 1951–52 tour to India, and Berry did not play Test cricket again.|$|E
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
25|$|A {{science and}} {{mathematics}} graduate from the University of Western Australia, Jack Rutherford was a right-handed opening batsman, <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defensive, and an occasional leg-break bowler who played for Western Australia from the 1952–53 season. Until 1956–57, Western Australia played the other Sheffield Shield state cricket teams only once a season, so Rutherford's record of five first-class centuries in his first four seasons was notable enough to win him selection for the 1956 Australian tour to England. In a damp summer, though, {{he was not a}} success, scoring only 640 runs at an average of fewer than 23 runs per innings. Only fleetingly, early in the tour, did he look likely to break into the Test team: against MCC at Lord's, he scored a dour 98 and shared a second wicket partnership of 282 with Neil Harvey, who scored 225. But when the team was announced for the first Test, the Australians reverted to the first-choice opening pair of Colin McDonald and Jim Burke.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explore the distinctions of luxury {{consumption}} motivations between Chinese and Japanese youth in the context of institutionalized individualization. It compares the different consumption motivations among Chinese and Japanese young people, as well as their respective inclinations between traditional and individualist consumption. It aims at identifying the underlying social factors that influence and contribute to the luxury consumptions in today’s China and Japan. Individualization theory is applied in this study to help understand the root of the differences (and similarities) between Chinese and Japanese luxury consumption motivations, especially their individualist tendency in luxury consumption today. The study uses mainly qualitative methods in a case study of the Core Region of the Yangtze River Delta in China, however, quantitative approach also has been used when deal the statistical data. The research methods adopted in this study are questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The research findings indicate the obvious difference of luxury consumption motivation and practice between Chinese and Japanese youth: the Chinese <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> private self-conscious consumers who are influenced more by personal effects and the luxury consumption in China express obviously individualistic tendency; whereas the Japanese <b>incline</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> public self-conscious consumers who are influenced more by interpersonal effects, the luxury consumption in Japan <b>inclines</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> collectivist traditional one while individualistic tendency emerges. However, the research also finds, in the context of institutionalized individualization, there is also common place between Chinese and Japanese luxury consumption: both the Chinese and Japanese youth try to seek balance between the individual and the society even in consumption field. Furthermore, the study also contributes knowledge about the variety of individualization, it display the distinctive individualization paths of China and Japan from the perspective of consumption...|$|R

25|$|Kardar captained Pakistan {{against all}} the Test playing nations of the day, and {{achieved}} an unparalleled distinction of leading his team to victory against each of them, which was remarkable for a nascent cricketing nation. Especially famous was the series-levelling victory achieved touring England in 1954 at The Oval. Kardar and his men also created history by winning the first-ever and only Test against Australia in Karachi in 1957. Although aggressive, motivated and confident, Kardar's Pakistan was yet immature, inexperienced and raw in their cricketing skills to win series victories. The attitude of the players was especially criticised when all the five Tests played by the Indian cricket team on its first tour of Pakistan in 1954–1955 ended in a draw. The fear of both Indian and Pakistani players of losing to each other, owing to political tensions and the bloody legacy of independence, {{was too much for}} competitive cricket to be played. During his tenure, Pakistan won six, lost six and drew eleven matches in a total of 23 Tests. In all his positions of authority, he was <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dictatorial and quickly angered, especially by any hint of criticism. But he was also a visionary and was an advocate of neutral umpires. Kardar retired from international Test cricket in 1958.|$|E
25|$|As the Hoa are <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entrepreneurs, {{they have}} {{dominated}} {{several types of}} businesses such as selling rice, crewed junk, rice transportation, and ship building during their early arrival to Vietnam. Through enterprise, organization, and cooperation many Chinese became part of a prosperous, urban middle class that controlled retail trade. Chinese shops filled every town and sea route as rice selling and transportation remained {{one of the most}} profitable businesses in the nation. In addition, the Hoa became actively involved in commerce, particularly in the area of Saigon, where Chinese worked as vendors and sold an array of products as an industrious enterprising ethnic group. Many would then work as butchers and tailors, and then venture into confectionery. Many Chinese also worked as money lenders, bankers, and money changers. Products such as tea, porcelain, pharmaceuticals and medicine, furniture and cabinet-work were shipped to Vietnam from China. Government officials said the ethnic Chinese in Cholon were active in municipal interests and the Vietnamese Communist Party. But their main interest was enterprise. The Chinese feel secure in business as well as their social and cultural life. About 20 percent of the 6,000 private companies and 150,000 individual small businesses in the city were run by Chinese. The Chinese accounted for more than 30 percent of Ho Chi Minh City's business output due to better equipment used by the businesses.|$|E
