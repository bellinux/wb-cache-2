5000|$|In {{archaeology}} a flake tool {{is a type}} {{of stone}} tool that was used during the Stone Age that was created by striking a flake from a prepared stone core. People during prehistoric times often preferred these flake tools as compared to other tools because these tools were often easily made, could be made to be extremely sharp and could easily be repaired. Flake tools could be sharpened by retouch to create scrapers or burins. These tools were either made by flaking off small particles of flint or by breaking off a large piece and using that as a tool itself. These tools were able to be made by this [...] "chipping" [...] away effect due to the natural characteristic of stone. Stone is able to break apart when struck near the <b>edge.</b> <b>Flake</b> tools are created through flint knapping, a process of producing stone tools using lithic reduction. Lithic reduction is the removal of a lithic flake from a larger stone in order to reach the desired tool shape and size. The beginning stone is called the flake lithic core. There are three steps to lithic reduction: ...|$|E

5|$|In {{gray iron}} the carbon exists as separate, fine flakes of graphite, and also renders the {{material}} brittle {{due to the}} sharp <b>edged</b> <b>flakes</b> of graphite that produce stress concentration sites within the material. A newer variant of gray iron, referred to as ductile iron is specially treated with trace amounts of magnesium to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, reducing the stress concentrations and vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.|$|R

50|$|When {{repairing}} {{paint that}} is flaking from parchment, isinglass {{can be applied}} directly to an area which has been soaked {{with a small amount}} of ethanol. It is typically applied as a very tiny drop that is then guided, with the help of a binocular microscope, under the <b>edges</b> of <b>flaking</b> paint.|$|R
30|$|In the {{oxidation}} duration, oxidation {{occurs at}} the <b>edges</b> of <b>flake</b> graphite first and then oxidants entered the interlayers. Oxide radicals induced cutting along the edges and surface defects of graphite [14]. Under the irradiation of microwave, expansible graphite expanded rapidly because of the decomposing of the oxidants between the layers. Compared with conventional expansion method, microwave irradiation is more economic and efficient. It could be confirmed that mild oxidants and microwave irradiation contributed {{to the expansion of}} the graphite flakes and ultrasonication helped to peel them into the thin graphene-like nanosheets.|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 b {{explains}} {{the separation of}} wood specimens. The L specimens were cut along the longitudinal direction about 5  mm from the RT surface, which {{had been exposed to}} the AA vapor. The T specimens were sliced along the tangential direction at about 0.5  mm from the LR surface. The cut blocks and sliced flakes were then leached in running water for at least 48  h, after which they were air-dried overnight. When the T specimens were treated for 24  h or longer, the <b>edges</b> of some <b>flake</b> samples showed a lighter color. This color change indicated that a small amount of AA vapor passed through the sealing and reacted with the LT surface of the T specimen. Therefore, the edges (5 – 8  mm from the <b>edge)</b> of all <b>flake</b> samples were removed prior to the following experiments.|$|R
30|$|In exfoliated {{pristine}} graphene, the D peak {{can only}} be observed at the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flakes</b> {{where there is a}} large concentration of structural defects and its intensity is typically much lower than the intensity of the G peak [55, 56]. In our studies performed on pristine graphene flakes with similar size as the fluorinated graphene flakes, the intensity of the D peak is typically well below the sensitivity of our Raman setup, i.e. we are usually not able to detect any D peak because of the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flakes.</b> Therefore, the observed D peak in our fluorinated graphene samples must originate from other defects than simply the edges of the samples. As all our samples contain networks of sp 2 bonded carbon atom rings, we believe that the D peak is mainly activated by the F atoms which act as vacancies in these sp 2 rings.|$|R
30|$|In {{the upper}} left part of Fig.  3 a, there is a region of the not fully formed flake. In {{the body of the}} {{indicated}} flake, there are significant areas that are not filled with atoms. Considering this {{and the fact that the}} atomic vacancies are largely observed on the <b>edge</b> of <b>flakes</b> as shown in Fig.  3 b, it may be assumed that the flake self assembling is carried out by two mechanisms, i.e., atoms, deposited on the sample, through the mechanism of the thermal drift and the atom flow from the melt, which does not fully heal vacancies. And thus, as it has already been noted, the formed flakes are generally characterized by very high vacancy defectiveness.|$|R

Though mostly coarse and tough, the raw materials vary in texture, homogeneity, and thus quality in lithic manufacture, {{which in turn is}} the main reason why there is significant variability in the lithic technology. In contrast to the common impressionistic assumption, these materials produce not only large tools but also small flake tools. The exam. ination of Paleolithic assemblages from the middle Korean Peninsula shows differences in raw material use in making artifacts of various form and size.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} estimating <b>edge</b> length from <b>flake</b> dimensions. Comparison of estimated values with data from measured <b>flake</b> <b>edges</b> demonstrates the robusticity of the method. Building {{on the work of}} Braun (Braun, D. R., 2005. Examining flake production strategies: examples from the Middle Paleolithic of Southwest Asia. Lithic Technology 30, 107 – 125; Braun, D. R., Harris, J. W. K., 2003.

Treballs d’ Arqueologia 9, pp. 132 – 144) this estimate is used to generate an edge length to mass value for complete flakes—taken to be a proxy for flaking efficiency. It is shown that this value is useful in tracking the onset, variability and decline of a well known technological phase—the Howiesons Poort of South Africa. The results suggest that the Howiesons Poort was a time in which flaking efficiency was emphasised. Furthermore, comparison of upper limits of edge to mass values for different raw materials may provide an insight into changes in raw material selection...|$|R
50|$|From circa 200,000 BC onwards, Middle Paleolithic humans {{began to}} make complex stone blades with <b>flaked</b> <b>edges</b> which were used as spear heads. These stone heads could be fixed to the spear shaft by gum or resin or by {{bindings}} made of animal sinew, leather strips or vegetable matter. During this period, a clear difference remained between spears designed to be thrown and those designed {{to be used in}} hand-to-hand combat. By the Magdalenian period (c. 15000-9500 BC), spear-throwers similar to the later atlatl were in use.|$|R

The site was {{discovered}} and a collection of flint tools used during the Neolithic Revolution was made by Lorraine Copeland and Frank Skeels in 1965. Materials recovered included blade-butts with scraping edges or notches, borers, cores (one with a twin <b>edge)</b> and small <b>flakes.</b> Some pieces were vaguely bifacial. The flints found were in a grey or chocolate-brown color with some having a shiny patina.|$|R
50|$|Current {{estimates}} put {{the beginning}} of the San Luis Rey Complex at around AD 500-1000. The primary traits that distinguish this complex from the locally preceding San Dieguito, La Jolla, and Pauma complexes are the presence of small projectile points (indicative of use of the bow and arrow), pottery, and the practice of cremation. Other San Luis Rey Complex lithic tools include mortars and metates (both bedrock and portable), pestles and manos, <b>flaked</b> <b>edge</b> tools (scrapers and knives), hammers, drills, steatite arrow straighteners, pendants, beads, and quartz crystals. Shell ornaments and bone tools are also present. Red and black geometrical pictographs were painted.|$|R
50|$|There were 70 {{thin and}} bifacially worked blades, {{which had no}} cutting edges nor notches and stems. Choppers were heavier, cruder, and bifacially <b>flaked</b> with cutting <b>edges.</b> 82 {{coarsely}} <b>flaked</b> unifaces and bifaces were found, discarded or aborted roughouts or blanks. 147 scrapers which had one or more <b>flaked</b> chipped <b>edges</b> that created blunt working edges. Only two presented special preparation for hafting. 2 spokeshaves and 21 drills were also found. The drills looked more like artifaces than the spokeshaves, {{which seemed to be}} nondescript notches pieces of stone. The drills were found uniformly in all deposits.|$|R
40|$|Water {{inside the}} low {{dimensional}} carbon structures {{has been considered}} seriously owing to fundamental interest in its flow and structures {{as well as its}} practical impact. Recently, the anomalous perfect penetration of water through graphene oxide membrane was demonstrated although the membrane was impenetrable for other liquids and even gases. The unusual auxetic behavior of graphene oxide in the presence of water was also reported. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we establish atomistic models for hybrid systems composed of water and graphene oxides revealing the anomalous water behavior inside the stacked graphene oxides. We show that formation of hexagonal ice bilayer in between the flakes as well as melting transition of ice at the <b>edges</b> of <b>flakes</b> are crucial to realize the perfect water permeation across the whole stacked structures. The distance between adjacent layers that can be controlled either by oxygen reduction process or pressure is shown to determine the water flow thus highlighting a unique water dynamics in randomly connected two-dimensional spaces.

While the stock dispersion had a mean lateral flake size of 0. 6 ?m, the separated fractions displayed clear size separation, with the second and fourteenth fractions displaying mean sizes of ~ 1. 2 and ~ 0. 5 microns respectively. Raman spectroscopy shows the flake D:G intensity ratio to scale inversely with the flake size indicating that any defects present are associated with <b>flake</b> <b>edges</b> rather than basal plane defects...|$|R

The importance of substrate steps and of the unbinding of graphene <b>flake</b> <b>edges</b> from the substrate for the intercalation is identified. With the use of CO titration to selectively remove oxygen from the bare Ir terraces the energetics of intercalation is uncovered.

50|$|The {{technique}} {{used to make}} the tranchet flake was used in the making of other tools as well, including tranchet axes (characterized by their trapezoidal or triangular shape) adzes, and even tranchet arrowheads. Unlike chisel arrowheads, tranchet arrowheads are transverse: this means they are knapped sideways, along the width of the flake versus the length of a flake like in the making of a chisel arrowhead. Also different is that tranchet arrowheads are made from a blade struck off a core versus being made from debitage like chisel arrowheads. The <b>edge</b> of the <b>flake</b> could be sharpened again by removing another flake from it.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} noted that during the thermal {{annealing}} up to 180  °C transformation of carbonyl carbon bonds (C=O, 287.6  eV) into C–O bonds (286.7  eV) takes place while a concentration of the carboxylate carbon (O–C=O, 289.0  eV) remains almost constant (see Fig.  3 f). The last bonds are usually formed in <b>edges</b> of GO <b>flakes</b> [12]. Further increase of annealing temperature results in increase of the non-oxygenated carbon concentration which at annealing temperature of 250  °C reaches 76 % from total carbon concentration (C/O[*]=[*] 3.26) in the reduced GO. After thermal annealing at 250  °C small concentrations of carboxylate carbon, carbonyl carbon and C–O bonds are observed that totally corresponds to the results obtained by FTIR spectroscopy (see Fig.  2).|$|R

Graphene oxide (GO) is {{typically}} synthesized by graphite powder under strong oxidizing reaction, possessing {{with the same}} set of functional groups: epoxy and hydroxyl in basal plane and carboxyl and hydroxyl groups existence on the <b>flake</b> <b>edges</b> which endow GO with amphipathy. GO and its functionalized derivatives have been successfully tested in many domains, such as polymer composites, biosensors, drug delivery systems, etc. In this paper, GO was prepared by a modified Hummers method employing improved process (preparation and separation), aiming at industrialization with the lowest cost. Moreover, some novel functional groups with different properties were controlled chemically grafted onto GO to modify the wettability and reaction activity with other materials. The hydrophobicity and the thermal property of graphene oxide were enhanced by chemical functionalization...|$|R

In this work we study the formation and localization of narrowband quantum emitters in large flakes (up to tens of microns wide) of hBN. The emitters can be activated in as-grown hBN by electron irradiation or high temperature annealing, and the emitter formation probability can be increased by ion implantation or focused laser irradiation of the as-grown material. Interestingly, we show that the emitters are always localized at <b>edges</b> of the <b>flakes,</b> unlike most luminescent point defects in 3 D materials. Our results constitute an important step on the road map of deploying hBN in nanophotonics applications...|$|R
40|$|Graphene and few-layer {{graphene}} at high bias expose {{a wealth}} of phenomena due to the high temperatures reached. With in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) we observe directly how the current modifies the structure, and vice versa. In some samples, cracks propagate from the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flakes,</b> leading {{to the formation of}} narrow constrictions or to nanometer spaced gaps after breakdown. In other samples we find layer-by-layer evaporation of few-layer graphene, which could be exploited for the controlled production of single layer graphene from multi-layered samples. Surprisingly, we even find that two pieces of graphene that overlap can heal out at high bias and form one continuous sheet. These findings open up new avenues to structure graphene for specific device applications...|$|R
30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} that {{the edges of}} pG and rGO are relatively rich in carboxyl groups, we can hypothesize that these groups may be an attractive site for bacterial attachment. Carboxyl groups are present on a large range of nutritional molecules (i.e., amino acids, short-chain organic acids, and fatty acids), which are commonly recognized, metabolized, and consumed by bacteria. The carboxyl groups available on the pG and rGO edges are therefore speculated to play a ‘baiting’ role for attracting bacteria. Consequently, the antibacterial activity of rGO and pG might be attributed to two different mechanisms. The sharp <b>flake</b> <b>edges</b> may have {{detrimental effects on the}} integrity of cell membranes [22]. Also, the chemical affinity of the hydrophobic areas of pG or rGO to phospholipid membranes may lead to the destruction of these structures [18].|$|R

We observe that the Lam'e parameters in small flakes can differ from the bulk values by 30 % for hydrogenated zig-zag edges. The change results from the <b>edge</b> of the <b>flake</b> that compresses the interior. When including the vibrational zero point motion, we detect a decrease in the bending rigidity by ~ 26 %. This correction is depending on the flake size, N, because the vibrational frequencies flow with growing N due to the release of the edge induced compression. We calculate Grueneisen parameters and find good agreement with previous authors. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{effects of the}} support substrate surfaces on properties of the attached graphene flakes by observing protein adsorption to the graphene surfaces on SiO 2 /Si substrates that are modified with self-assembled monolayers to control their hydrophilicity. Using atomic force microscopy operated in aqueous environment, we found that high-density clusters of agglomerated avidin molecules form on the graphene flakes in the areas supported by a hydrophobic substrate surface, whereas very low density of large avidin clusters form at the <b>edge</b> of graphene <b>flakes</b> in the area supported by a hydrophilic surface. These results demonstrate that hydrophilicity of the support surface affects hydrophilicity of the graphene surface also in aqueous environment and that surface modification of the support substrate is a useful technique to control protein adsorption phenomena on graphene surfaces for realization of high sensitive graphene biosensors...|$|R

It exhibits unusual thermal behavior, with a long-range ballistic transport at room temperature [16]. Baladin et al. [17] reported that graphene exhibits significantly higher thermal conductivity than carbon nanotubes, which gives graphene potential for use in heat management applications with high-power electronics devices. Baladin et al. also proposed a lattice thermal conductivity model of graphene using the framework of the Klemens approximation [18]. They found that the phonon mean free path was 775  nm at room temperature, and that the phonon thermal conductivity of single-layer graphene was in the range 2000 – 5000  W/mK, and depended on the defect concentration, roughness of the <b>edges,</b> and the <b>flake</b> width [19 – 23]. Although the potential applications of nanofluids are promising, the long-term stability of nanofluids is a problem [24].|$|R

The height difference {{in the middle and}} end points of the profile is 0.09  nm, and the flake width is about 8  nm. It is noteworthy that such a sag has been observed mostly on the horizontally oriented flakes. At the same time, the height differences between adjacent flakes, as it was noted above, were about 0.16  nm. Such a result may direct to a very important and intriguing question about the possibility of free sagging of the <b>flakes</b> <b>edges.</b> Since there is a difficulty to determine this by tunneling microscopy, it could be the subject of further studies. It should be noted that a variant of a free metal monolayer existence is contrary to the physics canons about the solid state.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida {{interaction}} between two magnetic impurities {{connected to the}} edges of zigzag-terminated MoS$_{ 2 }$ flakes. When the impurities lie on the <b>edges</b> of the <b>flake,</b> the effective exchange interaction exhibits sizable noncollinear Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya character that competes with a strong Ising coupling. We analyze the characteristic decay exponent for doping levels inside the band gap of the infinite layer, corresponding to edge states of the flake at the Fermi level. The characteristic exponents show sub-two-dimensional (sub- 2 D) behavior for these band fillings, with decays much slower than quadratic. The Ising interaction has effectively one-dimensional (1 D) long range, while the noncollinear component that grows for short impurity separation becomes comparable in magnitude. The resulting tunable exchange interaction on these systems opens the way for the study of interesting phases of impurity arrays with long-range stable helical order.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy proves that the SiC surface reconstruction persists throughout the growth process and that the synthesized films consist of sp 2 -bonded carbon. Interestingly, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements show that the graphene domains possess one single in-plane orientation, are aligned to the substrate, and offer a noticeably contracted lattice parameter of 2. 446 Å.
