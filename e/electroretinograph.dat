40|$|We {{describe}} a previously unreported co-existence of retinitis pigmentosa and congenital toxoplasmosis. An eight year old male presented to our center with complaints of decreased night vision. Fundus evaluations {{in both the}} eyes demonstrated features typical of retinitis pigmentosa. There were well-defined punched out healed chorio-retinal scars suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis. On the basis of history, clinical findings and reduction of a and b wave amplitudes on scotopic and photopic <b>electroretinograph,</b> a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa with congenital toxoplasmosis was made. Retinitis pigmentosa may co-exist with congenital toxoplasmosis that may affect the patient&#x 2032;s overall ocular morbidity and visual acuity...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To {{describe}} the topography of multifocal electroretinograms (ERGs) {{and to explore}} its diagnostic value in patients with Stargardt's macular dystrophy (SMD).  METHODS— 51 patients with SMD were examined {{by means of the}} m-sequence technique to characterise the topography of electroretinographic responses in the central visual field. The results were compared with data from 30  normal volunteers.  RESULTS—In 49  of 51  patients with SMD, macular electroretinographic activity was markedly diminished or non-detectable. Towards more peripheral areas, ERG responses of the SMD patients approached those of normals. Implicit times were not markedly delayed at any eccentricity.  CONCLUSION—In contrast with Ganzfeld electroretinography, multifocal electroretinography is useful to detect foveal dysfunction in SMD. Areas of dysfunction were found to be usually larger than expected from psychophysical measurements and morphological alteration. In early stages of the disease it was possible to detect foveal dysfunction, even in patients lacking morphological fundus changes and with good visual acuity.    Keywords: Stargardt's macular dystrophy; fundus flavimaculatus; <b>electroretinograph...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ji Won Lim, Joon Hee Cho, Ha Kyoung KimDepartment of Ophthalmology, Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, Chuncheon, Republic of KoreaAbstract: The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} macular function before and after surgery for idiopathic epiretinal membranes with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling by means of multifocal electroretinography (ERG). Eighteen eyes of 18 patients who underwent vitrectomy with ILM removal were included. Best corrected visual acuity, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and multifocal electroretinography were assessed prior to surgery, and 3 and 12 months after surgery. All surgical samples were obtained and confirmed inclusion of an ILM by electron microscopy. Visual acuity and the central foveal thickness by OCT improved significantly 3 months postoperatively, with gradual recovery by 12 months. Preoperatively, only the P 1 amplitude in rings 1 and 2 were decreased compared with the normal fellow eyes (P &lt; 0. 01). Three and 12 months after surgery, the P 1 amplitude in rings 1 and 2 were decreased compared with the preoperative P 1 amplitudes, but without significance. The photoreceptor status by OCT was related to the N 1 amplitude before and after surgery. Although visual acuity and macular edema were improved after surgery, macular function, as indicated by multifocal ERG, had limited recovery at 12 months.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the potential neuroprotective effect of neuroserpin (NSP) on acute retinal ischemic/reperfusion-induced (IR) injury. An IR injury model was established by elevating intraocular pressure (IOP) for 60 minutes in wild type and tPA-deficient (tPA-/-) mice. Prior to IR injury, 1 μL of 20 μmol/L NSP or an equal volume of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was intravitreally administered. Retinal function was evaluated by <b>electroretinograph</b> (ERG) and the number of apoptotic neurons was determined via TUNEL labeling. Caspase- 3, - 8, - 9,poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and their cleaved forms were subsequently analyzed. It was found that IR injury significantly damaged retinal function, inducing apoptosis in the retina, while NSP attenuated the loss of retinal function and significantly reduced the number of apoptotic neurons in both wild type and tPA-/- mice. The levels of cleaved caspase- 3, cleaved PARP (the substrate of caspase- 3) and caspase- 9 (the modulator of the caspase- 3), which had increased following IR injury, were significantly inhibited by NSP in both wild type and tPA-/- mice. NSP increased ischemic tolerance in the retina at least partially by inhibiting the intrinsic cell death signaling pathway of caspase- 3. It was therefore concluded that the protective effect of neuroserpin maybe independent from its canonical interaction with a tissue-type plasminogen activator...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHuntington's disease (HD) and {{spinocerebellar ataxia}} type 7 (SCA 7) {{belong to a}} group of {{inherited}} neurodegenerative diseases caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in corresponding proteins. Transcriptional alteration is a unifying feature of polyQ disorders; however, the relationship between polyQ-induced gene expression deregulation and degenerative processes remains unclear. R 6 / 2 and R 7 E mouse models of HD and SCA 7, respectively, present a comparable retinal degeneration characterized by progressive reduction of <b>electroretinograph</b> activity and important morphological changes of rod photoreceptors. The retina, which is a simple central nervous system tissue, allows correlating functional, morphological and molecular defects. Taking advantage of comparing polyQ-induced degeneration in two retina models, we combined gene expression profiling and molecular biology techniques to decipher the molecular pathways underlying polyQ expansion toxicity. We show that R 7 E and R 6 / 2 retinal phenotype strongly correlates with loss of expression of a large cohort of genes specifically involved in phototransduction function and morphogenesis of differentiated rod photoreceptors. Accordingly, three key transcription factors (Nrl, Crx and Nr 2 e 3) controlling rod differentiation genes, hence expression of photoreceptor specific traits, are down-regulated. Interestingly, other transcription factors known to cause inhibitory effects on photoreceptor differentiation when mis-expressed, such as Stat 3, are aberrantly re-activated. Thus, our results suggest that independently from the protein context, polyQ expansion overrides the control of neuronal differentiation and maintenance, thereby causing dysfunction and degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Membrane-associated {{guanylate}} kinase (MAGUK) proteins {{function as}} scaffold proteins contributing to cell polarity and organizing signal transducers at the neuronal synapse membrane. The MAGUK protein Mpp 4 {{is located in}} the retinal outer plexiform layer (OPL) at the presynaptic plasmamembrane and presynaptic vesicles of photoreceptors. Additionally, it is located at the outer limitingmembrane (OLM) where it might be involved in OLM integrity. InMpp 4 knockoutmice, loss ofMpp 4 function only sporadically causes photoreceptor displace-ment, without changing the Crumbs (Crb) protein complex at the OLM, adherens junctions or synapse struc-ture. Scanning laser ophthalmology revealed no retinal degeneration. The minor morphological effects suggest that Mpp 4 is a candidate gene for mild retinopathies only. At the OPL, Mpp 4 is essential for correct localization of Psd 95 andVeli 3 at the presynaptic photoreceptormembrane. Psd 95 labeling is absent of presyn-aptic membranes in both rods and cones but still present in cone basal contacts and dendritic contacts. Total retinal Psd 95 protein levels are significantly reduced which suggests Mpp 4 to be involved in Psd 95 turnover, whereas Veli 3 proteins levels are not changed. These protein changes in the photoreceptor synapse did not result in an altered <b>electroretinograph.</b> These findings suggest that Mpp 4 coordinates Psd 95 /Veli 3 assembly and maintenance at synaptic membranes. Mpp 4 is a critical recruitment factor to organize scaffolds at the photoreceptor synapse and is likely to be associated with synaptic plasticity and protein complex transport...|$|E

Inflammatory, diabetic, post-cataract, and macular edema due to age-related macular degeneration is described. The role of chronic inflammation and hypoxia and direct macular traction is evaluated {{in each case}} according to different views from the literature. The different diagnostic methods for evaluating the edema are described. Special attention is given to fluoroangiography and the most modern methods of macula examination, such as ocular coherence tomography and multifocal electroretinography. Finally, we discuss the treatment of cystoid macular edema in relation to its etiology. In this chapter we briefly refer to the therapeutic value of laser treatment especially in diabetic maculopathy or vitrectomy in some selected cases. Our paper is focused mainly on recent therapeutic treatment with intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide and anti-VEGF factors like bevacizumab (Avastin), ranibizumab (Lucentis), pegaptamid (Macugen), and others. The goal {{of this paper is}} to review the current status of this treatment for macular edema due to diabetic maculopathy, central retinal vein occlusion and post-cataract surgery. For this reason the results of recent multicenter clinical trials are quoted, as also our experience on the use of intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF factors and we discuss its value in clinical practice.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the ceroid-lipofuscinoses, inherited storage {{diseases of}} children, was studied in an ovine model. This {{was shown to}} have clinical and pathological features most {{in common with the}} late infantile and juvenile human forms of the disease. The ability to study sequential changes allowed the retinal lesions to be described as a dystrophy of photoreceptor outer segments which preceded loss of the photoreceptor cells. An early decrease in amplitude of the c-wave <b>electroretinograph</b> was attributed to a decrease in the transpigment epithelial component. The decreased a- and b-wave amplitudes were attributed to the changes in and loss of, photoreceptor cells. The chemical components of isolated storage cytosomes were analyzed and shown to consist mostly of protein. Sequence analysis of the dominantly stored protein showed that it was identical to the DCCD reactive proteolipid or subunit c of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase and that it comprised approximately 50 % of storage material. Based on the adage that the dominantly stored species should reflect the underlying biochemical anomaly, it was concluded that it was of pathogenic significance. This highly hydrophobic protein tends to extract with lipids in chloroform/methanol and is thus known as a proteolipid. Some of the remainder of the stored proteins also had this characteristic. It was concluded that ovine ceroid-lipofuscinosis was a proteinosis, more specifically a proteolipid proteinosis and as such it forms the prototype of a new class of storage diseases. Recognition {{of the nature of the}} dominantly stored chemical species has helped understanding of a variety of chemical and physical characteristics attributed to the whole pigment.

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster {{photoreceptor}} cell {{has long}} {{served as a}} model system for researchers focusing on how animal sensory neurons receive information from their surroundings and translate this information into chemical and electrical messages. <b>Electroretinograph</b> (ERG) analysis of Drosophila mutants has helped to elucidate some of the genes involved in the visual transduction pathway downstream of the photoreceptor cell, {{and it is now}} clear that photoreceptor cell signaling is dependent upon the proper release and recycling of the neurotransmitter histamine. While the neurotransmitter transporters responsible for clearing histamine, and its metabolite carcinine, from the synaptic cleft have remained unknown, a strong candidate for a transporter of either substrate is the uncharacterized inebriated protein. The inebriated gene (ine) encodes a putative neurotransmitter transporter that has been localized to photoreceptor cells in Drosophila and mutations in ine result in an abnormal ERG phenotype in Drosophila. Loss-offunction mutations in ebony, a gene required for the synthesis of carcinine in Drosophila, suppress components of the mutant ine ERG phenotype, while loss-of-function mutations in tan, a gene necessary for the hydrolysis of carcinine in Drosophila, have no effect on the ERG phenotype in ine mutants. We also show that by feeding wild-type flies carcinine, we can duplicate components of mutant ine ERGs. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment with H 3 receptor agonists or inverse agonists rescue several components of the mutant ine ERG phenotype. Here, we provide pharmacological and genetic epistatic evidence that ine encodes a carcinine neurotransmitter transporter. We also speculate that the oscillations observed in mutant ine ERG traces are the result of the aberrant activity of a putative H 3 receptor. Citation: Gavin BA, Arruda SE, Dolph PJ.

40|$|Background/aims: To {{determine}} {{the potential of}} an intravitreal sustained release naproxen and 5 -fluorouracil (NA/ 5 -FU) codrug {{for the treatment of}} experimental proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in a model for trauma associated tractional retinal detachment (TRD). Methods: Sustained release pellets were prepared by covalently linking naproxen to 5 -fluorouracil. Drug release was tested in vitro and toxic effects were evaluated by electroretinography and light microscopy. Traumatic PVR was induced in pigmented rabbits by performing a scleral laceration, followed by repair and intravitreal injection of 0. 4 ml of autologous blood. Thirty six eyes were treated with a sustained release implant containing 1. 5 mg NA/ 5 -FU as a codrug and 36 control eyes were submitted to surgery alone. Eyes were evaluated for TRD by serial indirect ophthalmoscope examination at different time points followed by postmortem fundus evaluation of the enucleated eyeResults: the NA/ 5 -FU pellets were found to provide linear release of 5 -FU and naproxen over the 30 day duration of the in vitro release test. Both the severity of PVR grade and the percentage of eyes with moderate or worse tractional detachment were significantly lower in eyes treated with the codrug pellet. There were no drug related toxic effects evident on histopathological or <b>electroretinograph</b> examination of eyes containing the NA/ 5 -FU pellet. Conclusions: the results suggest that this NA/ 5 -FU codrug device effectively inhibits the progression of PVR in a rabbit trauma model that closely resembles PVR in humans. Additional studies to add knowledge to these initial findings and to clarify the potential of the codrug device for the treatment of human PVR are warranted.

40|$|Inherited retinal {{degeneration}} is a devastating illness comprising nearly 200 disease-causing mutations. The difficulty of developing cures for each disease individually makes clear {{the need for}} a widely applicable and nonspecific treatment. My first project involved a recently discovered neurotrophic factor, rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF), known to protect degenerating cones. My aim was to determine whether achieving constitutive retinal overexpression of RdCVF in mouse models of {{retinal degeneration}} could prevent photoreceptor death. I demonstrated that subretinal delivery of an AAV 2 vector delivering RdCVF to retinal RPE cells achieves stable expression for at least 9 months. I then delivered the vector to retinal degeneration (Rd 10) mice and demonstrated that treated eyes showed significant improvement over control injected eyes. This was seen histologically, with increased outer nuclear layer thickness and improved cone morphology; physiologically, with improved <b>electroretinograph</b> and pupillometry responses; and in behaving animals, with improved optokinetic responses. Gene therapy-mediated expression of RdCVF may therefore be an effective treatment in delaying retinal degeneration. Meanwhile, recent Phase I clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy in restoring vision in Type 2 Leber 2 ̆ 7 s Congenital Amaurosis (LCA 2), using AAV 2 -mediated gene replacement of the RPE 65 gene. Current clinical trial guidelines do not allow contralateral readministration of vector or treatment of patients with high pre-existing neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers to AAV 2, because safety and efficacy are unknown. My second project assessed the safety and feasibility of readministration of the clinical trial-grade vector AAV 2 -hRPE 65 in the contralateral eye of monkeys previously exposed to AAV 2 vectors. Results showed that while serum neutralizing antibodies increased following both the first and second subretinal injections, ocular titer only rose following local injection of that eye. Furthermore, all monkeys showed increased RPE 65 expression in both injected retinas. One animal developed a CD 4 + T-cell response post-first injection, and histology showed minimal inflammatory changes. These results indicate that even in the context of humoral or CD 4 + T-cell responses, administration and contralateral readministration of vector are safe and feasible and have high transduction efficiency. It is my hope that these studies will contribute to making retinal gene therapy treatment a reality for more patients. ...|$|E
