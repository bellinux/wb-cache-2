It was found that the particle spectrometer data were incomplete in the very light ford and haze so this portion of the data was eliminated.

The 12 -m <b>visibility</b> test circle was divided into six sectors of vision, and the test tractor was placed {{at the center of the}} circle. Artificial light was supplied in the darkened environment, and shadow or masking effects were measured manually around the 12 -m circle. Results: When the bulbs were placed at the operator’s eye level, <b>front</b> <b>visibility</b> was good; no masking was found in the “A ” vision sector, but larger masking widths were found in the “B ” and “C ” vision sectors. Since the masking width exceeded 700 mm, additional tests, such as movement of the light sources to both sides of the operator’s eye level, were performed. Less than six masking effects were found in the semi-circle of vision to the front, and more than one masking was found in the “B ” and “C ” visual fields. The minimum distance between the centers of two masking effects exceeded 2500 mm when measured as a chord on the semi-circle of vision.

Motivated by <b>visibility</b> {{problems}} in three dimensions, we investigate {{the complexity and}} construction of the set of tangent lines in a scene of three-dimensional polyhedra. We prove that the set of lines tangent to four possibly intersecting convex polyhedra in R 3 {{with a total of}} n edges consists of Θ(n 2) connected components in the worst case. In the generic case, each connected component is a single line, but our result still holds for arbitrarily degenerate scenes. More generally, we show that a set of k possibly intersecting convex polyhedra with a total of n edges admits, in the worst case, Θ(n 2 k 2) connected components of maximal free line segments tangent to at least four polytopes. Furthermore, these bounds also hold for possibly occluded lines rather than maximal free line segments. Finally, we present an O(n 2 k 2 log n) time and O(nk 2) space algorithm that, given a scene of k possibly intersecting convex polyhedra, computes all the minimal free line segments that are tangent to any four of the polytopes and are isolated transversals to the set of edges they intersect; in particular, we compute at least one line segment per connected component of tangent lines.

40|$|Real-time {{realistic}} image synthesis for virtual environments {{has been}} one of the most actively researched areas in computer graphics for over a decade. Images that display physically correct illumination of an environment can be simulated by evaluating a multi-dimensional integral equation, called the rendering equation, over the surfaces of the environment. Many global illumination algorithms such as pathtracing, photon mapping and distributed ray-tracing can produce realistic images but are generally unable to cope with dynamic lighting and objects at interactive rates. It still remains one of most challenging problems to simulate physically correctly illuminated dynamic environments without a substantial preprocessing step. In this thesis we present a rendering system for dynamic environments by implementing a customized rasterizer for global illumination entirely on the graphics hardware, the Graphical Processing Unit. Our research focuses on a parameterization of discrete <b>visibility</b> <b>field</b> for efficient indirect illumination computation. In order to generate the <b>visibility</b> <b>field,</b> we propose a CUDA-based (Compute Unified Device Architecture) rasterizer which builds Layered Hit Buffers (LHB) by rasterizing polygons into multi-layered structural buffers in parallel. The LHB provides a fast <b>visibility</b> function for any direction at any point. We propose a cone approximation solution to resolve an aliasing problem due to limited directional discretization. We also demonstrate how to remove structure noises by adapting an interleaved sampling scheme and discontinuity buffer. We show that a gathering method amortized with a multi-level Quasi Mont Carlo method can evaluate the rendering equation in real-time. The method can realize real-time walk-through of a complex virtual environment that has a mixture of diffuse and glossy reflection, computing multiple indirect bounces on the fly. We show that our method is capable of simulating fully dynamic environments including changes of view, materials, lighting and objects at interactive rates on commodity level graphics hardware...|$|R

The pattern may be visible all at once because the phase difference varies {{as a function of}} space, as in a 2-slit experiment.
