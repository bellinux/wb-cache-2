This is a harsh reality, but it's true. You are no longer safe just buying a firewall: most firewalls are not intelligent and usually badly configured- besides the <b>firewall</b> <b>code</b> can also have flaws, {{just like any other}} software. I don't say that getting a firewall is a bad idea, but trusting your firewall to protect you against everything is a [...] . Copyright SANS Institut...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} evaluates {{and models}} the error-caused security vulnerabilities {{and the resulting}} security violations on two Linux kernel firewalls: IPChains and Netfilter. There are two major aspects to this work: to conduct extensive error injection experiments on the Linux kernel and to quantify the possibility of error-caused security violations using a SAN model. The error injection experiments show that about 2 % of errors injected into the <b>firewall</b> <b>code</b> segment cause security vulnerabilities. Two types of error-caused security vulnerabilities are distinguished: temporary, which disappear when the error disappears, and permanent, which persist even after the error is removed, {{as long as the}} system is not rebooted. Results from simulating the SAN model indicate that under an error rate of 0. 1 error/day during a 1 -year period in a networked system protected by 20 firewalls, 2 machines (on the average) will experience security violations. This indicates that error-caused security vulnerabilities can be a non-negligible source of a security threat to a highly secure system. 1...|$|E

The end of this product line came in 2013, following McAfee's acquisition of another major firewall vendor, Finland-based Stonesoft. McAfee announced in October 2013 the intention to migrate their existing installed base of firewalls to Stonesoft's own Stonegate.|$|R
40|$|Rogue Java applets are {{currently}} {{a major concern}} for big companies and private users alike. While the best protection against them is to turn off Java support in the WWW browser, this "solution" is unsatisfying: it deprives users {{of many of the}} advantages of the Java platform. Other mechanisms such as <b>firewalls</b> and <b>code</b> signing have been proposed to "enhance" security. In this paper we argue that these mechanisms cannot deliver the security they promise. As an alternative, we describe a simple yet effective way to prevent untrusted applets from entering the user's computer. At the same time, we allow trusted applets to execute in whatever sandbox the browser provides for them. Our technique works by modifying Java class loaders and can be extended to provide fine-grained access control for Java applets. 1 Introduction One especially interesting topic in the realm of Internet security is that of mobile code. While users browse the World Wide Web, programs [...] - known variously as applet [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Digital Crime is {{the latest}} {{terrorist}} who can intrude into any domain by breaking any type of <b>firewall</b> or secret <b>code</b> without frittering even a single drop of blood. To fight this terror, a cryptic army was evolved but {{not good enough to}} succeed. As a consequence, an effective commando namely steganography has been evolved who can combat any type of destructive intrusion. In this paper, Space Filling Curve (SFC) and RBG colour compound stego action against the threat of digital crime has been proposed. The proposed stego system scans the colour image pixel by pixel along a complex path, not row by row, and hides the variable k bit of the secret data in each pixel visited in the order defined by a Space-Filling Curve (SFC) such as the Hilbert curve and the Moore curve traversing paths. Such curves visit each pixel in the color image which is split into Red, Green and Blue components. The effectiveness of the proposed stego system has been estimated by computing bit error rate (BER), Mean square error(MSE),Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean Structural Similarity index(MSSIM). This paper also illustrates how security has been enhanced using this algorithm...|$|R
