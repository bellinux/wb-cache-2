5|$|After {{living in}} his new house for three years, Big Jim died of {{tuberculosis}} on October14, 1858. His widow, Elizabeth, {{lived in the house}} until after the Civil War. In 1867 or 1869, she sold the house, the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number20 to Charles Harmison (1823–1896) for $8,500, moving with her remaining children to Missouri (where she died in 1883). The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional, war-related <b>financial</b> <b>stress</b> from which the family could not recover.|$|E
5|$|At age 21, O'Brien {{retired after}} the 1968 Olympics, {{so he could}} {{concentrate}} solely on making a living. Since his father's death in 1962, O'Brien's swimming career had caused substantial <b>financial</b> <b>stress</b> for his family, with his mother having to sell the family home to make ends meet. O'Brien had also been forced to leave high school before he had completed his leaving certificate, {{so that he could}} support the family's income by wrapping parcels. Television and camera work had always interested O'Brien, and he secured a job as a stagehand for Channel Nine after returning from the Tokyo Olympics, which he held for more than ten years. He then worked for Channel Ten for two years, before working for an independent production company for another two years. In 1979, he started Videopak, which became one of the largest privately owned television documentary companies in Australia. Videopak's sound stages were used by public and private television companies. O'Brien was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2000, he received an Australian Sports Medal.|$|E
5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable <b>financial</b> <b>stress</b> on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the influenza pandemic in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E

40|$|Evidence abounds on the {{propagation}} of <b>financial</b> <b>stresses</b> originating in the US mortgage market to banking systems worldwide through international funding markets. But the transmission of this external funding shock to the real economy via bank lending is underexamined, given the central importance ascribed to this channel of contagion by policymakers. This paper provides evidence {{of the role of}} globalized banks in transmitting <b>financial</b> <b>stresses</b> to the real economy during the global financial crisis. A novel dataset is constructed from quarterly balance sheet reports provided by all UK-resident banks to the Bank of England. I find that the shock to bank funding from non-resident creditors was transmitted domestically through a significant reduction in bank credit supply. A range of instrumental variables is used to correct for endogeneity and omitted variable bias, and the results are robust to various sensitivity tests. Resident subsidiaries and branches of foreignowned banks reduced lending by a larger amount than domestically-owned banks, while the latter calibrated the reduction in domestic lending more closely {{to the size of the}} funding shock. Key words: Liquidity shock, financial crisis, transmission mechanism, bank lending, instrumental variables...|$|R

25|$|Overview Many {{urban water}} and {{wastewater}} utilities in China experience <b>financial</b> <b>stress,</b> because user fees are set well below cost recovery levels and government subsidies are insufficient to cover the resulting gap. In 2004, 60% of urban water utilities reported negative net incomes. The financial situation of wastewater utilities {{is expected to be}} even more precarious. Tariffs have increased by 50% since 1998 and now stand at 1.5 RMB/m3 or US$0.20/m3. These rates are insufficient to cover costs.|$|E

Contract rates were lower than the established going rates. Tensions flared. Non contractors refused to cart for the storekeepers and went “on strike” rallying against “non-union” rates. Two hundred and fifty camels at 32 Mile Well were unhobbled and scattered into the scrub. Camel loads were flung to the ground. The dispute was eventually settled after police and officials from both Perth and the local area intervened and facilitated discussions between the opposing parties. Troubles resurfaced periodically - three years later agreement was reached to almost double cartage rates, but it had been a period of <b>financial</b> <b>stress</b> to the cameleers.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even {{for those who are}} employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003.

The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option. One indicator of the consequences of Americans' inconsistent health care coverage is a study in Health Affairs that concluded that half of personal bankruptcys involved medical bills, although other sources dispute this.|$|E

500|$|In the {{interest}} of the family, rural females are sent to find urban employment over male counterparts, mainly to supplement familial income at home and to support the males, who are more likely to attend college. The male standard of education in China is higher, particularly when a family is under <b>financial</b> <b>stress,</b> females are more likely {{to drop out of school}} to generate income for the family. Because females have lesser impact on the family's long-term financial stability, their rights for opportunities development are consequently unequal. This inequality also reinforces emotional motivations for migration. Many women migrate to find personal fulfillment. Stereotypes in China that developed as a result of globalization portray rural women as [...] "‘backward’" [...] and urban women as [...] "‘modern’". Many people associate modernity with maturity, so rural women migrate to cities to be perceived as mature. Migrant women also appreciate the knowledge they obtain (including political- and self-awareness) while living in cities. Some women even report desiring to leave villages as a result of boredom with rural life. Ideas perpetuated due to globalization simultaneously increased women's intentions to become independent; many migrant workers desire lives separate from those of their families’.|$|E
