5|$|The {{result was}} a {{sequence}} of innovative but unpopular financial measures. John levied scutage payments eleven times in his seventeen years as king, as compared to eleven times in total {{during the reign of}} the preceding three monarchs. In many cases these were levied {{in the absence of any}} actual military campaign, which ran counter to the original idea that scutage was an alternative to actual military service. John maximised his right to demand relief payments when estates and castles were inherited, sometimes charging enormous sums, beyond barons' abilities to pay. Building on the successful sale of sheriff appointments in 1194, John initiated a new round of appointments, with the new incumbents making back their investment through increased <b>fines</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties,</b> particularly in the forests. Another innovation of Richard's, increased charges levied on widows who wished to remain single, was expanded under John. John continued to sell charters for new towns, including the planned town of Liverpool, and charters were sold for markets across the kingdom and in Gascony. The king introduced new taxes and extended existing ones. The Jews, who held a vulnerable position in medieval England, protected only by the king, were subject to huge taxes; £44,000 was extracted from the community by the tallage of 1210; much of it was passed on to the Christian debtors of Jewish moneylenders. John created a new tax on income and movable goods in 1207 – effectively a version of a modern income tax – that produced £60,000; he created a new set of import and export duties payable directly to the crown. John found that these measures enabled him to raise further resources through the confiscation of the lands of barons who could not pay or refused to pay.|$|E

40|$|Red light {{violation}} is {{a serious}} driving offense because of the crash risk and injury severity with which it is associated. In 2006, in Hong Kong both the <b>fine</b> <b>and</b> driver demerit <b>penalty</b> for red light violations were increased to combat the increasing trend of red light violation offenses. Public light bus (PLB) drivers constitute {{one of the most}} problematic driver groups because of their high rate of driving offenses and involvement in crashes. This study employed a stated preference (SP) survey to investigate the perceptions of PLB drivers and their attitudes towards the increase in the <b>fine</b> <b>and</b> driver demerit <b>penalty</b> imposed for red light violations, and to measure the influence of these penalties on deterring red light violations by using a multinomial logit model. Possible interventions by driver demographics and the operational characteristics of PLBs in the sensitivity measures were revealed through market segmentation analyses. Both the <b>fine</b> <b>and</b> the driver demerit penalty were significant in deterring PLB drivers from committing red light violations. In addition, the market segmentation analyses found age, marital status, educational level, income level, vehicle class, employment structure, and salary system to be significantly associated with perceptions of the increase in the <b>fine</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalty</b> among the drivers. ...|$|R

25|$|In September 1999, one of BP's US subsidiaries, BP Exploration Alaska (BPXA), {{pleaded guilty}} to {{criminal}} charges stemming from its illegally dumping of hazardous wastes on the Alaska North Slope, paying <b>fines</b> <b>and</b> <b>penalties</b> totaling $22million. BP paid the maximum $500,000 in criminal fines, $6.5million in civil penalties, and established a $15million environmental management system at all of BP facilities in the US and Gulf of Mexico that are engaged in oil exploration, drilling or production. The charges stemmed from the 1993 to 1995 dumping of hazardous wastes on Endicott Island, Alaska by BP's contractor Doyon Drilling. The firm illegally discharged waste oil, paint thinner and other toxic and hazardous substances by injecting them down the outer rim, or annuli, of the oil wells.

500|$|Businesses {{would be}} {{required}} to submit monthly or quarterly reports (depending on sales volume) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return.
