40|$|Georeferencing {{images is}} a {{laborious}} process so schemes for automating this process {{have been under}} investigation for some time. Among the most promising automatic registration algorithms aare those based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The displacement between the two given images can be computed by computing the ratio F 1 *conj(F 2) /|F 1 *F 2 |, and then applying the inverse Fourier transform. The result is an impulse-like function, which is approximately zero everywhere except at the displacement {{that is necessary to}} optimally register the images. Coverting from rectangular coordinates to log-polar coordinates, shifts representing rotation and scaling can be also determined to complete the georectification process. Our FFT-based algorithm has been successfully implemented in IDL (Interactive Data Language) and added as two user functions to an image processing software package - ENVI (ENvironment for Visualizing Images) interface. ENVI handles all pre-processing and post-processing work such as input, output, <b>display,</b> <b>filter,</b> analysis, and file management. To test this implementation, several dozen tests were conducted on both simulated and 2 ̆ 2 real world 2 ̆ 2 images. The results of these tests show advantages and limitations of this algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—Ultrasound image {{guidance}} of interventional devices during {{minimally invasive surgery}} provides the clin-ician with improved soft tissue contrast while reducing ion-izing radiation exposure. One problem with ultrasound im-age guidance is poor visualization of the device tip during the clinical procedure. We have described previously guid-ance of several interventional devices using a real-time 3 -D (RT 3 -D) ultrasound system with 3 -D color Doppler com-bined with the ColorMark technology. We then developed an analytical model for a vibrating needle to maximize the tip vibrations and improve the reliability and sensitivity of our technique. In this paper, we use the analytical model and improved radiofrequency (RF) and color Doppler fil-ters to detect two different vibrating devices in water tank experiments {{as well as in}} an in vivo canine experiment. We performed water tank experiments with four different 3 -D transducers: a 5 MHz transesophageal (TEE) probe, a 5 MHz transthoracic (TTE) probe, a 5 MHz intracardiac catheter (ICE) transducer, and a 2. 5 MHz commercial TTE probe. Each transducer was used to scan an aortic graft sus-pended in the water tank. An atrial septal puncture nee-dle and an endomyocardial biopsy forceps, each vibrating at 1. 3 kHz, were inserted into the vascular graft and were tracked using 3 -D color Doppler. Improved RF and wall filters increased the detected color Doppler sensitivity by 14 dB. In three simultaneous planes from the in vivo 3 -D scan, we identified both the septal puncture needle and the biopsy forceps within the right atrium using the 2. 5 MHz probe.

40|$|Development of an Audio-Triggered EL Wire Sequencer” California Polytechnic State University 2011, Ben Paik and John Oliver, Ph. D. (advisor) The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{investigate}} and develop a method for switching electroluminescent wire (EL wire) such {{that it can be}} activated by some audio source. EL wire is essentially a coaxial capacitor that luminesces when an alternating electric field excites the insulating phosphor layer in the wire (a 100 Vp, 1 kHz AC source is sufficient for this). The system involves the EL wire, a six channel sequencer to switch the EL wire, an method for processing the audio signal, and a microcontroller to interface these subsystems. The user selects from two modes of operation – one where each EL wire is associated with a certain frequency, triggering when a magnitude threshold is crossed and the other where each wire is associated with a magnitude threshold for a selected frequency. Both the threshold and frequency in each respective mode can be selected. Optoisolator TRAICs were initially tested as EL wire switches but failed due to their inability to handle 160 Vp from the AC driver; normal TRIACs were used instead. Similarly, FFT implementation was abandoned due to lack of memory on the ATMega 32 A microcontroller and the low sampling rate of the ADC. The MSGEQ 7, a seven-band graphic equalizer <b>display</b> <b>filter</b> was used instead to process the audio input. Free RTOS was used in the software design to achieve the response time necessary for real-time operation.

40|$|Staff from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Bechtel Nevada Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSL), and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL) {{completed}} the proposed {{work for the}} Technology Integration Project titled Integration of AMS and ERDS Measurement Data into NARAC Dispersion Models. The objectives of this project were to develop software to convert Aerial Measurement Survey (AMS) and Emergency Response Data System (ERDS) field measurement data into a standard electronic format for transmission to the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC), and to streamline aspects of the NARAC operational atmospheric dispersion modeling system to quickly process these data for use in generating consequence calculations based on refined, field measurement-based estimates of the source strength. Although NARAC continues to develop and maintain a state-of-the-art atmospheric dispersion modeling system, model predictions are constrained by the availability of information to properly characterize the source term. During an actual atmospheric release, very little may be known initially about the source material properties, amount, or release time and location. Downwind measurements often provide the best information about the scope {{and nature of the}} release. The timely integration of field measurement data with model calculations is an obvious approach toward improving the model consequence predictions. By optimizing these predictions a more accurate representation of the consequences may be provided to (a) predict contamination levels which may be below the detectable limit of sensors, but which may still pose a significant hazard, (b) determine contamination is areas where measurements have not yet been made, and (c) prioritize the locations of future measurement surveys. By automating and streamlining much of the related field measurement data processing, these optimized predictions may be provided within a significantly reduced period, and with a reduction in potential errors. The associated operational shortfalls were resolved by completing the following major tasks under this technology integration project: (1) The definition and implementation of a standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) measurement data transmission format, (2) Modification to the NARAC system Graphical User Interface (GUI) to streamline field measurement manipulation and processing within the NARAC system, (3) Modification to the NARAC graphical visualization capabilities to <b>display,</b> <b>filter,</b> and select target measurement data for further processing, (4) Improved access to statistically-oriented comparisons between model calculations and field measurement data aimed at developing a refined source term used to optimize model predictions, and (5) Rewriting of a limited legacy code which performs the calculations necessary to compare model results with field measurement data. Each of these tasks is discussed below in greater detail. The completed system was successfully used during the Dingo King exercise in August, 2005...|$|E
