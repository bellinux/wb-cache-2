40|$|Short {{take-off}} {{and vertical}} landing (STOVL) ventral nozzle concepts are investigated {{by means of}} a static cold flow scale model at a NASA facility. The internal aerodynamic performance characteristics of the cruise, transition, and vertical lift modes are considered for four ventral nozzle types. The nozzle configurations examined include those with: butterfly-type <b>inner</b> <b>doors</b> and vectoring exit vanes; circumferential <b>inner</b> <b>doors</b> and thrust vectoring vanes; a three-port segmented version with circumferential inner doors; and a two-port segmented version with cylindrical nozzle exit shells. During the testing, internal and external pressure is measured, and the thrust and flow coefficients and resultant vector angles are obtained. The <b>inner</b> <b>door</b> used for ventral nozzle flow control is found to affect performance negatively during the initial phase of transition. The best thrust performance is demonstrated by the two-port segmented ventral nozzle due to the elimination of the <b>inner</b> <b>door...</b>|$|R
