25|$|When Botvinnik {{finished}} the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education. While waiting, he qualified {{for his first}} USSR Championship final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master. He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the Proletstud, which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department. In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the Proletstud, secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where {{he was one of}} only four students who entered straight from school. As a result, he had to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> year's work in five months, and failed one of the examinations. Early in the same year he placed joint third in the semi-final stage of the USSR Championship, and thus failed to reach the final stage.|$|E
500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, Sonny and Cher's {{recording}} {{career was}} revived with four albums released under Kapp Records and MCA Records: Sonny & Cher Live (1971), All I Ever Need Is You (1972), Mama Was a Rock and Roll Singer, Papa Used to Write All Her Songs (1973), and Live in Las Vegas Vol. 2 (1973). Cher later commented on this period: [...] "I could <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> album... in three days... We {{were on the}} road... and we were doing the Sonny & Cher Show".|$|E
500|$|President Bush avoided federal antipoverty issues, {{and instead}} used Kemp as a {{mouthpiece}} {{to speak on}} the administration's low priority conservative activist agenda. Bush's contribution to the urban agenda had been volunteerism through his [...] "Points of Light" [...] theme, and Kemp received stronger support for his ideas from Presidential candidate Bill Clinton. By {{the time of the}} Los Angeles riots of 1992, Bush was a bit late in supporting enterprise zones, tenant ownership and welfare reform: [...] Mort Zuckerman compared Bush's vision on racial issues to that of a man riding backwards in a railroad car. Nonetheless, the riots made Kemp a focal point of the administration, even though at first, Kemp had been overlooked. However, Charles E. Schumer had probably summarized the prospects of Kemp's success in advance best when he said in 1989, [...] "Good ideas with money can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot. Good ideas without money aren't probably going to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot," [...] and the issue here was the decision not to fund Kemp's ideas. Although Kemp was unable to procure money for his visions, he was among the administration's leading users of first class corporate jets. He cited lingering effects from a knee injury as the reason he had to fly first class at government expense as the Housing Secretary.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} largely negative {{reviews from}} critics. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a B–, called the premise [...] "bor-ring [...] ", {{and noted that}} the episode's antagonist [...] "don't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> hell of a lot". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "B–" [...] and called the episode [...] "thoroughly mundane", especially {{in comparison to the}} preceding episode, [...] "Via Negativa". Handlen felt that [...] "because all of this is very familiar, and without any of the characters distinguishing themselves, there isn’t much reason to watch." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "'Surekill' isn't terrible, but it's far too easy to see right through." ...|$|E
500|$|Box Car Racer was {{released}} worldwide on May 21, 2002 by MCA Records. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 12 on May 30, 2002, selling 65,000 copies {{in its first}} week. The numbers were considered surprising given that the album had virtually no promotion. [...] "The overall response to this album has been ridiculous. We didn't have much push or anything, we didn't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of promo before the album came out and it still did really well," [...] said Barker. As of August 2002, it had sold 244,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. Internationally, the album charted best in Canada, where it peaked at number seven. In 2006, the album was certified gold in Canada for shipments of 50,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of [...] on the Nintendo 64 in 1996, LucasArts began {{planning}} a follow-up. At the time, Factor 5 was developing a game engine to create large terrain maps. LucasArts, pleased with earlier collaborations with the company, decided to use Factor 5's engine for its new game. The game's focus would be space combat; this direction {{was inspired by a}} level of Shadows of the Empire in which the player flies a snowspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. Rogue Squadron and Factor 5 production manager Brett Tosti stated, [...] "That whole scene was actually the genesis for Rogue Squadron because everybody said, 'Why don't you <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> game like that?' So we did." [...] Factor 5 initially pitched a concept to allow gamers to play through missions similar to the fans' favorite action sequences from the Star Wars films. This proposal was rejected, however. At that time, LucasFilm was not comfortable with video games drawing directly from the films.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the joke}} {{originally}} stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West, Parker and Stone said they realized West {{would probably be}} extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it, so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him. After {{coming up with the}} idea, Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because, Stone said, [...] "It just seemed too dumb. Are we really going to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> episode about this?" [...] Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were [...] "just a complete afterthought" [...] that came about during the writing process. During one scene in [...] "Fishsticks", Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write. This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had, then later claimed credit for the idea even though they {{had nothing to do with}} it. Stone said, [...] "They truly believe they did it. That's the really sinister part. It's not where they're trying to steal part of the glory. ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> video if you look like you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> series of shots that were happening mid-day, where {{you were going to get}} a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Peace on Earth {{met with}} a mixed {{reception}} from music critics. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising it for its [...] "wide appeal" [...] and for having [...] "a cohesive set of songs that brings out the worship aspect of the holidays" [...] and particularly praising [...] "While You Were Sleeping" [...] and [...] "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel". Andrew Greer of CCM Magazine gave it 3 out of 5 stars, regarding it as a let-down {{in comparison to the}} band's previous albums as well as holiday albums that other artists had put out. Russ Breimier of Christianity Today gave it 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as [...] "predictable". However, he praised [...] "While You Were Sleeping" [...] as an example of Mark Hall's [...] "bold, poignant songwriting". Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms gave the album a perfect 10 out of 10 stars, saying that it [...] "bucks all the trends in that it doesn't contain saccharine, sleigh bell-drenched arrangements nor those ghastly songs about Santa and chestnuts roasting in an open fire" [...] and praising it as an [...] "inventive and on occasions brilliant exploration of the wonders of the incarnation". Justin Mabee of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, praising the traditional Christmas songs on the album but criticizing the original songs as having a [...] "forced feel to them, almost like Casting Crowns wanted to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> album of traditional songs, but were told differently"; he remarked that [...] "this would have probably worked better, because the originality is lacking in these few original Christmas tunes".|$|E

We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
2500|$|IGN's Tom McNamara {{scored the}} game 8.1 out of 10, writing [...] "Ties That Bind {{is quite a}} solid romp, and a cut above most of the games in the genre that are marred by poor controls, poor balancing, {{annoying}} music, bad voice acting, thin stories, {{and a host of}} other problems that define the vast middle ground. Surreal Software has a very clear and detailed vision of the location and the people and tortured souls that populate it, an intuitive and smooth control scheme, and a dripping, engaging atmosphere of unpredictable nightmare." [...] Like other critics, however, he felt the game didn't build on the original sufficiently; [...] "it doesn't <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot to expand on the theme of the original -- nightmare prison visions come alive, ghosts that kill, and churning violence [...] Still, if you liked the original, you should like Ties That Bind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] he replied, warmly; [...] "chromos cannot {{accomplish}} the object. They are too expensive; and, besides, {{they are not}} the real thing. They are printed, not painted; and what the public wants is the real thing, the work of the brush; and that is what I give them. The pictures you see here, and an immense stock besides, are all copies of valuable paintings, many of them in the finest galleries of Europe. I sell no originals. I guarantee everything to be a copy. Honesty is at the bottom of all I do. But my copies are exactly like the originals; that is all I claim. I would like, sir, to show you through my establishment, and let you see how I am carrying on the great work of art education. There are picture-dealers in this city, sir, plenty of them, who try to make the public believe that the vile daubs they sell are originals, and the works of well-known painters; and when they do admit that the picture is a copy, they say it is the work of some distinguished student; that there is no other copy in the country; or they make some other misstatement about it. These people conceal their processes, but their tricks are beginning to be well known to the public. Now, sir, I conceal nothing. The day for that sort of thing is past. I want men of influence to know the facilities I have for the production of art-work upon a grand scale. We will first go into the basement. Sir," [...] said he, as I followed him down-stairs, [...] "you know how the watch-making business has been revolutionized by the great companies which manufacture watches by machinery. The slow, uncertain, and expensive work of the poor toilers who made watches by hand has been superseded by the swift, unerring, and beautiful operations of machinery and steam. Now, sir, the great purpose of my life is to introduce machinery into art, and, ultimately, steam. And yet I will have no shams, no chromos. Everything shall be real--the work of the brush. Here, sir," [...] he continued, showing me into a long room filled with workmen, [...] "you see the men engaged in putting together the frames on which to stretch my canvases. Every stick is cut, planed, and jointed at a mill in Vermont, and sent on here by the car-load. Beyond are the workmen cutting up, stretching, and preparing the canvas, bales upon bales of which are used in a day. At the far end are the mills for grinding and mixing colors. And now we will go to the upper floors, and see the true art-work. Here, sir," [...] he said, continuing to talk as we walked through the rooms on the various floors, [...] "is the landscape and marine department. That row of men are putting in skies; they do nothing else. Each has his copy before him, and, day after day, month after month, paints nothing but that sky; and of course he does it with great rapidity and fidelity. Above, on those shelves, are sky-pots of every variety; blue-serene pots, tempest pots, sunset pots in compartments, morning-gray pots, and many others. Then the work passes to the middle-ground painters, who have their half-tone pots within easy reach. After that the foreground men take it up, and the figurists put in the men and animals. That man there has been painting that foreground cow ever since the first of August. He can now put her in three and a half times in fifteen minutes, and will probably rise to sixteen cows an hour {{by the end of this}} month. These girls do nothing but put white-caps to waves. There's a great demand at present for the windy marine. This next room is devoted to portraits to order. You see that row of old ladies without heads, each holding a pair of spectacles, and with one finger in the Bible to keep the place; that's very popular, and we put in a head when the photograph is sent. There is a great rage at present for portraits of babies without any clothes on. Here is a lot of undraped infants with bodies all finished, but with no heads. We can finish them to order at very short notice. I have one girl who puts in all the dimples. You would be surprised to see what a charming dimple she can make with one twist of her brush. Long practice at one thing, sir, is the foundation of the success of this great establishment. Take that girl away from her dimple-pot, and she is nothing. She is now upstairs, putting dimples into a large Correggio order from the West. This next room is our figure department, battle-pieces, groups, single figures, everything. As you have seen before, each man only copies from the original that part which is his specialty. In addition to its other advantages, this system is a great protection to us. None of my men can work at home at nights and Sundays, and forge pictures. Not one of them can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> one. And now, sir, you have seen the greater part of my establishment. The varnishing, packing, and storage rooms are in another building. I am now perfecting plans for the erection of an immense edifice with steam-engines in the cellar, in which my paintings shall be done by machinery. No chromos, mind you, but real oil-paintings, done by brushes revolving on cylinders. I shall have rolls of canvas a mile long, like the paper on which our great dailies are printed, and the machines shall do everything; cut off the picture, when it has passed among the cylinders, whereupon fresh canvas will be rolled in for a new one; another machine will stretch them; and they will pass through a varnish bath in the twinkling of an eye. But this is in the future. What I want of you, sir, and of other men of influence in society, is to let our people know of the great good that is ready for them now, and of the greater benefit that is coming. And, more than that, you can do incalculable good to our artists. Those poor toilers on the solitary canvas should know how to become prosperous, great, and happy; tell them to go into some other business. And now, sir, I must see what I can do for you. We will return to my gallery, and I will show you exactly what you want." ...|$|E
