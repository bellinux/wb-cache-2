In this paper we analyze credit risk transfer relying on a unique data set on European collateralized debt obligations (CDO).

The cross-sectional analysis reveals that beta rises significantly more if the issuing bank is financially weak (low profitability and high leverage) and is domiciled in a bank-based financial system.
