50|$|Differential fringes {{which remain}} as fringes in the {{differential}} interferogram {{are a result}} of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite look direction causes an increase in path (translating to phase) difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in <b>differential</b> <b>interferometry</b> one fringe cycle − to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring subsidence movement, slope stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR. Further advancement to this technique whereby <b>differential</b> <b>interferometry</b> from satellite SAR ascending pass and descending pass can be used to estimate 3-D ground movement. Research in this area has shown accurate measurements of 3-D ground movement with accuracies comparable to GPS based measurements can be achieved.|$|E

40|$|Affected {{by natural}} and human-induced factors, {{cultural}} heritage sites and their surroundings face threats of structural instability and land displacement.

40|$|Two image-to-image patch offset {{techniques}} for estimating feature motion between satellite {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) images are discussed. Intensity tracking, based on patch intensity cross-correlation optimization, and coherence tracking, based on patch coherence optimization, are used to estimate the movement of glacier surfaces between two SAR images in both slant-range and azimuth direction. The accuracy and application range of the two methods are examined {{in the case of}} the surge of Monacobreen in Northern Svalbard between 1992 and 1996. Offset-tracking procedures of SAR images are an alternative to <b>differential</b> SAR <b>interferometry</b> for the estimation of glacier motion when <b>differential</b> SAR <b>interferometry</b> is limited by loss of coherence, i. e., in the case of rapid and incoherent flow and of large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images.

50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>interferometry</b> (D-InSAR) {{requires}} taking {{at least}} two images with addition of a DEM. The DEM can be either produced by GPS measurements or could be generated by interferometry {{as long as the}} time between acquisition of the image pairs is short, which guarantees minimal distortion of the image of the target surface. In principle, 3 images of the ground area with similar image acquisition geometry is often adequate for D-InSar. The principle for detecting ground movement is quite simple. One interferogram is created from the first two images; this is also called the reference interferogram or topographical interferogram. A second interferogram is created that captures topography + distortion. Subtracting the latter from the reference interferogram can reveal differential fringes, indicating movement. The described 3 image D-InSAR generation technique is called 3-pass or double-difference method.|$|E
