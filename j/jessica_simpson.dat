Singing, to her, represents a physical challenge, not an emotional unburdening." [...] While reviewing Music Box, Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with [...] "sustained passion," [...] while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments, Carey becomes [...] "too overwhelmed to put her passion into words." [...] In 2001, The Village Voice wrote in regards to what they considered Carey's [...] "centerless ballads," [...] writing, [...] "Carey's Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen-pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless Diane Warren ballads ..... it's largely because of Blige that the new R&B demands a greater range of emotional expression, smarter poetry, more from-the-gut testifying, and less sic unnecessary notes than the squeaky-clean and just plain squeaky Mariah era.
