5|$|Ancient Greek art, {{as found}} in pottery and other remains, {{frequently}} depicts scenes associated with Troilus' death: the ambush, the pursuit, the murder <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fight over his body. Depictions of Troilus in other contexts are unusual. One such exception, a red-figure vase painting from Apulia c.340BC, shows Troilus as a child with Priam.|$|E
5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak {{shear force}} or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

5|$|During {{the march}} to Kediri, the Mataram–VOC army purposefully split <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> columns took different, {{indirect}} routes to Kediri, {{as suggested by}} Amangkurat. This enabled the army to meet more factions and to win over those with wavering allegiance. The army marched through areas previously unexplored by the Dutch. The Dutch account was recorded in a journal by Hurdt's secretary Johan Jurgen Briel. Accounts of the campaign also appear in babads (Javanese chronicles).|$|E
5|$|Euston {{railway station}} opened in 1837, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> station {{was built on}} the northern boundary. Other termini north of London followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were outside the built-up area, making them inconvenient.|$|E
5|$|For Pellew, {{the victory}} was an {{encouraging}} {{sign of the}} weakness of the Dutch squadron. In October, Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron. Two ships of the line escaped Pellew's attack, but they were old and in a poor state of repair, and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807.|$|E

5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 1918, the 1st Battalion was in front-line {{trenches}} near St. Quentin {{when the}} German Army launched Operation Michael, the opening attack in their Spring Offensive. The battalion was virtually wiped out, losing 19 officers and 662 {{men in the}} attack <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> withdrawal which followed. The battalion was subsequently re-formed, {{and in the last}} weeks of the war in October 1918 took part in the Battle of the Selle, in which it suffered nearly 200 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, {{partly because of the}} costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to save money. There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|The badges for inductees are of {{a similar}} design to the sovereign's badge, though without {{precious}} stones, and slight differences for each grade.

All are topped by a St. Edward's Crown, symbolizing that the order is headed by the sovereign, and the reverse is plain except for the word CANADA.|$|E

5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of an}} upper-level low {{just west}} of the Canary Islands on September28. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460mi, 740km) southwest of São Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October4, convection increased as the surface low organized <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> system became a subtropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the terms}} of the 1852 {{agreement}} and Act of Parliament establishing the London Necropolis Company, the LSWR (after 1923 the SR) provided the locomotives and crew for London Necropolis Railway operations. There was no dedicated LNC locomotive, and the trains were worked by whichever suitable engine happened to be available. (Before the 1864 improvements to Necropolis Junction, locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line <b>itself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses.) Towards the end of the railway's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives, usually No.255.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the School's operation, the {{character}} of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London. In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station, including a station at Bruce Grove, close to Bruce Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle <b>itself,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> waterlogged floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm.|$|E
