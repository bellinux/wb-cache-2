40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Brazilian Central Region, {{flowering}} of Paspalum atratum cv.

Use of combine harvesters is an excellent option Pojuca seed production areas because, besides this concentrated flowering and uniform seed maturation, this cultivar presents lon flowering stems which expose the seed heads above the plant canopy. Good agronomical practices regarding choice of the area, tillage, fertilization, seed bed preparation, seeding, weed control will assure the a high seed yield in Pojuca grass.

50|$|The {{possibility}} of lava <b>flows</b> <b>cutting</b> off the harbour {{was the most}} significant threat facing the town. One contingency plan devised, should the harbour be closed off, was to cut through a low sand spit {{on the north side}} of the island to provide a new channel into the harbour, but it was hoped that if the lava flow could be slowed, this would not be necessary. Lava flows had been sprayed with water in attempts to slow them in Hawaii and on Mount Etna, but these had been rather small-scale operations with limited success. However, Professor Þorbjörn Sigurgeirsson carried out an experiment that proved that further advances of the lava could be impeded by prematurely solidifying the advancing lava-flow front.|$|R

40|$|Several {{cryogenic}} targets must be injected each second into {{a reaction}} chamber. Required target speed is about 100 m/s. Required {{accuracy of the}} driver beams on target is a few hundred micrometers. Fuel strength is calculated to allow acceleration in excess of 10, 000 m/s{sup 2 } if the fuel temperature is less than 17 K. A 0. 1 {mu}m thick dual membrane will allow nearly 2, 000 m/s{sup 2 } acceleration. Acceleration is gradually increased and decreased over a few membrane oscillation periods (a few ms), to avoid added stress from vibrations which could otherwise cause a factor of two decrease in allowed acceleration. Movable shielding allows multiple targets to be in flight toward the reaction chamber at once while minimizing neutron heating of subsequent targets. The use of multiple injectors is recommended for redundancy which increases availability and allows a higher pulse rate. Gas gun, rail gun, induction accelerator, and electrostatic accelerator target injection devices are studied, and compared. A gas gun is the preferred device for indirect-drive targets due to its simplicity and proven reliability. With the gas gun, the amount of gas required for each target (about 10 to 100 mg) is acceptable. A revolver loading mechanism is recommended with a cam operated poppet valve to control the gas <b>flow.</b> <b>Cutting</b> vents near the muzzle of the gas gun barrel is recommended to improve accuracy and aid gas pumping. If a railgun is used, we recommend an externally applied magnetic field to reduce required current by an order of magnitude. Optical target tracking is recommended. Up/down counters are suggested to predict target arrival time. Target steering is shown to be feasible and would avoid the need to actively point the beams. Calculations show that induced tumble from electrostatically steering the target is not excessive...|$|E

Foram analisados pH, Eh, turbidez, nitrato, nitrito, amônia e os elementos Cl, F, Si, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Al, As, Mn, P, Sb, Ba, Cr, Fe, Se, Sn, Cd, Cu, Pb e Zn, em dois períodos, no final do período chuvoso e na estiagem, em 18 poços e cacimbas. De acordo com os resultados obtidos, a água está comprometida para consumo humano na quase totalidade dos poços amostrados, em conseqüência dos elevados teores de Al, Fe, As, Cd, Pb, Sb e Se, dos compostos nitrogenados e também por contaminações pontuais de Mn e Zn.

30|$|Tomren et al. (1986) {{published}} {{the results of}} experimental studies with various drilling fluids in plastic pipe lines with inclination angle from 0 ° to 90 °. They stated that for a constant mud flow rate cutting bed thickness increased by increasing inclination angle. Also, they called the angle between 40 ° and 50 ° as critical angle since cutting bed thickness is formed and cuttings are slipped on the cutting bed in the critical angle. Ford et al. (1990) studied drilling cutting transport in deviated wells. They used a pipe line with 9  ft length, inclination angle from 0 ° to 90 ° and 3.5  in. internal diameter. The results of their work showed that flow regime and rheological properties of the drilling fluid are the key parameters in well cleaning operation and water with turbulence flow has a good performance in well cleaning. Horeland et al. (1993) investigated lime cutting transport in water base mud and invert emulsion oil base mud. They stated that for both muds with same rheological properties, water base mud has a better performance in the wells with 40 °– 50 ° inclination. Okrajni and Azar (1986) examined the effect of mud rheology on the annulus cleaning. The result of their experiments showed that mud rheology properties have a low effect on the cutting transport in turbulence flow, and in laminar <b>flow,</b> <b>cutting</b> transport is done better by increasing mud yield point. Sifferman and Becker (1992) accomplished a set of cutting transport experiments in deviated wells with deviation angle from 45 ° to 90 °. They investigated the effect of various parameters on cutting transport such as drilling fluid velocity, density and rheological properties of mud, mud type, cutting size, ROP, RPM, drill pipe eccentricity, drilling pipe diameter and well angle. Based on their experiments, velocity and mud density are the most effective parameters on the well cleaning. Also, formed drilling cuttings beds make a slop from 45 ° to 60 ° in which they make slippage of cutting on the bed. Shadizadeh and Zoveidavianpoor (2012) carried out experiments for {{the investigation of the}} effect of various parameters on well cleaning in the lowest possible velocity of cutting transport and compared their model with Larsen numerical model (Larsen et al. 1997). They expressed that well angle is the most effective parameter in the well cleaning, and the worse condition of cutting transport is observed at 70 °.|$|E

The <b>cutting</b> models in the chip flow are determined to calculate the cutting energy using the orthogonal cutting data. Then, the chip flow direction is determined to minimize the cutting energy. The cutting force can be predicted in the determined chip <b>flow</b> model. The <b>cutting</b> force with anisotropy in the material is modeled as {{the change in the}} shear stress on the shear plane. The shear stress changes with the edge orientation angle. The cutting force prediction is verified in drilling of a titanium alloy. The anisotropic parameters are identified to minimize the model error between the measured and the predicted cutting forces.
