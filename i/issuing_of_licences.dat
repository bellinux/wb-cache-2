500|$|By 1927, Cobby {{had been}} {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and the following year went to England to attend RAF Staff College, Andover. [...] Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of No.3 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, from Squadron Leader Frank Lukis on 13January 1930. At this time, the position of No.3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base. Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail. In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Richard Williams, arrived for an inspection and found the base to be {{in such a state}} of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as [...] "an almighty dressing down", threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up. Having handed over to Squadron Leader Bill Bostock on 22November 1931, Cobby was promoted to wing commander on 1May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence. [...] In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately {{led to the formation of}} the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No.1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of Queensland and the Northern Territory provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World WarII. Restless in the inter-war years, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as Australian Airmen and Popular Flying. His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection, the <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.|$|E

40|$|Seven {{hundred and}} twenty drug {{formulations}} collected from retail pharmacies and drug stores were analysed. Three {{hundred and twenty}} (44. 4 %) were syrups and 400 (55. 6 %) were mixtures. Total viable aerobic count for the formulations were determined using the plate count method, and the organisms isolated were identified by conventional microbiological/biochemical methods. The study revealed that microbial growth in mixtures was 49. 0 % and in syrups 42. 8 %; however, this difference was not significant. Different organisms were identified from the two formulations and their distribution pattern {{was found to be}} significantly different. It was shown that Gram-negative rods were found only in mixtures. Potential pathogens isolated were found more in mixtures (10. 5 %) than in syrups (0. 3 %). Mixtures of Magnesium trisilicate, Kaolin and Belladona, contained more potential pathogens as compared {{to the rest of the}} mixtures. Water used during manufacturing of the formulations was considered to be the main source of contamination. Of concern was the presence of potential pathogenic / iv microbes in high numbers. The extreme degradative nature of the Pseudomonas and many yeast cells isolated should make one seriously consider the possible degree of drug destruction. In view of the above findings, it is recommended that the authorities responsible for <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> for drug manufacturing should be more strict, and adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) should be emphasized. In addition, every manufacturing unit must have a functioning water purification system, and there should be frequent inspection of the microbial quality of locally manufactured drug formulations. Strong warning should be given for non-compliance and if necessary legal action be taken. The findings of this study, provide baseline information which may be of use in an attempt to improve the quality of pharmaceutical products and in setting up local standards in Tanzania...|$|E

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScAssessing groundwater-surface water {{interaction}} as a decision-making tool licensing {{water use}} South Africa: Case study area of Gevonden Farm {{is the title}} of the current study with the context that arises from the use of GRAII methodology which uses quaternary catchment boundaries for groundwater abstraction water use licence application assessment during decision making. The problem is that the quaternary catchment scale approach does not provide the scientific bases for site specific scale. The current study argues that such approach provides realistic, practical information at site specific scale and therefore informs the <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>licences</b> more accurately. The aim of the current study is to improve understanding of how the assessment of groundwater abstraction water use licence should be carried out at a site specific scale to improve decision making during licence issuance. The objective of the study is to outline the scientific study and demonstrate how the investigation that leads to the decision making can be conducted. The study was carried out using hydraulic methods such as pumping test and geochemical analysis method. Hydraulic properties were determined and chemical elements were analysed for and compared with the SANS 241 water quality standards for domestic and agricultural use. Hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity (K), transmissivity (T), yield and storativity (S) were determined. Major and minor ions that are required to be analysed for domestic and agricultural water use were analysed. Piper diagrams and FC method were used to analyse data. The piper diagrams plotted indicated that surface water is mixing with groundwater and that means there is connection between groundwater and surface water. The chemical elements analysed for were compared with SANS 241 water quality standards for domestic and agricultural use. The water quality on the investigated site can be categorized as having good water quality. A sustainable yield estimated from the two boreholes (BH 03 and BH 05) which was 1. 02 Ɩ/s. The available drawdown estimated with reference to the boreholes water strikes that were determined by EC profiling were 135 mbgl from both boreholes. The study recommends the issuance of water use licence with conditions that chemistry of water should be analysed for once a quarter and boreholes water levels should be analysed for once a month...|$|E
