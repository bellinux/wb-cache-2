5|$|The {{calculations}} of Jerry Alisandros {{and the other}} mass tort lawyers are based on their previous experience. Several times before they had caught Varrick marketing seriously faulty drugs, as well as ruthlessly trying out their products in Third World countries. In all these cases, Varrick preferred to negotiate lucrative compensations for these lawyers' clients, of which the lawyers <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> cut. Alisandros expects the same to happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read about in a magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

25|$|Jackson intercepted another {{pass on the}} Raiders' next {{drive and}} {{returned}} it 25 yards to Oakland's 45-yard line, making Jackson the first player ever to record 2 interceptions {{in the first half}} of the Super Bowl. However, the Buccaneers were unable to take advantage of the turnover and were forced to punt. Fortunately for Tampa Bay, they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> assist from their punter Tom Tupa, who managed to pin Oakland all the way back at their own 11-yard line with his punt. The Raiders could not move the ball either, losing 1 yard on 3 plays with their ensuing drive.

Once again the Lions <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> boost from their special teams unit, this time a 27-yard return by Eric Lynch that gave them a first down on the Packers 49. Detroit subsequently drove to the Green Bay 11, including a 3-yard sneak by Krieg on fourth down and 1. But {{over the next three}} plays, Sanders gained two yards, Krieg threw an incomplete pass, and then he was sacked by linebacker Bryce Paup for a 6-yard loss.

500|$|Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims, the Red Queen. She is an {{amalgamation}} of two Carroll characters: the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts. Her {{first name}} is a play on the word [...] because she is easily irritated, obstreperous, impatient, and quick to anger.

Lichtenstein not only redesigned the space, but also altered the position of Donald's body and fishing rod for better balance and eliminated signs of stress and exertion to form a meticulous composition. Walt Disney said about Donald Duck: [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mouth, a big belligerent eye, a twistable neck and a substantial backside that's highly flexible. The duck comes near being the animator's ideal subject." [...] Lichtenstein's painting reflects many of these physical features.|$|E
