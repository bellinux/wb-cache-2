40|$|This conference paper {{examines}} experimental <b>design</b> exercises <b>on</b> {{a simulated}} model {{in relation to}} <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> a physical model. In the initial design phases, the process of <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> both a haptic and digital model is analysed {{with regard to the}} didactic objectives. In this context, only form-related aesthetic aspects are discussed. The starting point is the didactic necessity of imparting to students the process of <b>designing</b> <b>on</b> spatial models. Reduced to form determination, the question examined is for which aspects of design theory the potentials of real and virtual models, {{as well as of the}} interaction of both types, can be exploited...|$|R

Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available, and based his <b>designs</b> <b>on</b> these. Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites, though by 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell services would open with the motorway.|$|E

5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the wind tunnel, they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new wind tunnel results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their <b>designs</b> <b>on</b> their own calculations.|$|E
