500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of it is tough or stringy. It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E
500|$|After its release, Born This Way: The Remix {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. It earned an overall score of 57 out of 100, on review aggregator site Metacritic. Jason Lipshultz from Billboard {{commented that the}} album did not re-invent anything new in terms of remix composition, but instead [...] "gives less recognizable artists a platform to tinker with these complex pop schemes." [...] He added that the album is not essential listening for non-Gaga diehards, [...] "but electronica fans who have yet to drink the Mother Monster kool-aid will find plenty of pristinely produced club tracks to groove to. The album is a great avenue for fans to digest new versions of their favorite songs of the year, as well as discover artists {{that are trying to}} command audiences the way Gaga so masterfully does." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave the album three out of five stars, commenting that [...] "some remixes take considerable liberty, ditching verses or hooks, whatever catches their fancy. So, it’s a remix album not for fairweather travelers but rather the hardcore Little Monsters, the <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> love every gesture grand or small from Gaga, but it also displays enough imagination to appeal to those listeners who fall into neither camp and are only looking for some darkly elastic dance." [...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix. And, unlike many remix albums featuring one song reworked again and again, this Remix comprises a diverse tracklist to match the diverse list of remixers." ...|$|E

Five of a <b>kind!</b> <b>Who</b> would want to draw against that kind of hand?" [...] Charlie Chaplin was once asked what he {{considered to be the}} most beautiful sight that he had ever seen.

2500|$|Writing in the Financial Times Italian Jurist Antonio Cassese who was {{the first}} President of the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia argued that critics of the report were relying {{primarily}} on ad hominem and strawman attacks. He argued that [...] "critics have given inaccurate descriptions of the report's findings" [...] and that [...] "those who claim the mission's mandate was biased against Israel seem to have ignored a significant fact: Justice Goldstone, whose mission was initially asked to look into alleged violations only by Israel, demanded—and received—a change of mandate to include attacks by Hamas." [...] Furthermore, he argued that many critics of the report [...] "have launched personal attacks on Justice Goldstone's character" [...] and some critics have even gone as far as labeling Goldstone, who is Jewish, [...] "an 'anti-Semite' of a <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> 'despise and hate our own people'".|$|E
2500|$|The film largely {{follows the}} novel, {{with a few}} exceptions. The {{character}} of Pellisier, the rival perfumer, never appears in the novel; he is only ever alluded to by Baldini and others. Grenouille himself, although speaking little in the film, speaks much less in the novel. The novel covers at length his solo life in the mountain, and in his cave, which is treated much more briefly in the film, and in the novel he becomes accustomed to living almost in a torpor with no other beings around. After leaving, in the novel he spends considerable time as the guest of [...] Marquis de La Taillade-Espinasse, who wishes to use him to prove pseudoscientific theories about altitude and health; this is cut in the film which describes him travelling directly to Grasse. In Grasse, in the novel, he learns the arts of perfume extraction {{but there is no}} description by Baldini in Paris, of [...] "12 notes" [...] with a [...] "13th note" [...] to command the others, as in the film - in the novel his sole motive is to obtain the scent of a rare kind of person - the <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> inspires love.|$|E
2500|$|Dahl's children's {{works are}} usually told {{from the point}} of view of a child. They {{typically}} involve adult villains who hate and mistreat children, and feature at least one [...] "good" [...] adult to counteract the villain(s). These stock characters are possibly a reference to the abuse that Dahl stated that he experienced in the boarding schools he attended. Dahl's books see the triumph of the child; children's book critic Amanda Craig said, [...] "He was unequivocal that it is the good, young and <b>kind</b> <b>who</b> triumph over the old, greedy and the wicked." [...] While his whimsical fantasy stories feature an underlying warm sentiment, they usually contain a lot of darkly comic and grotesque scenarios, including gruesome violence. The Witches, George's Marvellous Medicine and Matilda are examples of this formula. The BFG follows it in a more analogous way with the good giant (the BFG or [...] "Big Friendly Giant") representing the [...] "good adult" [...] archetype and the other giants being the [...] "bad adults". This formula is also somewhat evident in Dahl's film script for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Class-conscious themes also surface in works such as Fantastic Mr Fox and Danny, the Champion of the World where the unpleasant wealthy neighbours are outwitted.|$|E
