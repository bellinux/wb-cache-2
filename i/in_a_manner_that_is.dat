5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection. Prions composed of the prion protein (PrP) are believed to be the cause of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) among other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a {{is less than}} b and b is less than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which must be very carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E

25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an {{adverse possession}} claim are different in each state, adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor. These are that the disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> open and notorious, keep out others, and use {{it as if it were}} his own.

25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E

25|$|After World War I, further {{advances}} {{were made}} in the field of intratracheal anesthesia. Among these were those made by Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986). Working at the Queen's Hospital for Facial and Jaw Injuries in Sidcup with plastic surgeon Sir Harold Gillies (1882–1960) and anesthetist E. Stanley Rowbotham (1890–1979), Magill developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation. Magill devised a new type of angulated forceps (the Magill forceps) that are still used today to facilitate nasotracheal intubation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> little changed from Magill's original technique. Other devices invented by Magill include the Magill laryngoscope blade, as well as several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill.|$|E
25|$|Berkshire's class A shares {{sold for}} $281,000.00 , making them the highest-priced shares on the New York Stock Exchange, {{in part because}} they have never had a stock split and have only paid a {{dividend}} once since Warren Buffett took over, retaining corporate earnings on its balance sheet <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> impermissible for mutual funds. Shares closed over $100,000 {{for the first time on}} October 23, 2006. Despite its size, Berkshire had for many years not been included in broad stock market indices such as the S 500 due to the lack of liquidity in its shares; however, following a 50-to-1 split of Berkshire's class B shares in January 2010, and Berkshire's announcement that it would acquire the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, parent of BNSF Railway, Berkshire replaced BNSF in the S 500 on February 16, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, DGs {{have had}} a {{different}} approach to linear order (word order) than constituency grammars. Dependency-based structures are minimal compared to their constituency-based counterparts, and these minimal structures allow one to focus intently on the two ordering dimensions. Separating the vertical dimension (hierarchical order) from the horizontal dimension (linear order) is easily accomplished. This aspect of dependency-based structures has allowed DGs, starting with Tesnière (1959), to focus on hierarchical order <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hardly possible for constituency grammars. For Tesnière, linear order was secondary to hierarchical order insofar as hierarchical order preceded linear order in the mind of a speaker. The stemmas (trees) that Tesnière produced reflected this view; they abstracted away from linear order to focus almost entirely on hierarchical order. Many DGs that followed Tesnière adopted this practice, that is, they produced tree structures that reflect hierarchical order alone, e.g.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{finding that}} a {{decision}} or {{order of a}} public authority is unconstitutional, the High Court may grant a mandatory order (formerly known as mandamus) to compel the authority to perform its duties <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consistent with the Constitution. Although there {{has yet to be}} any constitutional case where a mandatory order has been granted, {{it is likely that the}} Singapore courts will adopt the same legal principles that apply in administrative law. In the latter, the Court has held that it cannot use a mandatory order to direct how and in what manner a public body should perform its duty. Hence, the Court cannot direct the public body to adopt a particular decision but can only order the body to re-consider its prior decision without lapsing into the unlawfulness that affected it. This is based on the well-settled principle that a reviewing court is limited to determining the legality, and must not deal with the substantive merits, of a decision.|$|E
25|$|ATP is {{hydrolysed}} relatively rapidly {{just after}} {{the addition of a}} G-actin monomer to the filament. There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectoral, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been hydrolysed. In either case, the resulting Pi is not released, it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin’s ADP, in this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin. The amount of each one of these species present in a filament depends on its length and state: as elongation commences the filament has an approximately equal amount of actin monomers bound with ATP and ADP+Pi and a small amount of ADP-Actin at the (-) end. As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip.|$|E
25|$|Resolving the {{statutory}} conflict {{in this way}} allows the disparate-impact prohibition to work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>manner</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> consistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores {{on the basis of}} race. See §2000e–2(l). Examinations like those administered by the City create legitimate expectations {{on the part of those}} who took the tests. As is the case with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters here invested substantial time, money, and personal commitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests can be an important part of a neutral selection system that safeguards against the very racial animosities Title VII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefighters saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reliance upon race-based statistics. If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candidates' race, §2000e–2(l), then it follows a fortiori that it may not take the greater step of discarding the test altogether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of promotion-eligible candidates— absent a strong basis in evidence that the test was deficient and that discarding the results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate-impact provision. Restricting an employer's ability to discard test results (and thereby discriminate against qualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in keeping with Title VII's express protection of bona fide promotional examinations.|$|E
