25|$|Following {{a disappointing}} mid-week {{exit from the}} Coppa Italia, islanders Palermo visited the Tardini, having failed to score in each of their {{previous}} six away league games. Parma had the better {{of much of the}} first half with Giovinco looking a threat and going close on a couple of occasions, but Palermo came back strongly at the beginning of second half. However, as the second half wore on, Parma again looked the better of the two teams, but neither side were able to get the decisive goal and the match ended goalless. This was Parma's <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> of the season, having been the only side in the league without one and the <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> at the Tardini since February after twelve consecutive games without a draw at the Ducali's home ground.|$|E

25|$|First we {{consider}} the Wallenius model. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> is 1000/2000 = ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the second draw, {{under the condition that}} it was not taken in the <b>first</b> <b>draw,</b> is 999/1999 ≈ ½. The probability that the red ball is not taken in the third draw, under the condition that it was not taken in the first two draws, is 998/1998 ≈ ½. Continuing in this way, we can calculate that the probability of not taking the red ball in n draws is approximately 2−n as long as n is small compared to N. In other words, the probability of not taking a very heavy ball in n draws falls almost exponentially with n in Wallenius’ model. The exponential function arises because the probabilities for each draw are all multiplied together.|$|E

In 1916, the Australian government started their own lottery, named the 'Golden Casket Art Union', with the intention of raising money for charities and projects. Its <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> is credited with raising funds for veterans of World War One.|$|E

25|$|At the , {{she caught}} the {{attention}} of many by winning the Ford Hot Shots competition and defeating defending champion Colleen Jones in the <b>first</b> <b>draw.</b> After falling to a record of 2-4, she rallied by winning four of her next five games, finishing 6-5. This was enough, however, to get into a four-way tie for fourth place. Hanna would end up winning both of her tie-breakers, against Cathy King of Alberta and Sandy Comeau of New Brunswick, allowing her to make the playoffs. She then proceeded to defeat Stefanie Lawton of Saskatchewan in the 3 vs. 4 game, followed by Kelly Scott of British Columbia in the semi-final, to face the Jennifer Jones rink from Manitoba in the final. At this stage, Hanna's team played well, and led for most of the game, but lost on the last rock to Jones' game saving in-off for four points. Hanna was named the tournament MVP, and was chosen for the second all-star team.|$|E

25|$|So {{when the}} MCG was finally relinquished by the {{government}} in August 1946, there was great expectation in the buildup to the grand final, where Essendon booted a record score to defeat Melbourne. Attendances were back to 1930s levels by 1947 and 85,815 turned up to see Carlton beat Essendon by a solitary point; a similar crowd a year later watched the Bombers and Demons play the <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> in grand final history. Melbourne won the replay the following week. The sight of thousands sitting between the fence and the boundary line, first seen in the late 1930s, was now usual at the grand final. Spectators were admitted on a first-come basis, and thousands took to lining up outside the stadium {{in the days before the}} match to gain the best vantage point when the gates opened on the morning of the match. Some reservations were raised about spectator safety as the MCG was clearly being filled above its capacity.|$|E
500|$|Coimbre began {{promoting}} an {{idea that}} focused {{in the performance of}} the team, instead of the success of individual players. In his first day as an amateur coach, Coimbre summoned the players to a conference, where he noted that if all of them felt like [...] "stars" [...] and played for statistics their collective performance would suffer. He won a national championship with the team, but decided to leave it and work with the Cachorros de Ponce, where he won another championship. During this time he also worked as a talent scout with the Pittsburgh Pirates. As a scout he was directly responsible for the hiring of Roberto Clemente, when he urged the Pirates to draft him in the <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> of the Major League Baseball Draft, even though Clemente was under a minor league contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the match}} against Middlesex, the team {{travelled}} to the north, where the strongest English rugby teams were based. Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until {{many of their}} respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 {{over the issue of}} [...] "broken time" [...] payments. The New Zealanders lost to Hull F.C. 1–0, defeated Dewsbury, then lost to Wakefield Trinity. After their <b>first</b> <b>draw</b> of the tour (against Northumberland County) they defeated Stockton-on-Tees and Tynemouth. Joe Warbrick appeared in the match against Tynemouth, but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point. These victories were followed by a 13–4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November. The team then won seven matches in a row, including one against Hawick RFC, their only Scottish opposition of the tour. The last two matches that month were a loss to Swinton and a 9–0 victory over Liverpool and District. The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them. By this point, the team was beset by injuries– of the fifteen players that played against Westmorland County on 24 November, five had injuries. The squad comprised only 26 players, and the tourists were often struggling to field a side. Nevertheless, their heavy schedule continued; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin, where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team.|$|E
