5|$|Batesian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Henry W. Bates. When an edible prey animal comes to resemble, even slightly, a distasteful animal, natural selection favours those individuals that <b>even</b> <b>very</b> slightly better resemble the distasteful species. This is because {{even a small}} degree of protection reduces predation and increases the chance that an individual mimic will survive and reproduce. For example, many species of hoverfly are coloured black and yellow like bees, and are in consequence avoided by birds (and people).|$|E
5|$|Key held a {{character}} popularity poll between December 15–31, 2011 for every character from the game, <b>even</b> <b>very</b> minor ones. The top three winners would each get a downloadable wallpaper, and first place would get original artwork for the wallpaper. A voter could vote one time {{for up to}} three characters per day. While Sizuru led at first, Akane surged ahead near the end. The top three winners were Akane with 18,042 votes, Sizuru with 16,839 votes, and Lucia with 15,047 votes.|$|E
5|$|The common {{oxidation}} {{states of}} silver are (in order of commonness): +1 (the most stable state; for example, silver nitrate, AgNO3); +2 (highly oxidising; for example, silver(II) fluoride, AgF2); and <b>even</b> <b>very</b> rarely +3 (extreme oxidising; for example, potassium tetrafluoroargentate(III), KAgF4). The +1 state {{is by far}} the most common, followed by the reducing +2 state. The +3 state requires very strong oxidising agents to attain, such as fluorine or peroxodisulfate, and some silver(III) compounds react with atmospheric moisture and attack glass. Indeed, silver(III) fluoride is usually obtained by reacting silver or silver monofluoride with the strongest known oxidizing agent, krypton difluoride.|$|E

5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and <b>even</b> (<b>very</b> rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E
5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: <b>even</b> <b>very</b> small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin of cats, either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
5|$|Müllerian mimicry {{was first}} {{described}} by pioneering naturalist Fritz Müller. When a distasteful animal comes {{to resemble a}} more common distasteful animal, natural selection favours individuals that <b>even</b> <b>very</b> slightly better resemble the target. For example, many species of stinging wasp and bee are similarly coloured black and yellow. Müller's explanation of the mechanism for {{this was one of}} the first uses of mathematics in biology. He argued that a predator, such as a young bird, must attack at least one insect, say a wasp, to learn that the black and yellow colours mean a stinging insect. If bees were differently coloured, the young bird would have to attack one of them also. But when bees and wasps resemble each other, the young bird need only attack one from the whole group to learn to avoid all of them. So, fewer bees are attacked if they mimic wasps; the same applies to wasps that mimic bees. The result is mutual resemblance for mutual protection.|$|E
60|$|No wind. Morning and <b>evening</b> <b>very</b> mild. At eight p.m. {{dark cloud}} moving from {{south-west}} to mountains. Drops of rain; then stars. Minimum thermometers during night, both 48 degrees. None {{of the maximum}} will act.|$|R

5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered together. This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. <b>Even</b> <b>very</b> young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E

25|$|Dolphins can {{tolerate}} and recover from extreme injuries such as shark bites although the exact {{methods used to}} achieve this are not known.

25|$|Ferrouranium {{is used as}} {{a deoxidizer}} (more {{powerful}} than ferrovanadium), for denitrogenizing steel, for forming carbides, and as an alloying element. In ferrous alloys, uranium increases the elastic limit and the tensile strength. In high speed steels, it has been used to increase toughness and strength in amounts between 0.05–5%. Uranium-alloyed steels can be used at very low temperatures; nickel-uranium alloys are resistant to <b>even</b> <b>very</b> aggressive chemicals, including aqua regia.|$|E
25|$|Wings, while {{common in}} Victorian and later artwork of fairies, are very {{rare in the}} folklore; <b>even</b> <b>very</b> small fairies flew with magic, {{sometimes}} flying on ragwort stems or the backs of birds. Nowadays, fairies are often depicted with ordinary insect wings or butterfly wings. In some folklore, fairies have green eyes. Some depictions of fairies either have them wearing some sort of footwear and other depictions of fairies are always barefoot.|$|E

25|$|Hoops, {{also called}} krikoi, were {{probably}} made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were driven {{with a stick}} called the elater. The hoop was sized according to the player, as it {{had to come up}} {{to the level of the}} chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick. The sport was regarded as healthful, and was recommended by Hippocrates for strengthening weak constitutions. <b>Even</b> <b>very</b> young children would play with hoops.|$|E
25|$|Extremes {{of weather}} are {{uncommon}} in the parish, but one serious danger {{is from the}} sea. With over four miles of coastline in the parish, and a major road (the B5300) sticking {{very close to the}} shore, storms and <b>even</b> <b>very</b> high tides are a threat. In 2014 the sea wall at Dubmill Point, near Salta, was breached in several places, and a £130,000 repair scheme was commissioned by Cumbria County Council.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of Lepospondyli {{in relation to}} other labyrinthodont groups is uncertain, and it is sometimes classified as a separate subclass. The teeth were not labyrinthodont, and the group has classically been seen as separate from the Labyrintyhodontia. There is some doubt as to whether the lepospondyls form a phylogenetic unit at all, or is a wastebin taxon containing the paedamorphic forms and tadpoles of other labyrinthodonts, notably the reptile-like amphibians, or <b>even</b> <b>very</b> small primitve amniotes with reduced skulls.|$|E
