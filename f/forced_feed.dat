50|$|The {{crankcase}} is {{a single}} cast piece, the drop-forged crankshaft with counter weights screwed on is supported in bearings made of steel-lead-bronze. The crank and shaft pins of the crankshaft are heat-hardened. Due to the air-cooling of the engine, the cylinders have cooling fins made of centrifugal cast metal. The combustion chamber of the engine {{is a part of}} the piston bowls because of the direct injection. The pistons are made of a special highly heat resistant light metal alloy, they have three piston rings and one oil control ring. The connecting rods are cranked as well as the lower crank ends. The lower big crank ends are made of steel-lead-bronze, the upper small crank ends are made of special-bronze. The camshaft is supported by rolling bearings. The overhead valves are pushed by rockers and pushrods. The cylinder head {{is a single}} piece made of low pressure chill cast highly heat resistant light metal alloy. The air filter of the engine is a wet filter. For dusty environments MWM offered an oil bath air filter. The air intake must not draw in hot air; this would reduce the engine power output. The fuel is pumped by a Bosch pump. The fuel pump is controlled by a centrifugal control mechanism using a pushrod. The control trap makes it possible to change the injection time at the engine start-up to pump more fuel into the cylinder. A <b>forced</b> <b>feed</b> lubrication system lubricates the engine, powered by a gear oil pump. The oil is filtered by a strainer in the low pressure circuit and a fine sieve strainer in the high pressure circuit. A gap filter in the high pressure circuit was also available. The cooling is done by an axial cooling fan powered by the crankshaft using a belt. The power can be taken off the flywheel or the PTO-shaft. An electric motor can be used to start the engine as well as a crank. The AKD 112 Z does not have glow plugs but a decompression system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} {{investigating the}} performance of a wastewater treatment plant consisting of a bioreactor with recycle followed by a clarifier under <b>forced</b> <b>feed</b> circulation. A previously developed dynamic model for the process is used to conduct the performance analysis. The static version of the model was utilized first to determine the optimal productivity conditions for the process. Numerical optimization is used to design the feed periodic function. The parameters of the feed cyclic functions are determined which resulted in improved productivity and substrate consumption. The improvement in productivity is marginal and is satisfactory for substrate conversion compared to that of the optimal condition and to the steady state condition, which corresponds to the average value of the periodic function...|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 51 - 56 Ever since steam {{turbines}} have been built, {{contamination of the}} lube oil by water has been a persistent problem. Water contamination will result in rusting of ferrous components, accelerate sludging leading to sticking of mechanisms. In advanced cases, if water is pumped by the oil pump, immediate bearing failures result. Aeration of oil as it leaves the bearing {{is the reason why}} most <b>forced</b> <b>feed</b> (lube) turbines experience a constant in flow of air into the bearing housings. If this air has a dew point above the coolest place in the oil system, water contamination results. Raising oil reservoir temperatures and better flingers frequently help and sometimes eliminates the problem, but a dry gas purge, either dry nitrogen or dehydrated air, has been proven to be very effective. For best results and safety, the dry gas purge should be introduced into the bearing housing seal...|$|E

40|$|The work {{includes}} the mechanical analysis of mechanical feeders and batchers that find application in various technological processes and industrial fields. Feeders are usually classified {{according to their}} design features into two groups: conveyor-type feeders and non-conveyor feeders. Batchers are used to batch solid bulk materials. Less frequently, they are used for liquids. In terms of a batching method, they are divided into volumetric and weighting batchers. Weighting batchers do not provide for sufficient batching accuracy. Automatic weighting batchers include a mass controlling sensor and systems for automatic material feed and automatic mass discharge control. In terms of operating principle, batchers are divided into gravitational batchers and batchers with <b>forced</b> <b>feed</b> of material using conveyors and pumps. Improved consumption of raw materials, decreased loss of materials, ease of use in automatic control systems of industrial facilities allows increasing the quality of technological processes and improve labor conditions. The batch feeder suggested by the authors is a volumetric batcher that has no comparable counterparts among conveyor-type feeders and allows solving the problem of targeted feeding of bulk material batches increasing reliability and hermeticity of the device...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the apparent simplicity of the overall reaction, oxidation of CO over Pt/A 2 O 3 is known to present complex behavior. Self-sustained oscillations, hysteresis loops in conversion, and enormous rate enhancements under <b>forced</b> <b>feed</b> concentration cycling have been observed. In this study the dynamic behavior of the IR-active surface CO species was followed with a fast-scan Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) during transient response and periodic operation. Depending on the conditions, up to four linearly adsorbed CO bands at 2123, 2092, 2073, and 2061 cm- 1, and a bridge-bonded CO band at 1850 cm- were observed. The time-averaged and transient intensities of the bands {{were found to be}} significantly different during periodic operation as compared to steady state. Linearly adsorbed CO on metallic platinum (2073 cm-) was found to have the fastest response to changes in the gas-phase concentration. It was also observed that CO adsorbed on platinum oxide is very stable and does not take part in the reaction to any appreciable extent. CO 2 production rates during periodic operation were found to correlate extremely well with the integrated total absorbance of the 2092 -cm- band, assigned to CO linearly adsorbed on a platinum atom sharing an oxygen with a neighbor. Based on the experimental observations a detailed mechanism of CO oxidation on platinum is proposed. The model can successfully explain the enormous rate enhancements observed during periodic operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the wood natural resistance of Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. of phenotypes (plants) with and without prickles to subterranean termite (Nasutitermes corniger Motsch.) in <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> and feeding preference assays, under laboratory conditions. Wood test samples measuring 2. 54 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 10. 00 x 1. 50 x 0. 64 cm (feeding preference), with the largest measurement in the fiber direction, were obtained from three positions from pith to bark direction. The samples were exposed for 28 days (<b>forced</b> <b>feeding)</b> and 45 days (feeding preference) to Nasutitermes corniger Motsch. termites. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay the termites caused superficial attack in wood and lived during 8 to 10 days, thus the wood was classified as resistant. In <b>forced</b> <b>feeding</b> assay more mass loss and attack in wood of external positions to both phenotypes was observed. To the waste and survival time of termites were similar to both types. In feeding preference a larger mass loss and waste to inner position in both phenotypes was observed. In general, the plants with prickles lost more mass than the one without prickles. Therefore, the wood of plants without prickles is more suitable to be use in construction of fences, sheepfolds and other similar uses where the wood shall be subject to attack by termites...|$|R
