5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it <b>is</b> <b>golden</b> in colour {{and will}} not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E

25|$|Even though Breton by 1946 responded rather {{negatively}} {{to the subject}} of music with his essay Silence <b>is</b> <b>Golden,</b> later Surrealists, such as Paul Garon, have been interested in—and found parallels to—Surrealism in the improvisation of jazz and the blues. Jazz and blues musicians have occasionally reciprocated this interest. For example, the 1976 World Surrealist Exhibition included performances by David Honeyboy Edwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} {{contradiction that}} Parvati is addressed as the fair one, Gauri, {{as well as}} the dark one, Kali or Shyama, as a calm and placid wife Parvati mentioned as Gauri and as a goddess who destroys evil she is Kali.

25|$|Clair's {{first film}} {{on his return}} to France was the romantic comedy Le silence est d'or (Silence <b>is</b> <b>Golden)</b> (1947), which was set in 1906 and nostalgically evoked the world of early French film-making; its plot also created {{variations}} on Molière's L'École des femmes. Clair considered it {{one of his best}} post-war films. Literary inspirations also underpinned other films: Faust for La Beauté du diable (Beauty and the Devil) (1950); and Don Juan for Les Grandes Manœuvres (1955). In these two films and the intervening Les Belles de nuit (Beauties of the Night) (1952), the leading actor was Gérard Philipe who became a friend and a favourite performer for Clair. Porte des Lilas (1957) was a sombre film, set once again in a popular district of Paris with its picturesque inhabitants, for which the singer Georges Brassens was persuaded to give his first and only film performance.|$|E

500|$|C. squamiferum is {{the type}} species and the sole species within the genus Chrysomallon. The generic name Chrysomallon is from the Ancient Greek language, and means [...] "golden haired", because pyrite (a {{compound}} occurring in its shell) <b>is</b> <b>golden</b> in color. The specific name squamiferum is from the Latin language and means [...] "scale-bearing", because of its sclerites. At first it was not known to which family this species belonged. Warén et al. classified this species in the family Peltospiridae, within the Neomphalina in 2003. Molecular analyses based on sequences of cytochrome-c oxidase I (COI) genes confirmed the placement of this species within the Peltospiridae. Morphotypes from two localities are dark; a morphotype from a third locality is white (see next section for explanation of localities). These different colored snails appear to be simply [...] "varieties" [...] of the same species, according {{to the results of}} genetic analysis.|$|E

The packing of the perfume is very similar to the original one, but features a pink and white colour scheme and the [...] "S" [...] logo is surrounded by a bunch of flowers. Similarly, the bottle retains the original shape but has a [...] "more romantic and feminine feel" [...] and a pink colour scheme; the colour of the perfume <b>is</b> <b>golden</b> rose.|$|E
