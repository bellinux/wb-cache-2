5000|$|In 2011 {{the house}} {{was placed on the}} market again, and this time was bought by Lara Grylls, the sister of Bear Grylls, and her husband James Fawcett, {{great-grandson}} of its previous owner in the 1920s. [...] The couple demolished the extension that had been added by the CEGB {{to the back of the}} building (dubbed by them [...] "the tumour"), which had included office buildings, control centres, bunkers and a tower, amounting to four times the size of the original house in all. The demolition process turned out to be self-financing, due to the value of the <b>electrical</b> <b>scrap</b> that was recovered, and even generated a small surplus, which paid for the reinstatement of period windows and chimneys.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presents}} a methodology contributing to boundary extraction in images of approximate polyhedral objects. We make {{extensive use of}} basic principles underlying the process of image formation and thus reduce the role of object-specific knowledge. Simple configurations of line segments are extracted subject to geometric-photometric compatibilities. The perceptual organization into polygonal arrangements is based on geometric regularity compatibilities under projective transformation. The combination of several compatibilities yields a saliency function for extracting a list of most salient structures. Based on systematic measurements during an experimentation phase the adequacy and degrees of compatibilities are determined. The methodology is demonstrated for technical objects of <b>electrical</b> <b>scrap</b> located in cluttered scenes...|$|E
40|$|WO 2004003528 A UPAB: 20040213 NOVELTY - Before plasma generation, in {{addition}} to the spacing d between the auto-focusing optics (1) and the workpiece surface (4), additional geometric parameters P 1, P 2, [...] . PN are determined at the workpiece surface, for each potential measurement location. Elemental analysis is carried out only at potential measurement locations, where {{at least one of the}} parameters lies within a given tolerance range T 1 [...] . T 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for corresponding apparatus USE - For pulsed laser-excited, plasma emission spectroscopy of a solid workpiece. The composition of an alloy may be determined, for example. The workpiece is moving. It is e. g. falling comminuted <b>electrical</b> <b>scrap.</b> Following measurement, plant is controlled. The objective is sorting of the measured objects for testing. It may be used for quality documentation. ADVANTAGE - Improved measurement accuracy is offered, especially when the objects examined are moving. The geometric nature of the surface under measurement is ideally very close to that of the surface used for calibration. Such factors as correct location (focusing), object orientation, and even whether or not the object is present, are taken into account...|$|E
30|$|The figure below {{demonstrates}} net asset {{salvage value}} rate of NG and CSG during 2010 and 2012. As indicated, the net asset salvage value rate of NG is about 5 %, which {{has reached the}} rejection standard of international advanced assets management. The net asset salvage value rate of <b>electrical</b> equipment <b>scrapped</b> most in CSG was {{at a high level}} of about 19 %. The high net asset value means that the equipment has not been fully utilized, and thus the utilization is low.|$|R
25|$|The {{theater was}} used again once for a Wolfgang concert in 2011. But since 2012, the theater was closed again due to decays inside the building. The {{structure}} continued to deteriorate and vandalism, political advertisements, promotional materials and trash now degrade the heritage theater. The theater has been protected using pieces of wood, <b>scrap</b> <b>electrical</b> wires and rundown plywood. Help continued to pour in but lacked any concrete direction.|$|R
50|$|Pottery Fields is the {{industrial}} area around Kidacre Street, Leathley Road, Ivory Street, Meadow Lane and Cross Myrtle Street where Leeds City Council's Pottery Fields Depot {{and the former}} Meadow Lane Gas Works are situated. Pottery Fields House, has the administrative and engineering functions for Northern Gas Networks. Other businesses include Merlin Gerin medium voltage <b>electrical</b> supplies, a <b>scrap</b> yard and Volkswagen auto breakers, and a motorcycle training centre. There are several disused railways crossing the roads, which brought coal from Middleton Colliery to the Meadow Lane Gas Works {{for the production of}} town gas, before conversion to North Sea natural gas.|$|R

There are three municipal nursery schools in one town and a forest nursery in Aich Schießer forest.A music school currently serves approximately 400 students with a comprehensive teaching program. Furthermore, an independent in Aichwald Volkshochschule [...]==Waste== The waste management company of {{the district}} Esslingen is responsible for disposing of the waste. There are separate collections for organic waste, household waste and paper. Packaging is collected under the Green Dot in the so-called yellow sacks. Bulky waste is picked up annually for free against the delivery of two vouchers or {{can be brought to}} a disposal station. At these disposal stations, <b>electrical</b> and metal <b>scrap</b> and other recyclable materials will be collected. Waste such as fluorescent lamps and coatings are collected as hazardous waste.|$|R
