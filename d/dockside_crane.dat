5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton <b>dockside</b> <b>crane,</b> and exploded underwater below the bilge keel. The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E

50|$|While being {{designed}} for roll-on roll-off operations the ships {{can also be}} loaded using <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes.</b> For this purpose {{there is a long}} sliding hatch cover above the bow section for access to the vehicle deck. There are no facilities for helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Although {{cargo of}} this sort can be {{delivered}} straight from a truck or train onto a ship, the most common way is for the cargo to be delivered to the dock {{in advance of the}} arrival of the ship and for the cargo to be stored in warehouses. When the ship arrives the cargo is then taken from the warehouse to the quay and then lifted on board by either the ship's gear (derricks or cranes) or by the <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes.</b> The discharge of the ship is the reverse of the loading operation.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1930 Viceroy of India was bethed in Bombay {{when the}} [...] British India Line ship [...] {{collided}} with her. The collision pushed the liner against a <b>dockside</b> <b>crane,</b> which she demolished. Viceroy of India herself escaped serious damage.|$|E
50|$|At the docks, Cranky {{is still}} being fixed, so Gator is lifted onto his ship by the other <b>dockside</b> <b>crane.</b> Percy is {{just in time to}} say {{farewell}} to Gator as his ship leaves, remarking that it takes courage to say goodbye to a friend. Gator's ship disappears on the horizon and the three friends puff away into the distance as the credits roll.|$|E
5000|$|Returning to the Norfolk area after {{salvaging}} YSD-68, Windlass conducted local salvage {{and diving}} {{operations for the}} remainder of 1952. The salvage vessel remained at Norfolk into February 1953, when she commenced a search for a downed Navy plane on the 5th of the month. Crash boats from NAS, Atlantic City, New Jersey, assisted Windlass in the dragging operations begun that same day and located the plane, minus its tail section, soon thereafter. Windlass raised the plane, brought it on board between the two [...] "horns" [...] forward, and returned to Norfolk where the aircraft was removed by a <b>dockside</b> <b>crane.</b> That salvage effort set a precedent for the new and useful application of ships like Windlass and her sisters.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dockside</b> <b>cranes</b> {{must meet}} the {{relevant}} strength requirements that provide usefulness and not endanger {{the safety of their}} use. The vibration effect on structural safety hazard results from the impact of horizontal forces caused by the transport of goods for loading and transverse forces caused by wind, which can be dangerous for correct functioning. In addition, there are often serious effects of climate-related impacts of the environment, material fatigue, which actuates the degradation state of the object. Dynamic loads may therefor cause random effects that devastate the structures or lead to their catastrophic destruction...|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} types of harbor cranes can be identified with a varying geographical distribution: While gantry cranes which pivoted on a central vertical axle were commonly found at the Flemish and Dutch coastside, German sea and inland harbors typically featured tower cranes where the windlass and treadwheels were situated in a solid tower with only jib arm and roof rotating. Interestingly, <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes</b> were not adopted in the Mediterranean region and the highly developed Italian ports where authorities continued {{to rely on the}} more labor-intensive method of unloading goods by ramps beyond the Middle Ages.|$|R
25|$|A {{container}} crane (also container handling gantry crane or ship-to-shore crane) {{is a type}} of large <b>dockside</b> gantry <b>crane</b> found at container terminals for loading and unloading intermodal containers from container ships.|$|R

50|$|With {{time running}} {{out before the}} Vanderveer Collection is moved from the bank, the thieves lock Ben and Fred in the freezer of a Chinese restaurant. It is {{revealed}} that Oscar is the mastermind of the heist, and he tricks Johnny into finishing the tunnel leading to the vault. Ben and Fred get Sandy to save them, using polyphonic renditions of songs that Ben learned on his date with her as clues to their location. Having discovered the Vanderveer Collection, Johnny deduces Oscar's true intentions but is attacked by the thieves and is severely damaged. Fred attempts to repair him by breaking into a Radio Shack and following Johnny's guidance. Johnny then locates Oscar and traps his accomplices. However, Oscar flees and steals a boat. Johnny uses a <b>dockside</b> <b>crane</b> to capture Oscar, who is later apprehended by the police. After Johnny's main power supply runs dry, Ben keeps him alive with a defibrillator.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Coast Guard Fire-fighting Module {{developed}} {{for the purpose of}} fighting fires in harbors and on ships is described. The module can be lifted by a <b>dockside</b> <b>crane</b> or helicopter and placed on the deck of a patrol boat or cutter for transportation {{to the scene of the}} fire. At the fire the module can be set up and put in operation by a crew of two in approximately fifteen minutes. Once in operation the module will deliver water to two fire nozzles at a pressure of 150 psi and a flow rate of 2000 gpm. Sufficient fuel is carried in the module for three hours of continuous operation. A record of the development of the fire fighting module is also presented...|$|E
50|$|Taylor & Hubbard was an {{engineering}} company founded in Leicester, specialising {{in the production}} of railway cranes. They later moved to Kent Street, Humberstone Road, Leicester, in approximately 1900 which gave them access to the railway siding.The company was founded in the 19th century and up to the 1960s made steam cranes for railway companies in both the UK and around the world, mainly in the British Empire. By the 1960s they were making diesel-electric cranes for British Railways and hydraulic cranes for the Admiralty. Their cranes were used on oil tankers, and they sold <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes</b> for the Thames Conservancy.|$|R
40|$|Steel wires {{are widely}} applied in {{industrial}} applications - {{in most cases}} as critical components fulfilling high safety requirements in harsh environments (e. g. <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes).</b> In this paper a technique for real-time monitoring of steel ropes applying optical strain sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings is presented. The optical sensors are integrated within the wire strand and replace the core. The strain transmission from the outer wires to the sensors is assured by the mechanical coupling between the optical fiber and the strand. The actual strain load and rope vibrations in the kilohertz range can be determined in real-time...|$|R
50|$|Thereafter, some of {{the cuts}} that had been {{proposed}} in the 1981 Defence White Paper were reversed. The retention of a larger fleet meant that a larger workforce was retained at Portsmouth than had been envisaged (around 2,800); however the run-down of the old Dockyard went ahead, with dry docks 1-7 being closed, just under half the <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes</b> demolished and ten out of the nineteen major workshops on the site taken out of service. The dockyards Edwardian piece de r√©sistance, the Great Factory of 1905, ceased manufacturing in 1986 and was converted {{to serve as a}} warehouse.|$|R

25|$|The Dieppe Raid of 1942 {{had shown}} that the Allies could not rely {{on being able to}} {{penetrate}} the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes,</b> to off-load their cargo and this was not available except at the already heavily-defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles, and tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord and the Battle of Normandy. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: breakwater, piers, roadways etc.|$|R
50|$|As {{container}} ships {{usually have}} no on-board cranes or other mechanism to load or unload their cargo, they are therefore dependent on <b>dockside</b> container <b>cranes</b> to load and unload. However lift-on/lift-off vessels can load and unload their own cargo unassisted. Lift-on/lift-off vessels can operate out of docks with no dockside cargo handling equipment.|$|R
50|$|Portable {{harbours}} {{were also}} prefabricated as temporary facilities to allow rapid offloading of cargo onto the beaches during the Allied invasion of Normandy.

50|$|The port {{has three}} {{international}} container terminals. Montreal Gateway Terminals Partnership operates {{two of the}} terminals and Termont Montreal Inc. operates the other. Empire Stevedoring Co. Ltd. operates a terminal that handles domestic containers. These facilities cover an area of approximately 90 hectares (36 acres) and have 15 <b>dockside</b> gantry <b>cranes</b> with lifting capacities ranging from 40 to 65 tonnes, yard gantry cranes and other container-handling equipment.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} fiber Bragg grating sensors gained {{interest}} in structural health monitoring and concepts for smart structures. They are small, lightweight, and immune to electromagnetic interference. Using multiplexing techniques, several {{sensors can be}} addressed by a single fiber. Therefore, well-established structures and materials in industrial applications can be easily equipped with fiber optical sensors with marginal influence on their mechanical properties. In return, critical components can be monitored in real-time, leading to reduced maintenance intervals and a great reduction of costs. Beside of generally condition monitoring, the localization of failures in a structure is a desired feature of the condition monitoring system. Detecting the acoustic emission of a sudden event, its place of origin can be determined by analyzing the delay time of distributed sensor signals. To achieve high localization accuracies {{for the detection of}} cracks, breaks, and impacts high sampling rates combined with the simultaneous interrogation of several fiber Bragg grating sensors are required. In this article a fiber Bragg grating interrogator for high frequency measurements up to the megahertz range is presented. The interrogator is based on a passive wavelength to intensity conversion applying arrayed waveguide gratings. Light power fluctuations are suppressed by a differential data evaluation, leading to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio and a low strain detection limit. The measurement system is used to detect, inter alia, wire breaks in steel wire ropes for <b>dockside</b> <b>cranes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 6 March 1909, during a {{blinding}} snowstorm, disaster struck. A gang of navvies {{were working in}} a 45 ft which formed the entrance channel to the new dock. They were clearing away rubble and timber, which was hauled up to the <b>dockside</b> by a <b>crane</b> which straddled the excavation. The waters of the neighbouring East Float were held back from the entrance channel by a 200 ft temporary coffer dam, formed from pilings rammed with mud and cement, which had been built in 1907. There was {{only a small amount}} of work left to do, and the whole four-year dock project would be finished by the following evening.|$|R
