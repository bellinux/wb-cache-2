5|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> while {{he was trying to}} get across the results of his experiences.|$|E

5|$|Terry Brooks {{has said}} that Tolkien's works were a major {{influence}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> though he has also said that Tolkien was not his only influence. Other influences included his editor Lester del Rey, {{as well as the}} many different books which he had read over his life. Also, mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school gave him a wealth of knowledge from which he drew. Many of these influences are reflected in Brooks' works.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b> In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Choe's diary {{accounts}} of his travels in China became widely {{printed in the}} 16th century in both Korea and Japan. Modern historians also refer to his written works, since his travel diary provides a unique outsider's perspective on Chinese culture in the 15th century and valuable information on China's cities and regional differences. The attitudes and opinions expressed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> represent in part the standpoints and views of the 15th century Confucian Korean literati, who viewed Chinese culture as compatible with and similar to their own. His description of cities, people, customs, cuisines, and maritime commerce along China's Grand Canal provides insight into the daily life of China and how it differed between northern and southern China during the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Lie is {{considered}} influential to the colony's journalism, linguistics, and literature. According to the Malaysian scholar Ahmad Adam, {{he is best}} remembered for his literary works. Several of his writings were printed multiple times, and Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari was adapted for the stage and screen. However, {{as a result of}} the language politics in the Indies and independent Indonesia, his work has become marginalised. When several of his writings were revealed as uncredited adaptations of existing works, Lie was criticised as unoriginal. Other critics, however, have found evidence of innovation <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> style and handling of plots.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the writing}} of vachana poems went into decline after {{the passing of the}} Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day vachanakaras such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of King Virupaksha RayaII, started a revival. He wrote Shatsthala Jnanamrita (1540), a {{collection}} of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara the central theme <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing</b> Siddhesvara Purana. Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known vachana poets who tried to recreate the glory days of the early poets, though the socio-political expediency did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Phan {{is widely}} {{regarded}} by Vietnamese people as a revolutionary hero. Phan Bội Châu, regarded as the leading Vietnamese anti-colonial figure of the early 20th century, strongly praised Phan <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> with particular emphasis on his defiance of Khai. During Phan Boi Chau's career as a teacher, he strongly emphasised Phan's deeds to his students. In 1941, after returning to Vietnam after decades in exile, the Marxist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, then using the name Nguyen Ai Quoc (Nguyen the Patriot), invoked the memory of Phan in appealing {{to the public for}} support for his independence movement. Like Phan, Ho was a native of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh. In the 1940s, Ho's Vietminh named their self-produced style of grenades in honour of Phan. Since then, Ho's communists have portrayed themselves as the modern day incarnations of revered nationalist leaders such as Phan, Trương Định and Emperors Lê Lợi and Quang Trung, who expelled Chinese forces from Vietnam. Both North and South Vietnam had prominent thoroughfares in their capital cities (Hanoi and Saigon, respectively) named in Phan's honour.|$|E

5|$|While {{writing of}} Afonso de Albuquerque's ventures in Sumatra, João de Barros {{noted that the}} Chinese {{were the first to}} control trade between Sumatra and India, and noted the {{presence}} of Chinese people living in Sumatra. Barros also noted that while Fernão Pires was loading Southeast Asian spices onto his ship in Pacem (a kingdom in Sumatra) in order to sell or present them as gifts in China, two different kings were killed and their position usurped. Apparently the usurpation of kings caused little tumult or crisis in this state, as Barros noted any leader there was believed by the locals not to have divine right to rule if he was able to be killed by a royal kinsman. Historian Mark Dion notes that Fernão related the same story <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing,</b> only adding that a Muslim in their society was the only acceptable replacement as ruler.|$|E
5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>writing.</b> Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose to confide in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E
