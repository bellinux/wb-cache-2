5000|$|In 1991, Bellows and {{his second}} wife divorced, an event that had an {{enormous}} impact on Bellows, and on his art, which became more intense and sometimes darker, and included more religious themes. Bellows talked about the relationship between his art and his personal life in a 1992 Nebraska Educational Television documentary, “What is Art?” “Talk about saving the world. It does save my world. It’s the way I just kind of claw and find my way through the darkness. I mean that’s it. I can’t imagine a life without making art. Joseph Campbell, in one of his lectures, said something that struck me—that artists are generally people who have come apart at the seams somewhere along the line, and their work is an attempt to put themselves back together again, or at least keep themselves together. That’s definitely what my work is about.” Later he added, “These projects work for me. It’s clarified my thinking. The thing about an experience like divorce for me is it’s just the way that the meaning drains out of your life. This has been my way to try to put it back, just {{to make sense of the}} experience. And it’s working, it’s working. I feel a lot calmer about it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> about our culture. Just a part of our culture where any bad thing, just push it down, avoid it…don’t feel it…I’m trying to actually just feel it…because that’s the thing about emotions, they have a purpose. I mean, I’m no psychologist, but for myself, to actually experience it in a very complete way and survive it. They don’t go away, but you process that material and then you go on to the next thing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that’s what I’m doing.” ...|$|R
40|$|PY: Marilyn Hood, in {{the very}} early 80 s, {{studying}} audiences in Toledo, found that <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that differentiated people who went to museums from those who didn't (given identical demographic profiles) was that museum goers thought that learning was a pleasurable experience, and they did go to museums to learn. The ones who chose sporting events and zoos over museums thought of learning as laborious, and not a way to spend leisure. We also found at MOMA that most people listed learning as an important goal when visiting. But that doesn't mean that the notion of learning is not pretty vague. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the paradox here is that even if they say they want to learn, it is in the rather broad sense of being uplifted and inspired. It is not as if they come to museums to work hard at something. DR: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>things</b> that has shifted the debate about visitor experience in art museums in recent years is the fact that for museum professionals trained in art history, post-modern scholarship rejects the notion of the "masterpiece " that can transform through its electrifying presence. The individual art object, instead of being seen as a pleasing combination of formal elements is treated as "as an element of discourse " within a variety of social, cultural and political contexts. In contemporary critical thinking, the museum can no longer claim to be a neutra...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to see in the 21 st century's classroom if the use of technology was enhance and engaging students in their learning. I wanted to know when having smartboards, iPads, laptops, computers, clickers and other technologies no longer engages students in learning. The method that I used was to have three different treatments that allowed me to see when and if the technology that I had in my classroom would enhance their learning. For the first treatment the students were not allowed any technology in the classroom. This meant these students had to rely on their own knowledge and ask questions of me and their fellow classmates. The second treatment group was allowed the use of technology fifty percent of the time. These students were given technology half of the time in the classroom. They could ask questions of their neighbors, their teacher, and use some other resources when time was permitted. The final treatment had full use of technology. These students were only allowed to use technology to find the answer that they were searching for. They could ask their teacher some questions but were to rely heavily on their technology for their answers. The results from my study were that second treatment group preformed the best on their posttest. They showed the most gain in their knowledge than the other two groups. The students that are coming to us in our classrooms are much more familiar with the use of computers, iPads, iPods, and other technology that in the years before. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that will never change in learning and that is the need for human contact...|$|R

Hill reflected on his career in 1995:I think every director thinks that he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, `Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely.
