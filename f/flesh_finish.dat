60|$|Carley rode {{all that}} {{afternoon}} {{in the rear of}} the caravan, gradually succumbing to the cold raw wind and the aches and pains to which she had subjected her <b>flesh.</b> Nevertheless, she <b>finished</b> the day's journey, and, sorely as she needed Glenn's kindly hand, she got off her horse without aid.|$|R
6000|$|Here, as I said, Faith hath {{an object}} to work upon, {{and that is}} the person of Christ, and that {{personal}} righteousness of his, which he in the days of his <b>flesh</b> did <b>finish</b> to justify sinners withal. This is, I say, the object of faith for justification, whereunto the soul by it doth continually resort. Hence David said to Christ, [...] "Be thou my strong habitation"; or as you have it in the margin, [...] "Be thou to me for a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort" [...] (Psa 71:3): And two things he inserts by so saying.|$|R
5000|$|In 1954 {{she married}} art {{historian}} Michael Levey (afterwards {{director of the}} British National Gallery, 1973-87, and knighted in 1981). The couple had one daughter. In the following years she brought {{out a series of}} novels, including <b>Flesh</b> (1962), The <b>Finishing</b> Touch (1963, described as a [...] "lesbian fantasia"), The Snow Ball (1964) and Palace Without Chairs (1978, in which a child of royal descent survives political tumult).|$|R
5000|$|Distinguished Professor Gordon (John Hoyt) {{explains}} that Earth is being tormented by periodic [...] "sex rays" [...] which send {{people into a}} sexual frenzy. When one of the rays hits the Ford Tri-Motor passenger aircraft carrying Flesh Gordon (Jason Williams) and Dale Ardor (Suzanne Fields), the pilots abandon the controls and everyone aboard has manic sex. When they <b>finish,</b> <b>Flesh</b> and Dale escape the imminent crash by parachute. They land near the workshop of Flexi Jerkoff (Joseph Hudgins), who has a plan to stop the sex rays at their source.|$|R
5|$|During the {{production}} of the fourth season of The X-Files, work on the first feature film adaptation of the series began. Also titled The X-Files, Carter initially began a treatment for the script over Christmas holidays in Hawaii in 1996. Series producer Frank Spotnitz collaborated on the story outline at this time. Carter would later return to Hawaii for a ten-day stint in 1997 to begin <b>fleshing</b> out the <b>finished</b> script. Carter appointed frequent series director Rob Bowman as director of the film, which went on to feature many of the series' regular cast, including Duchovny, Anderson, Mitch Pileggi and William B. Davis.|$|R
5000|$|He {{worked with}} Bandai {{producer}} Minoru Takanashi to <b>finish</b> <b>fleshing</b> out the original idea. [...] They researched various mysteries for inspiration, particularly stories {{centered on the}} mythical land of Atlantis and the Bermuda Triangle. As the series began taking shape, they changed the lead character from a male, the norm for an action-mecha series, to a high school girl as the lead character. Nobuteru Yuki was hired as the character designer, and tasked with crafting a design for Hitomi {{and the rest of}} the cast. He would later state that Hitomi was his favorite character because it was the first one he'd ever designed completely from scratch rather than simply being adapted from an existing medium. Initially, Folken and Dilandau were a single enemy commander, but as the story was fleshed out, the creators felt the series would be more interesting if there were two with very different personalities.|$|R
50|$|Jayarajan (Mohanlal), an over-enthusiastic {{assistant}} {{manager at a}} tea plantation plans to loot a huge amount. He lures two debt-ridden subordinates, Chandran (Rahman) and Johnny (Nedumudi Venu), into his conspiracy. Though unwillingly, both agree. But during their attempt, A.K.Menon (Janardhanan), {{the manager of the}} company catches them red-handed. To keep matters under wraps, Jayarajan enters Menon's house at night along with Johnny and Chandran. Jayarajan kills Menon and escapes from the house. He acts normal the next day and provides help to the police. But both Johnny and Chandran feel guilty. Jayarajan threatens both to keep silent and act as if nothing happened. Soon, however, Jayarajan is elevated as the new Manager of the company. Devi (Kajal Kiran), the virgin young widow of Menon arrives at the plantation for future financial formalities. Jayarajan, who already {{was having an affair with}} Padma, a nurse, now eyes Devi. He succeeds in taking her to bed and plans to take up all the financial benefits that she may get as Menon's bereavement benefits. But a cop, Ravi (Ratheesh), becomes suspicious of Jayarajan although he finds himself no match for the flawless and naturally responsive demeanour of Jayarajan. However, neither is he shunning his illicit relationship with Padma, an occasional prostitute and a nurse by profession. In a strange turn of events, for fear of a faint-hearted Chandran spilling out the beans of the Manager's murder and to satiate his avarice and taste of the fresher <b>flesh,</b> Jayarajan <b>finishes</b> off Johnny and Padma. His impeccable yet vile and strong character raises no suspicions of the two new deaths of anybody except Chandran, whose silence Jayarajan buys with scare tactics.|$|R
40|$|O F THE {{many factors}} that {{influence}} market grade of dressed turkeys, an important factor has been the degree of finish of the dressed carcass. Enos et al. (1961) found a high correlation between the average finish score and average market grade of dressed turkeys. Male turkeys which had a mean finish score of 3. 87 pro-duced 65. 95 percent grade A carcasses. Those with average finish scores of 3. 98 and 4. 03 produced 78. 98 and 85. 08 percent grade A carcasses respectively. Mountney et al. (1957) gathered data on 145, 192 officially graded turkeys. They found that bruises accounted for 35 percent of all birds grading B or lower and 2 7 per-cent of the birds grading B or lower were poorly <b>fleshed</b> or lacked <b>finish.</b> Johndrew et al. (1959) stated that grade A turkeys must be well covered with fat, with some fat under the skin over the entire carcasses except for fryers and young toms. Grade B turkeys must have sufficient fat on breast and legs to prevent a distinct appearance of flesh through skin...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT A. {{feeding system}} {{representing}} North American (NA) circumstance was {{compared with a}} successful extreme used in the European Economic Community (EEC) on three strains of large toms [Nicholas, British United (BUT), and Hybrid]. The NA system used six feeds to 24 weeks based on National Research Council (1977) specifications with corn, soybean meal, and fat as primary ingredients. The EEC extreme further employed fish meal, wheat, and barley in five feeds. Each EEC feed had a lower energy level and energy-protein ratio than the respective NA feed with these differences increasing from starting to finish. The BUT toms had the heaviest final body weight and the EEC system supported better gain with this strain than the NA system. Nicholas and Hybrid toms had equivalent final weights with each feeding system eliciting similar gains. Marketing at 20 and 24 weeks gave the same relative weight results. Additional <b>finish,</b> <b>fleshing,</b> and breast yields by Nicholas at 20 weeks indicated an advanced maturity {{compared to the other}} strains. Sensory evaluation on cooked grade A carcasses at 20 weeks favored Nicholas in a comparison with BUT. Overall results indicated that the strains differed in growth characteristics, particularly between 12 and 20 weeks with the onset of sexual maturity. Interaction between strain and feeding system at this time was attributed to different energy-protein needs rather than involving number of feeds, time sequencing, feedstuffs used, or plane of nutrition.
