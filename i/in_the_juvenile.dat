5|$|The milk cap's fruit {{bodies have}} a {{characteristic}} orange milk juice (latex). The guaiane sesquiterpenes {{are responsible for}} the orange colour. Sesquiterpenes are terpenes composed of three isoprene units and therefore have 15 carbon atoms. Sesquiterpenes are widely distributed in nature and are found in plants as well as animals, for example <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> hormone of insects. Plants use sesquiterpenes as a defense compound against insects. According to some studies, sesquiterpenes have antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, or immunostimulant effects.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
40|$|Activities of 13 {{different}} enzymes {{were measured}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> erythrocytes of <b>juvenile</b> and adult bandicoots, Isoodon macrourus. Seven of these enzymes had significantly (p < 0. 05 or less) greater activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juveniles</b> compared to <b>the</b> adult animals. The activity of one enzyme - phosphofructokinase - was significantly (p < 0. 01) lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> However, <b>the</b> activity of NADH-methaemoglobin reductase (MR) was similar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{two groups of}} animals. The rates of lactate production using four different substrates (glucose, galactose, inosine and adenosine) were also higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juveniles.</b> These results indicate that <b>the</b> erythrocytes of <b>juvenile</b> bandicoots are metabolically more active {{than those of the}} adult animals and follow the general pattern of higher metabolic activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> young red cells in eutherian mammals, with possible exception of NADH-MR activity...|$|R

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> phase before {{ballooning}} up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The hindlimbs of Patagosaurus {{are based}} on scant material, some femora, a tibia, and a few nondescript pedal bones. Two femora come from an adult, with a single {{additional}} bone known from the juvenile. The adult femora are proportionately different from the juvenile, being mostly straighter and more ovoid in cross-section. The femoral head is well preserved, although lacking the greater trochanter. The distal end is rather symmetrical when viewed from behind, with two similarly sized condylar surfaces. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile,</b> the fourth trochanter is completely in the proximal end. The tibia has a well-developed cnemial crest, and is also short and robust. The surface that would have articulated with the astragalus in life has the anterior half raised, and the posterior half lowered.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were on her face whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|In April 1888, the Church Board of Education {{was created}} {{as part of}} the LDS Church, {{inspired}} by a proposal made by Maeser in 1887. Maeser was made a member of the board, and was later appointed the superintendent of the Church Educational System. The Board of Education was created to maintain and supervise church schools. This position later became the Commissioner of Church Education. As Superintendent, Maeser helped establish initial policies for new academies established by the church. He also helped train teachers, and gave suggestions on the architecture of new school designs. By 1889, Maeser oversaw 19 schools that operated under the academy system. In 1889, Church Board of Education established a board of examiners to certify teachers. The board awarded Maeser a Doctor of Letters and Didactics degree that same year. Maeser also continued writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Instructor in the 1890s to clarify church educational policies.|$|E

5|$|To {{support the}} lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia {{as the most}} basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited {{in support of this}} position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter – a projection on the ilium that limits the greater trochanter of the femur – is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted that adults may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well-developed antitrochanter even at the hatchling stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would resolve this issue.|$|E

25|$|MILESTONES program {{objective}} is to facilitate a transformation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>juvenile</b> offender’s behavior from delinquent and addictive to pro-social and healthy. The program staff and treatment team develop individual and community strategies to help eliminate and/or manage undesirable behaviors and reinforce those that are socially acceptable with positive outcomes. The JCC–L program model incorporates mentoring, cognitive restructuring, social learning, and cause and effect reinforcement. JCC-L recognizes that most juvenile offenders, including those who are lower functioning, still possess a level of reasoning, response, {{and the ability to}} identify simple patterns. These juvenile offenders also possess the necessary tools to facilitate self-change. Consistent with cognitive theory, the expressed thoughts and beliefs of the juvenile offenders are tracked over time to establish patterns of thinking. Cognitive interventions target both beliefs and thoughts, identify those with positive and negative ultimate outcomes, and subsequently facilitate a change in behavior. In addition to providing alternative coping skills and competencies, the Milestone program also reduces risk levels. Any idea, belief, or circumstance which causes a juvenile to gravitate to inappropriate/illegal behavior is a risk factor.|$|E
