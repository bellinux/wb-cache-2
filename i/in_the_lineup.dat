5|$|Revere {{began the}} 2013 {{season as the}} Phillies; leadoff hitter before being moved down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> {{following}} an injury. His primary strengths are his speed and his defense, while he struggles to hit for power; he has only hit seven home runs in the major leagues. Writers and teammates have described Revere as being a genuine, goofy, energetic player.|$|E
5|$|The Naps {{acquired}} Shoeless Joe Jackson {{from the}} Athletics {{in a trade}} and had him replace Flick <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup.</b> In July 1910, the Naps sold Flick to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, but Flick refused to report to Kansas City, which cancelled the transaction.|$|E
5|$|The PSA Group, {{formed in}} 1976 when Peugeot bought out its competitor, Citroën, {{took over the}} former Chrysler Europe in 1979; one of its first {{decisions}} was to rebrand all of the models manufactured in the French and British factories to Talbot. Among the models inherited from Chrysler was the Scottish-built rear-wheel drive Talbot Sunbeam, the only small car <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also <b>in</b> 1998, <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> changed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> new <b>lineup</b> <b>the</b> band faced many difficulties, {{and within}} 3 years, in 2001 they {{published}} Reverse, an album which marked a new {{turn to the}} band's style and composition ideas. they approached more complex riffs, with the influence of bands such as Machine Head and Pantera. That year they participated again to the Gods Of Metal Festival.|$|R
50|$|Aytov {{made his}} A Group debut on 27 June 2014. He was {{included}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting <b>lineup</b> for a 1-1 draw against Beroe Stara Zagora.On 30 October 2015, Aytov was included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting <b>lineup</b> of Botev Plovdiv for <b>the</b> first time <b>in</b> his career but {{his team was}} defeated with 2-0 by Slavia Sofia.|$|R

5|$|At {{the close}} of the Interstate League season, Levan was called up to the Phillies. He made his major league debut against the New York Giants, {{collecting}} his first hit in his second official at bat. Batting second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup,</b> he finished his first game 2-for-5, notching his first major league run batted in (RBI). The following day, he helped pitcher Curt Simmons, a former teammate in American Legion Baseball, earn his first victory over Andy Hansen of the Giants by hitting safely twice in four times at bat and scoring one run.|$|E
5|$|By August 1997, the Tiger-Cats were {{struggling}} with several injuries to their receivers. After Ted Long reinjured his groin, the Tiger-Cats signed Alford to their practice squad {{with the intention}} of using him to replace Long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup.</b> Alford made his debut with the Tiger-Cats on August 8, 1997 and went on to play three games with the club. In late August, Alford was released from the team.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{retired as}} a player {{following}} the 1981 season. He finished his career having played in 181 {{out of a possible}} 190 games, and recorded 78.5 sacks (unofficially, as sacks were not an official statistic until 1982) and 16 fumble recoveries. His spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> was technically not replaced; the Steelers switched to a 3–4 defensive alignment for the 1982 season, which has only one nose tackle as opposed to two defensive tackles. The team has used the 3–4 as its base alignment continuously in the years since Greene's retirement, and more recently have used alignments that deploy only two true linemen.|$|E
30|$|As an {{additional}} aim for Experiment 3, we {{also sought to}} confirm that the pattern of results reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preceding experiments, which were based on only a single target identity, generalizes to other identities. We therefore examined the identification of two new targets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> multiple-lineup procedure. Both identities were also present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineups</b> employed <b>in</b> Experiment 2, allowing us to retain these materials.|$|R
25|$|Savard {{played for}} Canada <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union. Team Canada was 4-0-1 when Savard was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} <b>lineup.</b> He {{did not play}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening loss at <b>the</b> Forum <b>in</b> Montreal but was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting <b>lineup</b> for games 2 and 3 in Toronto and Winnipeg (a win and tie, respectively). He suffered a hairline fracture in his leg which forced him to sit out Canada's losses in games 4 and 5. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for games 6, 7, and 8, all wins for Canada.|$|R
50|$|After the {{resignation}} of Arturo Salah {{and the arrival of}} Sergio Markarian, Seymour had more continuity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting <b>lineup,</b> and a good season for both him and <b>the</b> team resulted <b>in</b> a victory in Torneo Apertura 2009. Then with the arrival of Jose Basualdo, Seymour was frequently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starting <b>lineup.</b> <b>In</b> Clásico Universitario he scored a goal against Universidad Católica in a 3-2 home loss.|$|R
5|$|Killebrew was {{bothered by}} injury {{early in the}} 1960 season. In March, he had surgery for nasal irritation, and a {{recurring}} hamstring injury caused him to miss most of May. On his return, he remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> {{for the rest of}} the season, finishing the year with 31 home runs in 124 games. Killebrew's arrival and home runs did little to improve the Senators' record, as they finished in the second division of the American League every year he played for Washington, including four years in last place. Following the 1960 season, the Senators moved to Minnesota and became the Minnesota Twins.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Jovanovski {{played for}} Canada at the 2004 World Cup. He {{suffered}} a cracked rib {{and a second}} degree sprain on his medial collateral ligament (MCL) during the first game against the United States, sidelining him {{for the rest of}} the tournament. He was replaced by San Jose Sharks defenceman Scott Hannan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup.</b> Canada went on to win the championship over Finland in the final.|$|E
5|$|The CQC-6 (Close Quarters Combat— Six) or Viper Six is a {{handmade}} tactical {{folding knife}} with a tantō blade manufactured by knifemaker Ernest Emerson. Although initially reported as the sixth design in an evolution of fighting knives {{and the first}} model <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> of Emerson's Specwar Custom Knives, Emerson later revealed that the knife was named for SEAL Team Six. It has a chisel-ground blade of ATS-34 or 154CM stainless steel and a handle made of titanium and linen micarta. The CQC-6 is credited as the knife that popularized {{the concept of the}} tactical folding knife.|$|E

5|$|Booth was not {{cleared for}} full-contact {{practice}} with the team until January 25, 2010. Six days later, {{he returned to the}} lineup for a game against the New York Islanders after being sidelined for 45 contests. During his absence, the Panthers and Flyers played each other on December 21, 2009, {{for the first time since}} Richards' hit. The game included four fights, including one between Panthers defenceman and captain Bryan McCabe and Richards. The teams met again with Booth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> on March 3, 2010. After fighting Richards in the first period (one of four fights in the game and Booth's first in the NHL), Booth scored a goal and three assists (completing a Gordie Howe hat trick) to help the Panthers to a 7–4 win.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 2009, Down was {{announced}} on -and later removed from- the lineup for the 2009 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, a large annual outdoor music festival since 2002. On February 18, 2009, Down {{was announced}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for the 2009 Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Following these live dates, the band toured the USA and Canada during August and September 2009. On March 30, 2009, Down posted {{a statement on}} their message board indicating {{that they will be}} back in the studio from October through November writing and recording what will eventually become Down IV. In the summer of 2009, Down began a US tour without Rex on bass, who had developed acute pancreatitis.|$|E
5|$|The Canucks {{entered the}} 2012 playoffs against the eighth-seeded Los Angeles Kings. With Daniel {{out with a}} {{concussion}} Vancouver lost the first two games. In Game 3, Henrik received a hard hit from Kings' forward Dustin Brown—he had to be helped onto the bench following the hit {{and went to the}} locker room for six minutes. Despite later returning to the game, the Canucks lost 1–0. With Daniel back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for Game 4, Henrik registered a goal and an assist in a 3–1 Canucks' victory. Facing elimination in Game 5, Henrik scored a power play goal late in the first period to give Vancouver the early lead, though Canucks were unable to add another goal and eventually lost 2–1 in overtime. Henrik finished the playoffs with two goals and five points to lead the team in scoring.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the New York Yankees Major League Baseball (MLB) team spans more than a century. Frank J. Farrell and William Stephen Devery bought the rights to an American League (AL) club in New York City after the 1902 season. The team, which {{became known as the}} Yankees in 1913, rarely contended for the AL {{championship}} before the acquisition of outfielder Babe Ruth after the 1919 season. With Ruth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup,</b> the Yankees won their first AL title in 1921, followed by their first World Series championship in 1923. Ruth and first baseman Lou Gehrig were part of the team's Murderers' Row lineup, which led the Yankees to a then-AL record 110 wins and a Series championship in 1927 under Miller Huggins. They repeated as World Series winners in 1928, and their next title came under manager Joe McCarthy in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> for a {{home game}} against St. Bonaventure Bonnies, Ron Everhart tried a new {{starting}} lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back. With less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. One quick possession by each team left it 67–69 {{in favor of the}} Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup,</b> hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game by Atlanta Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

5|$|With Kesler back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup,</b> the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five {{points in the}} seven games, but was playing with the discomfort steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he would be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{began the}} season {{coming off the}} bench. On November 24, Alexander had his first double-digit output with 10 points against Rider. In the 2014 Orlando Classic semifinals against Tennessee on November 28, he posted 16 points. Then in the finals against #20 Michigan State on November 30, he contributed 4 blocks. On December 5 during the Big 12/SEC Challenge contest against Florida, Alexander posted a team-high 10 rebounds along with 12 points for his first collegiate double-double. On December 20, Alexander was {{expected}} to be in the starting lineup for the first time against Lafayette, but he was not. However, he started on December 22 against Temple. On January 19 against #19 Oklahoma, Alexander posted 13 points and 13 rebounds. The 13 rebounds in just 23 minutes played marked a career high for Alexander and an individual season high for the Jayhawks. Alexander was named Big 12 newcomer of the week on January 26, 2015. Alexander made his second start of the season on February 10 against Texas Tech, replacing Jamari Traylor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> and posting 10 points, 4 blocks and 5 rebounds. On February 28, Alexander was inactivated due to an undisclosed NCAA investigation as a precautionary measure. He did not play any games after February 23 because of the investigation of his mother's initiation of pre-NBA draft loan processing.|$|E
5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lineup</b> as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, {{he began working}} on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find playing time during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the playing time, given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E
