40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used in place <b>of</b> the air <b>brake</b> in railway locomotives. This braking system uses a vacuum pump for {{creating}} vacuum in the brake pipe.

The vacuum braking system was modified from above said reasons and the same was tested for implementation in both light and heavy vehicles. In this work, vacuum is created and used for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> The system operation is somehow similar to air braking system. The main difference with air brake system is that vacuum is used instead of compressed air.

50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> and during emergency <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake.</b> The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|R

50|$|The Cineston {{controller}} is {{a control}} lever used in mass transit vehicles that combines the accelerator, brake and emergency controls {{into a single}} hand-operated device. The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting. However, it is only suitable for vehicles {{that do not require}} steering control, as it is hand operated and thus interferes with the presence of any sort of steering wheel.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model-based {{hierarchical}} control {{strategy for the}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> torque distribution to vehicle stability control. A three-layer control architecture is adopted, and {{the focus of the}} paper is on the intermediate layer which employs a form of model predictive control. To achieve this a non-linear vehicle model is linearised at successive time instants about non-equilibrium operating points. Simulations show that the new controller is more efficient (uses reduced brake authority) compared to a conventional rule-based control algorithm. It also has the advantage of being highly flexible for future application in fully integrated chassis systems. Copyright Â© 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R

50|$|This is {{the most}} common {{illusion}} during flight, and can be caused by a sudden return to wings-level flight following a <b>gradual</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> bank that had gone unnoticed by the pilot. The reason a pilot can be unaware of such an attitude change in the first place is that human exposure to a rotational acceleration of 1 degree per second squared or lower is below the detection threshold of the semicircular canals. Rolling wings-level from such an attitude may cause an illusion that the aircraft is banking in the opposite direction. In response to such an illusion, a pilot will tend to roll back {{in the direction of the}} original bank in a corrective attempt to regain the perception of a level attitude.|$|R
5000|$|Brake fade and rotor warping can {{be reduced}} through proper braking technique; when running down a long {{downgrade}} that would require braking simply select a lower gear (for automatic transmissions this may necessitate a brief <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the throttle after selecting the gear).

Continuous light <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brakes</b> can be particularly destructive in both wear and adding heat to the brake system.

40|$|Abstract. The lack of {{information}} integration, by the existing online systems, for resource sharing in a distributed environment, impacts directly to the development and the usage of dynamically defined Virtual Union Catalogues. In this work we propose a design approach {{for the construction of}} an online system, able to improve the information integration when a Dynamic Resource Collection is used, by taking into account the restrictions imposed by the network environment and the Z 39. 50 protocol. The main strength of this architecture is the presentation of de-duplicated results to the user, by the <b>gradual</b> <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the duplicate detection process in small received packets (sets of results), as the data packets flow from the participating servers. While it presents results to the user, it also processes a limited amount of data ahead of time, to be ready before the user requests them. ...|$|R
25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes. Unlike the clutched system, however, {{in this case}} all turning requires braking. This {{can be used on}} lighter tanks, but the amount of kinetic energy in larger tanks makes the required brakes impractically large. Another disadvantage is that the differential will allow the tracks to turn at different speeds no matter what the cause may be. This may be the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>braking,</b> but also occurs as the tank travels over terrain; if one side of the tank enters softer terrain and slows down, the tank will naturally turn towards that side. Forward momentum tends to offset this effect, so it is mainly a problem at low speeds.|$|R
