25|$|Tobruk {{is capable}} of embarking between 300 and 520 {{soldiers}} (extended duration versus short term), along with 1,300 tons of cargo or 330 lane metres of vehicles (equivalent to 18 Leopard 1 or M1 Abrams main battle tanks plus 40 M113 armored personnel carriers or Australian Light Armoured Vehicles). Vehicles and cargo can be embarked via bow or stern ramps, with the reinforced tank-deck running {{the length of the}} ship, and inter-deck transfer ramps fitted. The bow ramp is contained behind horizontal-opening bow doors, and can be extended and lowered for beach or harbour loading, while at the stern a combined door-ramp can be used conventionally when at suitable facilities, or for ramp-to-ramp loading of landing craft at sea. Additional cargo handling is provided by the 70-tonne Velle <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>derrick</b> (a feature singled out for attention in Jane's Fighting Ships), supplemented by two 8.5-tonne Favco cranes. Two LCM-8 landing craft can be carried in cradles on the main deck, while two LCVP are carried in derricks on the superstructure. Two Naval Lighterage Equipment pontoons can be carried on the ship's flanks to extend the reach of the bow ramp when beaching, or as rafts to transport cargo ashore. The ship has an aft helicopter platform capable of handling aircraft up to Sea King size, while the main deck (once cleared of landing craft and cargo) {{can be used as a}} secondary flight deck for helicopters up to Chinook size. Both flight decks can be operated simultaneously, and both have capability for landed or at-hover refuelling.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} three sister ships were the heavy lift {{vessels in the}} Safmarine fleet, also for carrying general cargo. The [...] "S.A.Van Der Stel", [...] "S.A. Weltevreden", and the [...] "S.A. Nederburg". were all built by a Dutch company, and entered service in the mid-1960s. The S.A. Van Der Stel could lift 250 tons with her own derricks {{and the other two}} could lift 125 tons. They were all powered by a six-cylinder M.A.N K6Z86/160 low-speed two-stroke diesel engine, developing approximately 14,000 BHP and a speed of 21 knots. For electrical power three M.A.N diesel engines drove AC alternators.These ships were modified in Japan in 1975/1976. An additional hold specially designed for containers approximately 100' long was added amidships. A new <b>heavy</b> <b>lift</b> <b>derrick</b> was added and loading points were added on deck for container mounting.|$|E

50|$|The Stiffleg derrick, {{also known}} as a Scotch derrick, is a derrick with a boom similar to a guy derrick, but instead of using guy wires to secure the top of the mast, it uses two or more stiff members, called stifflegs, which are capable of {{resisting}} either tensile or compressive forces. Sills may also be used to connect between the bottom ends of the stifflegs and the base of the mast. There may be a counterweight to place on the sills behind the stifflegs in <b>heavy</b> load <b>lifting.</b> Stiffleg <b>derrick</b> on a vessel is called a floating stiffleg derrick. Derricks are especially useful for high rise rigging, jobs that cover a long period of time, or jobs when the impact to the street/pedestrian traffic is a concern.|$|R

In terms of lifting capacity it reached its peak in 1978 with refitting the Japanese built bulk carrier MV Trifels with two 320 t Stülcken derricks. Shortly after that, in 1980, DDG went bankrupt.

40|$|Abstract Background Occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> {{is known}} to impose a high {{cardiovascular}} strain, but the risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) from occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> is unknown. The objective {{was to investigate the}} association between occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> and risk of IHD and all-cause mortality, and the influence of occupational and leisure time physical activity on this association. Methods Data were analyzed from 1987, 1994, and 2000 from the Danish National Health Interview Surveys providing a sample of 6, 692 working men and 5, 921 working women aged 16 – 85 [*]years without cardiovascular disease at baseline. Conventional risk factors for the outcomes IHD and all-cause mortality were controlled for in Cox analyses. Results Among men, <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> was associated with increased risk for IHD (hazard ratio (HR) : 1. 52, 95 % Confidence interval (95 % CI) : 1. 15, 2. 02), while a decreased risk was associated with occupational (HR: 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 37, 0. 68) and leisure time (HR: 0. 73, 95 % CI: 0. 56, 0. 95) physical activity. Referencing men with high occupational physical activity and no <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting,</b> men with high occupational physical activity and <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> did not have an increased risk (HR: 1. 11, 95 % CI: 0. 68, 1. 82), while men with low occupational physical activity and <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> had a substantial increased risk (HR: 2. 56, 95 % CI: 1. 52, 4. 32). No significant associations were found for all-cause mortality or for females. Conclusion These findings indicate an excessive risk for IHD from occupational <b>heavy</b> <b>lifting</b> among men, particularly among those with low occupational and leisure time physical activity. </p...|$|R
