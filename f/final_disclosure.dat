I have not liked to press the subject while she was so ill, as she always met every hint of it with tears and agitation. However, at last, Lida brought her to it, and we really believe she knows no {{more than we do}} what became of her first husband. She never heard of him after she fled from him. She was almost a child, and he had been very cruel to her. But she did tell us where we may be nearly certain of finding out, namely from Signor Menotti, Via San Giacomo, Genoa, or his successors, a man who trained singers and performers, and {{moreover}} took charge of Benista's money, and she thinks he had considerable savings. Poor woman, I believe she had no idea of the harm she might be doing me, though it was scarcely in human nature to see prosperity look so aggressive without trying to profit thereby; and when she had put herself into O'Leary's power, the notion was to make an income out of me by private threats and holding their tongues. That I should have any objection to such an arrangement, except on economical principles, never entered their heads, and they tried to make as much as possible out of either me or Clement, by withholding all the information possible till it was paid for, and our simultaneous refusal to be blackmailed entirely disconcerted them, and made them furious. Lida said the man was violent with her mother for letting out even what she did to Lance, and he meant to put a heavy price even on the <b>final</b> <b>disclosure,</b> in the trust (which I share) that it may prove the key to the mystery. She had no notion that the doubt was upsetting my position. Poor thing, she never had a chance in her life-—gipsy breeding at first, then Benista's tender mercies and the wandering life. She could not fail to love my father till his requirements piqued her, and it was a quarrel, exasperated perhaps by the commencement of his illness, over her neglect of my unlucky self, and her acceptance of Schnetterling's attentions, that led to her abandoning him. I really do not think she ever realized that it was a sin. That good Pere Duchamps is the first priest of any kind she ever listened to, and he has had a great effect upon her. He would like to extend it to Lida and me, but Lida is staunch to her well-beloved Mr. Flight as well as to me, and there is a church on the other side the bay to which I take her when our patient is well enough to spare her to walk, or we can afford the crossing. Easter was a comfort there.|$|E

60|$|But {{after his}} second glass, Israel {{declined}} to drink more, mild as the beverage was. For he noticed, {{that not only}} did the three gentlemen listen with the utmost interest to his story, but likewise interrupted him with questions and cross-questions in the most pertinacious manner. So this led him to be on his guard, not being absolutely certain yet, as to who they might really be, or what was their real design. But as it turned out, Squire Woodcock and his friends only sought to satisfy themselves thoroughly, before making their <b>final</b> <b>disclosures,</b> that the exile was one in whom implicit confidence might be placed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a framework where two agents {{are participating in}} a tournament that has two stages, intermediate and final. The results of the intermediate stage are observed by the principal who organizes the tournament, but not by the agents. This paper attempts {{to answer the question}} of how much information about the intermediate results the principal should disclose back to the agents in order to maximize their aggregate effort. We find that, when choosing the disclosure policy, the principal faces a tradeoff between intermediate and <b>final</b> effort. The <b>disclosure</b> policy that resolves this tradeoff in the optimal way includes two public announcements: one is made if both agents do poorly, and the other one otherwise. Consequently, both the policy of full disclosure and the policy of no disclosure are suboptimal...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{adoption}} of the Union Smotrytsky was a huge advocate of complete reunification of the Church. He hid {{the fact that he had}} already converted to the Union. His attitude, however, began to raise suspicions among the clergy. While retaining his popularity among the priests and faithful in Belarus, he lost trust among both the Vilnius fraternity and Kiev monks in monasteries. At the same time, Catholics were not yet convinced that Smotrytsky maintained full fidelity to his recently adopted Catholicism. On April 8, 1628, Cardinal Ludovisi in a letter to Alexander Zasławski demanded that the minister make a public profession of the Catholic faith. Smotrycki by then no longer resided in Vilnius, but in a monastery in Derman. The events that led to the <b>final</b> <b>disclosure</b> of Smotrytsky's conversion to Catholicism are known from a number of documents originating from himself or from his Orthodox opponents. Smotrytsky claimed that for the first time after conversion he had met with the Orthodox bishops of the Republic during the celebration of the Nativity of Our Lady in 1627 in Kiev. The meeting was also attended by Peter Mogila, who was still a layman. Mogila and Archbishop Job asked Smotrycki to show them the catechism which the Patriarch of Constantinople had presented. The next meeting of the hierarchy took place on the sixth Sunday of Lent in Horodku, on property belonging to the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. It was attended, in addition to Meletius Smotrytsky, by the Metropolitan Job, Bishop Isaac of Lutsk, Chelm Paisjusz and Peter Mogila, who was already igumen in the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra. Smotrytsky delivered a speech at the meeting, discussing the six basic differences between the two confessions. Then the assembled council decided to convene the Orthodox Church in Kiev; not only the clergy had taken part in it, but also representatives of the Orthodox nobility and bourgeoisie. The bishops agreed to present at the Council a draft union for the Orthodox and Uniate Churches. Hierarchs agreed thereby that contrary to earlier findings, ...|$|E
40|$|Most of society's {{innovation}} systems – academic science, {{the patent}} system, open source, etc. – are “open” {{in the sense}} that they are designed to facilitate knowledge disclosure among innovators. An essential difference across innovation systems is whether disclosure is of intermediate progress and solutions or of completed innovations. We theorize and present experimental evidence linking intermediate versus <b>final</b> <b>disclosure</b> to an ‘incentives-versus-reuse’ tradeoff and to a transformation of the innovation search process. We find intermediate disclosure has the advantage of efficiently steering development towards improving existing solution approaches, but also has the effect of limiting experimentation and narrowing technological search. We discuss the comparative advantages of intermediate versus <b>final</b> <b>disclosure</b> policies in fostering innovation...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis is to chart aH of the prose fiction works which have been already published, written by the Czech contemporary author Jáchym Topol. We are analyzing all works which are individually foucusing on the <b>final</b> <b>disclosure</b> of the possible agreeing points and therefore which means the connection between some of the proses. Among other questions, we are asking whether or not {{could be the most}} expressive novel Sestra and whether it could be seen as a melting pot full of inspiration in the complex of Topoľs works which the author has been using for his later works ever since...|$|E
40|$|The topos of {{the window}} and {{analogous}} framing devices is one of the recurrent characteristics of Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s work, and, as examples of this discretionary practice, one need recall only some of the many scenes that are framed by windows: the view of Yonville through the carriage window or the stainedglass window that is, very nearly, La Légende de Saint Julien l 2 ̆ 7 hospitalier. But windows are only incidentally our concern, for as the views of Yvetot and Constantinople equally signify something beyond themselves, so does this topos tie into a larger question, which is the evolution of Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s practice of closure. The term evolution is meant as a temporal phenomenon only in referring to the order in which the major works were published or were to be published had not Flaubert 2 ̆ 7 s death intervened. Within this order (from Madame Bovary to Bouvard et Pécuchet and Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues) there is an obvious movement towards ever greater abstraction of character, narrative form and sequence, and causal and temporal referentiality. The atemporal aspect of this 2 ̆ 2 evolution” is that one can find Flaubert practicing at the same time, and during the composition of a single work, forms that will be either used or deferred, indeed as he deferred some entire projects in favor of others. Such a 2 ̆ 2 split 2 ̆ 2 practice can be seen in two scenes from Madame Bovary, one kept for publication and the other discarded, which serve as examples of two of the most prominent framing devices that Flaubert will use, with or without the topos {{of the window}}. In one case the window is a synchronizing device. In the other it is used to establish a diachronic series of successive views that compose a larger narrative unit. The main point of this essay is to show that the structure of synchronic framing and scenic closure is gradually displaced in importance by the diachronic series of open-ended episodes, each reiterative of the preceding in its failure to be resolved and in its search for a <b>final</b> <b>disclosure</b> that will enclose and close the search. Moreover, this development parallels an increased focalization of narrative point of view as well as the growing intrusion on narrative form of theatrical structures, at least as they were understood and practiced by Flaubert towards the middle of his career...|$|E
