2500|$|... "Colour {{vision is}} {{the faculty of}} the {{organism}} to <b>distinguish</b> <b>lights</b> of different spectral qualities." [...] All organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum; this varies from creature to creature, but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700nm.|$|R
50|$|Actinic {{light was}} first {{commonly}} used in early photography to <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> that would expose the monochrome films from light that would not. A non-actinic safe-light (e.g., red or amber) {{could be used in}} a darkroom without risk of exposing (fogging) light-sensitive films, plates or papers.|$|R
2500|$|The very {{earliest}} [...] "eyes", called eyespots, {{were simple}} patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals. In multicellular beings, multicellular eyespots evolved, physically {{similar to the}} receptor patches for taste and smell. These eyespots could only sense ambient brightness: they could <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> and dark, but not {{the direction of the}} light source.|$|R
50|$|The {{globular}} compound eyes {{each have}} up to 28000 ommatidia and provide sharp color vision; On the forehead there are three ocelli, which can <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> from dark, and help with orientation in flight. The two short antennae are tactile receptors. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of}} the head and include simple chewing mandibles.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{living in}} an entirely {{subterranean}} environment, Damaraland mole-rats exhibit circadian rhythms, and are active primarily during the day. Their levels of the hormone melatonin can be altered by artificially changing the length of apparent daylight, suggesting that they are at least able to <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> from dark, although their eyesight may otherwise be very poor.|$|R
50|$|A doha is a couplet {{consisting}} of two lines, each of 24 instants (Matras). The rules for <b>distinguishing</b> <b>light</b> and heavy syllables is slightly different from Sanskrit. Each line has 13 instants in first part and 11 instants in the second. The first and third quarters of doha have 13 instants which must parse as 6-4-3.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of gastropods have simple visual organs, eye spots {{either at the}} tip or base of the tentacles. However, [...] "eyes" [...] in gastropods range from simple ocelli that only <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> and dark, to more complex pit eyes, and even to lens eyes. In land snails and slugs, vision {{is not the most}} important sense, because they are mainly nocturnal animals.|$|R
40|$|Light weapons pose serious {{threats to}} human security. A shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile—commonly {{known as a}} man-portable air-defence system (MANPADS) —can be used to shoot down a {{civilian}} airliner with hundreds of passengers on board. A lone gunman can kill a head of state with a 12. 7 mm sniper rifle {{from a distance of}} a kilometre or more. Lethal combinations of explosive power, technological sophistication, and range <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> weapon...|$|R
5000|$|... == Eyes == In {{terrestrial}} pulmonate gastropods, eye {{spots are}} {{present at the}} tips of the tentacles in the Stylommatophora or {{at the base of the}} tentacles in the Basommatophora. These eye spots range from simple ocelli that cannot project an image (simply <b>distinguishing</b> <b>light</b> and dark), to more complex pit and even lens eyes. Vision is not the most important requirement in terrestrial gastropods, because they are mainly nocturnal animals.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} recent {{research}} {{on the role of}} melanopsin in optogenetic therapy for patients with the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Reintroducing functional melanopsin into the eyes of mice with retinal degeneration restores the pupillary light reflex (PLR). These same mice could also <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> stimuli from dark stimuli and showed increased sensitivity to room light. The higher sensitivity demonstrated by these mice shows promise for vision restoration that may be applicable to humans and human eye diseases.|$|R

[...] All organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum; this varies from creature to creature, but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm.This is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum, probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ: water blocks out all but two small windows of the EM spectrum, and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range.|$|R
50|$|Spectral {{resolution}} {{is the ability}} to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. Color images <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> of different spectra. Multispectral images resolve even finer differences of spectrum or wavelength than is needed to reproduce color. That is, multispectral images have higher spectral resolution than normal color images.Spectral {{resolution is}} the ability to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. The spectral resolution required by the analyst or researcher depends upon the application involved. For example, routine analysis for basic sample identification typically requires low/medium resolution.|$|R

60|$|The {{one point}} of union between the parishes of Rockstone and Rockquay was a choral society, whereof Mr. Flight of St. Kenelm's was a <b>distinguished</b> <b>light,</b> and which gave {{periodical}} concerts in the Masonic Hall. It being musical, Miss Mohun {{had nothing to do}} with it except the feeling it needful to give her presence to the performances. One of these was to take place in the course of the week, and there were programmes in all the shops, 'Mr. Alexis White' being set down for more than one solo, and as a voice in the glees.|$|R
50|$|Logical {{functions}} (AND, OR, NOR, XOR, NOT) {{were carried}} out using two-wave signal processing. High diffraction efficiency allowed a CCD detector to <b>distinguish</b> between <b>light</b> pixels (1 bits) and dark pixels (0 bits).|$|R
50|$|Autofluorescence is {{the natural}} {{emission}} of light by biological structures such as mitochondria and lysosomes when they have absorbed light, and is used to <b>distinguish</b> the <b>light</b> originating from artificially added fluorescent markers (fluorophores).|$|R
25|$|Snake vision varies greatly, {{from only}} {{being able to}} <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> from dark to keen eyesight, but the main trend is that their vision is {{adequate}} although not sharp, and allows them to track movements. Generally, vision is best in arboreal snakes and weakest in burrowing snakes. Some snakes, such as the Asian vine snake (genus Ahaetulla), have binocular vision, with both eyes capable of focusing on the same point. Most snakes focus by moving the lens {{back and forth in}} relation to the retina, while in the other amniote groups, the lens is stretched. Many nocturnal snakes have slit pupils while diurnal snakes have round pupils.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the European Union {{published}} Directive 92/61/EEC which {{considered that}} quadricycles {{fell into the}} same category as mopeds. Framework Directive 2002/24/EC then refined this definition by <b>distinguishing</b> between <b>light</b> and heavy quadricycles (L6e and L7e categories).|$|R
2500|$|While {{mindful of}} R. v. Gonzales (in which the British Columbia Court of Appeal found section 94 {{consistent}} with the Canadian Bill of Rights), Justice Morrow asserted {{that it must be}} <b>distinguished</b> in <b>light</b> of Robertson and Rosetanni v. R..|$|R
30|$|The {{percentages}} reporting reading professional {{journals and}} books {{are larger than}} expected. Devising unambiguous questions for complexity of reading material is more difficult than for math and the item for professional journals may include over-reporting relative to what an external observer might consider a professional journal, but this cannot be confirmed without more intensive study. In addition, in {{the first wave of}} STAMP it was anticipated that so few people would read books as a regular part of their jobs that the question asked whether respondents ever read work-related books, which probably led to over-reporting as well. The second wave collected additional information on the number of books usually read to <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> from heavy readers.|$|R
40|$|This design-research thesis proposes the {{redesign}} of Tide Lock Park in Alexandria, Virginia as {{an exploration of}} light. By researching the cultural history of artificial lighting {{as well as the}} sculptural use of light as art, this thesis seeks to <b>distinguish</b> <b>lighting</b> design that goes beyond functional and safety concerns to include design that honors the human relationship to darkness, as well as the artistic and emotive qualities of lighting. To accomplish these goals, this thesis proposes a landscape design for Tide Lock Park which meets the City of Alexandria's objectives as described in the Waterfront Small Area Plan. The design includes three distinctive areas of light, providing visitors the opportunity to engage the night in multiple ways...|$|R
6000|$|... "His food is {{much the}} same as that of Teeny Weeny--worms, insects, flesh when he can get it, and seeds. He is fond of beechnuts. He is quite equal to killing a Mouse of his own size or bigger and does not {{hesitate}} to do so when he gets the chance. He makes a soft, comfortable nest under a log or in a stump or in the ground and has from four to six babies at a time. Teeny Weeny sometimes has as many as ten. The senses of smell and hearing are very keen and make up for the lack of sight. His eyes, like those of other Shrews, are probably of use only in <b>distinguishing</b> <b>light</b> from darkness. His coat is dark brownish-gray.|$|R
2500|$|The trams are powered with {{electricity}} conveyed by overhead wires. Trams {{have their own}} traffic <b>lights,</b> <b>distinguished</b> from normal <b>lights</b> {{in that they are}} based on symbols of single colour: an upward-pointing arrow signifies [...] "go", a horizontal line [...] "prepare to stop" [...] and the letter S [...] "stop". The traffic lights are synchronised to allow tram and bus traffic to flow relatively smoothly. This system is called HeLMi (Helsinki Public Transport Signal Priority and Passenger Information).|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn Extreme Value {{statistics}} {{we often}} encounter testing procedures {{for assessing the}} presence of the Gumbel domain, attached to the simple null hypothesis of shape parameter, thus praising the selection of extreme domains of attraction. However, the problem of assessing for light tailed distributions with finite or infinite right endpoint is seldom referred. The latter is an impending problem of practical importance, particularly at the enrollment of subsequent estimation of extremal features such as small exceedance probabilities. In this paper, we present two test statistics whose asymptotic behavior, albeit under some restrictive yet reasonable conditions, enables to <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> tailed distribution functions with finite right endpoint from those with infinite endpoint lying in the Gumbel domain. An illustrative example is provided via application to significant wave height data recorded at Figueira da Foz, Portugal, from 1958 until 2001...|$|R
5000|$|The success, {{with which}} the Life of Knox was attended, would have been {{sufficient}} to make most authors repeat the attempt; but, besides this, the task of Dr. M'Crie had already been chosen, of which his first great effort had only been the commencement. The <b>distinguished</b> <b>lights</b> of the Scottish Reformation had long stood arrayed before his view as successively demanding their due commemoration; and after having completed the first and best in the series, {{the choice of the}} next was not a matter of difficulty. [...] "If the love of pure religion, rational liberty, and polite letters," [...] he writes, [...] "forms the basis of national virtue and happiness, I know no individual, after her reformer, from whom Scotland has received greater benefits, and to whom she owes a deeper debt of gratitude and respect, than Andrew Melville." ...|$|R

[...] "He has very small eyes, tiny things, which you might find if you should part the fur around them, but they are of use only to <b>distinguish</b> <b>light</b> from darkness. Miner hasn't the least idea what any of you look like. You see, he spends his life under ground and of course has no use for eyes there. They would be a nuisance, for the dirt would be {{continually}} getting in them if they were any larger than they are or were not protected as they are. If you should feel of Miner's nose you would find it hard. That is because he uses it to bore with in the earth. Just notice those hands of his." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Jones {{fog bell}} was placed near Bald Head Lighthouse in 1855. In {{the same year}} the Lighthouse Board {{recommended}} improving the light by replacing the original apparatus with a third-order Fresnel lens.

40|$|It is now {{established}} that native language affects one's {{perception of the}} world. However, it is unknown whether this effect is merely driven by conscious, language-based evaluation of the environment or whether it reflects fundamental differences in perceptual processing between individuals speaking different languages. Using brain potentials, we demonstrate that the existence in Greek of 2 color terms [...] ghalazio and ble [...] <b>distinguishing</b> <b>light</b> and dark blue leads to greater and faster perceptual discrimination of these colors in native speakers of Greek than in native speakers of English. The visual mismatch negativity, an index of automatic and preattentive change detection, was similar for blue and green deviant stimuli during a color oddball detection task in English participants, but it was significantly larger for blue than green deviant stimuli in native speakers of Greek. These findings establish an implicit effect of language-specific terminology on human color perception...|$|R

40|$|Mariners {{frequently}} have trouble <b>distinguishing</b> <b>lighted</b> aids to navigation {{in areas with}} a high density of background lights. The Coast Guard is seeking ways to enhance the conspicuity, or likelihood of being noticed, of these aids. Literature has shown that a flashing light is more conspicuous than one that is steady. To improve conspicuity by determining optimal flash characteristics, we had 20 observers search for a flashing point of light among backgrounds of steady lights on a CRT screen. In single 360 -trial sessions, observers indicated which of five screen sectors contained the flashing target, and accuracy and response time were recorded. Targets were flashed at 1, 2, and 3. 85 Hz, each at duty cycles of. 3,. 5, and. 8. An ANOVA showed significant effects of frequency, duty cycle, and background light density. Search time increased with number of background lights. Conspicuity improved as frequency increased and as duty cycle decreased...|$|R
