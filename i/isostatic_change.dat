50|$|Occasionally, {{if there}} is no estuary then it is {{possible}} for the spit to grow across {{to the other side of}} the bay and form what is called a bar, or barrier. Barriers come in several varieties, but all form in a manner similar to spits. They usually enclose a bay to form a lagoon. They can join two headlands or join a headland to the mainland. When an island is joined to the mainland with a bar or barrier it is known as a tombolo. This usually occurs due to wave refraction, but can also be caused by <b>isostatic</b> <b>change,</b> a change in the level of the land (e.g. Chesil Beach). An example of this is along the Holderness coastline.|$|E
50|$|The {{sea level}} on earth {{regularly}} {{rises and falls}} due to climatic changes. During cold periods more of the Earth’s water is stored as ice in glaciers while during warm periods it is released and sea levels rise to cover more land. Sea levels are currently quite high, while just 18,000 years ago during the Pleistocene ice age they were quite low. Global warming may result in further rises in the future, which presents a risk to coastal cities as most would be flooded by only small rises. As sea levels rise, fjords and rias form. Fjords are flooded glacial valleys and rias are flooded river valleys. Fjords typically have steep rocky sides, while rias have dendritic drainage patterns typical of drainage zones. As tectonic plates move about the Earth they can rise and fall due to changing pressures {{and the presence of}} glaciers. If a beach is moving upwards relative to other plates this is known as <b>isostatic</b> <b>change</b> and raised beaches can be formed.|$|E
50|$|The {{surface of}} Earth is {{modified}} {{by a combination}} of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and shape the coastal geography.

Many of these factors are strongly mediated by climate. Geologic processes include the uplift of mountain ranges, the growth of volcanoes, <b>isostatic</b> <b>changes</b> in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep sedimentary basins where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material eroded from other parts of the landscape.

40|$|A {{modeling}} methodology {{based on}} a multi-scale hybrid morphodynamic model and representative climatic driving conditions is presented to study the long-term morphological evolution of wave-dominated coasts on a centennial-to-millennial scale. The Darss-Zingst peninsula at the southern Baltic Sea, which developed during the last 6000 years by a combined effect of eustatic sea level <b>change,</b> <b>isostatic</b> movement, meteorological drivers and nearshore sediment dynamics, is selected for a case study. A paleo-Digital Elevation Model (DEM) serving as initial condition is reconstructed by a compilation of recent digital elevation data sets, an eustatic sea-level curve, an isostatic map and dated sediment cores. Representative wind series are generated {{based on a}} statistical analysis of paleo-wind data from a simulation with the coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model ECHO-G over the last 7000 cal yr. These wind data were calibrated by proxies from lithostratigraphic studies of sediment cores from the central Baltic Sea, and used as climate driving conditions for the morphodynamic model. Based on the reconstructed paleo-DEM and the representative climatic driving conditions, the methodology is applied to reconstruct the Holocene morphogenesis of the Darss-Zingst peninsula since 6000 cal yr BP. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} development of the barrier system is a combination of long-term effects of climate <b>change,</b> <b>isostatic</b> crustal movement, wave dynamics and eolian transport with short-term effects of extreme wind events, i. e. storms.

40|$|Abstract Background The Chilean shoreline, {{a nearly}} strait line of coast {{expanding}} across 35 latitudinal degrees, represents an interesting region to assess historical processes using phylogeographic analyses. Stretching along the temperate {{section of the}} East Pacific margin, the region is characterized by intense geologic activity and has experienced drastic geomorphological transformations linked to eustatic and <b>isostatic</b> <b>changes</b> during the Quaternary. In this study, we used two molecular markers to evaluate the existence of phylogeographic discontinuities and detect the genetic footprints of Pleistocene glaciations among Patagonian populations of Mazzaella laminarioides, a low-dispersal benthic intertidal red seaweed that inhabits along ~ 3, 700 [*]km of the Chilean coastal rocky shore. Results Three main genetic lineages were found within M. laminarioides. They are distributed along the Chilean coast in strict parapatry. The deep divergence among lineages suggests {{that they could be}} considered putative genetic sibling species. Unexpectedly, genetic breaks were not strictly concordant with the biogeographic breaks described in the region. A Northern lineage was restricted to a broad transition zone located between 30 °S and 33 °S and showed signals of a recent bottleneck. The reduction of population size could be related to warm events linked to El Niño Southern Oscillation, which is known to cause massive seaweed mortality in this region. To the south, we propose that transient habitat discontinuities driven by episodic tectonic uplifting of the shoreline around the Arauco region (37 °S- 38 °S); one of the most active forearc-basins in the South East Pacific; could be at the origin of the Central/South genetic break. The large beaches, located around 38 °S, are likely to contribute to the lineages’ integrity by limiting present gene flow. Finally, the Southern lineage, occupies an area affected by ice-cover during the last glaciations. Phylogeny suggested it is a derived clade and demographic analyses showed the lineage has a typical signature of postglacial recolonization from a northern glacial refugium area. Conclusions Even if environmental adaptation could have strengthened divergence among lineages in M. laminarioides, low dispersal capacity and small population size are sufficient to generate phylogeographic discontinuities determined by genetic drift alone. Interestingly, our results confirm that seaweed population connectivity over large geographic scales does not rely only on dispersal capacity but also seem to depend highly on substratum availability and population density of the receiving locality. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Pliocene Epoch {{represents}} a significant {{period in the}} palaeozoogeography of North Atlantic, Arctic and northern Pacific podocopid ostracods. A climate crash during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) G 6 (c. 2. 74 Ma) resulted in the extinction of early-mid Pliocene thermophilic ostracods and the subsequent emergence of oligothermal assemblages during the late Pliocene. During the numerous cold stages of the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene Arctic ostracod species were able to disperse southwards into the mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. The Pre-Ludhamian Stage of the Red Crag Formation, Suffolk, England spans one such episode (c. 2. 7 – 2. 41 Ma) and thus offers new insight into the vagility of shallow marine ostracods as they responded to glacio-eustatic and <b>isostatic</b> <b>changes.</b> Five podocopid ostracods are described from the Sizewell Member (Pre-Ludhamian Stage) of the Red Crag Formation and new information regarding their phylogeny and palaeozoogeography is presented. Four of the species are new to science, Microcytherura gelida sp. nov., Thaerocythere liebaui sp. nov., Thaerocythere russus sp. nov. and Pectocythere hollowayae sp. nov., while the fifth, Neomonoceratina tsurugasakensis (Tabuki), is reexamined and reassigned. The comparative morphology of Pectocythere Hanai and Kotoracythere Ishizaki is reviewed and a morphological continuum recognized between phenotypic end-members. Pectocythere hollowayae sp. nov. forms part of a distinctive morphological group comprising Arctic and northern Pacific species: P. ishizakii Irizuki and Yamada, Pectocythere? sp. cf. P. ? dentarticulata (Smith) sensu Swain and Gilby, Kotoracythere sp. Irizuki, P. janae Brouwers and P. parkerae Swain and Gilby. Although lacking a distinctive caudal process, Paijenborchella tsurugasakensis Tabuki is reassigned to Neomonoceratina sensu Zhao and Whatley. Neomonoceratina tsurugasakensis displays some minor polymorphism over an enormous geo-temporal range that extends from the early Miocene of the northwestern Pacific to the late Pliocene-early Pleistocene of the southern North Sea Basin. Despite its lack of pelagic larvae N. tsurugasakensis was capable of transoceanic dispersal, evidenced by its occurrence in the early Pliocene (c. 4. 90 – 4. 81 Ma), Oosterhout Formation, Western Netherlands Basin, alongside other pan-Arctic and North Pacific ostracod taxa. Mechanisms of dispersal remain unclear but could involve passive transport on Fucus brown algae, aided by the Transpolar Drift. Further agents of dispersion could include fish and birds. The viability of water birds as vectors of invertebrate dispersal is given further credence by the discovery of Phoebastria anglica (Lydekker), a fossil albatross, in the Pliocene crags of East Anglia...|$|R
5000|$|During the Emerson Phase lake {{levels and}} {{drainage}} patterns continually fluctuated. The lake {{moved from a}} southward outlet to a northwestern outlet, {{and may have been}} static without a significant outlet during this phase. <b>Isostatic</b> rebound <b>changed</b> the altitude of the land, and this, combined with changes in the volume of meltwater from the ice margin and the closure of the Kaministikwia outlet in the east increased the size of the northern end of the lake. [...] One hypothesis postulates that the lake was a ‘terminal lake’ with water inflows and evapotranspiration being equal. Dating of the glacial moraines shows that the Clearwater and Athabasca River system and Lake Nipigon and Minong basin were still ice-covered.

[...] During this phase, the Clearwater and Athabasca River system outlet opened.

40|$|Accommodation zones on rift systems produce {{distinctive}} sedimentary facies and facies architecture. The Puertecitos volcanic {{province in}} the northern Gulf Extensional Province comprises an accommodation zone and records marine sedimentation and explosive volcanism during upper Miocene and early Pliocene time. The volcano-sedimentary sequence consists of two ·westward-thinning, wedge-shaped transgressive-regressive marine sequences, each less than 100 m thick, separated by one large pyroclastic flow unit. Northward the lower member is separated from the upper member by an angular unconformity and/or an interval of subaerial erosion. To the southeast, the volcanic units dominate the stratigraphic sections, whereas northward the two marine sequences dominate and contain the distal volcaniclastic facies. We propose the name of Puertecitos Formation to formally name this volcanosedimentary sequence. The sedimentary facies crop out in subparallel narrow belts along the present range front {{to the east of}} the volcanic province. The fossil assemblages and the sedimentary facies show that this area was a tide-dominated marine embayment and alluvial plain, deepening to the east. Although the environment is favorable for the formation of bioclastic carbonates, the section is essentially devoid of significant carbonate deposits. Instead, the basin was filled with epiclastic and pyroclastic material, and individual volcanic units occur as both subaerial and submarine facies and provide excellent chronostratigraphic markers. <b>Isostatic</b> sea-level <b>changes</b> and volcaniclastic deposits had a major impact on the facies distribution. Sediment accumulation rates were low. Pre- and postsedimentary deformation was produced by an evenly distributed array of normal faults with small individual offset. This fault pattern produced local facies variations and a distinct facies architecture that contrasts with sedimentary facies associated with basins on rift segments to the north and elsewhere in the Gulf Extensional Province, where rapid subsidence and coarse-grained deposits are associated with large vertical separation on basin-bounding faults...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{technological}} {{advances in the}} study and dating of both land and marine glacial geologic features combined with improvements in both glaciological and post-glacial isostatic rebound modelling have led to significant improvements in our knowledge and understanding of the Antarctic Ice Sheets at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and their subsequent changes throughout the Holocene. Here we review the geological evidence for the extent and timing of the maximum advance of the East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets and the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula during the most recent glacial cycle. We also discuss evidence for the rate and timing of Holocene Ice Sheet retreat. Geological data provide a very important ‘first-hand’ record of ice-sheet changes over a range of time periods. They are also useful for constraining and improving models which then have the potential to both fill in the gaps for which geological data are unavailable, and to make predictions of the future. Inspection of the geological record allows us to form qualitative scenarios concerning glacial history. Numerical modelling has been used on several occasions to test such hypotheses. We discuss such numerical studies, indicating both their importance and limitations in order to develop quantitative ideas about the late Quaternary history of the ice sheet. An important environmental aspect of Antarctica's glacial history is its contribution to global sea level rise since the LGM. The past decade has seen the range of estimates (from reconstructions based solely on geological evidence, on glaciological modelling constrained by geology and on modelling of the <b>isostatic</b> rebound) <b>change</b> from 0. 5 – 38 m sea level equivalent to 5. 9 – 19. 2 m.

Georgian Bay experienced a lowstand ending approximately 7, 200 years ago which cannot be explained by geological events, however this lowstand caused a basin-wide unconformity and is associated with microfossils adapted to slightly brackish conditions (i. e. high concentrations of ions) and relatively high abundances of aquatic pollen recording proximity to the shoreline in a core taken from approximately 120 m water depth.

Georgian Bay experienced a lowstand that caused a basin wide unconformity approximately 7, 500 years ago that cannot be explained by geological events. Thecamoebians are shelled protozoans abundant in freshwater environments and they are generally more sensitive to changing environmental conditions than the surrounding vegetation. Thecamoebians {{can be used to}} reconstruct the paleolimnology. The abundance of thecamoebians belonging to the genus Centropyxis, which are known to tolerate slightly brackish conditions (i. e. high concentrations of ions) records highly evaporative conditions in a closed basin.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, a {{breeding}} colony of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens L.) at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba, has grown 8 % annually. This increase {{has led to}} significant loss of plant cover in all major salt- and freshwater coastal habitats between 1976 and 1997. A series of transects established in 1976 was resurveyed in 1997. Exposed sediment, extent and type of vegetative cover, and aquatic areas were recorded along transects using a classification of 12 a priori classes. Five regions within the colony were identified, and changes in vegetation cover differed among these and depended on unique combinations of vegetation class and year. Grubbing by geese has led to loss of graminoid plants, especially in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Exposed sediments have largely replaced previously vegetated areas since 1976. Species characteristic of disturbed sites have colonized exposed sediment with the most abundant species varying according to soil conditions. In intertidal marshes, willow cover declined {{in association with the}} development of hypersalinity after loss of the graminoid mat, but willow cover increased at the base of well-drained beach ridges and in a river delta with ample winter snow accumulation and freshwater flow in spring that protected ground vegetation. Most of the expected successional trends associated with <b>isostatic</b> uplift and <b>changes</b> in soil organic matter failed to occur because of intense goose foraging throughout the 20 years.

Glacial Lake Agassiz {{was the largest}} of the proglacial lakes to have formed in North America during retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. The extent of Lake Agassiz was controlled by a combination of factors including topography, ice position and degree of <b>isostatic</b> rebound. Most <b>changes</b> in the outlet location of the lake involved a catastrophic release of water. Evidence for some of these catastrophic floods are visible in both terrestrial and sub‐lacustrine records. An influx of freshwater from Lake Agassiz to the North Atlantic from such floods has been suggested as a possible trigger for the initiation of the Younger Dryas cold interval. A series of airgun single‐channel seismic‐reflection profiles from Thunder Bay and the adjacent Isle Royal Trough of Lake Superior suggest that water from Glacial Lake Agassiz did not catastrophically release into Lake Superior at this locality, as has been previously suggested. Seismic surveys from a region further north within Lake Superior identified features of a younger catastrophic release of water. The features associated with the younger event include bedrock scour and large debris fans, neither of which are present in the Thunder Bay area. Given the similarity in geomorphic conditions at the two locations, similar features are expected if the same type of event occurred. Therefore, the absence of such features suggests that Lake Agassiz did not drain catastrophically through Thunder Bay. Instead of catastrophic outflow features in the seismic records, a thick package of distinct units occur in the Isle Royale trough, which suggest a complex history of ice retreat and readvance. Trough parallel profiles show a massive seismic package, which grades into more individually distinguishable units in the direction of general ice retreat...|$|R

A return to stratified, open-water conditions and a reduction in winter sea-ice extent between 2750 and 2200 cal. yr BP is signalled by enhanced biogenic production and more open-water diatom taxa. This is consistent with evidence for the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal detected in other records in East Antarctica. Isostatic isolation of the Pup Lagoon basin from the sea between 2200 and 2000 cal. yr BP slightly precedes the emergence of lakes with comparable sill heights from the nearby Vestfold Hills. The colonization of Pup Lagoon after its isolation as a freshwater lake was initiated by a siliceous flora dominated by stomatocysts with microbial mat development being prevented by mechanical or physical stress. A brief period of marine incursion following the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal may be related to local events such as iceberg calving or to minor sea-level change. Weighted averaging regression, used to infer salinity in the lacustrine zone, shows that from 1500 cal. yr BP Pup Lagoon is a freshwater lake, where the flora is dominated by stratified cyanobacterial mats, with green algae and diatoms as co-dominants, comparable to modem Pup Lagoon and other lakes in the Larsemann Hills...|$|R
