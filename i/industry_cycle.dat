40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on firms' {{cyclical}} behavior in the global semiconductor industry. We demonstrate that these cyclical dynamics at the industry level differ from both the business cycles at the macro-economic level and the lengthy industrial technology life cycle. We discuss a range of possible causes of those cyclical industrial dynamics, including the general business cycles as well as industry-specific factors. Our study reports three stylized facts {{in relation to the}} cyclical industrial dynamics in the global semiconductor industry: first, the industry is more concentrated during the <b>industry</b> <b>cycle</b> downturns; second, the capital investment of the industry as a whole follows a ‘pro-cyclical’ pattern; and third, firms that pursued a ‘counter-cyclical’ capital investment strategy during the <b>industry</b> <b>cycle</b> downturn have reaped rewards during the subsequent cycle period.

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to link the {{propensity}} for innovative activity to spatially cluster to the stage of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle.</b> The theory of knowledge spillovers, based on the knowledge production function for innovative activity, suggests that geographic proximity matters the most where tacit knowledge plays an important role in the generation of innovative activity. According to the emerging literature of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle,</b> tacit knowledge plays the most important role during the early stages of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle.</b> Based on a data base that identifies innovative activity for individual states and specific industries for the United States, the empirical evidence suggests that the propensity for innovative activity is shaped by the stage of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle.</b> While the generation of new economic knowledge tends to result in a greater propensity for innovative activity to cluster during the early stages of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle,</b> innovative activity tends to be more highly dispersed during the mature and declining stages of the life cycle, particularly after controlling for the extent to which the location of production is geographically concentrated.

40|$|Abstract: This study tests {{two major}} {{theories}} of insurer underwriting cycles and extends the hypotheses to explain insurers ’ reserving behaviors. By applying a simul-taneous equations model to cross-sectional and time-series firm-level data, this study proposes that insurers ’ net investment income {{can be used}} to explain both hypotheses regarding processes for establishing premiums and reserves. Our results confirm that the <b>industry</b> <b>cycle</b> phenomenon is reflected in individual firm dynamics. We find that net investment income is inversely related to both premiums and loss reserves, as expected, and we identify how the magnitudes of these effects correspond to the phases of the underwriting cycle. The results indicate that the effects are greatest in the hard market of underwriting cycles. Moreover, the yearly differential responses of premi-ums and reserves to net investment income are coincident with the formation of cycles.

40|$|Ever since Schumpeter first {{identified}} industry cycles as {{the characteristic}} form of capitalist development, with upturns creating opportunities for profit and downturns providing scope for restructuring, the topic has attracted occasional interest by business researchers – but never the sustained interest {{that the subject}} warrants.

40|$|Research on <b>industry</b> life <b>cycles</b> {{suggests}} that competitive pressures are more severe during the shakeout stage, {{which could be}} associated with the emergence of a dominant design, than at other stages. Transaction-cost theory, on the other hand, assumes generally competitive markets and does not address the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle.</b> It therefore implies that transaction-cost economizing is a superior firm strategy regardless of the stage of the life cycle. This paper seeks to reconcile these two streams of research by investigating whether aligning transactions with governance modes in accordance with transaction-cost prescriptions has a differential effect on firm survival in preshakeout versus shakeout stages of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle.</b> Analyzing data from the early U. S. auto industry (1917 - 1933), we find that while transaction misalignment did not {{have a significant impact on}} firm survival during the preshakeout stage or during the period as a whole, it did have a significantly larger negative impact on survival during the shakeout stage than during the preshakeout stage. We also find that the negative effects of misalignment on survival were significantly weaker for larger firms during the shakeout stage. This {{suggests that}} applications of transaction-cost theory which assume uniformly severe selection pressures across the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle</b> and uniform effects of misalignment across firms of different sizes could be misleading. It also suggests that theories of the <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle</b> could usefully take transaction costs into account along with production costs in their analyses of competition over the life <b>cycle.</b> <b>industry</b> life <b>cycle,</b> transaction costs, dominant design, manufacturing, strategy...|$|R

This paper describes the major considerations in selecting the target {{return on capital}}. A financial pricing model determines the premium rate such that the insurer achieves a target return on capital. The pricing model may take either of two forms: 9 A net present value model discounts the projected equity flows at the cost of capital. 9 An I RR model compares the internal rate of return implied by the project's equity flows with the cost of capital. The structure of the pricing model and most of the pricing assumptions are based on the characteristics of the insurance environment and of the line of business. In contrast, the cost of capital is not easily quantified. It is often selected by the insurer's management, based on recommendations by the financial, actuarial, and underwriting departments.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{characterize}} the cyclical phases of the manufacturing industry in Spain and detect which industries have more influence on the Spanish business cycle. We assume that economic growth is a priority; we are going to determine which industries have a more/less appropriate cyclical behavior according this priority. We analyze if the industries with better cyclical behavior are the ones that achieve greater co-movement with the business cycle of the Spanish economy, as this means they have a positive influence on economic activity. Design/methodology/approach: We examine the disaggregated quarterly IPI data of 16 manufacturing industries. Our methodology follows three steps. Firstly, we define cycle turning points; we follow the Harding and Pagan (2002) methodology. Secondly, we characterize the cyclical phases of the manufacturing industries in terms of duration, amplitude, deepness and steepness. We also determine the degree of inter-industrial cyclical synchronization and between industries in the cycle of the Spanish economy. This analysis is performed in two ways. On the one hand, we use the concordance index and the correlation coefficient. On the other hand, we work with indicators based on a consistency table. In the Third step, we apply a multi-objective methodology, specifically the compromise programming, to determine which industries have a more/less appropriate cyclical behavior according to the growth priority. Findings and Originality/value: The business cycle of the Spanish economy is positively influenced by high- and medium-tech industries, which have demonstrated their competitive capacity in international markets, and by medium- low-tech industries, with major strengths in R&D, and in survival and consolidation strategies. These results enable manufacturing industries to exert a positive effect on the business cycle that is weakened because many of them show a high correlation between employment and cyclical fluctuations. Originality/value: The study is original and useful on various levels. Firstly, the study of sectoral cycles makes it possible to identify common trends in the growth of business activities and to see the interdependence of fluctuations. Secondly, it will be easy to deduce which sectoral disruptions generate the greatest impact on economic activity. Finally, because the analysis of the manufacturing <b>industry</b> <b>cycle</b> has not yet carried ou...|$|E
