In this study, complex biofilms were developed using river water spiked with L. pneumophila, and the persistence of L. pneumophila in these complex biofilms was evaluated. In order to study the role of iron in the persistence of L. pneumophila, river water was supplied with either <b>iron</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> or iron chelators (deferoxamine mesylate, DFX for ferric iron and dipyridyl, DIP for ferrous iron) to modulate iron availability. The addition of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> and DFX did not markedly affect the persistence of L. pneumophila in the biofilms, whereas that of DIP had a beneficial effect. Since DIP specifically chelates ferrous iron, we hypothesized that DIP may protect L. pneumophila from the deleterious effects of ferrous iron. In conclusion, ferrous iron appears to be important for the persistence of L. pneumophila in complex biofilms. However, further studies are {{needed in order to}} obtain {{a better understanding of the}} role of ferrous iron in the behavior of this bacterium in the environment...|$|E

40|$|Department of Energy Engineering (Battery Science and Technology) Recently, {{sodium-ion}} batteries (SIBs) become promising {{alternatives for}} lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to abundance and cheap cost of sodium resources compared with lithium sources. Like cathode materials for LIBs, various compounds of layered oxides and polyanion materials are synthesized through several methods. However, conventional active materials have difficulties for satisfying both kinetics and safety issues. Here, {{new types of}} polyanion material, sodium metal pyrophosphate, are synthesized having composition of Na 3. 12 M 2. 44 (P 2 O 7) 2 (M = Fe, Fe 0. 5 Mn 0. 5, Mn, Co). Among them, sodium iron pyrophosphates are made into two ways: stoichiometric and off-stoichiometric ratio. This compounds have triclinic structure having three-dimensional tunnels, with sub-micron- or micron-sized particles.

Two types of organic manures; poultry droppings, cow dung and control were used for the experiment. Three levels of organic manures; 5, 10 and 15 tons per hectare (ton ha- 1) and three sampling time (30, 60 and 90 DAS were laid down in a completely randomized (CRD) design replicated three times. Results obtained revealed that rate, type of organic manures and time of submergence significantly (P ≤ 0. 05) changed Fe content in the soil. Mean extractable iron concentrations of 42. 01, 56. 13 and 24. 63 mgkg- 1 were recorded for ammonium oxalate extractable iron, Citrate Bicarbonate Dithionite extractable <b>iron</b> and sodium <b>pyrophosphate</b> extractable <b>iron</b> in the first experiment while 45. 81, 59. 29 and 28. 89 mgkg- 1 were recorded for the second experiment respectively.

In all formulations <b>iron</b> was ferric <b>pyrophosphate,</b> the excipients were different types and fractions of lecithin plus sucrose esters of fatty acids matrix (Sideral® RM; PRT 1; PRT 2) or lecithin without sucrester (SUN). Dissolution kinetics of formulations in SGF was studied by USP method. The ability of the formulations to promote iron intestinal absorption was evaluated by the Caco- 2 cell model, measuring cellular ferritin content, and by the excised rat intestine model, yielding apparent permeability parameters (Papp). All formulations limited iron release in SGF to ≤ 10 %. Sideral® RM {{was by far the}} most absorbed by Caco- 2, as ferritin content was in the order: Sideral® RM ≫ PRT 2 > PRT 1 > SUN > control. The Fe 3 + crossing the intestinal barrier was in part reduced to Fe 2 + by epithelial enzymes, in part it was carried by formulation rearrangement into nano-structures able to protect it from reduction and apt for internalization by epithelium cells. Papp parameters were in the order: Sideral® RM ≫ PRT 1 > PRT 2 > SUN = control. Relevance of transepithelial Fe 2 + carrier, DMT- 1, to Fe 3 + transport was ruled out using a DMT- 1 inhibitor. In conclusion, Sideral® RM retains iron in SGF, and is the most suitable for Fe 3 + internalization by Caco- 2 cells, Fe 3 + protection from enzymatic reduction and promotion of Fe 3 + absorption across intestinal epithelium, non-mediated by DMT- 1...|$|R

For dried and fatty foods, {{direct contact with the}} materials is envisaged whereas other food types will be separated from the active material by a layer that does not contain the active components. All the substances constituting the oxygen absorber system have been evaluated and authorised for use as plastic food contact materials, as food additives or as food supplements.

40|$|The {{cholesterol-lowering}} {{effects of}} oats {{have led to}} an increasing interest in them on the food market. Liquid oats {{has emerged as a}} new way of consuming oats and has become a commercial product. To produce liquid oats, steam-heated dehulled oat groats are subjected to flaking, wet-milling, enzyme hydrolysis, decanting, formulation, and ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treatment, the resulting beverage being aseptically packaged. The overall aim {{of the present study was}} to gain more adequate knowledge of the consequences of processing and storage on the nutritional properties of liquid oats. The retention of vitamins, minerals and phenolic antioxidants (including avenanthramides and hydroxycinnamic acids) was followed in the course of processing. After storage, the fatty acid profile, vitamin retention, dissolved oxygen concentration and sensory attributes of the liquid oats were followed in different prototypes after storage. Its protein quality after processing and storage was investigated in growing rats. The effects of phytase treatment, addition of citric acid and iron fortification either alone or in combination on the non-heme iron absorption from liquid oats in humans were also investigated. A moderate increase on a dry matter basis in the level of native vitamin B 6 was observed after the decanting process, whereas much of native phosphorus, zinc, calcium and iron were separated off together with the insoluble fraction. The supplemented vitamins A, B 1, B 2, niacin, B 6 and folate exhibited marked stability during UHT treatment at 140 ?C (holding times 5 s and 20 s), whereas vitamin D 3 was lost to about the same extent at both durations, B 12 being lost to a moderate extent at the longer duration. The fortified vitamins, except for vitamin A, D 3 and B 12, remained stable during a year of ambient storage. Phenols were lost to a varying extent after enzyme incubation process, the decanting step causing further losses. During storage, a refrigerating temperature favored the stability of the avenanthramides in the iron-lacking liquid oats. The fatty acid profile changed to only a minor extent after ambient storage for a year, also in an iron-fortified prototype. This could be due to the low dissolved oxygen concentration and also to the presence of antioxidants. Enzyme incubation process together with heating and subsequent decanting reduced the protein content of liquid oats, leading to a slight decrease in the biological value of the proteins in rats, whereas neither UHT treatment nor a year of ambient storage changed the protein quality. The true protein digestibility, biological value and net protein utilization of the various processed and stored forms of liquid oats were comparable to those of casein. The phytase treatment of liquid oats reduced the inositol phosphates to undetectable levels, leading to a significantly improved non-heme iron absorption in humans. A combination of phytase treatment, citric acid addition and iron supplementation increased the iron absorption. Fortification of <b>iron</b> as ferric <b>pyrophosphate</b> or ferric ammonium citrate resulted in similar iron absorption rates but addition of the latter may bring about undesirable sensory attributes. Overall the study showed decanting to change the relative proportions of proteins, vitamins, minerals and phenols, and direct UHT treatment to lead to a good retention of proteins and of most of the vitamins. Ambient storage for a year did not affect the protein quality or the fatty acid profile. The results suggest that the nutritional quality of UHT liquid oats can be improved by phytase treatment, better selection of ingredients, and refrigerated storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} acquire iron {{from various sources}} has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} determinant in the pathogenesis of Neisseria meningitidis. Outside the cells, iron is bound to transferrin in serum, or to lactoferrin in mucosal secretions. Meningococci can extract iron from iron-loaded human transferrin by the TbpA/TbpB outer membrane complex. Moreover, N. meningitidis expresses the LbpA/LbpB outer membrane complex, which can extract iron from iron-loaded human lactoferrin. Iron transport through the outer membrane requires energy provided by the ExbB-ExbD-TonB complex. After transportation through the outer membrane, iron is bound by periplasmic protein FbpA and is addressed to the FbpBC inner membrane transporter. Iron-complexing compounds like citrate and pyrophosphate have been shown to support meningococcal growth ex vivo. The use of <b>iron</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> as an iron source by N. meningitidis was previously described, but has not been investigated.

We showed that pyrophosphate was able to sustain N. meningitidis growth when desferal was used as an iron chelator. Addition of a pyrophosphate analogue to bacterial suspension at millimolar concentrations supported N. meningitidis survival in the mouse model.

During the treatment phase, 10 patients received ferric pyrophosphate via hemodialysis as monthly dialysate iron concentrations were progressively increased from 2, 4, 8, to 12 μg/dl and were then sustained for two additional months at 12 μg/dl (dialysate iron group); 11 control patients were continued on i. v. iron dextran (i. v. iron group). ResultsHemoglobin, serum iron parameters, and the erythropoietin dose did not change significantly from month 0 to month 6, both within and between the two groups. The weekly dose of i. v. iron (mean±sd) needed to maintain iron balance during month 6 was 56 ± 37 mg in the i. v. iron group compared with 10 ± 23 mg in the dialysate iron group (P = 0. 001). Intravenous iron was required by all 11 patients in the i. v. iron group compared with only 2 of the 10 patients receiving 12 μg/dl dialysate iron. The incidence of adverse effects was similar in both groups. ConclusionsSlow infusion of soluble <b>iron</b> <b>pyrophosphate</b> by hemodialysis may be a safe and effective alternative to the i. v. administration of colloidal iron dextran in maintenance hemodialysis patients...|$|E
