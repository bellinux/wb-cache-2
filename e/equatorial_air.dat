50|$|The Polar cell, likewise, is {{a simple}} system. Though cool and dry {{relative}} to <b>equatorial</b> <b>air,</b> the air masses at the 60th parallel are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo convection and drive a thermal loop. At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8 km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper level air mass deviates toward the east. When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates toward the west. Again, the deviations of the air masses {{are the result of}} the Coriolis effect. The air flows at the surface are called the polar easterlies.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, George Hadley, an English lawyer and amateur meteorologist, was {{dissatisfied}} with {{the theory that the}} astronomer Edmond Halley had proposed for explaining the trade winds. What was no doubt correct in Halley's theory was that solar heating creates upward motion of <b>equatorial</b> <b>air,</b> and air mass from neighboring latitudes must flow in to replace the risen air mass. But for the westward component of the trade winds Halley had proposed that in moving across the sky the Sun heats the air mass differently {{over the course of the}} day. Hadley was not satisfied with that part of Halley's theory and rightly so. Hadley was the first to recognize that Earth's rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass as it moves relative to the Earth. Hadley's theory, published in 1735, remained unknown, but it was rediscovered independently several times. Among the re-discoverers was John Dalton, who later learned of Hadley's priority. Over time the mechanism proposed by Hadley became accepted, and over time his name was increasingly attached to it. By the end of the 19th century it was shown that Hadley's theory was deficient in several respects. One of the first who accounted for the dynamics correctly was William Ferrel. It took many decades for the correct theory to become accepted, and even today Hadley's theory can still be encountered occasionally, particularly in popular books and websites. Hadley's theory was the generally accepted theory long enough to make his name become universally attached to the circulation pattern in the tropical atmosphere. In 1980 Isaac Held and Arthur Hou developed the Held-Hou Model to describe the Hadley circulation.|$|E
40|$|The {{entire region}} is under {{tropical}} influence with three sub-units.

Here, the Atlantic <b>equatorial</b> <b>air</b> masses from the northeast and southeast (trade winds) dominate. The eastern part, basically following the extent of the Atlantic Forest biome, is typical for the tropical littoral climate of the oriental northeast (2) with one to seven months of dry season. Again, <b>equatorial</b> <b>air</b> masses from the Atlantic Ocean dominate. The central southern part, and the second largest area shows a tropical humid to dry climate (3), also referred to as the tropical climate of Central Brazil. Four to eight months of drought characterize the region, and air masses from the southern Central Atlantic Ocean dominate, coming mainly from south-easterly directions (Nimer 1989; Mendonça & Danni-Oliveira 2007).

40|$|Singular {{spectrum}} analysis (SSA), a linear univariate and {{multivariate time series}} technique, is essentially principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the time series and additional copies of the time series lagged by 1 to K time steps. Neural network theory has meanwhile allowed PCA to be generalized to nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). In this paper, NLPCA is further extended to perform nonlinear SSA (NLSSA) : First, SSA {{is applied to the}} data, then the leading principal components of the SSA are chosen as inputs to an NLPCA network (with a circular node at the bottleneck), which performs the NLSSA by nonlinearly combining all the input SSA modes into a single NLSSA mode. This nonlinear spectral technique allows the detection of highly anharmonic oscillations, as illustrated by a stretched square wave imbedded in white noise, which shows NLSSA to be superior to SSA and classical Fourier spectral analysis. NLSSA is also applied to the Southern Oscillation Index (a monthly time series of the <b>equatorial</b> Pacific <b>air</b> pressure conditions from 1866 to 2000), which reveals a first mode with period of 52 months, and a second mode of 39 months. 2...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the methods}} to monitor the current rainfall, and {{possible}} global climate changes (natural or human induced changes), is through orbital remote sensing techniques. The TRMM satellite - Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission {{is one of these}} new generation sensors, which provides monthly precipitation data of the world. The main objective of this paper was to analyze the rainfall dynamic in Cerrado, a threatened and degraded savanna area in Brazil by the agricultural expansion, through a TRMM time-series in the period from 2000 to 2010. Data analysis were performed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment In general, both in the dry and in the rainy season, there was a predominance of the lower classes of precipitation, consistent with the climatic characteristics of this biome, with restricted areas with a higher volume of rain. The effects of El Niño and La Niña tend to be less pronounced in the Cerrado; nevertheless, these phenomena may be related to prolonged dry seasons observed in this study. In the other hand, the Atlantic Polar Front (APF) may explain the differences in rainfall regimes found in the study area and are expressed in the climatic diversity of the country. Still based on the literature, by observing the precipitation in the Cerrado, the greatest rainfall occurrence is concentrated in the period from November to March, due to increased activity of the <b>Equatorial</b> Continental <b>air</b> mass (MCE), composed of moist air masses with higher temperatures, causing heavy rainfall in the summer.

This paper reports {{on the results of}} the GSFC Monte Carlo simulation for two different, OWL instrument baseline designs. These results indicate that, assuming a continuation of the cosmic ray spectrum (theta approximately E(exp - 2. 75), OWL could have an event rate of 4000 events/year with E {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (exp 20) eV.

40|$|Differences in air {{pressure}} {{are a major}} cause of atmospheric circulation. Because heat excites the movement of atoms, warm temperatures cause, air molecules to expand. Because those molecules now occupy a larger space, the pressure that their weight exerts is decreased. Air from surrounding high-pressure areas is pushed toward the low-pressure areas, creating circulation. This process causes a major pattern of global atmosphere movement known as meridional circulation. In this form of convection, or vertical air movement, heated <b>equatorial</b> <b>air</b> rises and travels through the upper atmosphere toward higher latitudes. Air just above the equator heads toward the North Pole, and air just below the equator moves southward. This air movement fills the gap created where increased {{air pressure}} pushes down cold air. The,cold air moves along the surface back toward the equator, replacing the air masses that rise there. Another influence on atmospheric. circulation is the Coriolis force. Because of the Earth's rotation, large-scale wind currents move in the direction of this axial spin around low-pressure areas. Wind rotates counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. just as the Earth's rotation affects airflow, so too does its surface. In the phenomenon of orographic lifting, elevated topographic features such as mountain ranges lift air as it moves up their surface...|$|E

This paper describes the analysis of data collected in and around a tropical cloud cluster system studied as part of the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX). The data analysis indicates that the cluster originated off the northern coast of Australia along the midlevel monsoon trough and lasted approximately 12 hours. The system moved with a velocity of about 12 m/s toward the northeast and the low-level surface northwesterly flow at the vicinity of the premonsoon trough area seems continuously to feed the EMEX 9 cloud cluster with energetic warm, moist <b>equatorial</b> <b>air.</b> Data obtained from aircraft penetrations show features similar to tropical MCSs reported elsewhere (such as an area of strong to moderate convection surrounded by a broad region of stratiform precipitation, radar echo bright band in the stratiform region, "onion " type sounding behind the convective region). The vertical structures of the EMEX 9 cloud cluster also contain two types of imbedded convection: an upright vertical structure and a pronounced rearward slope (approximately 17 ø), having a vertical extent of 14. 5 km and above and a horizontal scale of about 40 kin.

Os dados foram obtidos pelo Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia, em 264 estações meteorológicas, no período {{de janeiro}} de 1990 a dezembro de 2012. Utilizamos o Detrended Fluctuation Analysis para realizar a estimativa do expoente de Hurst, o Multiscale Sample Entropy para as estimativas da entropia das séries e o Kriging para a interpolação das estimativas realizadas. Observamos que maiores latitudes tendem a atenuar as médias das temperaturas máxima, mínima e média do ar, porém aumentam a variabilidade das mesmas. Esta inversão entre as magnitudes da média e do desvio padrão também é observado na umidade relativa média do ar. As médias dos expoentes de Hurst estimados para todo o Brasil foram 0, 81; 0, 79; 0, 81; 0, 77; 0, 83 e 0, 64; e do Sample Entropy estimado, 1, 39; 1, 78; 1, 46; 1, 41; 1, 56 e 1, 66, respectivamente para séries diárias de temperatura média, máxima e mínima do ar, amplitude térmica do ar, umidade relativa média do ar e velocidade média do vento. Os valores do expoentes de Hurst estimados apresentaram uma correlação positiva com a latitude nas variáveis de temperatura do ar estudadas. Tal correlação não foi observada nas demais variáveis. As regularidades das séries climáticas no Brasil foram medianas. Espacialmente, as maiores alterações nas estimativas das entropias ocorreram na escala 1 para a 2 de, no Multiscale Sample Entropy.

O fator climático da altitude atuou com maior frequência sob os resultados observados, principalmente nas variáveis de temperatura. Em alguns casos, a continentalidade e as massas de ar também foram apontados como fatores importantes na caracterização da distribuição espacial das estimativas realizadas. The {{objective of this}} study was to uncloak the dynamic of climate of Brazil, seeking to measure the regularity and the long range autocorrelation of daily climate series of temperature of air (average, maximum, minimum, and temperature range), relative humidity of air average and wind speed average. The data were obtained by Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INMET), at 264 meteorological stations, in the period from January 1990 to December 2012. We use the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis to realize the estimation of the Hurst exponent, the Multiscale Sample Entropy to estimating the entropy of series and the Kriging to interpolate the estimates made. We observed that higher latitudes tend to attenuate the mean of temperatures of air maximum, minimum and average, but increase the variability of the same. This inversion of the magnitudes of the mean and standard deviation is also observed in the relative humidity of air. The means of the estimated Hurst exponents estimated for Brazil were 0. 81, 0. 79, 0. 81, 0. 77, 0. 83 and 0. 64, and the estimated Sample Entropy, 1. 39, 1. 78, 1. 46, 1. 41, 1. 56 and 1. 66, respectively for average, maximum and minimum temperatures of air, temperature range, relative humidity of air average and wind speed average. The values of the estimated Hurst exponents showed a positive correlation with latitude in the temperature variables studied. Such a correlation was not observed in other variables. This a correlation was not observed in other variables. The regularities of climate series in Brazil were medians.

40|$|Coarse {{particulate}} matter (PM 10) {{has long been}} understood to be hazardous to human health, with mortality rates increasing {{as a result of}} raised ground level concentrations. We explore the influence of synoptic-scale meteorology on daily mean observed PM 10 concentration ([PM 10]) using Rossby wave breaking (RWB). Meteorological reanalysis data for the winter months (DJF) between January 1999 and December 2008 and observed PM 10 data for three urban background UK (Midland) sites were analysed. Three RWB diagnostics were used to identify RWB that had significant influence on UK Midland PM 10. RWB events were classified according to whether the RWB was cyclonic or anticyclonic in its direction of breaking and whether the RWB event was influenced more by poleward or <b>equatorial</b> <b>air</b> masses. We find that there is a strong link between RWB events and UK [PM 10]. Significant increases (p< 0. 01) in UK [PM 10] were seen 1 day following RWB occurring in spatially constrained northeast Atlantic–European regions. Analysis into episodic PM 10 exceedance events shows increased probability of [PM 10] exceedance associated with all RWB subsets. The greatest probability of exceeding the UK [PM 10] threshold was associated with cyclonic RWB preceded by anti-cyclonic RWB forming an omega block synoptic pattern. This mechanism suggests an easterly advection of European PM 10 followed by prolonged stagnant conditions within the UK and led to an almost threefold increase in the probability of the UK Midlands exceeding a hazardous [PM 10] threshold (0. 383), when compared to days where no RWB was detected (0. 129) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{uses the}} GATE (GARP Atlantic Tropical Experiment) upper air {{network in the}} tropics {{combined}} with high resolution SMS- 1 (Synchronous Meteorological Satellite) derived winds at low levels, to identify the time-varying kinematics, and mass flux within the region of an intense cloud cluster on September 5, 1974. Satellite data was stored, displayed, and processed on the _Man-Computer interactive ga ta- Access System (McIDAS). Measurements of cloud area expansion covering 20 h determined the cloud cluster stages. Quantitative measurements of the mass flux and kinematic properties of the cluster are given for the growth, growth-mature, and mature-dissipating stages of the cluster. In the growth phase of the cluster strong convergence exists below 900 mb. Relative winds show that the mass inflow to the cluster comes from the west-southwest below 950 mb within the subcloud layer. During the growth-mature stage deep convective system dominates the cluster. Strong low level convergence decreases as divergence at 250 mb becomes dominant. In the growth stage downward motion exists above 600 mb, which becomes strongly upward as the cluster matures. Maximum vertical motion shifts from 800 to 300 mb in the mature-dissipating stage. A mass budget quantitatively describes the horizontal and vertical mass exchanges {{in and around the}} cluster. In the growth stage subcloud layer air is horizontally transported from distances greater than 300 km from the cluster center, transported upward in the cluster, and exits in the 800 - 600 mb layer. The growth-mature stage, characterized by wide-spread deep convection shows that mass is raised at the 200 - 250 mb layer, where it is transported northward. Most of this mass is supplied by the large scale flow of warm moist air below 950 mb. Relative winds show that deep convection in the cluster is responsible for the upward transport of <b>equatorial</b> <b>air</b> to higher latitudes, supporting the view that cloud clusters {{are an integral part of}} the Hadley circulation cell. 1...|$|E
