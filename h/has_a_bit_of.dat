The copycats are all competing with each other." [...] "...they have very little ads, therefore I guess it’s not going too well for them. The idea only works once and relies on novelty ... any copy-cat sites will only have pure comedy value, whereas mine possibly <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> comedy PLUS some actual pull in advertising dollars ... so I say good luck to the imitators!" ...|$|E

500|$|Hugh Jackman {{was offered}} the chance to {{audition}} for the Phantom, but he faced scheduling conflicts with Van Helsing. [...] "They rang to ask about my availability", Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview, [...] "probably about 20 other actors as well. I wasn't available, unfortunately. So, that was a bummer." [...] "We needed somebody who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> rock and roll sensibility in him", Andrew Lloyd Webber explained. [...] "He's {{got to be a}} bit rough, a bit dangerous; not a conventional singer. Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he's the right side of danger." [...] Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler's performance in Dracula 2000. Prior to his audition, Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing [...] "The Music of the Night" [...] for Lloyd Webber.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Selective Hearing {{was positive}} in his review. They praised {{the production and}} BoA's English pronunciation, stating [...] "The production as a whole <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> en edge to it which is a slight departure from the typical BoA song but it works... Her pronunciation is miles above the English in her older songs. Her vocals are as strong as ever and even when the vocal effects are laid on thick her voice doesn’t get drowned in them. You can still hear her clearly." [...] Overall, the reviewer {{felt it was a}} great debut track for the North American audience. Asian Junkie member Random J reviewed the song on his personal blog site, and his response was mixed. He felt the song was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "bog standard" [...] upon its release. However, he stated, [...] "But in comparison {{to the rest of the}} album, the song is actually rather decent and a highlight. A definite grower." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} {{portrayal}} of Yellowjacket in Ant-Man, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a problem {{when it comes to}} offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: evil. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [...] treated {{in such a way that}} their freak flags are allowed to fly free.|$|E

2500|$|Mayor Ann Popowicz (Debra McGrath)– Mayor of Mercy, she [...] {{supports}} the Muslim community {{in return for}} their votes. She is primarily concerned with maximizing the perks of her office and minimizing the amount of work that she actually has to do. She <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a wild streak, having been known to date members of the Hells Angels and has more skeletons in her closet than the local cemetery.

2500|$|Nancy {{soon after}} becomes pregnant. Nancy begins helping her friend, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) who has escaped from prison. Mitzeee {{was in prison}} for the {{stabbing}} of Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Fox explained that Nancy has [...] "always known her friend was innocent" [...] as she knows that she is not capable of stabbing Mercedes. Nancy knows Mercedes has set Mitzeee up as she has threatened her on a couple of occasions, even saying [...] "something bad might happen to Nancy's baby if she doesn't get her nose out and that's made Nancy more determined". Fox said that Nancy's attitude towards Mitzeee's situation stems from when Becca was wrongly accused, sent to prison and murdered in jail which makes her [...] "really desperate to get this right for Mitzeee - to get her out and take Mercedes down!" [...] Explaining why Nancy and Mitzeee are such good friends, Fox said: [...] "They're such different people on the surface, but deep down Ann Minniver - Mitzeee's alter ego - is very moral, kind and caring and she's a very clever girl. I think those are all things that Nancy responds to and enjoys. Also, I think Mitzeee just makes Nancy laugh. Mitzeee can be a bit silly sometimes, and that makes Nancy smile". During the storyline, Nancy feuds with Mercedes. Fox said that Nancy <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "bad girl" [...] in her which she shows during her confrontations with Mercedes, adding that the character has got [...] "more fire in her belly than maybe we'd realised".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, Geoff Ginsberg of AllMusic wrote: [...] "Whatever Happened to Slade is the band's extremely loud {{reply to the}} news that they were has-beens. Whereas Slade had been a huge influence on Kiss, the favor was now returned, as Whatever <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> the Hotter Than Hell, early-Kiss sound, which the band has acknowledged. It's still pure Slade, though. The songs and playing here are pretty much out of sight, with monster riffs and a different production style. For the Slade fan, {{this is a great}} record, and one you probably never heard. Rectify that." [...] Joe Geesin of Get Ready to Rock! said of the 2007 Salvo remaster: [...] "legendarily titled after a genuine piece of graffiti, the album is a return to the band's skinhead roots. It was also their first album since leaving Polydor. Some rough Slade style rock'n'roll, but gone was the glam (largely) and the kitsch. Still very much Slade, but if you're only familiar with the early 70s hits this is a very different beast. There's some great rough guitar." [...] In 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior: reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "Viewed with hindsight as the band's 'lost' album, Whatever Happened to Slade was buried by punk, yet praised by many punk musicians. But however marginalised, a world-beating band doesn't become shit overnight, and Whatever Happened to Slade tempers their established qualities with righteous indignation." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Returning from their lengthy attempt to crack America, Whatever Happened to Slade showed muscle, but the prime influence was US stadium boogie, paired with Noddy's least charming lyrics." ...|$|E
