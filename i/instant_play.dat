50|$|As an arcade game, TWC offers <b>instant</b> <b>play</b> but lacks {{longevity}} features {{found in}} many later soccer games (particularly those designed for the home market) {{such as the ability}} to influence the careers of individual players, league formats or multi-season planning.

Although in Single-Player mode the strength of the CPU teams increases from round to round, individual player attributes are not supported and so all the players in a given team are identical in behavior and ability. Fouling is not possible in TWC and therefore there are no free kicks, penalty kicks, drop balls, yellow or red cards; all tackles are considered clean (although not all tackles are successful). However, the gameplay does feature goal kicks, corner kicks, throw-ins and goalkeeper kick-outs.|$|E
