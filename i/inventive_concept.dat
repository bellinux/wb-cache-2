He wrote the screenplays {{for most of his}} starring vehicles and directed two of them, L'Enfant du carnaval (Child of the Carnival), released on 29 August 1921 and Le Brasier ardent (The Blazing Inferno), released on 2 November 1923. The leading lady in both films was the then-"Madame Mosjoukine", Nathalie Lissenko. Brasier, in particular, was highly praised for its innovative and <b>inventive</b> <b>concepts,</b> but ultimately proved too surreal and bizarre to become financially successful. Styled like a semi-comic Kafkaesque nightmare, the film has him playing a detective known only as [...] "Z" [...] hired by an older husband to follow his adventurous young wife. However, the plot was only the device which Mosjoukine and his assistant director Alexandre Volkoff used to experiment with the audience's perception of reality. Many of the scenes seem to be taking place on sets that are disconcertingly larger than normal and one particularly striking staging has the husband entering the detective agency to find a synchronized line of men, presumably detectives, all wearing tuxedos and gliding about in formation.

40|$|In {{times of}} climate change and the {{associated}} global warming, measures and concepts to save resources and to decrease emissions are significant factors {{in the effort to}} limit the en-vironmental impact of global technological improvement. With the development of lightweight vehicle concepts, research institutes as well as the automobile industry can contribute an important part to the future manufacture of ecological and technologically advanced cars. At the Institute of Vehicle Concepts, German Aerospace Center (DLR) a car body structure in sandwich architecture is developed. This structural concept is a consequent implementation of hybrid materials resulting in a lightweight structure made of few parts with relatively simple shape. The packaging and the weight distribution of this newly vehicle architecture has been estab-lished in close collaboration between the department of Lightweight and Hybrid Design Methods and some experts from the department of Alternative Powertrains of the Institute of Vehicle Concepts. A hybrid battery fuel cell powertrain added to the car body concept ena-bles developing a novel compact vehicle. Multifunctional structures are playing {{a major role in the}} implementation of this powertrain concept. A very light body in white structure (≈ 80 kg) with a high level of damage tolerance in case of accidents has been developed. This is achieved by adapting materials and using architecture of high damage tolerance for structural components. Especially structural foams and honey comb for cores in combination with metallic sheets are qualified. Hereby a high lightweight design potential is achieved. The basic scientific approaches like the novel hybrid material structure architecture, <b>inventive</b> <b>concepts</b> for passenger compartment, innovative frontends or the special crosswise seat beam construction complete the car body structure. In combi-nation with unconventional shape architecture an overall concept of a weight optimized, mul-tifunctional and highly integrated body in white structure is generated.

40|$|AbstractIn general, {{the result}} from {{conceptual}} design phase {{is described by}} text annotation and hand sketch. This information is not of a nature to provoke positive decisions for investment. Especially, in inventive design if decision maker (experts) have no time or little time, the result is often {{a good reason for}} projects to be abandoned (or placed on a shelve). Such situation is often due to their abstract description of a solution concept: often a rough graphical sketch and several sentences as written annotations. In parallel, computer support to conceptual design phase is not overwhelmed with many tools, they offer a useful tool for the concept generation but still poorly support investigating possible solutions, lacking of tools to size the geometry of the concepts and analyze their (physical) behavior. In order to give more chance for the solution concept to be selected and further developed in the next design phase. This paper will presents an approach and the software framework (RSC-Modeler) to support the need of tools for a type of conceptual design result: an <b>inventive</b> solution <b>concept</b> obtained from IDM-TRIZ (inventive design method based on TRIZ), by applied engineering analysis task and optimization techniques.

The main objective {{of this study was}} the design of a timber trailer capable of manual loading operations and suitable for rough terrain conditions to be used in combination with a farm tractor in the western Black Sea region of Turkey. In the proposed methodology, a House of Quality diagram was used to transfer customer requirements into quality characteristics, and focus the development of the product toward customer satisfaction. Negative correlations between quality characteristics were solved using the TRIZ contradiction toolkit and generating different <b>concepts.</b> <b>Inventive</b> solutions provided by TRIZ were designed with parametric CAD software. Several concepts were compared in a participative design review session in an immersive virtual reality environment. To choose an optimal concept, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used. The final concept has a total length of 3. 35 m, width of 1. 34 m, and height of 1. 8 m. The mass is 2700 kg, the payload capacity is about 2. 33 m 3, and the total volume of the chassis is 2. 68 m 3 The angle of rollover is 26. 9 °, the door is reachable by 90 % of the population, and the lower back analysis performed for the loading operation showed a maximum value of 2597 N. The final concept is capable of movement in steep terrain and with the presence of obstacles, carrying logs up to 3 -m long. It is more productive among high-density stand trees, allows for ergonomic loading operations, and reduces environmental damage to soil and vegetation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{competition in}} the automobile industry leads to intensified development activities regarding the next innovations of hybrid and electric vehicle technologies with acceptable costs, reduced weight and commonality. A survey {{carried out in the}} field of the automobile industry working on the electrification of drive trains analyzed the specific use of design methods. The industry survey revealed shortcomings in the industrial utilization of design methods which hinder their application and understanding. Besides the need for improved comprehension and a better balance between preparation and output, a lack of direct reference to the technical design task was observed. A development project in a product generation development was accompanied with creativity workshops to specify the designers’ needs. Therefore parts of the TRIZ (theory of <b>inventive</b> problem solving) <b>concepts</b> were chosen to stimulate new solutions. The goal of the presented approach was to facilitate the application of the inventive principles in this product generation development by customizing to the technological circumstances of electric energy storage systems (EESS). The basis of the used approach was a patent search involving 150 patents (and patent applications) in the EESS field. These patents were selected by relevance for e. g. design of the battery's mechanical structure, cooling, electric contacting or assembly. Each of these patents was analyzed in detail regarding the used inventive principles and the technical contradictions solved thereby. After aggregating all identified combinations into an EESS specific contradiction matrix, this matrix was compared to Altshuller's matrix to evaluate the success rate of the given principles in these matrices for solving high voltage battery specific problems. The main result is a ranking of the most used inventive principles in this field. The benefits of the patents were moreover evaluated considering costs, lightweight and production. Hence, it was possible to create particular matrices and rankings for design tasks in these contexts. A first testing of these outcomes showed positive effects on the generated ideas and on the designers’ comprehension. This design practice is focusing on the EESS and needs to be conducted and validated for further applications...|$|R

50|$|In my view, Mayo did {{not fully}} {{take into account the}} fact that an <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> can come not just from creative, {{unconventional}} application of a natural law, but also from the creativity and novelty of the discovery of the law itself.

5000|$|In its {{decision}} in Quanta Computer, Inc. v.

In Quanta, the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to [...] "exhaust" [...] not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.|$|E

5000|$|Reyna {{similarly}} {{analyzed the}} other patents. He found some claims patent ineligible because they merely claimed results or functions without describing how to accomplish them {{by using an}} <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> Other claims, however, he found patent eligible because they not only described functions or goals, but they also recited specific steps or machinery to accomplish them. In this connection, he argued that [...] "software structure and process can confer eligibility," [...] so that [...] "the district court erred by dismissing the recited components on the sole basis that they are software without considering whether these architectural aspects are inventive structure or process." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{court said}} that it {{rejected}} Sequenom's argument that “implies that the <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> lies in the discovery of cffDNA in plasma or serum.” That discovery is {{the discovery of a}} natural phenomenon. The court also rejected the argument that the patent did not preempt the entire use of cffDNA and that some uses were unpreempted. While total preemption “may signal patent ineligible subject matter,” under Parker v. Flook and other cases “the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate patent eligibility.” The fact that once a court concludes that the claims involve only natural phenomena and “conventional” techniques, “preemption concerns are fully addressed and made moot.” ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{the breadth}} of the claim is {{sufficiently}} limited to a specific application of the new law of nature discovered by the patent applicant and actually reduced to practice, I think that the novelty of the discovery should be enough to supply the necessary <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> My proposed approach would require that the claimed application be both narrow in scope and actually reduced to practice, not merely “constructively” reduced to practice by filing of a patent application replete with prophetic examples [...] [...] [...] So long as a claim is narrowly tailored to what the patent applicant has actually invented and reduced to practice, there is limited risk of undue preemption of the underlying idea.|$|E
5000|$|The {{application}} should {{relate to}} one invention only {{or where they}} are a group of inventions, they must be linked so as to form a single <b>inventive</b> <b>concept.</b> [...] The applicant may opt to amend the application prior to the grant of the right, however, such amendment must not affect {{the core of the}} initial disclosure made. [...] The applicant may,divide the application into divisional applications but each divisional application is only limited to that before the initial disclosure. [...] Each divisional application shall have a filing date and, where applicable, a priority date. It is noteworthy however, that a patent would not be invalidated because it does not comply with the requirement of unity as in subsection (1) of section 6.|$|E
5000|$|John Eyles, in a 4.5-starred {{review for}} All About Jazz, praised its [...] "consistency and unity {{of sound and}} tone" [...] {{and the fact that}} several of the songs [...] "could be taken for {{traditional}} folk songs rather than new compositions". Piers Ford, writing in The Art of the Torch Singer, described the album as [...] "Haunted and haunting. Poignant and achingly beautiful. Ribald and raunchy. Evocative and nostalgic...

5000|$|The {{preceding}} analysis {{may have}} been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in Alice v. CLS Bank. In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in Parker v. Flook and Mayo v. Prometheus to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is {{that the presence of}} a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an [...] "inventive concept." [...] The <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> must provide [...] "something extra" [...] that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} an {{invention}} is patentable or even patented {{does not necessarily mean}} that use of the invention would not also infringe another patent. The first patent in a given area might include a broad claim covering a general <b>inventive</b> <b>concept</b> if there is at that point no relevant prior art. Later, a specific implementation of that concept might be patentable if it is not disclosed in the earlier patent (or any intervening prior art), but nevertheless still falls within the scope of the earlier claim (covering the general concept). The later inventor must, therefore, obtain a license from the earlier inventor to be able to exploit their invention. At the same time, the earlier inventor might want to obtain a license from the later inventor, particularly if the later invention represents a significant improvement in the implementation of the original broad concept. In this case, the two enter into a cross license.|$|E
