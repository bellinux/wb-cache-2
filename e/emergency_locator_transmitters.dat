5000|$|On 26 May, it was {{reported}} that signals from the aircraft's <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> had been detected by satellite, which narrowed the area where the main wreckage was likely to be located on the seabed to within a radius of 5 km. An <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> usually activates at impact to send a radio distress signal; this is not the signal from an underwater locator beacon (ULB) attached to a flight recorder, which is an ultrasonic pulse. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> signal was received by satellites minutes after the airliner disappeared from radar. A [...] "distress signal" [...] received two hours after the disappearance of the aircraft, possibly originating from the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter,</b> had been reported already on 19 May; this report was denied by EgyptAir.|$|R

50|$|The basic {{operating}} principle of Transit {{is similar to}} the system used by <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitters,</b> except that in the latter case the transmitter is on the ground and the receiver is in orbit.|$|E
50|$|The oldest, {{cheapest}} (US$139) beacons are aircraft <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitters</b> (ELTs) {{that send}} an anonymous warble on the aviation band distress frequency at 121.5 MHz. The frequency is often routinely monitored by commercial aircraft, {{but has not}} been monitored by satellite since Feb. 1, 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{impetus for}} the program in the U.S. was the loss of Congressmen Hale Boggs (D-LA) and Nick Begich (D-AK) in the Alaskan wilderness on October 16, 1972. A massive search effort failed to locate them. The result was a U.S. law mandating that all aircraft carry an <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Technical and organizational improvements followed.|$|R
50|$|In his glider, he {{installed}} an <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (ELT), {{although it}} was not required. The wreckage was found in less than 24 hours, even though it was in steep terrain in a remote forested water-shed area, not visible from the air. As a result of this accident, and the subsequent search and rescue, ELT's are now required in many gliding competitions.|$|R
5000|$|CPI's {{became a}} {{requirement}} on some military aircraft and were often combined with flight data recorders. Today the beacon functions are normally fulfilled by the <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> system.

50|$|On {{the third}} day after the disappearance, sixteen ships, a {{submarine}} and six aircraft were deployed {{to search for the}} missing An-32 in the Bay of Bengal, about 150 nautical miles east of Chennai. On 1 August, it was confirmed that the aircraft had no underwater locator beacon (ULB). It did have two <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitters</b> (ELTs).|$|E

Media attention eventually resulted in Congressional legislation mandating improved <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitters</b> (ELTs) {{be installed in}} U.S.-registered business jets.|$|E
5000|$|L-Tronics is {{a company}} based in Santa Barbara, California that specializes {{in the design and}} {{manufacture}} of direction finding (DF) equipment for search and rescue applications, used to locate signals originating from distress radiobeacons. These include <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitters</b> (ELTs) used by aircraft, Emergency Position Indicator Radio Beacons (EPIRBs) used by marine vehicles, and Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs). One major operator of L-Tronics devices is the Civil Air Patrol.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{emergency frequency}} (also known as GUARD) is a frequency {{used on the}} aircraft band reserved for emergency communications for aircraft in distress. The frequencies are 121.5 MHz for civilian, also known as International Air Distress (IAD) or VHF Guard, and 243.0 MHz for military use, also known as Military Air Distress (MAD) or UHF Guard. Earlier <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitters</b> used the guard frequencies to transmit, but an additional frequency of 406 MHz is used by more modern ELTs.|$|E

40|$|The NASA <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitter</b> Survivability and Reliability (ELT-SAR) {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 2013 {{to assess the}} crash performance standards {{for the next generation}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> (ELT) systems. Three Cessna 172 aircraft were acquired to perform crash testing at NASA Langley Research Center's Landing and Impact Research Facility. Full-scale crash tests were conducted in the summer of 2015 and each test article was subjected to severe, but survivable, impact conditions including a flare-to-stall during emergency landing, and two controlled-flight-into-terrain scenarios. Full-scale finite element analyses were performed using a commercial explicit solver, ABAQUS. The first test simulated impacting a concrete surface represented analytically by a rigid plane. Tests 2 and 3 simulated impacting a dirt surface represented analytically by an Eulerian grid of brick elements using a Mohr-Coulomb material model. The objective of this paper is to summarize the test and analysis results for the three full-scale crash tests. Simulation models of the airframe which correlate well with the tests are needed for future studies of alternate ELT mounting configurations...|$|R
50|$|No mayday {{call was}} {{received}} by air traffic control, although signals that smoke had been detected {{in one of}} the aircraft's lavatories and in the avionics bay were automatically transmitted via ACARS shortly before the aircraft disappeared from radar. The last communications from the aircraft prior to its submersion were two transmissions from its <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> that were received by the International Cospas-Sarsat Programme. The cause of the disaster is under investigation.|$|R
50|$|In an {{enormous}} search effort, {{search and rescue}} aircraft of the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, and United States Air Force were deployed {{to look for the}} four men and the missing Cessna 310. On November 24, 1972, after proceeding for 39 days, the air search was called off. Neither the airplane nor any of its four occupants were ever found. All were declared dead on December 29, 1972. The accident prompted Congress to pass a law mandating <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitters</b> (ELTs) in all United States civil aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Older <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>{{transmit}}ters</b> transmit on 121.5 MHz {{in case of}} impact. Newer ELTs transmit on 406 MHz, with a {{low power}} beacon on 121.5 MHz for local homing. Satellites listen for the signals and alert local personnel to the emergency, and the beacon allows search and rescue to find {{the scene of the}} accident faster. Beacons operating at 406 MHz are encoded, allowing the vessel of origin to be determined and false alarms to be quickly verified. Satellite support for the 121.5 MHz-only versions was discontinued in early 2009.|$|E
50|$|The third {{mission of}} the program is {{emergency}} services, which entails locating and silencing any <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitters</b> (ELTs) that are transmitting at any point during the event. Senior members handle the logistical and administrative components of emergency services at the air show. During operational hours, they staff the communication post and have several vehicles at their disposal for use in tracking down the ELTs. Cadets aid the senior members by taking control of the radio shack during their shifts and handling signalling hardware with the vehicles. Cadets also staff two stations to observe aircraft landing on each runway, in order to keep track of which aircraft are on the ground.|$|E

40|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> (ELT) {{activation}} {{problems were}} investigated by testing {{a sampling of}} ELT units in actual airplane crashes and in a special test apparatus which simulated longitudinal crash pulses with superimposed local structural resonances. Probable causes of excessive false alarms and nonactivations of ELT's during crash situations were determined and solutions to the current operational and technical problems were obtained. The results, which considered placement, mounting, and activation of ELT's under simulated crash impacts, and {{an evaluation of the}} sensitivity of ELT impact switches to orientation and to local structural vibrations are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The CRJ (CL-65) {{aircraft}} was not {{equipped with an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter,</b> nor was one required. This, combined with the snow, fog, and darkness, hampered rescue efforts as the first responders did not arrive until 20 minutes after the incident. Passengers and crew also had no means of signalling rescuers to reveal their location. As well, the flight crew was unaware that pry-bars {{were part of the}} standard rescue gear aboard the aircraft. Thus they were unable to assist at least six individuals trapped inside the aircraft by the crash, until rescuers arrived.|$|R
