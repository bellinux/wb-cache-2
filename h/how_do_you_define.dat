The issue of {{definitions and standards}} in {{coaching and}} mentoring circles {{is the subject of}} much debate. A competence-based approach is appealing; clarity in the coaching process would be helpful. But is it really a practicable proposition? This paper explores the difficulties inherent in a competence-based approach, and in attempting to define a process and standards (beyond a code of ethics) for executive coaching and mentoring. It concludes that attempting to ‘map ’ this highly complex area using conventional competence-based methods is impractical.
