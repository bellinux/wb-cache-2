40|$|AbstractThe {{reduction}} of economic disparities {{represents one of}} the priorities of the European Union. This is the reason why we aim to study the evolution of disparities both at national level among the economic development regions of Romania and {{at the level of the}} European Union, by taking into consideration all the member countries. In order to study the disparities among the economic development regions of Romania, we took into account the following variables: the available income of private households, the rate <b>of</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>population,</b> the human resources in sciences and technology (as a percentage <b>of</b> the <b>occupied</b> <b>population),</b> the life expectancy at birth, the gross domestic product and the unemployment rate. For the study we used the method of multivariate data analysis, the analysis of main components by taking into consideration the variables used and recorded at the end of the year 2006, in the moment of Romania's adherence to the European Union and at the end of the year 2009...|$|R
40|$|Abstract For {{a proper}} {{understanding}} of the present evolution of the commerce with services {{we have to start}} from the Romanian tertiary sector analysis for the period 1990 – present time. The study analyses the evolution of the three sectors, mainly the tertiary sector considering some indicators and the dynamics of the Romanian services importation and exportation during 2003 – 2006. Till 1898 the increase of the percentage <b>of</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> with services (from 14, 4 % to 27 %) was slower than in industry (from 15, 1 % to 38, 1 %) and the contribution of the services to the Gross National product increased in the same period from 13, 4 % to 26, 1 %. In this period the most important services were those for the population (natural persons) not for enterprises (legal persons), so that some support services for the modern society remained behind (telecommunications, transportation, bank services and insurances, etc.). After 1990 the situation became, as we can observe in table 1, more favorable for the tertiary sector (the services), the <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> in this sector reaching 37, 5 % in 2005.

50|$|By this time, the war {{was looking}} ever darker for Germany. On July 20, 1944, a group of conspiring German {{officers}} attempted to assassinate Hitler. The bomb they used did injure him, but the second was not used, and a table shielded Hitler in a stroke of luck. The plotters still could have launched a coup, but only the <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupied</b> Paris acted, arresting SS and Gestapo forces in the city. The German propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, rallied the Nazis, and saved the day for Hitler.|$|R
50|$|The other {{financial}} <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>occupied</b> territories {{were not as}} eager as Rost van Tonningen to remove the barriers and the Netherlands could not spend the Reichsmarks obtained in this way to pay these other countries. The other territories brought their Reichsmarks to the Netherlands to pay their foreign debt; Germany, Denmark, Hungary and Occupied France all paid their debts in this way. This and the purchase of Dutch goods for Reichsmarks by the Germans made the Dutch balance of Reichsmarks grow from 83,000,000 (March 1941) to 3,646,000,000 (September 1941). Rost van Tonningen in the meantime kept printing large amounts of Dutch money. This led to large inflation figures.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe middle class, as its {{denomination}} suggests, {{is placed}} between the basis {{and the top}} of the social hierarchy, being the most active component of the present society (Larionescu, Mărginean, Neagu, 2006; Mărginean, 2011). The purpose of our approach is to estimate the size of the middle class from Romania and to determine the possible changes on it by the recent economic and financial crisis upon it. Actually, we have an approach of which shows the probable affiliation to the middle class starting from the position {{of the people on the}} labour market. We used two reference indicators, school training and the nature of the occupation – at least high school training and the non-manual occupations, both management and executive positions. The results obtained (AMIGO, INS data) show a substantial increase of the number of people with high school and university training during the recent years, as well as of the some occupations specific to non-manual activities, such as specialists. If we are taken into consideration the full achievement of those two requirements of the definition mentioned above, only one forth <b>of</b> <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> belongs to the middle class. In the expanded variant of estimation (at least high school education for all <b>occupied</b> <b>population)</b> that value reaches to 50 %...|$|R

50|$|When {{we look at}} the {{occupational}} structure we find that there was a very high percentage of dependents, i.e. women and children. But leaving aside dependents, domestic service was the largest occupational group. In both 1901 and 1911 it accounted for over 40% <b>of</b> the <b>occupied</b> <b>population.</b> This explains the large number of single people, as was seen earlier, and also the class structure. The domestic servants were usually employed by those in the next largest sector- the public and professional service. These were mainly army personnel living outside the barracks. This reflects the importance of the military to Ballincollig in those years.|$|R

50|$|Toffler {{proposed}} one {{criterion for}} distinguishing between industrial society and post-industrial society: the share <b>of</b> the <b>population</b> <b>occupied</b> in agriculture versus the share <b>of</b> city labor <b>occupied</b> {{in the services}} sector. In a post-industrial society, the share <b>of</b> the people <b>occupied</b> in agriculture does not exceed 15%, and the share <b>of</b> city laborers <b>occupied</b> in the services sector exceeds 50%. Thus, the share <b>of</b> the people <b>occupied</b> with brainwork greatly exceeds the share <b>of</b> the people <b>occupied</b> with physical work in post-industrial society.|$|R

A far-reaching effect was the emergence of widespread, ferocious partisan warfare, the legacy of which still resonates in the countries affected. This book assembles cutting-edge case studies by established and emerging academics to examine both partisan and anti-partisan warfare in different regions and localities of German-occupied eastern Europe. It shows how such warfare was shaped by an array of factors including fighting power, political and economic structures, the ideological and psychological attitudes of the combatants, the stance <b>of</b> the <b>occupied</b> <b>population</b> towards occupier and partisans, varied and often extreme environmental conditions, and the hostile, often bloody relations between the different ethnic groups under occupation. The result is a new degree of illumination of the realities of partisan and anti-partisan warfare on the ground during this dark chapter in European history...|$|R

50|$|Essentially, then, {{only one}} viable option remains.
