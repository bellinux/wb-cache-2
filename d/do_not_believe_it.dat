Prosecutors traditionally refrain from commenting outside of the judicial process on the actions of persons not charged with criminal offenses. Such individuals have significant privacy and due process interests that deserve protection as do the intemal deliberations of prosecutors relating to their conduct.|$|E

Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know.

Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm {{description}} of Barbara's portrait—"the mother of Albrecht Dürer in oil colors on wood, [...] {{there are many who}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> to be a work of Dürer"—led Brand Philip to conclude that Albrecht's panel was likely sold individually as the more accomplished and marketable of the two. The attribution is widely accepted today. In 2013 Stephan Kemperdick noted the sophistication of the Nuremberg portrait and that its three-dimensional modeling of the head displays a level of skill beyond Wolgemut and his circle.|$|E

Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, I do not want to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Congress, Gore was {{considered}} a [...] "moderate" [...] (he once referred to himself as a [...] "raging moderate") opposing federal funding of abortion, voting {{in favor of a}} bill which supported a moment in silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, [...] "I think it is wrong", and [...] "I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another normal optional life style." [...] In his 1984 Senate race, Gore said when discussing homosexuality, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm." [...] He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups. Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, Gore said in 2008 that he thinks [...] "gay men and women ought to have the same rights as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage." [...] His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000.|$|E

What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom".

500|$|At the time, {{the use of}} such robust {{force against}} Katanga, {{including}} aircraft, artillery, and armoured vehicles, aroused much controversy. Though personally dismayed by the violence as a Bhuddist, Thant thought the operation was justified. His reasoning for such strong action fell in line with just war theory. Proponents of Katanga argued that the secessionist movement was a legitimate exercise of self-determination. Thant refuted the idea in his memoirs, listing three primary objections: first, the Congo had been admitted into the UN in 1960 as a [...] "unified state" [...] with the written agreement of Tshombe. Second, [...] "no sovereign state in the world ever recognized the independence of Katanga". Third, Tshombe's government was [...] "never able to exercise effective control" [...] over the entirety of the province. Military researcher Walter Dorn speculates that Thant may have been personally sensitive to the issue of secession, having suffered from the bloody Karen conflict in his native Burma and witnessed the consequences of the Partition of India. Holding office during a time of widespread decolonization in Africa and Asia, Thant was mindful of the precedent he was setting; recognizing or encouraging secession in one country could allow it to spread to others with fractious consequences. As late as February 1970, he denounced secession, declaring that the UN [...] "has never accepted and does not accept, and I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> will ever accept, the principle of secession of a part of its Member State." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parents {{with the}} {{perspective}} of autism as a disorder (which is called the [...] "pro-cure perspective" [...] in the autism rights movement) believe that therapy {{with the intent of}} extinguishing stereotypically autistic behavior is in their children's best interests; they see this as a treatment that will reduce their children's suffering. These critics say ABA gives autistic children the best chance of success in adulthood, as they either <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is possible that adult society could accommodate autistic people (who have not been trained by ABA to exhibit neurotypical behavior at all times) or they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> is desirable to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Marquis's {{argument}} has prompted several objections.

[...] According to the poll, even if Congress were to authorize military action, 55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes. [...] When asked about a plan that limited military action to 90 days and prohibited the use of ground troops, like S.J.Res 21 would authorize, 59% still opposed it. [...] The poll also indicated that President Obama's approval rating on foreign policy was at its lowest point ever and that only 3 in 10 approved of how he is handling Syria.|$|E
