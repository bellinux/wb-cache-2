Gillian Anderson was {{very pleased with the}} scene. She later noted that [...] "I happened to be in good shape at the time and was just raring to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and be taking those half-naked nurses out with some karate chops." [...] David Duchovny was not as exuberant; when showed the script and directed to [...] "be impressed with [...] karate skills", he responded that [...] "But I have no arms. I've lost my arms. Why would I care about Scully's karate?" [...] Dean Haglund later called the sequence [...] "one of the great fight scenes, ever".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole. It was recorded and produced by John Alagía at his home studio in Easton, Maryland. In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When we walked into John's house, we didn't know what to expect, and we <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is {{in the kitchen and}} the piano is over there. And he's so nonchalant about all his stuff — there'd be a triple-platinum Dave Matthews Band plaque sticking out from under the bed." [...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We {{like being in the}} studio and when we <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, it was {{announced}} that Engen was leaving the program and that Muhney had immediately been recast in the role. Muhney made his first appearance as Adam on June 25, 2009. In 2011, Muhney signed a contract that would keep him in the role for an unspecified period. In April 2013, Muhney announced that he had signed a new contract that would expire in June 2015. In December, however, Muhney announced that he had been abruptly let go from the soap opera, with his last airdate on January 30, 2014. In August, it {{was announced}} that Hartley had been cast as Adam, due to begin taping in September; he first aired on November 5, 2014. Upon the news of his casting, the actor told TV Guide: [...] "I'm so pumped about joining Y — I watch it all the time and can't wait to <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and get my hands dirty!" [...] In 2016, {{it was announced}} that Hartley had been cast in a regular role on the NBC drama series This Is Us, which was picked up by the network, placing his future with The Young and the Restless into question.

500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. I held my breath all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E

His next fight (on November 1 {{of the same}} year) was {{in his hometown of}} Grand Rapids against WBC #1-ranked contender Phillip N'dou, whose record was 31–1 with 30 KOs. During the run-up to the fight Nelson Mandela invited N'dou to his office for a pep talk before his departure for the U.S., advising him to [...] "keep Mayweather on the outside with the jab, work the body and the head will become available".

[...] He also stated: [...] "They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for." [...] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had [...] "needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" [...] and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.|$|E
