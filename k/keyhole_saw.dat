60|$|Much elated, Billy {{left the}} saloon and {{walked along the}} street until {{he came to the}} one general store of the town. After another heart rending {{scrimmage}} with the language of Ferdinand and Isabella he succeeded in making several purchases--two heavy sacks, a brace, two bits, and a <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw.</b> Placing the tools in one of the sacks he wrapped the whole in the second sack and made {{his way back to the}} bank building.|$|E
60|$|Going {{at once to}} {{his room}} Billy withdrew his tools from their hiding place beneath the mattress, {{and a moment later}} was busily engaged in boring holes through the floor at the foot of his bed. For an hour he worked, {{cautiously}} and quietly, until he had a rough circle of holes enclosing a space about two feet in diameter. Then he laid aside the brace and bit, and took the <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw,</b> with which he patiently sawed through the wood between contiguous holes, until, the circle completed, he lifted out a section of the floor leaving an aperture large enough to permit him to squeeze his body through when the time arrived for him to pass into the bank beneath.|$|E
5000|$|A thin saw {{used for}} cutting curves, the Japanese {{version of a}} <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw.</b> The name means [...] "turning cut".|$|E
50|$|<b>Keyhole</b> <b>saws,</b> {{also called}} padsaws or jab saws, feature shorter, finer blades and (often) {{straight}} handles, and {{are suitable for}} cutting extremely tight curves.|$|R
50|$|Maintenance of the {{saw blade}} {{will depend on}} the type and or age of the tool. Older <b>keyhole</b> <b>saws</b> with filed {{crosscut}} teeth will require the craftsman to manually set and sharpen the teeth by hand. For contemporary versions of the retractable-blade variety replacement blades are readily available thus removing the skills, tools and time that would otherwise be required to manually sharpen the blade. Mass production of cheap, throwaway versions of the fixed-blade type make it cost effective for exactly that and purchase a new replacement when the teeth become blunt.|$|R
60|$|That evening, as {{luck would}} have it, Josiah Crabtree retired early. As was his custom, he placed his false teeth in a glass of water on a stand in his room. Watching through a <b>keyhole,</b> Pepper <b>saw</b> him do this, and then calmly waited for the teacher to go bed and fall asleep.|$|R
50|$|A <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw</b> (also {{called a}} pad saw, {{alligator}} saw, jab saw or drywall saw) is a long, narrow saw used for cutting small, often awkward features in various building materials. There are typically two varieties of keyhole saw: the fixed blade type and retractable blade type.|$|E
5000|$|Police {{said that}} the bodies of Fred and Edwina Rogers were dismembered in the upstairs {{bathroom}} by a person [...] "with some knowledge of anatomy". There was little blood {{in the house and}} it appeared it had been thoroughly cleaned after the murders. What little blood was found led to Charles Rogers' bedroom. There, police found a blood stained <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw</b> but no trace of Rogers. A search for Rogers was launched and a warrant was issued for him as a material witness to the crime but Rogers was never found.|$|E
50|$|Drywall is cut to size, using a large T-square, {{by scoring}} {{the paper on}} the {{finished}} side (usually white) with a utility knife, breaking the sheet along the cut, and cutting the paper backing. Small features such as holes for outlets and light switches are usually cut using a <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw</b> or a small high-speed bit in a rotary tool. Drywall is then fixed to the wall structure with nails or drywall screws and often glue. Drywall fasteners, {{also referred to as}} drywall clips or stops, are gaining popularity in both residential and commercial construction. Drywall fasteners are used for supporting interior drywall corners and replacing the non-structural wood or metal blocking that traditionally was used to install drywall. Their function serves to save on material and labour expenses, to minimize call-backs due to truss uplift, to increase energy efficiency, and to make plumbing and electrical installation simpler.|$|E
500|$|After {{a day or}} so, Adams' family {{began searching}} the city for him, placing notices in several {{newspapers}} such as the New York Courier and Enquirer and the New York Weekly Tribune notifying people he was missing. A neighbor of Colt's, Asa H. Wheeler, told Adams' father-in-law, Joseph Lane, {{that he had heard}} noises in Colt's office that sounded like a fight followed by a crash to the floor. Peering in the <b>keyhole,</b> he <b>saw</b> someone [...] "bending over something on the floor". [...] Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams. Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself. Colt made no reply to the implied allegation, and excused himself.|$|R
50|$|William Bonill, aged 68, {{had lived}} for 13 months in a rented room at a house near the Blackfriars Road, Southwark, London. His {{landlord}} later stated that Bonill had frequent male visitors, who generally came in pairs, and that his suspicions became aroused {{on the afternoon of}} 29 August 1835, when Pratt and Smith came to visit Bonill. The landlord climbed to an outside vantage point in the loft of a nearby stable building, where he could see through the window of Bonill's room, before coming down to look into the room through the keyhole. Both the landlord and his wife later claimed they both looked through the <b>keyhole</b> and <b>saw</b> sexual intimacy between Pratt and Smith, so the landlord broke open the door to confront them. Bonill was absent, but returned a few minutes later with a jug of ale. The landlord went to fetch a policeman and all three men were arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "George {{closed the}} door and went back to his seat. But his curiosity was not satisfied. Indeed, this partial {{satisfaction}} had but whetted its appetite. Where did the staircase lead? What was the errand of the little maid? It was no business of his, he kept repeating--no business of his. He tried to read, but his attention wandered. A quarter-past twelve sounded on the harmonious clock. Suddenly determined, George rose, crossed the room, opened the hidden door, and began to ascend the stairs. He passed the first window, corkscrewed round, and came to another. He paused for a moment to look out; his heart beat uncomfortably, as though he were affronting some unknown danger. What he was doing, he told himself, was extremely ungentlemanly, horribly underbred. He tiptoed onward and upward. One turn more, then half a turn, and a door confronted him. He halted before it, listened; he could hear no sound. Putting his eye to the <b>keyhole,</b> he <b>saw</b> nothing but a stretch of white sunlit wall. Emboldened, he turned the handle and stepped across the threshold. There he halted, petrified by what he saw, mutely gaping.|$|R
50|$|A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, {{originally}} and principally {{made for}} cutting metal. They can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them. There are hand saw versions and powered versions (power hacksaws). Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped frame that holds a blade under tension. Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames {{may also be}} adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin blade under tension. Panel hacksaws forgo the frame and instead have a sheet metal body; they can cut into a sheet metal panel further than a frame would allow. These saws are no longer commonly available, but hacksaw blade holders enable standard hacksaw blades to be used similarly to a <b>keyhole</b> <b>saw</b> or pad saw. Power tools including nibblers, jigsaws, and angle grinders fitted with metal-cutting blades and discs are now used for longer cuts in sheet metals.|$|E
