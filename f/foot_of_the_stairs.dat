5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
25|$|The {{manor house}} {{is laid out}} symmetrically. It is 33 meters from the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{to the top of}} the tower, and 33 meters from the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to the main gate portal.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2002 Kennedy {{was found}} {{unconscious}} at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> at his home, suffering {{a broken leg}} and skull with suspected brain damage.|$|E
60|$|Just then a man's {{voice was}} heard at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> grumbling angrily. At {{the same moment}} young Auberly rose to leave.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} a {{confused}} noise of voices and hurrying steps was {{heard in the}} street. Another moment and they were at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> <b>The</b> three men seized the poker, tongs, and shovel. Mrs. Black opened her back window {{and pointed to the}} churchyard.|$|R
5000|$|The tower, {{which stood}} in a {{commanding}} position, had three storeys and a garret, with a semi-octagonal <b>stair</b> tower in <b>the</b> re-entrant angle. The original doorway was at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> tower.|$|R
25|$|The sacred ballcourt and skull rack {{were located}} at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> of the twin temples, to mimic, like the stone disk, where Huitzilopochtli {{was said to have}} placed the goddess’ severed head. These {{locations}} served as a place for the reenactment of the mythical conflict.|$|E
25|$|To {{reach the}} Royal Reception Rooms one {{goes through the}} Queen's Gate (Dronningeporten), and through the Hall of the Halberdiers (Drabantsalen) {{you get to the}} King's Stairway (Kongetrappen). At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> are the Audience Chamber (Audiensgemakket) and the State Council Room (Statsrådssalen). The Queen holds an {{audience}} every other Monday and attends Council with the government as required– usually on Wednesdays. The Queen in Council signs new Acts after their adoption in Parliament. The Audience Chamber and the State Council Room are the only Royal Reception Rooms that are closed to the public.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter fire regulations, introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new fire doors were also installed at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and elevators on the platforms.|$|E
60|$|At <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> {{he found}} <b>the</b> guard afoot and {{awaiting}} his arrival; {{and when he}} had once more repeated his story, <b>the</b> commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post ordered four men to accompany him to the church.|$|R
6000|$|Then Rob {{also came}} to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> There was some angry muttering from the crowd, and young Charles Yuill exclaimed, [...] "Curse you, would you lord it ower us on week-days as weel as on Sabbaths?" ...|$|R
60|$|On the way down-stairs Laidlaw and {{his little}} {{companion}} passed a tall gentleman and two ladies who were ascending. Ere <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> was reached, loud exclamations of recognition and joy were heard in the regions above.|$|R
2500|$|In the Presidential Palace in Khartoum (built in 1899), in {{the west}} wing on the ground floor, there is (or once was) a stone slab against the wall {{on the left side of}} the main {{corridor}} when coming from the main entrance with the text: [...] "Charles George Gordon died—26 Jan 1885," [...] on the spot where Gordon was killed, at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> in the old Governor-General's Palace (built around 1850).|$|E
60|$|In due season {{they reached}} the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and a small table, covered with {{occasional}} china and photographs in frames, which lay adjacent to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> That--especially the occasional china--was what Baxter had heard.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed through}} the dining-room to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs Murridge," [...] said Mr Blurt, {{when the}} doctor had gone, [...] "would you be so good as mind the shop for a few minutes, while I go up-stairs? If any one should come in, just go to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> and give two coughs. I shall hear you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must use}} powder, my lord," [...] {{answered}} Pearson, who saw his master was too modest to reserve to himself <b>the</b> whole merit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceeding-- [...] "There {{may be a}} chamber easily and conveniently formed under <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> We have a sausage, by good luck, to form the train--and so"-- ...|$|R
60|$|A man had {{suddenly}} sprung out at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> and had swung his arm as though throwing something. It was the Flemish Bastard. Amos Green's musket flashed, but the savage had sprung back again {{as rapidly as}} he appeared. Something splashed down amongst them and rolled across {{the floor in the}} lamp-light.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rogers rose {{quietly and}} walked to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{paused at}} the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> expecting her to appear and come down.|$|E
60|$|The {{family had}} breakfasted, all but William. He {{went to the}} <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
40|$|No. 3. Indian {{girls from}} the Salvation Army School at Satara (with their leaders, Lieut-Colonel Edwin and Ensigns Khushi and Kamalabai) " A number of young girls are shown {{standing}} on a wooden stair leading up into a brick building. Two older women stand at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> near an accordion and other musical instruments. <b>The</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> postcard is blank...|$|R
60|$|This {{house is}} divided into sets of {{chambers}} and has a new frontage, but it no longer lets well. A few years ago there were two funerals from it within a fortnight, and soon afterward another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tenants was found at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> with his neck broken. These fatalities gave the house a bad name, as such things do in London.|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} before Miss Cutter's return {{developed in}} other directions still, {{and when that}} event took place, at a few minutes past seven, these circumstances were, by <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> between mistress and maid, <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> some interrogative gasps and scared admissions. Lady Wantridge had arrived shortly after the interloper, and wishing, as she said, to wait, had gone straight up in spite of being told he was lying down.|$|R
60|$|When I {{reached the}} <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> my father called {{me into his}} study.|$|E
60|$|She faintly smiled, {{and let him}} {{give her}} his arm to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Vaughan {{left the}} room. At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> he {{was met by}} the matron.|$|E
50|$|While, on 5 June 1607, at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>of</b> his lodgings in <b>the</b> High Street <b>of</b> Edinburgh, Spynie was {{witness to}} an {{encounter}} between his kinsmen, David Lindsay, 12th Earl of Crawford, and David Lindsay of Edzell, son of Walter Lindsay of Balgavie {{who had been}} murdered by Crawford. He endeavoured to interpose to prevent bloodshed and was slain by <b>the</b> young laird <b>of</b> Edzell by mistake. The incident was told inaccurately in the old ballad Lord Spynie.|$|R
50|$|Victory Park {{was opened}} in honor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 40th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Victory in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, however the {{architectural}} and sculptural memorial complex was built in 1975. The central area is filled with a eternal fire, alley of Heroes with high relief and sculpture Mother. At <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> is a granite slab with inscriptions in Tajik soldiers that were awarded <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> Hero <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. The park provided a cascade near the monument. On holidays, Victory Day parades {{are in the}} park such as in 2012 and 2015.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Utterson's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk {{that nearly}} threw {{him from his}} balance; but he re-collected his courage and {{followed}} the butler into the laboratory building and through the surgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> Here Poole motioned him to stand {{on one side and}} listen; while he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious call on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat uncertain hand on <b>the</b> red baize <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet door.|$|R
60|$|He seemed hurt, {{and walked}} away in silence to the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> where he paused.|$|E
60|$|At the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> Nutty stopped. He looked {{quickly into}} the porch, then looked away again.|$|E
60|$|William {{kissed his}} {{sweetheart}} at the <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and she went. He {{returned to the}} kitchen.|$|E
60|$|At eleven Mr. Binkley took Medora to the boarding-house {{and left}} her, with a society bow, at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall <b>stairs.</b> She {{went up to}} her room and lit the gas.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{the matter}} with Miss Blood?" [...] asked Dunham, who joined him at this moment. [...] "I just spoke to her at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gangway <b>stairs,</b> and she wouldn't answer me." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it chanced that a polar bear, {{attracted}} {{perhaps by}} <b>the</b> odour <b>of</b> cooked food, had wandered {{near to the}} ship and observed the young Eskimo ascend. Polar bears are not timid. On the contrary, they are usually full of courage. They are also full <b>of</b> curiosity. <b>The</b> night was clear, and when that bear saw the youth go up <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> it immediately went to the place to inspect it. Courage and caution are not necessarily antagonistic. On arriving at <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> it paused to paw and otherwise examine it. Then it began to ascend slowly, as if doubtful of consequences.|$|R
