500|$|Having won both races, Biden made a {{point of}} holding off his {{resignation}} from the Senate so that he could be sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009. [...] He became the youngest senator ever to start a seventh full term, and said, [...] "In all my life, the greatest honor bestowed upon me has been serving the people of Delaware as their United States senator." [...] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. [...] Biden resigned from the Senate later that day; in emotional farewell remarks on the Senate floor, where he had spent most of his adult life, Biden said, [...] "Every <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> have seen happen here, every bold step taken in the 36-plus years I have been here, came not from the application of pressure by interest groups, but through the maturation of personal relationships." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morris {{played at}} Michigan under head coach Bo Schembechler. [...] When Morris first arrived at Michigan, Schembechler told Morris (who stood five feet, seven inches) {{he was too}} short to play at running back. [...] Schembechler recalled: [...] "I told Jamie when we {{recruited}} him he {{was too small to}} be a running back and we wanted him for running back kicks. I did, however, promise him the chance to try to be a running back for us. <b>Good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> did, isn't it?" [...] In his third game as a freshman, Schembechler put him in as the starting tailback, and he remained Michigan's starter at the position for four years.|$|E
2500|$|She {{has spoken}} {{out on a}} number of {{volatile}} political issues, including tort/litigation reform, but perhaps her most consistent theme—aside from gay and lesbian rights—has been her unstinting opposition to Communism, and unrelenting opposition to the former Eastern Bloc power structure that compelled her to flee her native Czechoslovakia. She has denounced the Soviet Union's control over Czechoslovakia, maintaining that she refuses to speak Russian to this day because of the Soviet Union's former hegemony over Eastern Europe."Whenever people go into politics and they try to say that Communism was a <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> say, 'Go ahead and live in a Communist country then, if you think it's so great.'

6000|$|... "I haven't eaten so {{much for}} years, I assure you, Mrs. Basset; but it was {{impossible}} to taste all your <b>good</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> am not dyspeptic, thank you, but a little seedy and tired, for I've been working rather hard lately." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drummer and {{founding}} member Tommy Portimo said that Unia [...] "brought many <b>good</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> think our band needed that little shaking. ... That album felt very natural. Although we {{realized it was}} very far from what we were before. But {{it was just a}} natural shaking." ...|$|R
60|$|FANNY [she whistles]. I am awfully ignorant on some topics. One <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> {{always was}} a quick study. Not a bad-looking woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a queer person, Philip," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You're not fit to {{go about}} alone, really. <b>Good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> came over {{to take care of}} you, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|This account gave me great joy, as it {{perfected the}} only <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had done. I asked Joe {{whether he had}} heard {{if any of the}} other {{relations}} had any legacies? ...|$|E
60|$|Yet is {{man ever}} {{a strange and}} unaccountable creature. I, who had asked of God's mercy no more than putrid meat to eat and a {{sufficiency}} of water not too brackish, was no sooner blessed {{with an abundance of}} cured meat and sweet water than I began to know discontent with my lot. I began to want fire, and the savour of cooked meat in my mouth. And continually I would discover myself longing for certain delicacies of the palate such as were part of the common daily fare on the home table at Elkton. Strive as I would, ever my fancy eluded my will and wantoned in day-dreaming of the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had eaten and of the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> would eat if ever I were rescued from my lonely situation.|$|R
5000|$|While the German example's moral relativism {{has led to}} {{a lesser}} {{political}} fascism, others have questioned whether politics of memory is a <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>Is</b> it that [...] "Those who cannot remember the past, are doomed to repeat it?" [...] Literature in the past has largely ascertained that it is so.|$|R
5000|$|..... oh dear. What <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> could <b>I</b> {{possibly}} {{say about}} this most horrible piece of crap?! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's good! That's--sit down; sit down!--that's a very <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> assure you, I don't think it's {{the least}} use, though I do both. My boy doesn't, he's a pattern to his father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bother volcanoes!" [...] I {{answered}} testily. [...] "One {{may have}} {{too much of a}} <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't care if I never set eyes on another eruption as long as I live. So that's flat for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, land is a <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> admit, and it's {{right there}} should be an owner to it; yet there are folks who would rather squat than buy or hire, any day. Squatting comes nat'ral to 'em." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rock 'n' Roll was {{produced}} by the band and Guy Bidmead at Master Rock Studios and Redwood Studios in London. In the Motörhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, guitarist Phil Campbell states, [...] "I like it.

60|$|Ye {{have been}} very kind and good To me, since I've been in the wood; Ye have gone nigh to fill my heart; But good-by, kind friends, every one, I've far to go ere set of sun; Of all <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> would have part, The day was high ere I could start, And so my journey's scarce begun.|$|R
6000|$|My naturalist {{host and}} my {{scientific}} friend both remarked somewhat grumpily that I {{seemed to get}} the best of all the <b>good</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> might have retaliated that I certainly had gotten the worst of all the bad jokes; but, being generously happy over my prize, merely remarked: [...] "If you want fame or wealth or wolves, go out and hunt for them." ...|$|R
60|$|The girl {{pointed to}} the door without saying anything, and the dark man left the room. And then she came over and cried around me again. It's a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> had enough rubber in me to be water-proof.|$|E
6000|$|... "By thunder! {{but that}} was {{something}} I hadn't bargained for!" [...] murmured the great scout, as he surveyed the carcass. [...] "That's about the biggest wildcat I ever saw. It's a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> didn't meet him in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is rich, and she'd {{be sure to}} {{take notice}} o' the maid," [...] {{continued}} Mrs Durbeyfield; [...] "and 'twill be a very <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> don't see why two branches o' one family should not be on visiting terms." ...|$|E

5000|$|Tinchy Stryder {{said in an}} {{interview}} with The Sun: [...] "Mario Balotelli is a real cool guy and he likes his music, too."Mario’s the type of character that the Premier League hasn't really had.

6000|$|... "It'd be a <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>I</b> reckon. But you mustn't {{forget your}} milkin'. I dunno what our cow'd do this morning if it wasn't for Joey. But he'll milk her, him and Benny Hingston, between them, somehow. Benny {{stayed with him}} last night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not, your Grace. But as I and Silverbridge are {{together}} in this matter I thought I'd just let your Grace know {{that we ought to}} have had a very <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>I</b> thought that perhaps your Grace might like to know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{she will}} have you, there is no <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> would not wish for you both," [...] I said; {{but in spite of}} my efforts my voice rang hollow, and I was thankful when Cotton, who did not seem to notice it, rode away.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have done}} three <b>good</b> <b>things</b> since <b>I</b> have commenced; I have spared Boulton's life at your instance, I pardoned Gaddy, and now I shall shoot Scott." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that's--I've {{been feeling}} so jumpy lately, I thought maybe {{it might be}} a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> if <b>I</b> kind of got off by myself and sweat it out of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Things have happened, <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> hold, though you, Master, {{may think}} {{otherwise}} {{for a little}} while.

That lord brought a writing," [...] and he nodded towards the document on the table, [...] "and talked of death for you, Master--not for himself.

60|$|That these Sunday {{meetings}} in Theatres are <b>good</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> do not doubt.
