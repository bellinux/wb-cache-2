In [13], the authors proposed <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> approach for cluster-based WSN. Thus, in {{the existing}} literature, only <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> is carried out. The issue of <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> is completely different from jammer <b>detection.</b> <b>Jamming</b> <b>detection</b> refers to the detection of {{the presence or absence}} of jamming in the network. Jammer intrusion detection or simply jammer detection refers to the detection or identification of the entry of jammer node in the cluster. To the best of our knowledge, none of {{the existing literature}} has considered the issue of jammer intrusion detection or jammer detection in cluster-based WSN. Therefore, in this paper, the main idea is to first detect the jammer intrusion into the cluster (Section 3.1. 1 : verification and validation algorithm) and then to perform <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> in the cluster in the cluster-based WSN (Section 3.1. 2 : auditing algorithm). The proposed system works in two aspects: first, it prevents the entry of jammer into the cluster and, second, it continuously monitors the members inside the cluster to determine whether the members are jammed or not. That is, first, the proposed JDF prevents the entry of the jammer into the cluster. But due to any unexplained or unaddressed random error, if the jammer enters into the cluster then, a monitoring mechanism is needed to monitor the cluster member to determine whether the members are jammed or not. To address this, the cluster head of the proposed system performs <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> inside the cluster. Therefore, the proposed JDF comprises two components: verification and validation algorithm for jammer intrusion detection and auditing algorithm for <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> within the cluster member.|$|R

Therefore, in the proposed JDF, first, jamming is detected (based {{on the results of}} statistical test), and then if jamming is present, classification of jamming is done (based on the results of statistical test). Thus, statistical tests are employed for both <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> and classification but the methodology followed for <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> and classification is completely different as detailed below.|$|R

40|$|Modern {{geographic}} information systems do {{not only have}} to handle static information but also dynamically moving objects. Clustering algorithms for these moving objects provide new and helpful information, e. g. <b>jam</b> <b>detection</b> is possible by means of these algorithms. One of the main problems of these clustering algorithms is that only uncertain positional information of the moving objects is available. In this paper, we propose clustering approaches which take these uncertain positions into account. The uncertainty of the moving objects is modelled by spatial density functions which represent the likelihood that a certain object is located at a certain position. Based on sampling, we assign concrete positions to the objects. We then cluster such a sample set of objects by standard clustering algorithms. Repeating this procedure creates several sample clusterings. To each of these sample clusterings a ranking value is assigned which reflects its distance to the other sample clusterings. The clustering with the smallest ranking value is called the medoid clustering and can be regarded as the average clustering of all the sample clusterings. In a detailed experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of these medoid clusterings. We show that the medoid clustering is more suitable for clustering moving objects with fuzzy positions than arbitrary sample clusterings or clusterings based on the distance expectation values between the fuzzy positions of the moving objects. 1...|$|E
40|$|During the {{execution}} of the project Floating Automotive Data Collection (FADC), various traffic conditions were recorded using in-vehicle measurements. A series of reference measurements were performed on a fixed route in Belgium in real traffic circumstances, including motorway, rural and city traffic. Three vehicles were used for the reference measurements: a passenger car, a delivery van, and a delivery truck. An on-board device recorded vehicle speed and GPS position on second-basis. The resulting speed profiles were used as input in the vehicle emission simulation programme VeTESS to estimate fuel consumption and emissions of certain vehicles driving according to these speed profiles. The goal of these calculations was to quantify the effect of preventing traffic jams. From the simulations it was concluded that a reduction in average speed does not necessarily lead to higher fuel consumption. Actually when average speed is reduced from speeds above 100 km/h down to 80 or 60 km/h, fuel consumption can even be expected to decrease. Of course traffic jams are more about low average speeds. The simulations showed that when average speed drops below 30 or 40 km/h, fuel consumption increases significantly. Emissions of NOx CO and HC also increase in this case. So concerning fuel consumption and emissions it is indeed worth the effort to prevent traffic jams and slow traffic and to improve the traffic flow.

40|$|Traffic flow {{model that}} {{provides}} accurate traffic prediction can {{be beneficial for}} traffic congestion management. Macroscopic traffic flow models {{were used in the}} past to incorporate probe vehicle data and to provide real-time traffic information, but the data collection has not been done efficiently. Also, prediction of traffic state, especially for unexpected traffic jam, is needed to compensate latency in data processing and to provide advance warning to the driver. The objective of this dissertation is to develop an analytical tool which predicts congested highway traffic by utilizing macroscopic traffic flow model and strategically collecting data from probing vehicles with real-time update. First, Newtonian relaxation method is used to incorporate probing data into the LWR model in Eulerian coordinates for traffic status estimation. An investigation of probe vehicle deployment optimization is used to reveal the trade-off between the quality of traffic estimation and the probing cost. Synthetic data is used for numerical experiment, and Genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The result indicates that optimal deployment of probe vehicle can reduce probing cost and estimation error by efficient usage of probe vehicles. It is possible to decrease probing data for congested traffic with negligible degradation on the quality of traffic estimation. Second, a stochastic Lagrangian macroscopic traffic flow model is formulated which update the prediction of model parameters and traffic state with unscented Kalman filter in real-time. The proposed probing method tracks vehicles in pairs and utilizes loop detector data for additional information as needed. The model is validated with two sets of empirical data to demonstrate its capability of providing short-term prediction and using model parameter to detect traffic jam i advance. An adaptive probing scheme is presented to show that adjusting probing cell size based on the variance from stochastic model can improve the prediction accuracy.

30|$|Two <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> {{algorithms}} {{are proposed}} {{to detect the}} presence of different jamming attacks in the sensor network [9]. The fundamental algorithm is referred as basic <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> mechanism, in which bad packet ratio, packet delivery ratio, and energy consumption metrics are {{used to determine the}} existence of jamming. In order to determine this, these metric values are compared with their corresponding thresholds. If the metric values are smaller than their threshold, then there is an existence of jamming. Otherwise, there is no jamming. Secondary algorithm referred as advanced <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> mechanism uses additional variables and flags in order to improve the fundamental algorithm in detecting jamming attacks. The limitations are (i) the computation of metrics and decision-making are made at node level and (ii) every node collects its neighbor node’s metrics, stores, and makes decision for determining the presence of jamming. Therefore, this leads to increased time, space complexity, and communication overhead. A novel <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> approach is proposed to detect the presence of reactive jamming attacks. This approach used bit error rate and received signal strength to detect the individual packet bit errors. In [10], predetermine knowledge, error correcting code or error detecting code, and wired node chains are discussed. The proposed approach are assessed statistically and experimented on COTS BT nodes and Tmote Sky node. However, this approach can detect only reactive jamming and cannot detect other jamming attacks.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{implement}} a reactive approach, {{it is first necessary}} to detect <b>jamming.</b> Well-known <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> methods usually use packet delivery ratio, packet loss rate, packet latency, and signal strength [2, 14, 17]. <b>Jamming</b> <b>detection</b> schemes can be classified into two categories: the signal strength consistency-based approach and the location consistency-based approach. In the signal strength consistency-based approach, a low packet delivery ratio and a high received signal strength usually indicate a jamming attack. A location consistency-based approach determines the location of a node and measures throughput. If the throughput is low for a node that is close by, it might be due to a jamming attack. The signal strength consistency-based approach of Xu et al. [2] is used to detect a jamming attack in our proposed scheme.|$|R

30|$|Four {{types of}} jamming models, namely constant, deceptive, random, and {{reactive}} jammer, {{are presented in}} [7]. These jamming models {{are used in the}} wireless networks and are experimented for detecting the presence of jamming. The invented <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> mechanism was experimented by using MICA 2 mote platform. Initially, the <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> metrics such as signal strength, carrier sensing time, packet delivery ratio, or packet sent ratio were used independently to detect the presence of jamming. It is noted from the experiments that one of the <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> metrics by itself cannot detect the presence of jamming. Hence, the consistency check mechanism is devised in order to enhance the detection. This uses packet delivery ratio to detect the presence of jamming and consistency check to assess whether the packet delivery ratio is affected by jamming. The signal strength or location information is used as a consistency check. The overheads in this mechanism are (i) the nodes are heavily loaded due to collection of neighbor node’s metric and decision-making are done at node level; (ii) the collected neighbor node’s metrics are stored and processed for decision-making; therefore, this leads to increased time and space complexity; (iii) communication overhead due to collection of neighbor node’s metrics to make decision; (iv) if a node does not have neighbor node, then the presence of jamming cannot be determined precisely; and (v) the consistency check uses location information that entails GPS hardware or localization techniques.|$|R
30|$|The {{sensor network}} is {{vulnerable}} to jamming attacks since the sensor nodes operate at a very low radio power [4] and use limited communication range between source and sink. The jammers initiate jamming attacks, and their objective is to prevent the communication between sensor nodes or corrupt legitimate transmissions of sensor nodes by causing intentional packet collisions at the medium. Therefore, wireless sensor networks are appropriate in their hunt for jammers. The sensor networks are enormously used in many applications from military to health care [1, 3, 5, 6]. Therefore, a mechanism is required to detect jammer intrusion and jamming in wireless sensor network (WSN). To detect jammer intrusion and jamming, first, the intrusion or entry of jammer has to be detected (by using verification and validation algorithm) then, jamming and its types are detected (by using auditing algorithm). In this paper, a novel jammer detection framework (which detects the intrusion of jammer and various types of jamming attacks) is proposed and evaluated. In the existing literature [7 – 10], various <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> approaches are proposed for detecting jamming in the wireless sensor networks. However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, none of the existing literature has considered the issue of jammer intrusion detection in sensor networks. Therefore, in this paper, the main idea is both jammer intrusion <b>detection</b> and <b>jamming</b> <b>detection</b> in the cluster-based wireless sensor networks. throughout this paper, jammer detection refers to (i) jammer intrusion <b>detection</b> and (ii) <b>jamming</b> <b>detection.</b>|$|R

Second, when the source node is declared as a new one in the first step, then the framework validates whether the new node is legitimate node in the previous cluster or a jammer node by using cluster head code. Third, the framework observes the behavior of the newly joined node and the existing nodes to identify whether the nodes in the cluster is jammed or not.
