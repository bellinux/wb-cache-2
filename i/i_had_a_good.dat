2500|$|Truex {{was happy}} with his team's performance, [...] "I'm so proud of the team – all {{the guys on the}} team and {{everybody}} at MWR. Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just says a lot about everything that everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> day other than that. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time. … I feel bad about what happened with Jeff, but damn, we were just racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the way Mr. Speaker, did {{you know}} that I am a {{military}} hero? Yes sir, {{in the days of the}} Black Hawk War I fought, bled and came away [...] [...] [...] I was not at Stillman's defeat, but I was about as near it as Cass was Hull's surrender, and, like him, I saw the place very soon afterwards [...] [...] [...] If he saw any live, fighting Indians, it was more than I did; but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes, and although I never fainted from the loss of blood, I can truly say I was often very hungry.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to {{end of the}} West Indies {{domestic}} season, Australia {{toured the}} Caribbean. Having not been selected for either the Test series or the initial or the first three ODIs, Miller was [...] "surprised" [...] {{to be one of}} three new players called up for the final two ODIs in St Kitts, replacing Suliemann Benn. [...] "I was looking out for it [...] because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> season so I always kept my mind in tune for that call so that I won't be surprised," [...] said Miller. [...] "I was disappointed [...] but now that I got the chance I have to take it with both hands." [...] The West Indies had already lost the series 30.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Wilson explained: [...] "I first felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{voice when}} I was about {{seventeen}} or eighteen {{and was able}} to sing along well to records by the Four Freshmen. By singing along to those records that's how I learned how to sing falsetto. [...] I would sing along to songs like 'I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,' 'I'll Remember April' and 'Day by Day'." [...] He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a [...] "groovy sectional sound". He added, [...] "The harmonies that we [...] are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake." [...] For a period, Wilson avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying, [...] "I thought people thought I was a fairy. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Neal {{was born}} on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey, to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney, who played high school {{basketball}} (he was an All-State guard) and was offered a basketball scholarship to play at Seton Hall. Toney struggled with drug addiction and was imprisoned for drug possession when O'Neal was an infant. Upon his release, he did not resume a place in O'Neal's life and instead agreed to relinquish his parental rights to O'Neal's stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison, a career Army sergeant. O'Neal remained estranged from his biological father for decades; O'Neal had not spoken with Toney or {{expressed an interest in}} establishing a relationship. On his 1994 rap album, Shaq Fu: The Return, O'Neal voiced his feelings of disdain for Toney in the song [...] "Biological Didn't Bother", dismissing him with the line [...] "Phil is my father." [...] However, O'Neal's feelings toward Toney mellowed in the years following Harrison's death in 2013, and the two {{met for the first time}} in March 2016, with O'Neal telling him, [...] "I don’t hate you. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> life. I had Phil." ...|$|E
2500|$|De Angelis was {{replaced}} at Lotus by Scotland's Johnny Dumfries after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers {{at the same}} time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian Maurício Gugelmin to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor John Player & Sons (JPS) insisted on a British driver {{which led to the}} signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted [...] "It was bad, bad. Until then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> relationship with Derek." [...] Senna started the season well, coming second in Brazil behind the Williams-Honda of Nelson Piquet, and winning the Spanish Grand Prix by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races. However, poor reliability, particularly {{in the second half of}} the season, saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the Detroit Grand Prix, thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 2011, Lancashire were widely tipped to face relegation from the first {{division}} of the County Championship. Against Yorkshire in May, Chapple became the fifth Lancashire player to score 7,000runs and take 700wickets for the club. Chapple passed the landmark of 800first-class wickets in May 2011 during a match against Warwickshire. His 800th wicket was that of batsman William Porterfield. Victory in the match sent Lancashire {{to the top of}} the County Championship. In the last match of the season, Lancashire won the County Championship for the first time since 1950 when they shared the title. In his fifth over of the match Chapple experienced pain in his right hamstring, and feared he may have torn it. He returned to the field with strapping and on the final day, when he claimed his 800th wicket for Lancashire, he produced what Michael Atherton considered to be his most threatening bowling in a decade. For his efforts in taking Lancashire to the title, Chapple was named as one of Wisden five Cricketers of the Year in 2012. He said [...] "Personally <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> season but that wouldn't, in itself, be enough normally to win this award. The credit has to go to the players for the way they performed last year. It was a fantastic year for Lancashire and all the lads who played so well have obviously played a big part in me receiving this award." ...|$|E
