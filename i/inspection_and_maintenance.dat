25|$|Concerns {{about the}} safety of older {{transport}} aircraft being used as airtankers had been ongoing, long before the 2002 crashes. In the early 1980s, concern about the age and safety issues of World War II and Korean War-era aircraft that were the predominant aircraft used as airtankers led the Forest Service to initiate a program to provide more modern, turbine-powered C-130As to contracting companies. However, this solution quickly became the problem. According to an NTSB advisory, During a C-130A contract pre-award evaluation in 1991, the Department of the Interior's (DOI) Office of Aviation Services inspectors concluded that essential <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> services critical to sustaining the airplane in an airworthy condition under normal operating conditions were not being accomplished with the C-130A. This prompted the DOI, in 1993, to prohibit the use of the C130A on DOI land. The FAA and the DOI subsequently developed an action plan to address many of the same <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> issues seen in the most recent C-130A and P4Y accident investigations. Since that time the DOI has dropped its restrictions on the C-130A....|$|E

25|$|As in any {{infrastructure}} asset, railways {{must keep}} up with periodic <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{in order to minimize}} effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered the most crucial cargo and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include track geometry cars or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.|$|E
25|$|Periodically, ballast must {{be removed}} and {{replaced}} with clean ballast to ensure adequate drainage. Culverts and other passages for water must be kept clear lest water is impounded by the trackbed, causing landslips. Where trackbeds are placed along rivers, additional protection is usually placed to prevent streambank erosion during times of high water. Bridges require <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance,</b> since {{they are subject to}} large surges of stress {{in a short period of}} time when a heavy train crosses.|$|E
25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on erodible soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with erodible soil and topped off with dry riprap. Riprap protection, <b>inspection,</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E

25|$|That same year, the Aquileian War of Succession erupted as a {{coalition}} of secular nobles from Udine and surrounding cities sought to remove the newly appointed Patriarch, Philippe II d'Alençon. Fiore seems to have sided with the secular nobility against the Cardinal as in 1383 there is record of him being tasked by the grand council with <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> on the artillery pieces defending Udine (including large crossbows and catapults). There are also records of him working variously as a magistrate, peace officer, and agent of the grand council {{during the course of}} 1384, but after that the historical record is silent. The war continued until a new Patriarch was appointed in 1389 and a peace settlement was reached, but it's unclear if Fiore remained involved for the duration. Given that he appears in council records five times in 1384, it would be quite odd for him to be completely unmentioned over the subsequent five years, and since his absence after May 1384 coincides with a proclamation in July of that year demanding that Udine cease hostilities or face harsh repercussions, it seems more likely that he moved on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} optimal asset main-tenance inspection services. The model is designed to support through-life service {{in the form of}} multiple nested <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> to meet defined asset availability and capability requirements, as well as achieving successful through-life tech-nology insertions. The <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities are assumed to be performed at more than one level, but nested and aimed at different types of defects or subsystems over a fixed period of time (the designed asset life). This practice is common in many industries, particularly in the defense industry. The impact of technological insertions is reflected through changes in the failure behavior of the asset. We use the delay time concept to model the failure mechanism of the asset, and the arrivals of defects are assumed to follow Poisson processes. The decision variables are the inspection intervals, while the objective function can be expressed in terms of cost, downtime, or reliability. The model is demonstrated through a numerical example. The model can be used for optimizing two-level inspection intervals with technological insertions. Index Terms—Delay time, inspection, maintenance, technolog-ical insertions...|$|R

500|$|The NTSB {{determined}} that {{the damage to the}} left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on March 29 and 30, 1979. On that date the aircraft had undergone routine service, during which the engine and pylon had been removed from the wing for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>maintenance.</b> [...] The removal procedure recommended by McDonnell-Douglas called for the engine to be detached from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself from the wing. [...] However, American Airlines, as well as Continental Airlines and United Airlines, had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200 man-hours per aircraft and [...] "more importantly from a safety standpoint, it would reduce the number of disconnects (of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines, electrical cables, and wiring) from 72 to 27." [...] This new procedure involved removal of the engine and pylon assembly as a single unit, rather than as individual components. United Airline's implementation involved use of an overhead hoist to support the engine/pylon assembly during removal and installation. [...] The method chosen by American and Continental procedure supported the engine/pylon assembly with a large forklift.|$|E
