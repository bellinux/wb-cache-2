5|$|Express trains {{operated}} by NSB <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> primary passenger service on Bergensbanen. Passenger trains follow the Drammen Line and the Asker Line to Drammen, before heading north to Hønefoss on the Randsfjord Line. The express trains offer both transport from villages {{along the line}} to either Bergen or Oslo, as well travel between Norway's two largest cities. Expresses are locomotive-hauled trains with modernized coaches. Six nights a week there is a night train service. Several {{parts of the line}} service places without road access, such as Finse and Myrdal. Operating deficits are covered by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.|$|E

25|$|Although the Bumiputra <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest racial {{segment of}} the Malaysian {{population}} (about 65%), their economic position has also tended to be precarious.

As a result, the Reid Commission had recommended the drafting of Article 153 to address this economic imbalance.|$|E

500|$|This {{study has}} been {{extensively}} discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed {{to be limited to}} German-speaking Europe and thus may <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized {{as an example of the}} logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965) and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide sociologically within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that [...] "he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals".|$|E
500|$|Heather Phares from AllMusic gave it {{five out}} of five stars and said: [...] "Madonna's Video Collection: 1993-1999 adds to her status {{as one of the}} best {{represented}} artists on DVD. [...] Though it doesn't offer much in the way of DVD-specific features, the artistry of directors like Mark Romanek, Stephane Sedaoui, David Fincher, Jean-Baptiste Mondino, as well as Madonna herself, is on full display with videos like 'Take a Bow', 'Bedtime Story', 'Human Nature', 'Frozen', and 'Ray of Light'. All in all, it's a worthwhile collection of memorable videos from one of pop's trendsetters." [...] Bryan Chin from University Wire commented [...] "Some people really dislike the Madonna of the '90s. 'Oh, she got so slutty!, they quibble. 'She doesn't have the same kind of cultural impact that she had in the '80s,' they whine. Obviously, these people haven't been paying much attention. With the recent release of The Video Collection 93:99, however, those naysayers are certain to realize what they've been missing. These videos <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> perfect outlet to chronicle Madonna's smorgasbord of personas." ...|$|E

500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the {{polarization}} of religion {{viewed in the}} episode, noting that [...] "although 'Signs and Wonder's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith, it offers a pessimistic—and distorted view of religion." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{type of person who}} admires the creative attempt, even if the attempt isn't a complete success. [...] This is precisely the mindset I'm feeling after watching 'Signs and Wonders'. I admire the attempt to spook me, to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness, even if I'm not completely sure what the point of it all was." [...] Nevertheless, Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode's occasional quips of humor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+". Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were [...] "surprisingly horrifying" [...] and that the episode contained [...] "plenty [...] to recommend", he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey. Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes, he wrote that the [...] "last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going, and in a way that hurts everything that came before." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take the time to talk to me made a big difference. I <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I really do have to credit those two women for saving me." ...|$|E
