5|$|On 6 April, a {{force of}} 300 insurgents {{attacked}} Marine patrols throughout Ramadi {{in an attempt to}} relieve pressure on Fallujah. Sixteen US Marines and an estimated 250 insurgents were killed in heavy street <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> four days.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> {{the months that}} followed. In a period known as the Phoney War, {{soldiers}} on both sides trained for war and the French and British constructed and manned defences on the eastern borders of France.|$|E
5|$|During the American Revolutionary War (17751783), the Continental Army made {{relatively}} little use of cavalry, primarily relying on infantry {{and a few}} dragoon regiments. The United States Congress eventually authorized regiments specifically designated as cavalry in 1855. The newly formed American cavalry adopted tactics based on experiences <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> vast distances during the Mexican War (18461848) and against indigenous peoples on the western frontier, abandoning some European traditions.|$|E

5|$|On 12 June the {{soldiers}} of the 9th Infantry Division, who had come ashore the previous day, readied themselves for {{an attack on the}} battery. At 8:30a.m., the men of the 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery. The <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> the battery took a heavy toll on both sides, 307 German soldiers died to defend it and about as many Americans died to take it.|$|E
5|$|The adult bobcat has few predators {{other than}} humans, {{although}} it may be killed in interspecific conflict. Cougars and gray wolves can kill adult bobcats, a behavior repeatedly observed in Yellowstone National Park. Coyotes have killed adult bobcats and kittens. At least one confirmed observation of a bobcat and an American black bear (Ursus americanus) <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> a carcass is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a lull in}} <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> {{the winter}} of 1812–13 while both the Russians and the French rebuilt their forces; Napoleon was able to field 350,000 troops. Heartened by France's loss in Russia, Prussia joined with Austria, Sweden, Russia, Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal in a new coalition. Napoleon assumed command in Germany and inflicted a series of defeats on the Coalition {{culminating}} in the Battle of Dresden in August 1813.|$|E

5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> a princess. The Doctor would become involved in his own timeline by arriving {{at the wrong time}} and becoming accused of being a poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of <b>fighting.</b> <b>Over</b> the next six weeks the regiment advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's focus now shifted {{towards the}} {{southern}} end of the battlefield where the French and the Allies were still <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire's division and part of Davout's III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz and persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O'Reilly light cavalry, who gallantly managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they too had to retreat.|$|E
25|$|Following Japanese {{landings}} on Singapore, intense <b>fighting</b> occurred <b>over</b> several days. But the poorly led {{and increasingly}} disorganised Allied forces were steadily driven {{into a small}} pocket on the island.|$|R

5|$|The Army and Air Force {{had been}} {{involved}} in interservice <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> missile systems since they split in 1947. The Army considered surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) an extension of conventional artillery, and surface-to-air designs as the modern replacement for their anti-aircraft artillery. The Air Force considered the nuclear SSM to be an extension of their strategic bombing role, and any sort of long-range anti-aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet. Both forces were developing missiles for both roles, leading to considerable duplication of effort which was widely seen as wasteful.|$|E
5|$|While the Ramayana {{states that}} Tara first weds Vali, some Ramayana adaptations {{sometimes}} present a polyandrous relationship between Tara, Vali and Sugriva. The Ranganatha Ramayana states that Tara {{is given to}} Vali and Sugriva {{as a reward for}} helping the gods. A Tamil folk tale tells that after the amrita emerged, Tara rises and is given as a common wife to both Vali and Sugriva. In the Mahabharata, there is a reference to Vali and Sugriva <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> an unnamed woman, who the mythologist Bhattacharya believes to be Tara.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin {{to explain why}} he deserted the army, with Kevin telling him that he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> the United States's {{occupation}} of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|France in the 12th {{century was}} a loose {{collection}} of counties and smaller polities, under the minimal {{control of the}} king of France. The king's power was linked to his control of the rich province of Île-de-France, just {{to the east of}} Stephen's home county of Blois. In the west lay the three counties of Maine, Anjou and Touraine, and to the north of Blois was the Duchy of Normandy, from which William the Conqueror had conquered England in 1066. William's children were still <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> the collective Anglo-Norman inheritance. The rulers across this region spoke a similar language, albeit with regional dialects, followed the same religion, and were closely interrelated; they were also highly competitive and frequently in conflict with one another for valuable territory and the castles that controlled them.|$|E
5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942, the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had to be abandoned by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army. On 3 January 1943, this airfield had to be abandoned as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to Tazinskaya, there it remained until the <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.|$|E
5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but within Nagorno-Karabakh {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave. Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of <b>fighting</b> <b>over</b> rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
