5|$|Biscayne National Park {{includes}} {{a number of}} navigational aids, {{as well as an}} ornamental structure built to resemble a lighthouse. The Fowey Rocks Light is a skeleton-frame cast iron structure built in 1878. Already included within the boundaries of the park, the light was acquired by the Park Service on October 2, 2012. The unmanned Pacific Reef Light <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> miles (5 km) offshore from Elliott Key. The original 1921 structure was replaced in 2000 and its lantern was placed on display in a park in Islamorada.|$|E
5|$|Canberra <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> {{hours by}} road from Sydney on the Federal Highway (National Highway 23), which connects with the Hume Highway (National Highway 31) near Goulburn, and seven hours by road from Melbourne on the Barton Highway (National Highway 25), which joins the Hume Highway at Yass. It is a two-hour {{drive on the}} Monaro Highway (National Highway 23) to the ski fields of the Snowy Mountains and the Kosciuszko National Park. Batemans Bay, a popular holiday spot on the New South Wales coast, is also two hours away via the Kings Highway.|$|E

In 2017, Bratislava was ranked as the third richest region of the European Union by GDP (PPP) per capita (after Hamburg and Luxembourg City). GDP at purchasing power parity <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> times higher than in other Slovak regions.|$|E

5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> kilometers, but this will likely vary with the wind conditions. Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe. In fact, due to the thick, highly reflective cloud cover, the total solar energy received by {{the surface of the}} planet is less than that of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not buffered and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
5|$|It {{is active}} {{throughout}} the year, primarily at night. Gestation <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> weeks, {{and the female}} has a litter {{of three or four}} young. Nests in the wild, built from shredded bark, are in a tunnel or under a log. Marsh shrews typically live about 18 months, and males are not thought to reach sexual maturity during their first summer. Since their lifespan is short, they apparently breed for only one season. Although no breeding data exist for British Columbia, the breeding season elsewhere is from late January to late August; most young are born in March. The number of litters a female rears is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Predators of {{treecreeper}} nests {{and young}} include the great spotted woodpecker, red squirrel, and small mustelids, and predation <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> times higher in fragmented landscapes than in solid blocks of woodland (32.4% against 12.0% in less fragmented woodlands). The predation rate increases {{with the amount}} of forest edge close to a nest site, and also the presence of nearby agricultural land, in both cases probably because of a higher degree of mustelid predation. This species is parasitised in the nest by the moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae. The juvenile survival rate of this species is unknown, but 47.7% of adults survive each year. The typical lifespan is two years, but the maximum recorded age is eightyears and tenmonths.|$|E
5|$|The story <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> {{brothers}} who, traveling together, reach a treacherous river. They make {{a magical}} {{bridge over the}} river wherein just as they cross, they meet the personification of Death, who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The oldest brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest brother does not trust Death and asks {{for a way to}} stop Death from following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|They once practised fraternal polyandry, a {{practice}} {{in which a}} woman marries all the brothers of a family, but no longer do so. All the children of such marriages were deemed to descend from the eldest brother. The ratio of females to males <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> to five. The culture historically practised female infanticide. In the Toda tribe, families arrange contracted child marriage for couples.|$|E
25|$|DXM has an {{elimination}} half-life {{of approximately}} 4hours in individuals with an extensive metabolizer phenotype; this is increased to approximately 13hours when DXM {{is given in}} combination with quinidine. The duration of action after oral administration <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> to eight hours for dextromethorphan hydrobromide, and 10 to 12 hours for dextromethorphan polistirex.

25|$|Hydrogen {{pipelines}} {{are more}} expensive than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (hydrogen embrittlement), which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and material costs. The difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology: wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased material costs, but higher pressure pipes require proportionally more material.|$|E
25|$|The longest a human {{has ever}} been proven to live is 122 years, the case of Jeanne Calment {{who was born in}} 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum {{lifespan}} of a wildtype mouse, commonly used as a model in research on aging, <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include differences in efficiency of DNA repair, antioxidant defenses, energy metabolism, proteostasis maintenance, and recycling mechanisms such as autophagy.|$|E
25|$|The church proper, {{which has}} never been studied systematically, has a cross-in-square (or quincunx) plan, with each side nine meters long. Together with the Eski Imaret Mosque, {{provides}} an example of the Komnenian style in Constantinople. Its masonry consists of bricks, mounted adopting the technique of the recessed brick, typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period. In this technique, alternate courses of brick are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged into a mortar bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>three</b> times greater than that of the brick layers.|$|E
