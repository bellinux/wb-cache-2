500|$|During {{his four}} years at Michigan, Woolfolk had what one {{reporter}} described as [...] "a strange love-hate relationship" [...] with Coach Bo Schembechler. Woolfolk noted at the time Schembechler is a [...] "tough coach", and it was [...] "not easy at all" [...] playing for him. Schembechler was often angered by Woolfolk's tendency to try to run around defenders rather than banging through them, resulting in Woolfolk being benched more than once. But Schembechler said Woolfolk [...] "came of age" [...] in the November 1980 Ohio State game. After Woolfolk's MVP performance in the 1981 Rose Bowl helped Schembechler to his first bowl game victory, Bo complimented Woolfolk's powerful performance, noting: [...] "Butch {{can be a real}} load." [...] By the 1981 season, Schembechler was a true believer in Woolfolk, saying: [...] "Today, I can say without reservation, that I'd rather go into a big game with Woolfolk at tailback than any other back in the country." [...] Woolfolk, too, concluded in the end that Schembechler was [...] "key" [...] to his success: [...] "He kept after me. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> I was getting too fancy. <b>He</b> <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> 'You're a big back, a fast back, and you ought to be running over people -- not trying to dance around them.'" ...|$|E

"Timodemus of Aphidnae, {{who was one}} of Themistocles' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed {{with envy}} and spoke bitterly to Themistocles of his visit to Lacedaemon, saying that the honors he had from the Lacedaemonians were paid him for Athens' sake and not for his own. This <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>saying</b> until Themistocles replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: if I had been a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.'

500|$|Although {{suddenly}} {{very wealthy}} and successful, {{much of the}} band and its entourage now struggled with heroin addiction. Four individuals — group leader Duane Allman, bassist Berry Oakley, and roadies Robert Payne and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell — checked into the Linwood-Bryant Hospital for rehabilitation in October 1971. Their addictions had begun to affect their performances and matters seemed to only be getting worse, according to many involved. The clinic was deemed a [...] "joke" [...] and a [...] "nuthouse" [...] by Payne and Red Dog, and was later described {{as more of a}} psychiatric ward, as true rehabilitation clinics were several years away. All involved (including Duane) struggled to keep off the substance in the ensuing days. Despite this, Duane fueled the band's passion to get better and end their addictions: [...] "Duane was so happy and full of positive energy. He was always like that unless he was just totally wasted. He was the leader, the great soul, and <b>he</b> <b>kept</b> <b>saying,</b> 'We are on a mission and it's time for this thing to happen,'" [...] said Linda Oakley.

It included a sudden and prolonged spike in fear and anxiety, constipation, urinary difficulty, heartburn, sleeplessness and insomnia, a poor sense of smell, stress, and a slight tremor in his left hand.

In his {{presence}} I was almost always reduced to total silence. This was an extremely good thing, as it meant that we concentrated exclusively on the music. Above all, he taught me the meaning of silence and the meaning of singing. He said I was incredibly obstinate and did only what I wanted to. It's true that I've only ever played what I wanted.

In 1845 he was sent to the legislature, where he took a leading part in opposing the repeal of the Black Laws, which kept the negro from voting at the polls or testifying in the courts. Two years later he fixed his home in Dayton, where he quickly came to the front as a States Rights Democrat in the full Southern sense. He was given by a Democratic house the seat to which Lewis D. Campbell was elected in 1856, and he remained in Congress till defeated in 1862.

It is a characteristic of the mischiefs that arise from financial prodigality that they creep onwards with a noiseless and a stealthy step; that they commonly remain unseen and unfelt, until they have reached a magnitude absolutely overwhelming.” He referred to the case of Austria, where these mischiefs seemed to threaten the very foundations of empire.|$|R
