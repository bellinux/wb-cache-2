Seeds with 8. 5 % moisture content and 86 % <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> were filled in containers of different permeability, and storaged at different conditions during 360 days. Seeds packed in permeable container (paper bag) were stored at ordinary room temperature (18 to 25 ºC and 55 to 78 % RH), and dry chamber (18 ºC and 60 % RH) while those packed in semipermeable (polyethylene bag) and impermeable (glass) containers were stored in cold chamber (10 ºC and 75 % RH). Seed moisture content, <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> and germination speed were evaluated each 90 days interval. For all the tested storage conditions, seed germination speed was reduced at first evaluation and stabilized up to 360 days.

Material was collected in the years 2002 and 2003 on two different habitats. The first one was on a field after sugar beet and maize as preceding crops, the second one was an adjacent balk. The mass of seeds was estimated in ten replications (100 achenes each). Thereafter the achenes were weighed on an analytical scales. The <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> was assessed under different conditions of germination. Altogether there were 8 variants of germination conditions in 10 replications (20 achenes each). The first and the last evaluation were performed on the 9 th and 30 th day of the experiment, respectively. The total average mass of 100 achenes originating from all habitats and both experimental years was 0. 23 g. The total average <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> of poison hemlock achenes was 53 %.

Seed mass exhibited a significant maternal effect, increasing seed <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> but not germination rate. After accounting for variation in seed mass, both <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> and germination rate exhibited significant reciprocal effects, but these were non maternal in origin. Rapid germination and large seeds resulted in significantly larger seedlings in the nursery, but these carryover effects diminished with age. In contrast, the expression of genetic effects increased with age. Significant additive genetic variation was detected for growth by age 3 years and significant reciprocal differences were detected at the race level after 2 years in field trials.

Se determinó el contenido de humedad (CH), la germinación y la viabilidad de las semillas durante los 12 meses de almacenamiento en cámara fría. Para el procesamiento de la información se emplearon análisis multivariados. En A el mayor valor de la capacidad germinativa (98, 67 %) se observó en la primera evaluación, al igual que en B (100 %), donde las diferencias entre los meses fueron mínimas en todo el estudio. En C la capacidad germinativa fue de 79, 33 % a los 12 meses, lo que representó un aumento cuantitativo de la longevidad de las semillas con respecto a A. El proceso germinativo en A, entre 0 y 9 meses de almacenamiento, se completó a los 9 días de iniciada la prueba, mientras que en el resto de las evaluaciones ocurrió a los 6 días.

In this study, we investigated the possible functions of H 2 S in regulating Arabidopsis seed germination. NaHS treatments delayed seed germination in a dose-dependent manner and were ineffective in releasing seed dormancy. Interestingly, endogenous H 2 S content was enhanced in germinating seeds. This increase was correlated with higher activity of three enzymes (L-cysteine desulfhydrase, D-cysteine desulfhydrase, and beta-cyanoalanine synthase) known as sources of H 2 S in plants. The H 2 S scavenger hypotaurine and the D/L cysteine desulfhydrase inhibitor propargylglycine significantly delayed seed germination. We analyzed the <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> of desl seeds mutated in Arabidopsis cytosolic L-cysteine desulfhydrase. Although the mutant seeds do not exhibit germination-evoked H 2 S formation, they retained similar germination capacity as the wild-type seeds.

We therefore designed an exper-iment in which Pinus pinaster, P. radiata and Eucalyptus globulus seeds underwent four different ash treatments and one control. The treatments chosen were three solutions of ash in water (0. 5, 1 and 5 g L- 1) which were used to periodically water the seeds of each species, and a treatment in which a cer-tain amount of ash was applied directly to seeds which were moistened with distilled water only. Six replicates of 30 seeds per replicate from each species were used for each treatment. Seeds were incubated on a double layer of filter paper in Petri dishes under laboratory conditions. Germination counts were taken every 2 days {{until the end of the}} germination period. The results indicated that ash (in the quantities and under the conditions studied) had no postive effect on the germination of these species. The ash solutions did not significantly alter the germination rate with respect to the con-trol. Only the germination percentages obtained in the ash treatment markedly reduced the <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> of P. pinaster and P. radiata and had a completely inhibitory effect in the case of E. glob-ulus.

Seed produced by immature as well as over matured trees often give lower germination and seedling vigour (Khanna, 1977). In frequent seed years, low <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> of seeds of forest tree species necessitates collection of as much quantities of seeds as possible (Arya et al., 1994). The large-scale reforestation programme has necessitated the need of collection of large quantities of seed and that to the quality seeds. Further, there is no sufficient work carried out about quantification of seeds in different trees. Therefore, an attempt has been made in this study, to quantify the seed of T. alata under different forest types and diameter class. The present study was carried out in Uttara Kannada district (130 551 to 150 321 N and 740 61 to 750 71 E) of Central Western Ghats of Karnataka during 2008 - 2009. The forest types and locations were selected in the district based on the distribution of Terminalia species in natural forests by referring to “Fores...|$|R

Kernel heterogeneity can lead to brewhouse problems and a product with unpredictable nitrogen and fermentable sugar content. The variability between individual grains of important malting characteristics was measured in malt samples produced under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Various parameters (including <b>germinative</b> energy, <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity,</b> moisture content, β-glucanase activity, friability and homogeneity) were measured {{to ensure that the}} 5 d aerobic Optic malt, produced in Heriot-Watt university micromaltings, was viable and of commercial quality. The 5 d aerobic malt kernels produced at Simpsons Maltings in Berwick-Upon- Tweed were heavier than the micromalt. Commercially produced malt kernels had higher levels of fermentable sugars and soluble nitrogen than the micromalt despite lower α-amylase, β-amylase and ‘total’ limit dextrinase activity. Differences between the 5 d aerobic micromalt and the 5 d aerobic commercially produced malt are indicative of why micromalting cannot always be used as a model system for what is happening industrially and must be modelled on commercial practice. Subjecting 5 d aerobic micromalt to 24 h anaerobic incubation resulted in increased levels of fermentable sugars per l wort. 24 h anoxia also resulted in increased α-amylase and limit dextrinase activities. There are potential industrial applications for this anaerobic wort.

All the experiments were conducted in selected olive grove situated in northern part of Tunisia (Testour and Thibar) where the most widespread variety is Chetoui following by Gerboui which is a local variety. The experimental approach was based on using 32 parameters as recommended by COI for characterization and the bioagronomic observations concerned the morphological characteristics of the trees, leaves, fruit and inflorescence and the flowering period. The olive fruits were examined for their morphology and oil composition (oil content, oil quality and maturity index) and for endocarp characteristics. The field comparison, carried out in 2003, 2004 and 2005 and in the 2 regions, showed a good vegetative and reproductive behaviour of this cultivar, good productivity with high oil content and quality (fatty acids based on IOOC standards). Flowers occurred on inflorescences that measured about 3 cm in length. On average 23 flowers were observed by inflorescence but 42 % were aborted which is acceptable for obtaining a commercially profitable crop in olive trees. Inflorescence length, number of flowers per inflorescence and pistil failure percentage resulted higher in Testour than in Thibar. The parameters of pollen capacity studied indicate that the pollen of Gerboui olive cultivar show a rapid <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> and a good growth of the pollen tube, which is suitable as pollinizer. Olive oil of cultivar Gerboui is considered to be highly nutritional oil due in part to the high level of monounsaturated oleic acid and lower palmitic and linoleic acid content. The fruit samples had oil yields greater than 18 % (25 %) calculated at 50 % moisture, oleic acid levels greater than 55 % (60. 5 %), palmitic acid between 7. 5 and 20 % (13. 4 %) and linolenic acid levels less than 1 % (0. 55 %). The self fertility behaviour of this olive cultivar shown it is self-compatible, with satisfactory fruit set when flowers were self pollinated. The fruit set in self pollinated flowers was 3. 12 % resulting in higher fruit set in free pollinated flowers 4. 21 %. It has shown compatibility to local climatic conditions and was well adapted to the cultural and environmental conditions of the site. This description analyses numerous characters of local cultivars which can solve some cases of varietal homonymy and synonymy, resolving the confusion in cultivar identity.

40|$|Graduation date: 1954 The Oregon State Cooperative Seed {{laboratory}} uses {{two methods}} for testing {{the quality of}} Douglas-fir seed lots. The first of these is a straight-forward germination test without any pre-treatment of the seed, involving a period of 42 days in the germinator at alternating 20 °C. - 30 °C. temperatures. The second method consists of 14 days pre-chill of the seed on the moistened medium at 5 °C. prior to 28 days germination at the same alternating temperatures. The pre-chill helps to overcome dormancy which may {{be present in the}} lots. Recent work by several investigators has indicated that soaking pre-treatments might also be employed to overcome dormancy in coniferous seed. 	The study was designed to evaluate some of these soaking treatments in relation to the methods at present used by the laboratory. In all cases soaking was followed by pre-chilling; so that a measure of additional effects of the soaking treatment on the dormant seed was obtained. Two studies were made with the normal laboratory testing methods as controls. 	The first consisted of soaking the seed in water at temperatures of 5 °C., 20 °C. and 30 °C. for periods of 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, prior to pre-chill and germination. 	In the second study soaking temperatures of 5 °C. for 36 hours and 30 °C. for 14 hours were used. The seed was soaked in water and in 0. 2 percent potassium nitrate solution, to determine the merits of the two soaking media. At 5 °C. the effect of light during the soaking was examined together with its effect during pre-chilling on the germination of seed soaked at both temperatures. 	Included in the thesis are the results of a small study designed to determine an effective and reliable method of estimating moisture content in the soaked seed. Consequently moisture content was determined on an over-dry weight basis after heating the soaked seed at 100 °C. for six hours in an air-oven. 	Three seed lots were used in an attempt to obtain results over a wide range of seed quality. As demonstrated by the germination figures, the lots chosen exhibited such a range. Though the lots responded differently to the treatments employed, no over-all increase in germination of the dormant seed present was obtained with any of the treatments. The 30 °C. soaking for the longer periods produced a considerable decline in the germination, <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> and <b>germinative</b> energy of the lots. 	Dormancy was present in two of the three lots, but the number of dormant seeds remained approximately constant over all the treatments. Dormancy was reduced only {{in the case of the}} pre-chilled controls over the controls without pre-chill. The statistical analysis of the germination percentages revealed that temperatures of soaking was the dominant factor affecting germination. The period of soaking, though influencing the moisture content attained, was of little consequence in germination. No responses were obtained with the use of light during soaking and pre-chill, nor with the variation in soaking medium. A convariance analysis of moisture content attained and subsequent germination, indicated the absence of any correlation between the two entities. 	Taken as a whole, soaking procedures are of no advantage over the present germination techniques in use at the Oregon State Laboratory for Douglas-fir tree seed...|$|R
40|$|Background Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} (AE) is {{a life-threatening}} disease caused by larvae of the fox-tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Crucial to AE pathology is continuous infiltrative {{growth of the}} parasite's metacestode stage, which is driven by a population of somatic stem cells, called germinative cells. Current anti-AE chemotherapy using benzimidazoles is ineffective in eliminating the germinative cell population, thus leading to remission of parasite growth upon therapy discontinuation. Methodology/Principal findings We herein describe the characterization of EmPlk 1, encoded by the gene emplk 1, which displays significant homologies {{to members of the}} Plk 1 sub-family of Polo-like kinases that regulate mitosis in eukaryotic cells. We demonstrate germinative cell-specific expression of emplk 1 by RT-PCR, transcriptomics, and in situ hybridization. We also show that EmPlk 1 can induce germinal vesicle breakdown when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, indicating that it is an active kinase. This activity was significantly suppressed in presence of BI 2536, a Plk 1 inhibitor that has been tested in clinical trials against cancer. Addition of BI 2536 at concentrations as low as 20 nM significantly blocked the formation of metacestode vesicles from cultivated Echinococcus germinative cells. Furthermore, low concentrations of BI 2536 eliminated the germinative cell population from mature metacestode vesicles in vitro, yielding parasite tissue that was no longer capable of proliferation. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that BI 2536 effectively inactivates E. multilocularis germinative cells in parasite larvae in vitro by direct inhibition of EmPlk 1, thus inducing mitotic arrest and germinative cell killing. Since germinative cells are decisive for parasite proliferation and metastasis formation within the host, BI 2536 and related compounds are very promising compounds to complement benzimidazoles in AE chemotherapy. Author Summary The lethal disease AE is characterized by continuous and infiltrative growth of the metacestode larva of the tapeworm E. multilocularis within host organs. This cancer-like progression is exclusively driven by a population of parasite stem cells (germinative cells) that have to be eliminated for an effective cure of the disease. Current treatment options, using benzimidazoles, are parasitostatic only, and thus obviously not <b>effective</b> in <b>germinative</b> cell killing. We herein describe a novel, druggable parasite enzyme, EmPlk 1, that specifically regulates germinative cell proliferation. We show that a compound, BI 2536, originally designed to inhibit the human ortholog of EmPlk 1, can also inhibit the parasite protein at low doses. Furthermore, low doses of BI 2536 eliminated germinative cells from Echinococcus larvae in vitro and prevented parasite growth and development. We propose that BI 2536 and related compounds are promising drugs to complement current benzimidazole treatment for achieving parasite killing...|$|R

Nesse contexto, o controle biolÃgico constitui alternativa cada vez mais importante aos defensivos agrÃcolas quÃmicos. O controle biolÃgico {{consiste}} no emprego de um organismo (predador, parasita ou patÃgeno) que ataca outro que esteja causando danos econÃmicos Ãs lavouras. EspÃcies de Trichoderma sÃo reconhecidas como agentes de controle biolÃgico de doenÃas de plantas causadas por fungos fitopatogÃnicos, sendo a espÃcie T. harzianum uma das mais utilizadas. Os conÃdios sÃo os micropropÃgulos preferÃveis para uso no controle biolÃgico. Para a comercializaÃÃo de produtos de biocontrole, o produto formulado deve ser estÃvel ao armazenamento e manter a viabilidade dos esporos durante este perÃodo. A desidrataÃÃo dos esporos permite a preservaÃÃo do inoculo por um longo perÃodo de tempo, com alta viabilidade; e um dos mÃtodos utilizados para a secagem Ã a atomizaÃÃo (âspray dryerâ). Este trabalho teve como objetivo determinar as condiÃÃes mais adequadas de secagem de esporos de Trichoderma harzianum LCB 47 em âspray dryerâ, de forma a preservar sua capacidade germinativa no produto desidratado. Conduziram-se experimentos para avaliar a necessidade do uso de encapsulante na secagem dos esporos. Estudaram-se, preliminarmente, as variÃveis temperatura de entrada e de saÃda do ar para avaliaÃÃo dos seus efeitos no nÃvel de sobrevivÃncia dos esporos e na umidade do pÃ final. Testou-se a influÃncia de diferentes materiais usados como encapsulantes, por meio da avaliaÃÃo da sua capacidade calorÃfica (Cp) e atravÃs do nÃvel de sobrevivÃncia resultante da secagem utilizando cada material. Estudaram-se os parÃmetros temperatura de entrada e de saÃda do ar, por meio de planejamento experimental, para avaliaÃÃo da sua influÃncia no nÃvel de sobrevivÃncia dos esporos e na umidade e atividade de Ãgua do pÃ final. Realizou-se uma avaliaÃÃo da estocagem dos esporos com relaÃÃo Ã retenÃÃo da sua viabilidade. Verificou-se que Ã necessÃrio a adiÃÃo de um encapsulante para a secagem dos esporos por atomizaÃÃo. O aumento da diferenÃa entre a temperatura de entrada e de saÃda do ar no processamento levou Ã elevaÃÃo da umidade do produto final, devido Ã necessidade do aumento da vazÃo de alimentaÃÃo da suspensÃo. Menores temperaturas de saÃda foram melhores quanto ao nÃvel de sobrevivÃncia dos esporos, sendo a de 55 ÂC a que permitiu os melhores resultados. A goma arÃbica foi o encapsulante que apresentou maior capacidade calorÃfica, e foi o melhor com relaÃÃo Ã proteÃÃo dos esporos do calor do ar durante a secagem. O teor de encapsulante Ã o principal fator que afeta o nÃvel de sobrevivÃncia dos esporos, enquanto a umidade e a atividade de Ãgua do produto em pÃ sÃo fortemente influenciadas pela temperatura de entrada. Os esporos mantiveram sua viabilidade durante um mÃs quando armazenados sob refrigeraÃÃo.

In recent years, {{the world}} is having a growing concern regarding human activity towards the environment, including the problems related to agriculture. Biological control is, nowadays, a viable and important alternative to chemical defensives. Biological control consists of the used of a living organism (predator, parasite or pathogen) that attacks other unwanted organism without causing damages to the crops. Trichoderma species are known as biological control agents to plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi. T. harzianum is the most applied agent. Conidia are the preferred micropropagules for biological control. For commercialization, biological control products should be stable during storage and should maintain its viability during this period. Drying of the spores allows {{the preservation of the}} inoculums {{for a long period of}} time maintaining high viability. One of the most used methods for drying spores is spray drying. This work aims to determine the best operating conditions to dry Trichoderma harzianum LCB 47 spores, using spray drying, to keep the <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> of the dehydrated product. Experiments were carried out to evaluate the need for encapsulates during drying of the spores. Initially, the inlet and outlet air temperatures in the spray drier were evaluated concerning the survival of the spores and the final dried product moisture content. Several raw materials were tested as encapsulates by means of evaluating their heat capacity (Cp) and by evaluating the level of survival after drying the spores. The inlet and outlet air temperature were evaluated using a factorial design. An evaluation of the viability of the spores during storages was also carried out. The results show the need of the addition of encapsulates for drying spores using spray-drying. The increase between the inlet and outlet air temperatures in the spray-drier resulted in an increase in the final moisture content of the product because of the need to increase the feed flow rate in the spray-drier. Lower outlet air temperatures resulted in higher levels of survival of the spores, and the temperature of 55 ÂC allowed the best results. Arabic gum was the encapsulate that presented the highest heat capacity and that resulted in the highest protection of the spores during drying. The amount of encapsulate was the most significant factor that influenced in the survival of the spores, while the final moisture content and the water activity were most significantly influenced by the inlet temperature of the air. The spores maintained their viability for a month under refrigeration. The best operating condition to dry spores of T. harzianum LCB 47 was obtained applying inlet and outlet air temperatures of respectively 140 and 55 ÂC, and using maltodextrin as encapsulate. Under this condition, the mean level of survival of the spores was 96 %...|$|R

La investigación en esta especie es escasa, particularmente en los procesos que ocasionan el deterioro de las semillas almacenadas, fenómeno que provoca una pérdida anual hasta de 10 % de germinación. La presente investigación se llevó a cabo en tres fases. En la primera se evaluaron respiración y contenido de ácidos grasos y su correlación con perdida de germinación y vigor en semillas deterioradas de P. ixocarpa var. CHF 1 -Chapingo, almacenadas hasta por siete años en una bodega sin control de clima. En la segunda fase, se evaluaron las mismas {{variables}} en semillas sometidas a envejecimiento acelerado (deterioro artificial). Finalmente, en {{la tercera}} fase se elaboró un modelo matemático para estimar la viabilidad de semillas almacenadas en una bodega sin control de temperatura ni humedad relativa ubicada en el Valle de México. En la primera fase se encontró que semilla almacenada hasta por siete años perdió capacidad germinativa a una tasa anual de 11 %. El ácido linoleico mostró una disminución constante conforme aumentó el tiempo de almacenamiento, de tal manera que al séptimo año la disminución fue del 94 %. La actividad respiratoria también mostró un decremento constante desde el primer año de almacenamiento. La germinación correlacionó positivamente con velocidad de emergencia de radícula (r = 0. 99; P ≤ 0. 01), actividad respiratoria (r = 0. 79; P ≤ 0. 01) y contenido del ácido linoleico (r = 0. 78; P ≤ 0. 01); así, tanto la actividad respiratoria como el contenido del ácido linoleico están involucrados en la disminución de la germinación y vigor conforme aumenta el tiempo de almacenamiento. En la segunda fase se observó que los tratamientos de envejecimiento acelerado no cambiaron significativamente la composición de ácidos grasos en las semillas. El tratamiento de 50 °C combinado con 65 % de humedad relativa provocó una disminución promedio de 63 % en la germinación, así como un decremento en la respiración a valores inferiores a 0. 1 mL de CO 2 g- 1 h- 1. De igual manera, la velocidad de emergencia de radícula disminuyó 75 % al subir la temperatura de 45 a 50 °C. La respiración correlacionó positivamente con la pérdida de germinación (r = 0. 84; P ≤ 0. 01) y velocidad de emergencia de radícula (r = 0. 98; P ≤ 0. 01); así, la disminución de respiración fue la principal causante del deterioro en semillas envejecidas artificialmente. Finalmente, en la tercera fase se mostró que la predicción del contenido de humedad de la semilla en el rango de 5 a 14 %, adecuado para preservar la longevidad de la semilla. La mejor calibración de la ecuación de viabilidad de Ellis y Roberts fue cuando se optimizaron simultáneamente CH, CW, y Ki con el método Simplex en donde los cambios en los parámetros fueron menores a 4. 6 %, el error fue 3. 4 % y R 2 alto. La viabilidad de la semilla fue mayor o igual a 85 % hasta 263 d de almacenamiento y se alcanzó el 50 % de viabilidad en cuatro años y cinco meses. _______________ PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL EXPRESSION OF NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SEED DETERIORATION OF Physalis ixocarpa Brot. ABSTRACT : Mexico is origin center of husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.), which occupies the fourth {{place among the}} horticultural species. The investigation in this species is still scarce, particularly about the processes that cause seed deterioration in stored seeds, phenomenon that provoke a annual loss of 10 % in the germination. The investigation {{was carried out in}} three phases. In the phase one, the respiration and content of fatty acids were correlationated with the loss of germination and vigor in P. ixocarpa seeds var. CHF 1 -Chapingo stored from two months as far as seven years in a store without control of both, temperature and relative humidity. In the second phase the same variables were evaluated in seeds with accelerated aging (artificial seed deterioration). Finally, in the third phase, a mathematical model was elaborated to estimate the viability of seeds stored in a store without control of both, temperature and relative humidity. It store is localized in the Valley of Mexico. In the first phase was found that the seed stored as far as seven years missed <b>germinative</b> <b>capacity</b> in a rate annual of 11 %. The linoleic acid showed a constant decrease in accordance with the time of storage, {{in such a way that}} in the seventh year showed a decreased of 94 %. The respiratory activity also showed a constant decrease since the first year of storage. The germination correlationed positively with the speed of root emergence (r = 0. 99; P ≤ 0. 01), respiratory activity (r = 0. 79; P ≤ 0. 01) and content of linoleic acid (r = 0. 78; P ≤ 0. 01). In this way both, the respiratory activity and content of linoleic acid are involved in the decrease of the germination and vigor in accordance with the increase of the time of storage. In the second phase was observed that the treatments of accelerated aging did not change significatively the fatty acids content in seeds. The treatment of 50 °C with 65 % of relative humidity caused a decrease average of 63 % in germination and a decrease in respiration with values lower than 0. 1 mL of CO 2 g- 1 h- 1. Similarly, the speed of root emergence decreased 75 % when the temperature increased from 45 to 50 °C. The respiration correlationed positively with the loss of germination (r = 0. 84; P ≤ 0. 01) and speed of root emergence (r = 0. 98; P ≤ 0. 01). In this way, the decrease in the respiration was the main factor that caused deterioration in husk tomato seeds aged artificially. Finally, in the third phase, the mathematical model showed that the prediction of seed moisture was in a rank from 5 to 14 %, what is adequate to protect the seed longevity. The best calibration of the Ellis and Roberts viability equation was when CH, CW, and Ki were simultaneously optimized with the Simplex method, which, the changes in these parameters were smaller than 4. 6 %, the error was 3. 4 % and the R 2 was high. The seed viability was major or equal than 85 % until 263 d of storage and reached 50 % of viability at fourth years and five months...|$|R
