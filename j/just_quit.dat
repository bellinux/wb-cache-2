25|$|For {{the sixth}} and final season in 2001, the show {{concentrated}} more on the cops' personal lives rather than just focusing on the crimes committed. The Nine Network cancelled the show after six seasons. Executive Producer Kris Noble blamed escalating costs for the cancellation. However, Bisley and Smart had also <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> the show, and the series had already been suffering a ratings battle following the departure of Friels and McClements in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The line-up on Ozzmosis was Wylde, Butler (who had <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> Black Sabbath again) {{and former}} Bad English, Steve Vai and Hardline drummer Deen Castronovo, now in Journey. Keyboards were played by Rick Wakeman and {{producer}} Michael Beinhorn. The tour maintained Butler and Castronovo and saw Sinclair return, but a major line-up change was {{the introduction of}} former David Lee Roth guitarist Joe Holmes. Wylde was considering an offer to join Guns N' Roses. Unable {{to wait for a}} decision on Wylde's departure, Osbourne replaced him. In early 1996, Butler and Castronovo left. Inez and Randy Castillo (Lita Ford, Mötley Crüe) filled in. Ultimately, Faith No More's Mike Bordin and former Suicidal Tendencies and future Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo joined on drums and bass respectively. A greatest hits package, The Ozzman Cometh, was issued in 1997.|$|E
25|$|Foley first {{played with}} The Replacements {{publicly}} for First Avenue's twentieth anniversary. After seeing him play with this band at the Orpheum Theatre, his father finally decided that Foley {{was a professional}} musician. Starting in January 1991, The Replacements toured Europe for Warner Bros.' Sire Records for All Shook Down as the opening act for Elvis Costello. But their review in New York was poor and they broke up, perhaps because Westerberg was {{in pursuit of a}} solo career, or they <b>just</b> <b>quit.</b> What is known is that Paul Westerberg, Mars, and Bob and Tommy Stinson who formed The Replacements played rock music that was perhaps the most legendary and might be the most influential so far to emerge from Minnesota. Second only to Bob Dylan, Westerberg has been called the state's most influential rock songwriter.|$|E

500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2001 {{the band}} {{released}} numerous singles, {{as well as}} a box set featuring the amazing artwork of Japanese manga artist Suehiro Maruo, which had been used on the album Zennou-Naru Musuu no Me ha Shi wo Yubi Sasu. They also contributed a noise rock version of [...] "Day the Earth Caught Fire" [...] and another very catchy pop-influenced song, [...] "The Silence of the Crows" [...] on the Abstruct Madness split with Rocky and the Sweden and Delta. [...] "The Silence of the Crows" [...] would prove to be an instant hit with many fans. Near {{the end of the year}} the band found themselves once again without a drummer. Kill quit the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Takayuki. He had been a friend of the band's for many years and had <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> playing for the band The Batties Boys. They also opened their second retail store, Coffin, in Kyoto.|$|E

2500|$|Liston {{failed to}} answer the bell for the seventh round, and Ali was {{declared}} the winner by technical knockout. At that point the fight was level on the official scorecards. It {{was the first time}} since 1919—when Jack Dempsey defeated Jess Willard—that a world heavyweight champion had quit on his stool. Liston said he quit because of a shoulder injury. Dr. Alexander Robbins, chief physician for the Miami Beach Boxing Commission, diagnosed Liston with a torn tendon in his left shoulder. However, David Remnick, for his book, King of the World: Muhammad Ali and the Rise of an American Hero, spoke with one of Liston's cornermen, who told him that Liston could have continued: [...] " [...] was all BS. We had a return bout clause with Clay, but if you say your guy <b>just</b> <b>quit,</b> who is gonna get a return bout. We cooked up that shoulder thing on the spot." [...] Hall of Fame matchmaker Teddy Brenner also disputed the shoulder injury, claiming he saw Liston use the same arm to throw a chair in his dressing room after the match. However there is ample evidence that Liston carried an injury to his left shoulder into the fight.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{released}} [...] their eponymous debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers on August 10, 1984. Though {{the album}} {{did not set}} sales records, airplay on college radio and MTV helped to build a fan base, and the album ultimately sold 300,000 copies. Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill, who produced the album [...] "didn't embrace [...] musical aesthetic or ideology, argued constantly with the band over the record's sound." [...] Kiedis recalled, that [...] "Andy's thing was having a hit at all costs, but {{it was such a}} mistake to have an agenda." [...] Despite the misgivings of Kiedis and Flea, Gill pushed the band to play with a cleaner, crisper, more radio-friendly sound. The band was disappointed in the record's overall sound, feeling it was overly polished and as if it had [...] "gone through a sterilizing Goody Two-shoes machine". The album included backing vocals by Gwen Dickey, the singer for the successful 1970s disco funk group Rose Royce. The band embarked on a grueling tour during which they performed sixty shows in sixty-four days. During the tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. When the tour ended in October 1984, Sherman was fired. Hillel Slovak, who had <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> What Is This?, would re-join the band in early 1985.|$|E
2500|$|Grohl {{described}} this song as such; [...] "Wind Up {{is about the}} press. It {{has to do with}} me reading about people that... I mean there's certain musicians who have nothing better to do than complain, People, that can't feel fortunate for what they have been given, and if you don't want it, then fucking <b>just</b> <b>quit</b> and get away from it. It drives me insane when I hear musicians that don't understand how fortunate they are that they don't have to go and pump gas for twelve hours a day. They can sit on their couch and smoke pot, and complain to their friends that they hate it when someone comes up and says that he likes their band. And it also has to do with... I mean there are two sides: there's the reluctant rock-star, {{and then there is the}} prying journalist that almost lives for the reluctant rock-star, it's just talking [...] "about the hand you've been dealt." [...] Every time I hear about [...] "the hand you've been dealt," [...] it drives me fucking nuts, spare me your confessions. And paramania is the joy of complaint, like if you're a pyromaniac — if you're a paramaniac, you love complaining about everything. I don't want to complain about anything, I want people to know that I'm happy doing what I'm doing. I've had so many fucking bullshit jobs for the half of my life - you know, working in furniture warehouses and planting trees, painting houses - and it's a lot more fun to play music." ...|$|E
