5|$|On August 23, 2002, {{dozens of}} {{members from the}} Deputy Sheriff's Association issued a vote of no {{confidence}} in the incumbent sheriff during {{a meeting at the}} county's courthouse. The vote, they claimed, was issued due to allegations that the sheriff made against members of the agency, in which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> deliberately malingering in order to reflect badly on him. The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was only weeks away at the time.|$|E

25|$|After the incident, rumors {{spread that}} Goetz had been {{threatened}} with sharpened screwdrivers. This rumor was published as fact by some newspapers including The New York Times; however, neither Goetz nor the men made any such claim. During his subsequent {{statement to the}} police, Goetz expressed a belief {{that none of the}} young men had been armed. Paramedics and police did find a total of three screwdrivers on two of the men; when Canty testified at Goetz's criminal trial, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to be used to break into video arcade change boxes and not as weapons.|$|E

Wieseltier specifically dismissed West's books as [...] "almost completely worthless" [...] because, <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> [...] "noisy, tedious, slippery ... sectarian, humorless, pedantic and self-endeared." [...] Nonetheless, West remains a widely cited scholar in the popular press.|$|R

500|$|Poe {{introduced}} the collection with an apologetic notice admitting the low {{quality of his}} poems. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not intended ever to be published and [...] "why they are now published concerns no one" [...] but the author. He claimed, however, {{that the majority of}} the poems were written between 1820 and 1821, [...] "when the author had not completed his fourteenth year" [...] though this is assumed to be an exaggeration. Poe used the low circulation of this collection to attract readers later in his career, suggesting the 1827 poetry book had been [...] "suppressed through circumstances of a private nature". That second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems, included revised versions of five of the nine poems from Tamerlane and Other Poems.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community {{is not good}} for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders of}} another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E
500|$|... "Heart" [...] {{received}} {{a wide range}} of opinion from reviewers, though the balance was clearly on the positive side. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, wrote that it was [...] "thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish", and HuffPost TV Crystal Bell called it [...] "a standout episode of the season". Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle characterized it as [...] "sort of terrible" [...] and [...] "unfunny", and IGN's Robert Canning gave it an [...] "okay" [...] grade of 6.5 out of 10, but Canning also acclaimed [...] "the introduction of Rachel's two dads played by Jeff Goldblum and Broadway vet Brian Stokes Mitchell"; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "fantastic" [...] and their schemes regarding the engagement [...] "delightful". Bell called theirs [...] "the most surprising pleasant performances of the night" [...] and added [...] "I absolutely adored these two". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal summed up their appearance as [...] "annoyingly perfect", and TV Guide Kate Stanhope devoted an entire article to the pair, wrote, [...] "What's not to like? Seamless chemistry, witty back-and-forth", and noted that their appearance filled out Rachel's backstory. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was another who pointed out that you could see, from their characterization, [...] "how Rachel got to be the way she was". Billboard Rae Votta approved of the episode as a whole and of the Berry parents: [...] "For a pair that have been noticeably absent from the show {{for two and a half}} seasons, they cram a ton of character moments into a single scene". VanDerWerff wrote that the scheme by the Berry fathers [...] "to get the two to break off their marriage plans by talking earnestly about teenage lovemaking" [...] was [...] "very, very creepy and just a little unsound, but I sort of like that it suggests to me that, yeah, this is who these guys are." [...] He characterized Hiram and LeRoy as [...] "goofy sitcom characters", unlike Burt or Carole.|$|E

2500|$|In {{conversation}} on the Popery laws, I expressed my surprise at their severity; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> severe in the letter, but never executed[...]. His Lordship did justice to {{the merits of the}} Roman Catholics, by observing that they were in general a very sober, honest and industrious people.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Larry King Live, Al Sharpton, accompanied by Paultre, stated that according to his conversations with eyewitnesses, {{none of the three}} men mentioned a gun while leaving the club. Sharpton also said {{that it would have been}} impossible for anyone in the car to have heard the police; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> likely in fear that they were being car-jacked. However, several of the witnesses were paid by Sharpton. The NYPD Detectives union and others complained that the payments brought into question the witnesses' credibility. Sharpton replied, [...] "How can [...] support the detectives and I can't support the victims?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Arnold's {{sighting}} {{was partly}} corroborated by a prospector named Fred Johnson on Mt. Adams, who wrote AAF intelligence {{that he saw}} six of the objects on June 24 {{at about the same}} time as Arnold, which he viewed through a small telescope. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "round" [...] and tapered [...] "sharply to a point in the head and in an oval shape." [...] He also noted that the objects seemed to disturb his compass. An evaluation of the witness by AAF intelligence found him to be credible. [...] Ironically, Johnson's report was listed as the first unexplained UFO report in Air Force files, while Arnold's was dismissed as a mirage, yet Johnson seemed to be describing a continuation of the same event as Arnold.|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{said several}} of the tracks are songs that he held onto before he was signed. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> too good to give away on mixtapes. Cole stated that he had 16 tracks on the album, 12 of which he has {{produced}} himself. He also revealed {{that he would not}} release a pre-album mixtape like he previously stated. Instead, every Sunday until the album he released songs that did not make the album. The bundles of songs released are called Any Given Sundays. Cole said that the reason for the subtitle [...] "The Sideline Story" [...] is because he feels since being signed to Jay-Z it has been like someone being on the sidelines for their favorite basketball team, and they're just waiting until the coach puts them in.|$|E
2500|$|Rounding out {{the infield}} was utility infielder Flea Clifton. [...] Clifton played in 43 games during the 1935 regular season, with a [...]255 batting average. [...] However, when Hank Greenberg broke his wrist in Game 2 of the 1935 World Series, Marv Owen moved to first base, and Clifton stepped {{in as the}} {{starting}} third baseman. [...] Clifton was 0-for-16 with 4 strikeouts in the Series. [...] Clifton had been teammates with Hank Greenberg in the minor leagues, and the two became friends. [...] In his autobiography, Greenberg joked about Clifton's unusual diet: [...] "On the road, he used to eat nothing but doughnuts and bananas. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> cheap and filling and stretched his meal money. Flea was the only ballplayer who could show a profit on $1-a-day meal money." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ' no more justifiable insurrection had, in his judgement, {{taken place}} {{in the history of the}} world than the Irish {{rebellion}} of a hundred years ago. A rebel was a patriot who failed – a patriot was a rebel who succeeded, and he thought he did not misinterpret the spirit of that assembly if <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ready to toast the men of '98 in either capacity. He should never cease to be grateful to the United Irishmen, not only because they had bequeathed an example of courageous patriotism, but because they had given them one cardinal principle of high policy, and that was the principle of a united Ireland. He trusted that this memorable year would not be allowed to pass away without renewed efforts being made to restore union in the National Union, at present so unhappily divided.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Creation Research Society Quarterly for September 1971 Morris {{introduced}} the [...] "two-model approach" [...] asserting that evolution and creation were both equally scientific and equally religious, and soon afterwards <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "competing scientific hypotheses". For the third printing of Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity in 1974, the editor John N. Moore added a preface setting out this approach as [...] "the two basic viewpoints of origins", the [...] "evolution model" [...] and the [...] "creation model". When an Indiana school {{decided to use}} the book as their biology text, the Hendren v. Campbell district court case banned its use in public schools as infringing the Establishment Clause. Judge Michael T. Dugan, II, described it as [...] "a text obviously designed to present only the view of Biblical Creationism in a favorable light", contravening the constitution by promotion of a specific sectarian religious view.|$|E
2500|$|Following the by-election, the {{government}} stepped up efforts to gain {{support for the}} reform package. It commissioned two television advertisements which emphasised the need to move forwards with democratisation. Tsang began to campaign via radio interviews, {{and he and his}} ministers took to the streets to mobilise support. On the weekend of 29/30 May, Tsang and his ministers toured Hong Kong on an unpublicised itinerary to deliver flyers and meet the public. Tsang described as [...] "myths" [...] which surrounded the proposals – that it is regressive, it makes little difference whether it is passed or not, and that ordinary people are not concerned by political developments. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "the first step as well as the last opportunity" [...] to lay the foundation for a chief executive elected by universal suffrage in 2017. He expressed his fear that [...] "a mood of pessimism and cynicism will take root" [...] if there was no progress this time. Tsang also invited Audrey Eu of the Civic Party, the spokesperson of the [...] "Five Constituencies Referendum" [...] to a one-hour televised debate between on 17 June. Pundits were unanimous that Eu had trounced Tsang in the debate, with the University of Hong Kong poll showed that 45% of people were [...] "more opposed" [...] to {{the government}}'s proposals after the debate, while 20% said they were more supportive.|$|E
2500|$|Pushing the Senses {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. In a review for Dotmusic, Chris Heath said that [...] "Feeder {{are in danger}} of being a schizophrenic band, unrecognisable from their once 'trademark' sound and prone to style swings on a whim." [...] The Guardian said the album was a [...] "kind of emotional aural soup that will baffle the spikier members of their original punky fanbase". However, Q magazine reviewer Paul Brannigan was impressed, and wrote that the album could [...] "Finally establish Feeder as major league players". Metacritic, a website which aggregates the albums reviews from selected publications, gives an overall score of 52/100 indicating [...] "Mixed or average reviews" [...] from a total of six. Grant said that positive reviews are good to have, [...] "but {{at the end of the}} day do not sell records". In a 2008 interview with Kerrang!, Grant expressed his annoyance with the Coldplay comparisons, in which <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only made because he played a piano on the album. Kerrang! were brutal towards the band for all of their reviews, with Ben Meyers referring to them as a [...] "radio friendly unit shifter", including comparisons to a [...] "pastel box". A year later the album was marked as [...] "Avoid" [...] in a round-up of the band's material, which included the usual Coldplay and Keane comparisons the album suffered on release, although still conceded that the album is Feeder's most successful. Classic Rock review was more forgiving, considering the album a way [...] "to exorcise the ghosts of the past and ultimately move onward, into a brighter future".|$|E
