40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{offers a}} defence of open borders. It presents {{a critique of}} the idea that the state has a <b>justified</b> <b>claim</b> to regulate the movement of people because they reflect the collective endeavours {{of the members of the}} state to pursue a shared project of self-rule or self-determination. It argues that this view rests on an indefensible understanding of the nature of the state, which should be viewed less as a collective endeavour than as a product of conflicts among political elites. There is a strong prima facie case for free movement that suggests there should be a presumption in favour of open borders. The argument from self-determination is not a sound basis for justifying restrictions on the movement of people...|$|E

Therefore, sound information is required, but health information is often misleading and based on different interests. The risks of disease and the benefits of medical interventions tend to be overestimated, whereas harm is often underestimated. Evidence-based health information has to fulfil certain criteria, for instance, it should be evidence-based, independent, complete, true as well as understandable. The aim of a medical intervention has to be explained. The different therapeutic options including the option not to intervene have to be delineated. The probabilities for success, lack of success and unwanted side effects have to be communicated in a numerical and understandable manner. Patients have the right to reject medical interventions without any sanctions...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of educational/cognitive difficulties from which children can suffer as they develop, and there {{are many different}} commercially-available treatment programs which are advertised as able to assist such children. However, it is rare for any evidence to be supplied that demonstrates the efficacy of such programs. The authors show how neuroscience cannot help education here. Studies which collect neuroscientific data from children before and after a treatment has been applied cannot tell us whether or not the treatment has ameliorated the children's educational/cognitive difficulty. Whether a treatment has worked can only be assessed by collecting cognitive-testing data before and after treatment. Even when this is done and test performance is better after treatment than before, there are several potential confounding factors which need to be ruled out before a <b>justified</b> <b>claim</b> for efficacy of the treatment can be made. The authors describe two treatment research designs which allow one to rule out these confounding factors 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Of {{the most}} recent {{disciplines}} to arise in computer science, one is devoted to modelling with constraints and to solving the resulting constraint satisfaction problems. Some authors call it “constraint programming”, which I will avoid to prevent confusion with “programming ” as used in, say, “linear programming ” or “object-oriented programming”. Other authors prefer “constraint processing”, which I will avoid in favour of the more specific constraint satisfaction. Constraint satisfaction started as part of artificial intelligence. In 1993 annual workshops started, which became the CP (for “Constraint Processing”) series of conferences. Since 1996 Kluwer has published a journal named Constraints exclusively devoted to the subject. The blurb for the journal lists as application domains artificial intelligence, discrete mathematics, neural networks, operations research, design and configuration, graphics, visualization and interfaces, hardware verification and software engineering, molecular biology, scheduling, planning, resource allocation. Though {{it sounds like a}} blurb, it is a <b>justified</b> <b>claim.</b> Early books on the subject [7, 8] were focused on constraint satisfaction as a basis for a programming language. Tsang’s [13] is an exception: it is a pioneering precursor to the books under review. It is fitting that they were published shortly after [13] went out of print...|$|E

The latest survey of oral health and dental care has described two worlds in Australian dentistry (Slade et al, 2007). The first constitutes approximately half of all adults who enjoy a favourable pattern of dental visiting and better oral health. The second constitutes the other half who have an unfavourable pattern of dental visiting and poorer oral health. A very similar situation has been described in the South Australian population (Ellershaw et al, 2005).

40|$|Every year {{throughout}} the world, individuals' health is damaged by {{their exposure to}} toxic chemicals at work. In most cases these problems will resolve, but many will sustain permanent damage. Whilst any <b>justified</b> <b>claim</b> for compensation requires medical and legal evidence a crucial and often controversial component {{of this process is}} the establishment of a causal link between the individual's condition and exposure to a specific chemical or substance. Causation, in terms of how a substance or substances led the claimant to his or her current plight, can be difficult to establish and the main purpose of this book, is to provide the aspiring expert report writer with a concise, practical guide that uses case histories to illuminate the process of establishing causation in occupational toxicity proceedings. In summary: A practical, accessible guide to the preparation of balanced, scientifically sound expert reports in the context of occupational toxicology. Focuses on the scientist's role in establishing a causal link between exposure to toxins and an individual's ill health. Includes real-life case histories drawn from the Author's 15 years experience in this area to illustrate the principles involved. Expert Report Writing in Toxicology: Forensic, Scientific and Legal Aspects proves invaluable to scientists across a range of disciplines needing guidance as to what is expected of them in terms of the best use of their expertise and how to present their findings {{in a manner that is}} authoritative, balanced and informative...|$|E
40|$|Did we invent or {{discover}} moral rights? What {{would either}} answer entail for the duties that rights purport to create? And {{what would it}} entail for political and legal rights? The following three papers revolve around these questions. My answers exploit a property of rights that makes them very special: There is a constitutive connection between their justification and their existence. I have a right iff I am indeed justified in making certain demands, iff it is indeed true that others owe me certain duties. A theory of right therefore requires us to connect metaphysical with moral issues. “Anscombe on the Sources of Normativity” is the first systematic reconstruction of a very important discovery of hers. Rights (and also rules and promises) are self-referential: They purport to themselves be the justification of the duty that they impose; and they indeed are the justification if the purported duty exists indeed. For Anscombe, a social constructivist view of right-based duties {{is the only way}} explain this property: Rights can justify themselves, just as rules in a board game can, because they exist as part and parcel of a larger social practice. “Do Rights Exist by Convention or by Nature?” uses Anscombe’s discovery of the self-referentiality of rights to shed new light on an old debate: that between natural rights theorists and social constructivists about rights. I attempt a proof of Anscombe’s contention that rights can only exist with social practices. I also spell out what kind of universal rights are still possible within such a social constructivist framework. “Authority and Interest in the Theory of Right” applies Anscombe’s discovery to a current standoff in legal philosophy. I argue that “Will Theory,” according to which I have a right iff I have a <b>justified</b> <b>claim</b> against someone, gives the correct justification of rights, provided we modify certain details. “Interest Theory,” however, according to which I have a right iff I have a legitimate interest, seems to give the correct justification of the practices, within which rights are assigned (as opposed to any individual person’s right, as Interest Theorists claim) ...|$|E
