5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) {{arrive at}} the scene of Ed Russell (David Shumbris), a stay at home father, who is found by his wife Jen (Molly Price) stabbed to death at their house, whilst their baby {{daughter}} Sophie is at home. When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud to let his mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police did not know where her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on <b>Ed</b> <b>was</b> personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on <b>Ed</b> <b>was</b> personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Erectile {{dysfunction}} (<b>ED)</b> <b>is</b> {{a common}} sexual problem in men. Under-reporting of <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> widespread, {{largely because of}} the embarrassing nature of the condition. AIM This paper reviews the comorbid conditions that are commonly found in patients with ED patients and discusses the implications. DISCUSSION Erectile dysfunction is often associated with other disorders such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obesity, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lower urinary tract symptoms. Although the aetiology of <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> multifactorial, some of the associated comorbid conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, can be a primary cause of ED. Similarly, <b>ED</b> could <b>be</b> a useful marker for comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Effective treatments for <b>ED</b> <b>are</b> available, including the three phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors sildenafil citrate, tadalafil and vardenafil HCl. CONCLUSIONS Thorough medical screening of patients with <b>ED</b> <b>is</b> advisable, as this could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions. Conversely, men with conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and depression may have undiagnosed <b>ED</b> and should <b>be</b> questioned appropriately to ascertain any erectile problems and initiate appropriate treatment...|$|R

The current {{study was designed to}} evaluate the impact of the perceived severity of ED on treatment-seeking behavior and satisfaction with treatment among men with ED. Main Outcome Measures. Participants completed a questionnaire to assess the above variables, as well as the duration of <b>ED.</b> Methods. Participants <b>were</b> 410 men with <b>ED</b> who <b>were</b> primarily recruited over the Internet via men 2 ̆ 7 s health websites. Results. The results demonstrated that men with more severe ED compared with men with milder <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> more likely to have discussed their ED with their partner and doctor, have sought assistance for their ED problem, but they were also less satisfied with the effectiveness of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, and said they were less likely to use them in the future. Men with more severe <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> also less likely to want ED medication to last for 24 hours. Conclusions. Implications of these findings for the treatment of men with different levels of <b>ED</b> <b>are</b> discussed. <br /...|$|R

25|$|The Snows' {{marriage}} was strained and the Japanese occupation {{of much of}} China made life difficult. In December 1940, the Snows decided {{to move back to}} the United States in fear that the Japanese would make them prisoners of war. The attack on Pearl Harbor would take place exactly one year later. Prior to their departure, <b>Ed</b> <b>was</b> offered a position as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune and Helen encouraged him to take it. She returned to the United States without him. But not much time had passed until Ed realized he didn't want to be without his wife and the living conditions were too difficult for him to withstand much longer. The Snows had been in China for a decade and they were both lacking proper nutrition and vitamins. Nearly the entire time they were in Asia, they did not eat raw foods in order to avoid dysentery and their health was depleted. Upon their initial return to the United States, the couple lived in California for a short time and then moved into a small mid-1700's house in Madison, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Masterson got {{his term}} {{off to a}} roaring start on February 1, 1878, by {{capturing}} Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15, but the tandem law-enforcement effort {{came to an abrupt}} end when 25-year-old City Marshal Edward J. Masterson was shot and killed {{in the line of duty}} on April 9, 1878. <b>Ed</b> <b>was</b> shot by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Ed Masterson's brother Bat was in the vicinity. As mortally wounded Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street with deadly force, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss Alf Walker, who was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat avenged his brother. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as Fannie Keenan, was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman Miflin Kenedy (1818–1895). Sheriff Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Bat used his rifle to shoot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.|$|E
