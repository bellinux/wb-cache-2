5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>duplicate</b> Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead {{concentrating on the}} farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E

In task orders, the SOW may simply be included among the terms and conditions of the order itself. The SOW is often supplemented by technical reference documents and attachments.
