25|$|A <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> {{consists}} {{of one or}} more panels of webbing fastened together. They are left free to drift with the current, usually near the surface or not far below it. Floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline keep them vertical. Drift nets drift with the current while they are connected with the operating vessel, the driftnetter or drifter.|$|E
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>netting</b> is {{a fishing}} {{technique}} where <b>nets,</b> called <b>drift</b> <b>nets,</b> hang vertically {{in the water}} column without being anchored to the bottom. The nets are kept vertical in the water by floats attached to a rope {{along the top of the}} net and weights attached to another rope along the bottom of the <b>net.</b> <b>Drift</b> <b>nets</b> generally rely on the entanglement properties of loosely affixed netting. Folds of loose netting, much like a window drapery, snag on a fish's tail and fins and wrap the fish up in loose netting as it struggles to escape. However the nets can also function as gill nets if fish are captured when their gills get stuck in the net. The size of the mesh varies depending on the fish being targeted. These nets usually target schools of pelagic fish.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally {{drift nets}} {{were made of}} organic materials, such as hemp, which were biodegradable. Prior to 1950, nets tended to have a larger mesh size. The larger mesh only caught the larger fish, {{allowing}} the smaller, younger ones to slip through. When <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> fishing grew in scale during the 1950s, the industry changed to synthetic materials with smaller mesh size. Synthetic nets last longer, are odourless and may be nearly invisible in the water, and do not biodegrade. [...] Most countries regulate <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> fisheries within their territories. Such fisheries are also often regulated by international agreements.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Pallid {{sturgeon}} Scaphirhynchus albus and shovelnose sturgeon S. platorynchus {{are commonly}} sampled using <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> in the Missouri and Mississippi river basins. Despite {{the fact that}} <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> {{have been used for}} decades to sample these species, {{little is known about the}} capture efficiency of this gear. We estimated conditional capture probability for <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> over known locations of pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon. In addition, we examined several variables that were predicted to influence the success of capturing a pallid sturgeon or shovelnose sturgeon in a <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>net.</b> Conditional capture probability (the conditioning factor was known presence) varied from 0. 37 on the first attempt to 0. 51 on the second attempt. None of the variables measured were useful in explaining the success of sampling a fish in a <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>net.</b> <b>Drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> are relatively efficient, and we suggest that they continue to be used to sample pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon in large turbid rivers. The high variability in catch per unit effort associated with sampling pallid sturgeon and shovelnose sturgeon using <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> reported in the literature is probably related to the their low abundance (primarily pallid sturgeon) and patchy distribution (both species). Thus, using sampling designs appropriate for species with low abundance or patchy distributions rather than sampling designs commonly used for abundant species with ubiquitous distributions will require less effort because <b>drifting</b> trammel <b>nets</b> are relatively efficient...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>net</b> fishing {{became a}} {{commercial}} fishing practice {{because it is}} cost effective. Nets can be placed by low-powered vessels making it fuel efficient. Drift nets are also effective at bringing in large amounts of fish in one catch.|$|E
50|$|A drifter {{is a type}} {{of fishing}} boat. They were {{designed}} to catch herring in a long <b>drift</b> <b>net.</b> Herring fishing using drifters has a long history in the Netherlands and in many British fishing ports, particularly in East Scottish ports.|$|E
50|$|Japanese <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> fishing {{began to}} draw public {{attention}} in the mid-1980s when Japan and other Asian countries began to send large fleets to the North Pacific Ocean to catch tuna and squid. Japan operated about 900 <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> vessels, earning around $300 million a year. Those fishing boats were blamed not only for indiscriminate destruction of marine life, but also for poaching North Pacific salmon, harming the U.S. and Canadian fishing industries, and threatening the jobs of fishermen who did not use such methods. The first Bush administration opposed a U.S. driftnet ban because it would allegedly conflict with a treaty with Japan and Canada regarding salmon fishing in the North Pacific.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Drift</b> <b>nets</b> - are nets {{which are}} not anchored. They are usually gillnets, and are {{commonly}} used in the coastal waters of many countries. Their use {{on the high seas}} is prohibited, but still occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Despite controls, {{violations}} of <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> fishing laws are commonplace. The Mediterranean Sea {{is the most}} overexploited. With 21 modern states with coastline on the sea, there are many fisheries harvesting one small area. When <b>drift</b> <b>net</b> gear was banned, manufacturers modified {{the design of the}} nets so they no longer fell under the banned definition. A new definition was established in 2007 as [...] "any gillnet held on the sea surface or at a certain distance below it by floating devices, drifting with the current, either independently or with the boat to which it may be attached. It may be equipped with devices aiming to stabilize the net or to limit drift".|$|E
50|$|Although {{long line}} {{fisheries}} {{are the main}} contributor to sea bird by-catch, sea birds are also caught in drift nets in significant numbers.
