40|$|Measurements of NO, NO(y), O 3, and CO {{were made}} during NASA's Global Tropospheric Experiment/Pacific Exploratory Mission-West B (GTE/PEM-West B) carried {{out over the}} western Pacific in February and March 1994. NO(x) was {{calculated}} from NO using a photostationary state model ((NO(x) (sub mc)). Correlations between these species are presented, and some insights into the sources of NO(x) and NO(y) are described. The boundaries between the lower, middle, and upper troposphere have been defined at potential temperatures of 311 K and 328 K, which correspond to the <b>geometric</b> <b>altitudes</b> of about 5 and 9 km at 30 degN. Enhancements in the mixing ratios of NO(y) and CO were observed in the lower and middle troposphere. A positive correlation was found between these two species suggesting that the high NO(y) values were due to anthropogenic emissions over the continental surface. On the other hand, O 3 increased little with increase in CO. As a result, NO(y) /O 3 ratios were higher in air more influenced by pollution. NO(y), values in 55 and 28 % of the air masses sampled in the lower and middle troposphere, respectively, were higher than the clean free tropospheric NO(y) -O 3 range when O 3 values simultaneously observed were used. High (NOx) mc/NOy ratios between 0. 15 and 0. 3 {{were found in the}} boundary layer with relatively low mixing ratios of CO and NOy during the three flights. These air masses were transported from a higher altitude (approximately 5 km) and a higher latitude (approximately 50 degN) within a few days. The peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) /NO(y) ratios were generally high (approximately 0. 4) in these air masses, and the thermal decomposition of PAN was a probable source of NO(x). In the middle troposphere the (NO(x)) mc mixing ratio did not generally increase with NO(y) or CO, suggesting that the transport of air masses affected by anthropogenic emissions did not increase the NO(x) level significantly. In the upper troposphere, very minor effects from the continental surface sources were seen in the CO mixing ratio. By contrast, NO(y) values in 33 % of the air masses were higher than those expected when stratospheric air intrusion is assumed to be a single source of NO(y) based on NO(y) -O 3 correlation analyses. This result suggests significant free tropospheric NO(y) sources, namely exhaust from the aircraft and NO production by lightning activity. In fact, spikes in the (NO(x)) (sub m) c mixing ratios were observed near the aircraft corridor south of Tokyo at an altitude of 10 km. These two free tropospheric NO(x) sources were considered to be important in determining the levels of the upper tropospheric NO(x) and NO(y) during PEM-West B...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{barometric}} altimetry is to {{some extent}} a limiting factor on safety, predictability and efficiency of aircraft operations, and reduces {{the potential of the}} trajectory based operations capabilities. However, geometric altimetry could be used to improve all of these aspects. Nowadays aircraft altitude is estimated by applying the International Standard Atmosphere which differs from real altitude. At different temperatures for an assigned barometric altitude, aerodynamic forces are different and this has a direct relationship with time, fuel consumption and range of the flight. The study explores the feasibility of using sensors providing geometric reference altitude, in particular, to supply capabilities for the optimization of vertical profiles and also, their impact on the vertical Air Traffic Management separation assurance processes. One of the aims of the thesis is to assess if <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> fulfils the aeronautical requirements through existing sensors.

The radar system {{has the ability to}} accurately determine the <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> of detected meteor trains, thereby making it a potentially powerful tool for detailed and continuous observation of the atmosphere. Software has been developed in the IDL interpretative language to analyse the data in two main ways. Firstly a brief analysis of the relationship between <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> and ambipolar diffusion coefficient was made. As with all previous work the logarithmic relationship predicted between the two was confirmed on average, although a very large degree of true scatter was found. The density scale height inferred by this analysis was found to be in reasonable agreement with recent previous results. The major part of the analysis done used the ambipolar diffusion coefficient as a measure of temperature change and investigated these changes over time. Three time scales were investigated; variations over a few hours, daily behaviour and long term change over months and years. All three scales showed evidence of time dependent structure. The short time scale analysis showed evidence of fluctuations consistent with gravity wave propagation. Mid time scales showed a diurnal oscillation, but the source of this is unclear.

The theoretical predictions for how the pressure should vary {{over the surface of}} the hemisphere, involving an unknown sensitivity parameter, leads to a set of equations that can be solved for the unknowns – angle of attack, angle of sideslip, dynamic pressure and the error in static pressure – if the sensitivity factor can be determined.

40|$|A new laser air-motion sensor {{measures}} the true airspeed {{with a standard}} uncertainty of less than 0. 1 m s − 1 and so reduces uncertainty in the measured component of the relative wind along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft to about the same level. The calculated pressure expected from that airspeed at the inlet of a pitot tube then provides a basis for calibrating the measurements of dynamic and static pressure, reducing standard uncertainty in those measurements to less than 0. 3 hPa and the precision applicable to steady flight conditions to about 0. 1 hPa. These improved measurements of pressure, combined with high-resolution measurements of <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> from the global positioning system, then indicate (via integrations of the hydrostatic equation during climbs and descents) that the offset and uncertainty in temperature measurement for one research aircraft are + 0. 3 ± 0. 3 °C. For airspeed, pressure and temperature, these are significant reductions in uncertainty vs. those obtained from calibrations using standard techniques. Finally, it is shown that although the initial calibration of the measured static and dynamic pressures requires a measured temperature, once calibrated these measured pressures and the measurement of airspeed from the new laser air-motion sensor provide a measurement of temperature that {{does not depend on}} any other temperature sensor...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{modulation}} of {{temperature of the}} mid-latitude mesosphere by the solar-cycle EUV variation, which leads to greater heat input at higher solar activity, is well established. Middle atmosphere temperature modulation by the solar cycle is independently confirmed by the variation of reflection heights of low frequency radio waves in the lower ionosphere, which are regularly monitored over about 30 years. As explained elsewhere in detail, these reflection heights depend on the <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> of a certain isobaric surface (near 80 k), and on the solar ionizing Lyman-alpha radiation flux. Knowing the solar cycle variation of Lyman-alpha how much the measured reflection heights would be lowered with the transition from solar minimum to maximum can be calculated, if the vertical baric structure of the neutral atmosphere would remain unchanged. An discrepancy between expected and observed height change must be explained by an uplifting of the isobaric level from solar minimum to maximum, caused by the temperature rise in the mesosphere. By integrating the solar cycle temperature changes over the height region of the middle atmosphere, and assuming that the lower boundary (tropopause) has no solar cycle variation, {{the magnitude of this}} uplifting can be estimated. It is given for the Lidar-derived and for the rocket-measured temperature variations. Comparison suggests that the real amplitude of the solar cycle temperature variation in the mesosphere is underestimated when using the rocket data, but probably overestimated with the Lidar data...|$|E

Images have been analyzed to determine the altitude of the emission above the limb and infer the characteristic energy of the auroral electrons. Our study shows that the peak of the emission is located 1000 - 1300 km above the limb, indicating that the precipitated electrons are mostly in the 0. 1 - 1 keV energy range, that is significantly less than on Jupiter. Another source of information on the electron energy are the FUV spectra obtained with Voyager UVS (Sandel et al., 1982) and the HST-STIS (Gérard et al., 2004) and Cassini-UVIS spectrographs which only occasionally show a signature of absorption by hydrocarbons. Consequently, the emission is located above but close to the methane homopause. Finally, EUV spectra collected with the FUSE satellite (Gustin et al., 2008) provide information on the H 2 column overlying the aurora through analysis of self-absorption and rotational temperature of the emitting layer from the intensity distribution among the H 2 lines. If Moses et al. (2000) ’s low latitude model is used to convert altitudes into pressure levels, H 2 and hydrocarbon columns and temperature, discrepancies appear between the observed temperature, ultraviolet colour ratio and <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> of the emission.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the algorithms {{of the level}} 2 research (L 2 r) processing chain developed for the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES). The chain has been developed in parallel to the operational chain for conducting researches on calibration and retrieval algorithms. L 2 r chain products are available to the scientific community. The objective of version 2 is the retrieval of the vertical distribution of trace gases in the altitude range of 18 - 90 km. A theoretical error analysis is conducted to estimate the retrieval feasibility of key parameters of the processing: line-of-sight elevation tangent altitudes (or angles), temperature and ozone profiles. While pointing information is often retrieved from molecular oxygen lines, there is no oxygen line in the SMILES spectra, so the strong ozone line at 625. 371 GHz has been chosen. The pointing parameters and the ozone profiles are retrieved from the line wings which are measured with high signal to noise ratio, whereas the temperature profile is retrieved from the optically thick line center. The main systematic component of the retrieval error {{was found to be}} the neglect of the non-linearity of the radiometric gain in the calibration procedure. This causes a temperature retrieval error of 5 - 10 K. Because of these large temperature errors, {{it is not possible to}} construct a reliable hydrostatic pressure profile. However, as a consequence of the retrieval of pointing parameters, pressure induced errors are significantly reduced if the retrieved trace gas profiles are represented on pressure levels instead of <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> levels. Further, various setups of trace gas retrievals have been tested.

40|$|Scientific {{measurements}} of atmospheric properties {{have been made}} by a wide variety of planetary flyby missions, orbiters, and landers. Although landers can make in-situ observations of near-surface atmospheric conditions (and can collect atmospheric data during their entry phase), the vast majority of data on planetary atmospheres has been collected by remote sensing techniques from flyby and orbiter spacecraft (and to some extent by Earth-based remote sensing). Many of these remote sensing observations (made over a variety of spectral ranges), consist of vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature as a function of atmospheric pressure level. While these measurements are of great interest to atmospheric scientists and modelers of planetary atmospheres, the primary interest for engineers designing entry descent and landing (EDL) systems is information about atmospheric density as a function of <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude.</b> Fortunately, as described in in this paper, it is possible to use a combination of the gas-law relation and the hydrostatic balance relation to convert temperature-versus-pressure, scientific observations into density-versus-altitude data for use in engineering applications.

It also gives methodology for using atmospheric information to do "back-of-the-envelope" calculations of various EDL aeroheating parameters, including peak deceleration rate ("g-load"), peak convective heat rate. and total heat load on EDL spacecraft thermal protection systems. Brief information is also provided about atmospheric variations and perturbations for EDL guidance and control issues, and atmospheric issues for EDL parachute systems.

40|$|A joint field {{experiment}} between NASA and NOAA was conducted during August to September 1987 to obtain in situ and remote measurements of key gases and aerosols from aircraft platforms during {{the formation of}} the ozone (O 3) hole over Antarctica. The ER- 2 (advanced U- 2) and DC- 8 aircraft from the NASA Ames Research Center were used in this {{field experiment}}. The NASA Langley Research Center's airborne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system was operated from the DC- 8 to obtain profiles of O 3 and polar stratospheric clouds in the lower stratosphere during long-range flights over Antarctica from August 28 to September 29, 1987. The airborne DIAL system was configured to transmit simultaneously four laser wavelengths (301, 311, 622, and 1064 nm) above the DC- 8 for DIAL measurements of O 3 profiles between 11 to 20 km ASL (<b>geometric</b> <b>altitude</b> above sea level) and multiple wavelength aerosol backscatter measurements between 11 to 24 km ASL. A total of 13 DC- 8 flights were made over Antarctica with 2 flights reaching the South Pole. Polar stratospheric clouds (PSC's) were detected in multiple thin layers in the 11 to 21 km ASL altitude range with each layer having a typical thickness of less than 1 km. Two types of PSC's were found based on aerosol backscattering ratios: predominantly water ice clouds (type 2) and clouds with scattering characteristics consistent with binary solid nitric acid/water clouds (type 1). Large-scale cross sections of O 3 distributions were obtained. The data provides additional information about a potentially important transport mechanism that may influence the O 3 budget inside the vortex. There is also some evidence that strong low pressure systems in the troposphere are associated with regions of lower stratospheric O 3. This paper discusses the spatial and temporal variations of O 3 inside and outside the polar vortex region during the development of the O 3 hole and relates these data to other measurements obtained during this field experiment...|$|E
40|$|Many {{atmospheric}} measurement systems, {{such as the}} sounding instruments on Voyager, gather atmospheric information {{in the form of}} temperature versus pressure level. In these terms, there is considerable consistency among the mean atmospheric profiles of the outer planets Jupiter through Neptune, including Titan. On a given planet or on Titan, the range of variability of temperature versus pressure level due to seasonal, latitudinal, and diurnal variations is also not large. However, many engineering needs for atmospheric models relate not to temperature versus pressure level but atmospheric density versus <b>geometric</b> <b>altitude.</b> This need is especially true for design and analysis of aerocapture systems. Aerocapture drag force available for aerocapture is directly proportional to atmospheric density. Available aerocapture "corridor width" (allowable range of atmospheric entry angle) also depends on height rate of change of atmospheric density, as characterized by density scale height. Characteristics of hydrostatics and the gas law equation mean that relatively small systematic differences in temperature-versus-pressure profiles can integrate at high altitudes to very large differences in density-versus-altitude profiles. Thus a given periapsis density required to accomplish successful aerocapture can occur at substantially different altitudes (approx. 150 - 300 km) on the various outer planets, and significantly different density scale heights (approx. 20 - 50 km) can occur at these periapsis altitudes. This paper will illustrate these effects and discuss implications for improvements in {{atmospheric measurement}}s to yield significant impact on design of aerocapture systems for future missions to Titan and the outer planets. Relatively small- scale atmospheric perturbations, such as gravity waves, tides, and other atmospheric variations can also have significant effect on design details for aerocapture guidance and control systems. This paper will also discuss benefits that would result from improved understanding of Titan and outer planetary atmospheric perturbation characteristics. Details of recent engineering-level atmospheric models for Titan and Neptune will be presented, and effects of present and future levels of atmospheric uncertainty and variability characteristics will be examined...|$|E
