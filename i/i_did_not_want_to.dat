500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> come back. I've always had a great story to play. I love the way they write Sharon. It was just a matter of hammering out the deal points." ...|$|E
500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton {{made her}} driver debut in 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances {{were the result}} of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits they were saying 'Michele you must stop', but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E

Banks enjoyed coaching but soon resigned his position, feeling that players such as Bernie Wright refused to take his advice on board. He applied for the vacant management positions at Lincoln City and Rotherham United, but was rejected. He instead accepted the role as manager of Alliance Premier League part-time club Telford United. He signed a goalkeeper, centre-half and centre-forward from Bangor City for £1,500, as well as former Stoke striker John Ruggiero. The [...] "Bucks" [...] finished in 13th place in 1979–80. In November 1980, he left Jackie Mudie in temporary charge of team affairs whilst he underwent surgery, who led the club to defeat in the FA Trophy {{at the hands of}} a lower league club. On his return to the club Banks was sacked. He was offered the position of raffle-ticket seller, and accepted the post in the belief that it would entitle him to the money owed to him in the terms of his management contract; he eventually had to settle for 50% of his contract. He later stated that [...] "It broke my heart... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stay in the game." ...|$|E

During this period she disliked being typecast as a French maid. Colbert later said, [...] "In the very beginning, they wanted to give me French roles … That’s why I used to say my name Col-bert {{just as it is}} spelled instead of Col-baire. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be typed as ‘that French girl.’" [...] She received critical acclaim on Broadway in the production of The Barker (1927) as a carnival snake charmer. She reprised this role for the play's run in London's West End. Colbert was noticed by the theatrical producer Leland Hayward, who suggested her for the heroine role in For the Love of Mike (1927), a silent film now believed to be lost.

2500|$|Gonzales enjoyed broad {{bipartisan}} support {{in connection with}} his nomination, including the support of former Democratic HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros and Colorado Democratic Senator Ken Salazar.

2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E

After 10 to 15 years of recording like that I felt that it was finally time for me to have my own place to produce music, and have exactly what I want in there: the exact tape machines, the exact microphones, the exact amplifiers that I like, and so on." [...] Using the slogan [...] "Your Turntable’s Not Dead," [...] Third Man also presses vinyl records, for the artists on its label, for White's own musical ventures, as well as for third parties for hire.|$|E
