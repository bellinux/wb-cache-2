40|$|A new Unemployment Insurance System {{based on}} {{individual}} accounts {{was launched in}} Chile on October 2002. One {{of the most interesting}} features of the system is given by the compensation scheme of the fund manager, which contains a performance based incentive benchmarked to one of the default portfolios of the pension system (pension <b>funds</b> <b>Type</b> E, with a 100 % investment in fixed-income securities). This paper studies the portfolio choice problem of a fund manager which is subject to a similar performance-based compensation scheme. We model the portfolio choice problem of a risk averse portfolio manager that must finance an exogenous sequence of benefits, and whose terminal payoff depends upon the terminal value of the portfolio under management, relative to an exogenous benchmark portfolio. Our interest is on the consequences of the incentive scheme over the portfolio that is selected by the portfolio manager. For the Black and Scholes [1973] economy we are able to determine the investment policy in closed form. We show that the riskiness of the portfolio depends on the composition of the benchmark, and that the fund manager is motivated to imitate the investment policy of the benchmark in some random scenarios. ...|$|E

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) a major driving force of globalization offer unique opportunities to SMEs, empowering {{them to participate in}} the globalised economy. However ICT use in SMES remains low. This study was carried out to investigate the determinants of ICT adoption and use by SMEs in Thika Municipality in Kenya. A cross-sectional survey of 75 SMEs was carried out; stratified random sampling was used to draw the sample from the total population of 240 SMEs. Structured questionnaires were used to collect data which was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Findings indicated an ICT adoption index of 68 %; mobile phones were the most adopted and used ICT, followed by computers and fixed phones. Most enterprises used ICT for basic applications of communication and office automation. Use of more advanced ICT applications was very low and only 28 % of the enterprises had a web page. ICT adoption was more influenced by internal enterprise factors which include ICT knowledge and skills of the manager/owner and employees, identified need for ICT/ perceived usefulness of ICT in the enterprise, availability of <b>funds,</b> <b>type</b> of market and business operations. The study recommends stepping up ICT awareness and training among SMEs owners, employees and the public, formulation of supportive policies, subsidizing the cost of ICT...|$|E
40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo visa contribuir ao {{mainstream}} da Teoria de ApreÃamento de Ativos, ao analisar o desempenho dos fundos de investimento em aÃÃes no Brasil, a partir de um painel composto por 75 fundos do tipo ANBIMA Ibovespa Ativo, sobreviventes no perÃodo {{de janeiro}} de 1998 a dezembro de 2008, identificando aqueles cujo resultado se deve simplesmente Ã sorte ou ao azar e aqueles cujo resultado se deve Ã habilidade ou Ã falta de habilidade dos seus gestores. Seguindo a metodologia desenvolvida em Fama & French (1992, 1993) e o trabalho elaborado por Matos e Silva (2010), construÃram-se fatores, os quais consistem em zero cost equal weighted portfolios compostos apenas por fundos, capazes de captar os efeitos tamanho e ganho acumulado destes ativos, sendo os mesmos usados em diversas aplicaÃÃes em uma versÃo estendida do Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Os efeitos tamanho e ganho acumulado, evidenciados pela inadequaÃÃo do CAPM em modelar fundos com maior patrimÃnio lÃquido e ganhos acumulados muito altos ou baixos, parecem ser muito bem acomodados quando da incorporaÃÃo dos fatores, os quais se mostraram significativos conjuntamente em 50 % dos 75 fundos analisados. As principais evidÃncias obtidas a partir de regressÃes temporais individuais sÃo corroboradas quando do teste em painel com efeitos aleatÃrios em que ambos os efeitos sÃo indispensÃveis na explicaÃÃo dos retornos dos fundos de investimento em aÃÃes no Brasil. Para a anÃlise de performance dos fundos, seguiu-se a metodologia proposta por Fama & French (2010), na qual, por meio de tÃcnicas de bootstrap, modela-se o estudo transversal do desempenho dos fundos de investimento. Para a maioria dos fundos que apresentaram outperformance significativa, com base nos alfas estimados nas regressÃes individuais, identificou-se desempenho devido ao acaso. No modelo de fatores proposto, somente trÃs fundos apresentaram real desempenho superior devido Ã habilidade de seus gestores, todos esses vinculados a instituiÃÃes financeiras privadas. O modelo de fatores se mostrou mais criterioso na caracterizaÃÃo da aleatoriedade de performance. This dissertation aims {{to contribute to}} the mainstream in Asset Pricing Theory, to analyze the performance of stock mutual funds in Brazil, for a panel with 75 mutual <b>funds</b> <b>type</b> ANBIMA Active Ibovespa which have survived during the period between Jan- 1998 and Dec- 2008, identifying those whose result is simply due to good luck or bad luck and those whose result is due to the skill or lack of skill of their managers. Following the methodology developed in Fama and French (1992, 1993), we built two factors, mutual funds zero cost equal weighted portfolios, able to accommodate the size and performance effects observed for these assets, which are used in some applications in an extended version of Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Both effects, which seem to play a relevant role due to the inefficiency of the CAPM model to price big funds with huge relative performance (very high or very low), are partially accommodated when one adds factors, which are significant jointly in 50 % of the 75 funds analyzed. The main evidences obtained running individual time series regressions are corroborated if one uses the panel technique estimation with random effects, where both factors seem to be vital if one intends to better understand the returns of the mutual funds in Brazil. To analyze the performance of the funds, the methodology developed in Fama and French (2010) was used, in which, by bootstrap techniques, the cross-section of the performance of investment funds are modeled. For most of the funds that had significant outperformance, based on the estimated alphas in individual regressions, performance due to chance was identified. In the factors model proposed, only three funds really outperformed due to the ability of their managers, all those linked to private financial institutions. The factor model proved to be more accurate in characterizing the randomness of performance with the appropriate criteria...|$|E
