25|$|On old and lower-cost CRT {{oscilloscopes}} the <b>graticule</b> is a {{sheet of}} plastic, often with light-diffusing markings and concealed lamps {{at the edge of}} the <b>graticule.</b> The lamps had a brightness control. Higher-cost instruments have the <b>graticule</b> marked on the inside face of the CRT, to eliminate parallax errors; better ones also had adjustable edge illumination with diffusing markings. (Diffusing markings appear bright.) Digital oscilloscopes, however, generate the <b>graticule</b> markings on the display in the same way as the trace.|$|E
25|$|Accuracy and {{resolution}} of measurements using a <b>graticule</b> is relatively limited; better instruments sometimes have movable bright markers on the trace that permit internal circuits {{to make more}} refined measurements.|$|E
25|$|External <b>graticules</b> also {{protect the}} glass {{face of the}} CRT from {{accidental}} impact. Some CRT oscilloscopes with internal <b>graticules</b> have an unmarked tinted sheet plastic light filter to enhance trace contrast; this also serves to protect the faceplate of the CRT.|$|R

25|$|A third {{model is}} the geoid, a more complex and {{accurate}} representation of Earth's shape coincident with what mean sea level would be {{if there were no}} winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped <b>graticule</b> would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's <b>graticule.</b> Normally the geoid is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the undulation of the geoid amounting to less than 100m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3millionm Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the geoid are used to project maps from.|$|E
25|$|Some {{oscilloscopes}} have cursors, {{which are}} lines {{that can be}} moved about the screen to measure the time interval between two points, or the difference between two voltages. A few older oscilloscopes simply brightened the trace at movable locations. These cursors are more accurate than visual estimates referring to <b>graticule</b> lines.|$|E

25|$|The basic oscilloscope, {{as shown}} in the illustration, is {{typically}} divided into four sections: the display, vertical controls, horizontal controls and trigger controls. The display is usually a CRT or LCD panel which is laid out with both horizontal and vertical reference lines referred to as the <b>graticule.</b> In addition to the screen, most display sections are equipped with three basic controls: a focus knob, an intensity knob and a beam finder button.|$|E
25|$|These include {{controls}} for the delayed-sweep timebase, which is calibrated, and often also variable. The slowest speed is several steps {{faster than the}} slowest main sweep speed, although the fastest is generally the same. A calibrated multiturn delay time control offers wide range, high resolution delay settings; it spans the full duration of the main sweep, and its reading corresponds to <b>graticule</b> divisions (but with much finer precision). Its accuracy is also superior {{to that of the}} display.|$|E

Tempest pilots continued to use either the Type I Mk.III reflector gunsight, which projected the sighting <b>graticule</b> directly onto the windscreen, or the Mk.IIL until just after the Second World War, when the gyro gunsight was introduced in Tempest IIs.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. — In this paper, {{the surface}} {{bounding}} the anomalous masses at depth has been discussed. Different methods and techniques for such studies are used, ranging from <b>graticules</b> to the non-linear optimisation techniques {{making use of}} high-speed computers for the complete solution of the given problems, after {{a great number of}} iterations. The determined surface is in harmonic relation with those computed upon analyzing the vertical magnetic intensity anomalies in this region...|$|R
50|$|A {{vectorscope}} is {{a special}} type of oscilloscope used in both audio and video applications. Whereas an oscilloscope or waveform monitor normally displays a plot of signal vs. time, a vectorscope displays an X-Y plot of two signals, which can reveal details {{about the relationship between}} these two signals. Vectorscopes are highly similar in operation to oscilloscopes operated in X-Y mode; however those used in video applications have specialized <b>graticules,</b> and accept standard television or video signals as input (demodulating and demultiplexing the two components to be analyzed internally).|$|R
50|$|Telescopic sights for {{tanks were}} adopted before World War II, and these sights usually had {{a means of}} aiming off for target {{movement}} and <b>graticules</b> marked for different ranges. Tank sights were of two general types. Either the sight was in fixed alignment with the {{axis of the bore}} with ranges marked in the sight, and the gunner laid the range mark on the target. Or during laying the gunner physically set the range to offset the axis of the bore from the axis of the sight by the correct amount and laid using the centre mark in the sight.|$|R
25|$|The <b>graticule</b> is {{a grid of}} squares {{that serve}} as {{reference}} marks for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.|$|E
25|$|In {{an analog}} oscilloscope, the {{vertical}} amplifier acquires {{the signal to}} be displayed. In better oscilloscopes, it delays them by {{a fraction of a}} microsecond, and provides a signal large enough to deflect the CRT's beam. That deflection is at least somewhat beyond the edges of the <b>graticule,</b> and more typically some distance off-screen. The amplifier has to have low distortion to display its input accurately (it must be linear), and it has to recover quickly from overloads. As well, its time-domain response has to represent transients accurately—minimal overshoot, rounding, and tilt of a flat pulse top.|$|E
25|$|Two {{levels of}} {{abstraction}} {{are employed in}} the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a <b>graticule</b> on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.|$|E

Subsequently another big challenge was put up to CSIO to enter into state-of-art technology for avionic cockpit display systems (Head Up Display (HUD)) for Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) and Hindustan Jet Trainer (HJT 36) aircraft.

40|$|AbstractVisualising {{computational}} {{simulation models}} of solid state physical systems {{is a hard}} problem for dense lattice models. Fly-throughs and cutaways can aid viewer understanding of a simulated system. Interactive time model parameter updates and overlaying of measurements and <b>graticules,</b> cluster colour labelling and other visual highlighting cues can also enhance user intuition of the model’s meaning. We present some graphical and simulation optimisation techniques and various graphical rendering and explanatory techniques for computational simulation models such as the Ising model in 2 and 3 dimensions. In addition to aiding understanding of conventional algorithms such as Metropolis Monte Carlo, we try to visualise cluster updates to the system using algorithms like that of Wolff. We also explore ways to visualise path-length shortening and other changes to the Ising system when small-world link rewiring {{is applied to the}} system. We use a combination of OpenGL visualisation software and General Purpose Computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) with the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and consider ways to accelerate both the simulation itself as well as the graphical rendering to make an interactive system of model system sizes that are large enough to be challenging and visually interesting...|$|R
40|$|The (, DFA) {{project is}} {{presented}} below. The surname maps {{are based on}} German fixed network telephone lines (in 2005) with German postal districts as <b>graticules.</b> In our project, we use this data to explore the areal variation in lexical (e. g., 'Schröder/Schneider' ‘tailor’) as well as phonological (e. g., 'Hauser/Häuser/Heuser') and morphological (e. g., patronyms such as 'Petersen/Peters/Peter') aspects of German surnames. German surnames emerged quite early on and preserve linguistic material which is up to 900 years old. This enables us to draw conclusions from today’s areal distribution, e. g., on medieval dialect variation, writing traditions and cultural life. Containing not only German surnames but also foreign names, our huge database opens up possibilities for new areas of research, such as surnames and migration. Due to the close contact with Slavonic languages (original Slavonic population in the east, former eastern territories, migration), original Slavonic surnames make up the largest part of the foreign names (e. g., '–ski' 16, 386 types/ 293, 474 tokens). Various adaptations from Slavonic to German and vice versa occurred. These included graphical (e. g., 'Dobschinski' < 'Dobrzynski') as well as morphological adaptations (hybrid forms: e. g., 'Fuhrmanski') and folk-etymological reinterpretations (e. g., 'Rehsack' < Czech 'Režak') ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} work {{presented at}} the Nordic Symposium on Digital Pathology 2014, Linköping, Sweden. Systematic random sampling (SRS) is a stereological tool, which provides a framework to quickly build an accurate estimation {{of the distribution of}} objects or classes within an image, whilst minimizing the number of observations required. RandomSpot is a web-based tool for SRS in stereology, which systematically places equidistant points within a given region of interest on a virtual slide. Each point can then be visually inspected by a pathologist in order to generate an unbiased sample of the distribution of classes within the tissue. Further measurements can then be derived from the distribution, such as the ratio of tumor to stroma. RandomSpot replicates the fundamental principle of traditional light microscope grid-shaped <b>graticules,</b> with the added benefits associated with virtual slides, such as facilitated collaboration and automated navigation between points. Once the sample points {{have been added to the}} region(s) of interest, users can download the annotations and view them locally using their virtual slide viewing software. Since its introduction, RandomSpot has been used extensively for international collaborative projects, clinical trials and independent research projects. So far, the system has been used to generate over 21, 000 sample sets, and has been used to generate data for use in multiple publications, identifying significant new prognostic markers in colorectal, upper gastro-intestinal and breast cancer. Data generated using RandomSpot also has significant value for training image analysis algorithms using sample point coordinates and pathologist classifications...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Three {{successive}} {{stages in}} the representations of the visual image are studied by compu-tations from the best available data. The results are embodied in projections, drawn automatically. These projections {{are related to the}} assessment of visual disability and the dimensions of lesions in the retina and visual pathway. Fields can be assessed visually with the aid of <b>graticules</b> or directly during computerised perimetry. The complexity and variability of perimetric data present a serious obstacle to progress in ophthal-mology owing to the difficulty in summarising or comparing field changes and assessing visual disability. It has therefore often been proposed that different parts of the visual field should be assigned a specific weighting so that a quantitative score could be obtained by calculation or planimetry. '- 4 Although some of these methods have won a well deserved popularity, they are based on the clinical judgment of their proposers or on surveys of professional opinion and have the disadvantage that an infinite number of alternative arbitrary proposals can be made. The merits of any one may remain forever a matter of opinion. It seems obvious therefore that there are some virtues attached to methods of quantification which are related to functional properties and dimensions of the visual system and determined by rigorous procedures. The transformations which the visual image undergoes before it arrives as an encoded pattern of neural events in the cerebral cortex include 3 distinct stages which can be related to perimetric quantification. The image begins in environmental space, when it may be considered to be equally distributed over the solid angle subtended at the pupil by the visual field. It is projected on to the retina already subject to a relative compression of the peripheral regions, and finally in the visual pathways and striate cortex the foveal region has achieved its greatly enhanced representation. Surprisingly, none of these stages is proportionately displayed on th...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{acquired}} {{property in the}} Tamar Valley prompted the research, Mapping ruderality: heading for design. With ownership comes a natural inclination to make change, to imprint one’s mark on the land. In order to inform decision‐making and to maximize understanding of this new place called home, my research maps the cultural and natural phenomena of the site and its surrounds as a direct response to prevailing concerns. Working at the interface of art and design, one informs the other, setting the conditions for change. Although {{the focus is on}} a particular parcel of land – a ruderal landscape of dilapidated timber sheds and rampant blackberries, neglected for many years since its pioneering, productive past – the modus operandi (mapping and hermeneutics) may be applied more generally. Inspired, in part, by landscape architect James Corner, hermeneutics is presented as a means to counter the demise of substantive landscape design. The evolving art of mapping, from navigation to conceptualisation, is considered through its complementary parts – scale, projection, triangulation, toponomy, grids. Together, mapping and hermeneutics interpret the microcosm of the former orchard and its extended relationships in the valley. Traditional cartography has influenced the method which often presents as phenomenological or absorptive mapping. Hermeneutic enquiry allows for open interpretation, for an understanding of the whole by reference to its individual parts, and vice versa. Overall, the works constitute a ‘bringing to attention’ of site conditions, which we are compelled to modify and control (owning, naming, limiting, exploiting). The process is informed predominantly by the works of Janet Laurence, Maya Lin, Fujiko Nakaya, Anne Wilson and Julie Mehretu, all of whom offer new readings of landscape as an expression of ideas and a way into design. An alternative cartographic practice which infuses rational, detached observation with the subjectivity of experience takes cues from the ruderal state to engage with current issues in land use and design, and augments the tradition of map‐making in place‐making. <b>Graticules</b> and rhumb lines of individual works converge in a larger exploratory grid to reveal the distortions, biases, influences and ambiguities that are inherent in the project of mapping. Together hermeneutics and mapping locate the research specifically here, and, at a remove, should be comprehended as (anywhere) there...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>graticule</b> on the {{ellipsoid}} {{is constructed}} {{in exactly the}} same way as on the sphere. The normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre, except for points on the equator or at the poles, but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane. The terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishing: ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{select the}} {{horizontal}} {{speed of the}} CRT's spot as it creates the trace; this process is {{commonly referred to as}} the sweep. In all but the least-costly modern oscilloscopes, the sweep speed is selectable and calibrated in units of time per major <b>graticule</b> division. Quite a wide range of sweep speeds is generally provided, from seconds to as fast as picoseconds (in the fastest) per division. Usually, a continuously-variable control (often a knob in front of the calibrated selector knob) offers uncalibrated speeds, typically slower than calibrated. This control provides a range somewhat greater than that of consecutive calibrated steps, making any speed available between the extremes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{isometric}} latitude is conventionally denoted by [...] (not {{to be confused}} with the geocentric latitude): it is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal Mercator projection and the Transverse Mercator projection. The name [...] "isometric" [...] arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of [...] and longitude [...] give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively. The <b>graticule</b> defined by the lines of constant [...] and constant , divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares (of varying size). The {{isometric latitude}} is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude, tending to infinity at the poles. The conventional notation is given in Snyder (page 15): ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>graticule</b> {{is formed}} by the lines of {{constant}} latitude and constant longitude, which are constructed {{with reference to the}} rotation axis of the Earth. The primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the Earth intersects the reference surface. Planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians; and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through Greenwich (the Prime Meridian) defines the longitude: meridians are lines of constant longitude. The plane through the centre of the Earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the Equator. Planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude; these are the parallels. The Equator has a latitude of 0°, the North Pole has a latitude of 90° North (written 90°N or +90°), and the South Pole has a latitude of 90° South (written 90°S or −90°). The latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point: the normal {{to the surface of the}} sphere is [...] along the radius vector.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} of an arbitrary point (φ,λ) {{on the standard}} <b>graticule</b> can also be identified in terms of angles on the rotated graticule: φ′ (angle M′CP) is an effective latitude and −λ′ (angle M′CO) becomes an effective longitude. (The minus sign is necessary so that (φ′,λ′) {{are related to the}} rotated <b>graticule</b> {{in the same way that}} (φ,λ) are related to the standard <b>graticule).</b> The Cartesian (x′,y′) axes are related to the rotated <b>graticule</b> in the same way that the axes (x,y) axes are related to the standard <b>graticule.</b>|$|E
