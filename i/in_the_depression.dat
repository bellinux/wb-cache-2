5|$|Edward speculated {{heavily in}} real estate, and {{gradually}} lost the family's wealth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> {{that followed the}} Panic of 1873. When Louis was seven, the family lost their home, moving to Saratoga, New York, with help from Eliza's family. Edward's health collapsed, but he nonetheless {{took a job as}} a reporter for a Saratoga newspaper, later purchasing a small Democratic paper of his own, The Saratoga Sun. Louis's health, in contrast, improved during his teenage years, allowing him to leave the house more often and consider attending Yale University. On his way to a cousin's wedding rehearsal, he suffered a bicycle accident in which he fell into gravel, permanently scarring his face. Ultimately, the dual obstacles of his still-questionable health and finances caused him to abandon his university ambitions and instead take a job with his father's paper.|$|E

5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park.

Lassen Peak is situated at a center from which many of these glaciers originated. Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly everything <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Depression,</b> causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|Seething {{beneath the}} surface of American life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Depression</b> was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked {{hysteria}} in films such as Gabriel Over the White House (1933), The Mayor of Hell (1933), and American Madness (1932). Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression. The Bonus Army protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} began {{a movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, the depression ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression,</b> and broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression {{was nothing more than a}} swirl of low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} {{becoming}} a depression on September20, strong wind shear caused convection to diminish. However, data from an ASCAT scatterometer pass revealed that the system attained gale-force winds, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> being upgraded to a tropical storm on 0000 UTC September21. Operationally, the first advisory on storm was not issued until 1200 UTC, where it was named Georgette. Meanwhile, thunderstorm activity increased {{near the center of}} the storm. Little change took place throughout the day as the storm approached Baja California Sur. Around 1800UTC, Georgette made landfall near San Jose del Cabo with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Additionally, a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg) was measured. Shortly before entering the Gulf of California, Georgette weakened to a tropical depression. Maintaining winds of 35mph (55km/h), the storm later made a second landfall near San Carlos in Sonora. Shortly after moving inland, the low-level circulation dissipated over the mountains of western Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Along the Western front these began quite early {{after the}} war and {{continued}} for several decades, dropping in number in the mid-1920s, when interest in the war temporarily diminished, and again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Depression</b> years of the early 1930s. Flemish pilgrimages to Belgium graves, particularly the heldenhuldezerkjes, and memorials began in 1919, continuing through the subsequent decades. The Ossuary at Verdun was the centre for many veterans pilgrimages in the 1920s, one of the better known groups being the Fêtes de la Bataille, which travelled to the site to undertake a vigil, processions and lay wreaths. These pilgrimages were typically low-key and avoided military symbolism or paraphernalia. Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit; the Ypres League was established by veterans, and sought to transform the horrors of trench warfare into a purifying spiritual quest. The Menin Gate memorial became a focal point for British pilgrims to the Western front after it was opened in 1927. Pilgrims could come long distances: in the 1920s Canadians began to journey to Vimy and Australians began visiting Gallipoli from 1925 onwards, bringing back military souvenirs relics.|$|E

5|$|South India is a {{peninsula}} in {{the shape}} of an inverted triangle bound by the Arabian Sea on the west, by the Bay of Bengal on the east and Vindhya and Satpura ranges on the north. The Narmada river flows westwards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau. The Western Ghats run parallel along the western coast and the narrow strip of land between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea forms the Konkan region. The Western Ghats continue south until Kanyakumari. The Eastern Ghats run parallel along the eastern coast and the strip of land between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal forms the Coromandel region. Both the ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains. The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges, extending on to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>depression</b> around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

40|$|A 50 : 50 {{blend of}} {{polystyrene}} (PS) and poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA) {{has been characterized}} with an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) in Tapping Mode and with force-distance curves. The polymer solution has been spin-coated on a glass slide. PnBMA builds a uniform film on the glass substrate with a thickness of @ 200 nm. On top of it, the PS builds an approximately 100 nm thick film. The PS-film undergoes dewetting, leading {{to the formation of}} holes surrounded by about 2 µm large rims. In those regions of the sample, where the distance between the holes is larger than about 4 µm, light <b>depressions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PS film can be observed. Topography, dissipated energy, adhesion, stiffness and elastic modulus have been measured on these three regions (PnBMA, PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rims and PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressions).</b> <b>The</b> two polymers can be distinguished in all images, since PnBMA has a higher adhesion and a smaller stiffness than PS, and hence a higher dissipated energy. Moreover, <b>the</b> polystyrene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>depressions</b> shows a very high adhesion (approximately as high as PnBMA) and its stiffness is intermediate between that of PnBMA and that of PS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rims.
