50|$|For {{much of its}} {{production}} run, the Mark Series was nearly distinguished within the Ford Motor Company divisional hierarchy. Following the discontinuation of the Continental Division in 1957, the vehicles would remain marketed within the Lincoln dealer structure.

2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 140 series in 1966, Volvo used a tri-digit system for their cars. The first number was the series, the second number {{the number of}} {{cylinders}} and the third number the number of doors; so a 164 was a 1-series with a six-cylinder engine and four doors. However, there were exceptions to this rule – the 780 for example, came with turbocharged I4 and naturally aspirated V6 petrol engines and I6 diesel engines, but never an eight-cylinder, as the [...] "eight" [...] would suggest. Similarly, the 760 often was equipped with a turbocharged I4 engine, and the Volvo 360 only had four cylinders. Some 240GLT had a V6 engine. The company dropped {{the meaning of the}} final digit for later cars like the 740, but the digit continued to identify cars underhood on the <b>identification</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E

50|$|What {{started as}} a legal {{business}} with a viable model soon turned into large-scale fraud; in reality, FlowTex had only produced 181 machines that were sold multiple times, with the certificates and <b>identification</b> <b>plates</b> manipulated according to the scam. At one point, the same machine was paraded at various different fake construction sites to potential investors during the same inspection; it later emerged that they had moved the machine from one location to another during lunch breaks. Over a period of ten years or so, they secured loans worth more than two billion Euros for non-existent drilling systems and the scam is widely tipped as Germany’s largest ever case of white-collar crime.|$|R
50|$|Suspected unapproved {{parts are}} those {{aeronautical}} parts {{that should be}} deemed unairworthy and are therefore not eligible for installation on an aircraft or another aeronautical product because their design, manufacture or distribution is in conflict with aviation regulations. This means that such a part may not have an approved design, may be manufactured by an unapproved manufacturer, distributed by an unapproved distributor, possibly even taken from scrap aircraft while bypassing mandatory and costly shop inspection and recertification processes. Indicators for an unapproved or bogus part may reach from missing, incomplete or counterfeit certification, missing or manipulated <b>identification</b> <b>plates,</b> physical aspects like surface grain structure, shape, colour, or weight deviating from the removal part, to any indicators of poor workmanship {{as well as a}} suspiciously low purchase price.Suspected unapproved parts shall be reported to the national aviation authority.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A fast {{algorithm}} for {{image classification}} {{based on a}} computationally efficient operator forming a semigroup on real numbers is developed. The new operator does not require any multiplications. The co-difference matrix based on the new operator is defined and an image descriptor using the co-difference matrix is developed. In the proposed method, the multiplication operation of the well-known covariance method is replaced by the new operator. The proposed method is experimentally compared with the regular covariance matrix method. The proposed descriptor performs {{as well as the}} the regular covariance method without performing any multiplications.

40|$|Abstract. Design and {{implement}} a car license <b>plate</b> <b>identification</b> system with the applications of Viola and Jones algorithm. This algorithm {{which is based on}} the AdaBoost method is trained and optimized for the best performance using large database of car license plate images. The final license <b>plate</b> <b>identification</b> system obtained a cascade of classifiers consisting of 8 stages with 1310 Haar-like features. Once the license plates have sufficient visibility and there are no other objects similar to the plate in images, this system operates perfectly and shows high correct identification rate with low false positive rate. And as integral image allows the Haar-like features to be calculated very fast, the system also finished the identification rapidly...|$|R
50|$|For {{items that}} are {{under the control of}} the Department of Defense and subject for marking, there are many {{specifications}} that must be met for a proper mark.

Additionally, the marking may even be applied directly to the surface of the item itself - provided of course it can still meet the requirements described below.|$|E

5000|$|When a German {{military}} aircraft emerged from its production plant, {{it was given}} a four-letter Stammkennzeichen code (factory radio code), which was an individual aircraft's radio code before it entered service and staying with the aircraft throughout its entire existence. This format was also usually used for prototype aircraft {{if they did not}} bear a German national [...] "D-xxxx" [...] style civil registration. The entire Stammkennzeichen was usually on the fuselage sides, and also often repeated on the undersides of both wings, with the four letters spread out along the entire wing's under-surfaces. The code could also be placed on such things as the manufacturer's <b>identification</b> <b>plate,</b> and sometimes even the compass correction card for a particular aircraft.|$|E
40|$|The TREK Automated Reading and Incubation System (ARIS 2 X®) {{has been}} {{tailored}} to automate {{the reading of}} Sensititre susceptibility and <b>identification</b> <b>plates</b> with data archiving and report generation via data management software. This study focused on verifying the accuracy of Sensititre MIC trays incubated and read automatically by the ARIS 2 X ® {{for a variety of}} clinical isolates. Susceptibility results were compared to those obtained with either the Vitek Legacy, Pasco frozen microdilution panels, the E-test gradient diffusion method, or combinations of these methods for 401 clinical isolates comprising multiple genera and antimicrobial resistant patterns. Gram-negative identifications were evaluated using Sensititre GNID panels. In general the ARIS 2 X ® performed well demonstrating an overall agreement of 98 % with the other methods. A total of 26 categorical errors were noted with the ARIS 2 X®, including 19 (0. 5 %) minor errors, 1 (0. 03 %) major error, and 6 (0. 8 %) very major errors. The ARIS 2 X®-Sensititre platform can be used to accurately determine susceptibility profiles of most clinical isolates, including fastidious bacteria,thus eliminating the need to maintain multiple ancillary susceptibility methods.

40|$|Studies on the {{survival}} of species are essential to understanding their biology and to developing effective conservation and management plans. This study aimed {{to determine the best}} model to explain {{the survival}} of the species Melocactus conoideus on the basis of time, density, age structure and habitat location, as well as to describe the interactions among those factors. The study was conducted in three M. conoideus habitat patches in the municipality of Vitória da Conquista, in the state of Bahia, Brazil, only one of which was within a "conservation unit" (protected area). In each patch, we selected 120 specimens of M. conoideus, which were marked with <b>identification</b> <b>plates</b> and classified by developmental stage and density. The survival of those individuals was monitored for a period of one year. The overall survival of M. conoideus was 87. 5 % and was found to correlate with the month, {{as well as with the}} interaction between the factors Patch and Density. Our results show that {{the survival of}} M. conoideus individuals is related to the intrinsic characteristics of each habitat patch and suggest that more areas should be set aside for the conservation of this species...|$|R
