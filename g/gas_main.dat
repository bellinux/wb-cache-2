5|$|Digging {{the tunnel}} {{turned out to}} be more {{difficult}} than expected. The soil was rocky, which forced the men to dig deeper than planned. There, they discovered a leaking <b>gas</b> <b>main,</b> which required the installation of special pumps to bring fresh air to the men. To hide the noise from the digging, one of the crew played piano and sang in the house while the others worked below. On July5, Berkman visited the prison stable, planning to make his escape. He was horrified to discover that the entrance was blocked by a large load of stones and bricks recently dumped for a construction project.|$|E
5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. <b>Gas</b> <b>main</b> supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas street lighting. The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 November 1923, a slight misjudgement {{at the end of}} the tunnel {{enlargement}} work left the tunnel unstable near Borough. A collapse on the same day, caused when a train hit temporary shoring near Elephant & Castle, filled the tunnel with wet gravel. Later a <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> exploded, causing a water main to break and leaving a water-filled crater in the middle of the street. The line was briefly split in two, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
40|$|EP 983965 A UPAB: 20000412 NOVELTY - A {{secondary}} gas stream is {{injected into the}} <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream in a mixing chamber at an angle of 10 - 170 deg. to the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream. The flow cross-section of the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream before the injection site of the {{secondary gas}} stream into the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream is reduced {{in such a way}} that the flow speed of the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream is increased. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Production of dinitrogen pentoxide comprises: (a) forming ozone containing a <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream; (b) forming nitrogen dioxide containing a secondary gas stream; (c) injecting the secondary gas stream into a <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream; (d) feeding the total gas stream formed through a flow reactor in which nitrogen dioxide reacts with the ozone; and (e) removing the dinitrogen pentoxide formed. The secondary gas stream is injected into the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream in a mixing chamber at an angle of 10 - 170 deg. to the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream. The flow cross-section of the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream before the injection site of the secondary gas stream into the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream is reduced {{in such a way that}} the flow speed of the <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> stream is increased.

While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{development}} and improvement of the London Underground, meant that Victoria could not compete as a cross-London service. GNR trains stopped running on 1 October 1907, with Midland ones following on June the next year. The GWR ceased to use the station for scheduled services on 21 March 1915, partly due to World War I {{in addition to the}} new Underground lines. Victoria was used as the main station for drafted soldiers, and those returning from action in the war. By the middle of the war, the station served twelve trains a day running between Victoria and Folkestone, with additional trains serving Dover. The station was regularly served with a voluntary buffet for departing soldiers, who served up to 4,000 men a day. Victoria itself did not suffer significant damage during the war, but a section of Grosvenor Bridge was destroyed after an anti-aircraft shell struck a <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> underneath it.|$|E
5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a <b>gas</b> <b>main.</b> The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E
5000|$|The gas {{condensate}} {{from the high}} pressure separator flows through a throttling control valve to a low pressure separator. The reduction in pressure across the control valve causes the condensate to undergo a partial vaporization referred to as flash vaporization. The raw natural gas from the low pressure separator is sent to a [...] "booster" [...] compressor which raises the gas pressure and sends it through a cooler, {{and then to the}} <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> compressor. The <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> compressor raises the pressure of the gases from the high and low pressure separators to whatever pressure is required for the pipeline transportation of the gas to the raw natural gas processing plant. The <b>main</b> <b>gas</b> compressor discharge pressure will depend upon the distance to the raw natural gas processing plant and may require a multi-stage compressor.|$|R

500|$|As {{darkness}} fell at {{the close}} of Adlertag, Sperrle sent nine Kampfgruppe 100 (Bombing Group 100) He 111s to conduct a strategic bombing raid against the Supermarine Spitfire factory at Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. Despite the group being a specialist night strike unit which had high expertise in night navigation, only four of the crews found their targets. The eleven [...] bombs dropped were not sufficient to disrupt fighter production. Around five of the 11 fell inside the compound. Casualties were small as workers had gone to shelter. Serious damage was done only to offices and a tool room, while a <b>gas</b> <b>main</b> was fractured. Another group, led by Gruppenkommandeur Hauptmann (Captain) Friedrich Achenbrenner, dispatched 15 He 111s from bases in Brittany across the Irish Sea to strike at the Short Brothers factory at Queen's Island, Belfast Northern Ireland. Five Short Stirling aircraft were destroyed.kg 27 also took part in the missions, and bombed Glasgow during the night although their specific target is unclear. Other bombers, commencing the night stage of Adlertag, resolutely flew the length and breadth of Great Britain, bombing Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, Liverpool, Sheffield, Norwich, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Very little damage was done, though some rail tracks were cut temporarily and around 100 casualties were suffered. It is unknown if any German aircraft were lost.
