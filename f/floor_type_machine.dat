40|$|AbstractRam {{is a very}} {{important}} component of super-heavy-duty computer numerical control (CNC) <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> boring-milling <b>machine,</b> and deformation of ram is a significant source causing errors in machining process. To compensate the deformation error of super-heavy-duty CNC <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> boring-milling <b>machine,</b> based on force analysis theory, the law and compensation measures of deformation of ram are researched. Based on the principle of torque (force) balance of the ram components, the formulas of compensation forces and compensation torques are derived, the relations between compensation forces (compensation torques) and the stroke distance of the ram are given. According to theoretical analysis results and the structural characteristics of super-heavy-duty CNC <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> boring and milling machine of TK 6932, rods compensation, hydrostatic pressure compensation and wire rope compensation measures are taken to compensate the deformation error of ram. The experiments and computer simulation results show that the straightness of the ram at its overhanging end meets the national machinery industry standards...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study the effect of density and <b>floor</b> <b>types</b> on performance, physiological state and immune response of broilers. The research involved 368 male broilers of the New Lohman strain aged 8 days which were raised up to 35 days at different densities and <b>floor</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>types</b> consisted of rice hull litter and bamboo slat were used as the main plot; while densities of 7, 10, 13 and 16 birds/m 2 applied as the sub-plot. The results showed that the final body weight gain of the 35 -day Lohmann broilers at densities of 7, 10 and 13 birds/m 2 were 28. 22, 24. 43 and 19. 27 kg respectively, compared to 16 birds/m 2 at 13. 53 kg (P> 0. 05). Broilers in the bamboo slats floor had lymph weight at 3. 73 g compared to the litter floor at 2. 55 g (P< 0. 05). Also, broilers in the bamboo slats had average RHL (0. 65) lower than broilers in the litter floor (0. 79).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} <b>floor</b> <b>types</b> on the {{incidence}} of feather follicle infection and breast blisters in caged broilers was investigated in two trials. Broilers were reared on corn-soybean meal diets with warm-room brooding. <b>Floor</b> <b>types</b> included litter (control), wire, wire covered with vari-ous types of plastic mats, and wire woven with surgical tubing. In trial 1, {{the effect of a}} coccidio-stat (monensin, 120 mg/kg of feed) was investigated for broilers not on litter, and in trial 2, the effect of supplemental zinc was investigated. Broilers were processed in the laboratory processing plant when they were 51 (trial 1) and 53 days old (trial 2). Carcasses were evaluated for the occurrence of fleshing downgrades, crooked keels, feather follicle infection, and breast blisters. Incidence of feather follicle infection was low for broilers on litter or wire floor and high for broilers reared on plastic mats. Breast blister inci-dence was low for broilers on litter and plastic mats and was high for broilers on the wire floor. Overall carcass quality for litter (control) was superior to any of the cage treatments. Neither the coccidiostat nor supplemental zinc affected {{the incidence of}} breast blisters or feather follicle infection.

40|$|The {{influence}} of physical {{stress on the}} plasma concentration of the acute-phase proteins serum amyloid-A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) was studied in 10 calves. Two different stress levels were created by housing two groups of five calves, each on different <b>types</b> of <b>floor.</b> The stress level was assessed by studying videotapes of the animals, and, subsequently, by quantifying the problems related with moving across the pens and the time the calves spent lying down and standing. Plasma concentrations of Hp, SAA, aldolase, and cortisol were measured in blood samples obtained by jugular venepuncture. Plasma SAA concentrations were significantly (p< 0. 001) elevated in animals housed on the <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> associated with {{the highest level of}} physical stress, although the concentrations were within the normal range for healthy adult cattle. Hp concentrations were not elevated. The <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> did not alter the stress related biochemical variables aldolase and cortisol. It is concluded that plasma SAA concentrations rise upon physical stress, whereas Hp concentrations do not change. The absence of a significant difference in aldolase or cortisol concentrations indicates that the difference in the level of neuro-endocrine stress between the animals housed on the two <b>floor</b> <b>types</b> is only minimal. Consequently, SAA is suggested to be a sensitive variable to assess physical welfare in calves. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to study the effect of cage <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> (wire and litter) and sex ratio on fertility, hatchability and dead embryo of quail. The materials used were 24 male and 84 female quails aged 60 days old. The method of research was experiment which was arranged factorially (2 x 4) with Randomized Block Design (RBD). The first factor was the <b>type</b> of cage <b>floor</b> which was wire and litter. The second factor was the sex ratio which was 1 : 2, 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5. The variables were fertility, hatchability, and dead embryo. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and if there were significant differences among the treatments it would be continued with Duncan Multiple Range Test. The results showed that cage <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> had no effect (P> 0. 05) on fertility with the average of 80 ± 8, 78 to 81 ± 5, 37 %, hatchability with the average of 82, 6 ± 2, 46 to 82, 93 ± 2, 74 %, and dead embryo with the average of 17, 06 ± 2, 74 to 17, 37 ± 2, 46 %. Sex ratio had highly significant effect (P 0, 05) on hatchability (79, 78 to 85, 79 %) and dead embryo (14, 21 to 20, 21 %). There was no interaction effect (P> 0. 05) between the cage <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> and sex ratio. The conclusion on breeding quail can be used two <b>type</b> of cage <b>floor</b> i. e. litter or wire floor. The sex ratio influenced egg fertility, a higher sex ratio produced lower fertility. It was suggested that in quail‘s breeding practices could be used both <b>floor</b> <b>type</b> of cage which were wire or litter floor, with sex ratio 1 male and 4 female quails.

One of factors that influence incidence of ARI is house environment. This study aimed to determine the relationship bertween house environment with acute respiratory infections (ARI) incidence in coastal communities in Lapulu Village, Subdistrict of Abeli 2014. This study is analytical observational with cross sectional study design. The sample size was 88 samples by applying proportional sampling technique. The independent variable were household crowding, natural ventilation, natural lighting, humidity, <b>floor</b> <b>type,</b> wall type and location of the kitchen. The data were analyzed by using chi-square test. The result at significance level α = 0, 05 showed that there is relationship between household crowding (p-value = 0, 000, CC = 0, 415), natural ventilation (p-value= 0, 000, CC= 0, 394), natural lighting (p-value= 0, 001, CC= 0, 330), and humidity (p-value= 0, 015, CC= 0, 250) with ARI incidence.
