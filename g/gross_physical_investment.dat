The result showed that the variables of labor absorption, minimum wages, and education level simultaneously affected the rates of real wages in Indonesia significantly. The variables of labor absorption and minimum wages partially found affected the real wages rates positively and significantly, whilst the variable of education level partially affected the real wages rates in Indonesia negatively and significantly. On the structural equation of labor absorption, variable of real wages rates, GDP, <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> and price changes simultaneously affected significantly the labor absorption in Indonesia.

40|$|I {{study the}} time series {{predictability}} of aggregate R&D <b>investment</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> for future stock market returns in a dynamic equilibrium model with production.

I propose a model in which R&D investment drives an embodiedtechnological change to physical capital production. Therefore R&D investment reduces marginal cost of <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> hence future <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return is increasing in R&D <b>investment.</b> <b>Physical</b> capital production is diminishingmarginal-returns in <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> so future <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return is decreasing in <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> In the model stock return is a weighted average of <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> return and R&D <b>investment</b> return.

It is demonstrated that their results do not hold, after extending the sample that matches their criteria by including more time periods and/or more firms. Namely, {{it is found that}} the Granger causality between R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> occurs both ways. It is also shown that their contemporary relationship, derived by dynamic simultaneous expressions, is positive in both ways, from current R&D to current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and from current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> to current R&D. Moreover, previous R&D affects current <b>physical</b> <b>investment,</b> and previous <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> also affects current R&D. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the hypothesis by Hall (1992) who claims that firms prefer to use debt to finance <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> but not R&D, due to the risky nature of R&D. Employing a dynamic simultaneous approach and R&D Master File, the relationship between debt, R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> is reestimated with the full sample and two sub-samples, including firms in all industries, in science-based industries, and in nonscience-based industries, respectively. First, {{the results show that}} the contemporary relationship between R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> is positively reciprocal, particularly in science-based industries. That is, current R&D positively affects and is positively affected by current <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> Second, it is shown that, in (non-) science-based industries, current R&D (raises) lowers current debt and current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> raises current debt; and that current debt raises current <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and (raises) reduces R&D. In other words, the evidence supports that debt is a resource to finance both <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> and R&D in nonscience-based industries, but debt is only a resource to finance <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> but not R&D in science-based industries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{tests the}} production-based asset pricing model (PCAPM) using industry-level data. Specifically, I examine the pricing {{relationship}} between <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns and equity returns by testing the hypothesis (spanning assumption) that the payoff space of <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> spans the payoff space of financial securities. Instead of following {{the traditional approach}} of testing a linear <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> factor pricing model, I propose a new testing procedure based on entropic principles and no-arbitrage constraints. The proposed nonparametric method recovers and compares the state price densities for <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns and equity returns. The new testing procedure has two main advantages over the traditional approach. First, the new method is consistent with no-arbitrage conditions while the traditional approach leads to a stochastic discount factor that may take negative values. Second, the new method alleviates the joint hypothesis test problem suffered by the traditional approach. I apply the proposed procedure to the following six industries: mining, construction, manufacturing, transportation, communication, and public utilities. The empirical {{results show that the}} state price density recovered from <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> returns is able to correctly price the corresponding equity returns. This provides supporting evidence that the spanning assumption holds at the cross-industry level. Furthermore, this study highlights the fact that <b>physical</b> capital <b>investment</b> conveys important information for pricing financial securities. Hence, to explain both the time series and the cross-sectional variations in equity returns, it is useful to develop models that explicitly address the impact of key production characteristics on financial asset pricing...|$|R

As expected from the stock market efficiency hypothesis, q, the stock market one period holding rate of return, is exogenous relative to the other three variables (or Granger causes them). As postulated in the traditional accelerator model of investment, the rate of growth of sales, s, can be also treated as exogenous to the rates of growth of R&D and <b>physical.</b> <b>investment,</b> r and i. Moreover, no strong feed- back interaction is detected between the last two (r and i). Within the simple structure of the extended accelerator model, the substantive conclusion is that R&D and <b>physical</b> <b>investment</b> react very similarly to the growth of the sales and to movements in q; the response of R&D is, however, more stable or less irregular than that of <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> Expected demand and expected profitability thus both appear to be important determinants for R&D expenditures and <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> ...|$|R

We model reform as a change in policy which induces agents to close existing enterprises using old technologies of production and to open up new enterprises adopting new technologies of production. The central idea of our paper is that it is costly to close old enterprises and open new enterprises because, in doing so, information capital built up about old enterprises is lost and time must pass before information capital about new enterprises can be acquired. Thus, an acceleration of the pace of industry evolution leads in the short run to a net loss of information capital, a drop in productivity, a recession, and a fall in <b>physical</b> <b>investment.</b> We calibrate our model of industry evolution, information capital, and transition to match micro data on industry evolution in the United States and macro data from the United States, Japan, and the former communist countries of Europe.
