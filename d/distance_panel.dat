Our empirical modelling strategy employs a probabilistic test statistic for convergence {{based on the}} percentage of unit root rejections among all state house price differentials. Using a sieve bootstrap procedure, we construct confidence intervals and find evidence in favour of convergence.

30|$|The {{critical}} Reynolds {{number of}} each ball decreases {{with the number}} of panels, i.e. it decreases from the Roteiro to the Teamgeist II to the Jabulani. Furthermore, the extended total <b>distance</b> of the <b>panel</b> bonds decreases {{with the number of}} panels. The new Tango 12 ball has 32 panels; therefore, its extended total <b>distance</b> of <b>panel</b> bonds will increase, and its critical Reynolds number will be {{similar to that of the}} 32 -panel Roteiro ball (r[*]=[*] 0.9). Achenbach (1974) reported that an increase in the roughness of the spherical surface decreases the critical Reynolds number. From these points, it can be concluded that the roughness of the ball surface increases with the extended total <b>distance</b> of <b>panel</b> bonds, causing the critical Reynolds number to decrease. In terms of roughness, the panel surface of the Roteiro is relatively smooth; the Teamgeist II has small protuberances; the Jabulani has small ridges; and the Tango 12 has small grip textures. Generally, the critical Reynolds number of a sphere decreases as the surface roughness increases. The critical Reynolds number of the Roteiro was lower than that of the Jabulani despite the panel surface of the Roteiro being relatively smoother than that of the Jabulani. The ‘small designs’ on the soccer ball panels appeared to play a small role in this experiment (see Additional file 1). Therefore, the critical Reynolds number of a soccer ball, as considered within the scope of this experiment, may depend on the extended total <b>distance</b> of the <b>panel</b> bonds rather than the small designs on the panel surfaces.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} the risk management decision for an original dataset of North American gold mining firms. We propose explanations based on the firm's financial characteristics, managerial risk aversion and internal corporate governance mechanisms. We develop a theoretical model in which the debt and the hedging decisions are made simultaneously. Our model suggests that more hedging does not always lead to a higher debt capacity when the firm holds a standard debt contract, while hedging is an increasing function of the firm's financial distress costs. We then test the predictions of our model. To estimate our system of simultaneous Tobit equations, we extend, to panel data, the minimum distance estimator proposed by Lee (1995). We obtain that financial distress costs, information asymmetry, separation between the posts of CEO {{and chairman of the}} board positions and managerial risk aversion are important determinants of the decision to hedge whereas the composition {{of the board of directors}} has no impact in such decision. Also, our results do not support the conclusion that firms hedge in order to increase their debt capacity which seems to confirm our model's prediction.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} response and radiation from an acoustically loaded aircraft panel is presented. In the experiment, the panel is excited by a normally incident, harmonic wave. Measurements of the panel response and the resulting transmitted pressure are made in both the near- and acoustic far-fields. The numerical computations model the experiment and in particular account for the full coupling between the panel and the surrounding three dimensional acoustic fluid. The results demonstrate that for a sufficiently high excitation level, the panel response becomes nonlinear. The nonlinearity {{is characterized by the}} appearance of harmonics and subharmonics in the power spectral densities of the panel motion and consequently in the resulting acoustic radiation. The primary characteristic of the far-field acoustic radiation is the increase in harmonic content relative to the fundamental and subharmonics with increasing <b>distance</b> from the <b>panel.</b> This is shown to be a result of linear and weakly nonlinear wave propagation effects.

40|$|A {{new water}} {{deionization}} method was conceived and investigated. Bench scale reactors were designed and tested. Numerical analysis of ion movement in {{water in the}} presence of electrical, hydraulic, and chemical gradients was conducted. The new water treatment technology uses bicomponent fibers (BCF). Ions in water are concentrated near charged bicomponent fibers. Bicomponent fibers are composed of two materials. The outer annulus is made of nylon and has an inside diameter of 10 mum and outer diameter of 50 mum. The inner annulus is composed of carbon powder and has an outer diameter of 10 mum. For the bench scale reactors, approximately one kilometer length of fibers was wrapped around a series of plastic panels and placed in a plexiglass container containing sodium nitrate solution. The ends of the fibers were covered with electrically conductive epoxy and connected to a DC power supply. In experiments which lasted up to 96 h., the solution showed up to 50 percent decrease in nitrate concentration after the power supply was applied. Preliminary studies indicated that <b>distance</b> between <b>panels,</b> polarity of panels and voltage magnitude influenced observed concentration. Two one dimensional analytical solutions and finite element solutions for two dimensions were derived for no flow condition between parallel plates. For the first finite element model, the continuity, Navier-Stokes, and species equations were solved for solute concentration with rectangular coordinates. For the second model, Poisson-Boltzmann equations were included in a finite element scheme. The models were applied to irregular-shaped bodies and the finite element solutions were compared with analytical solutions. The solutions for Poisson-Boltzmann equations were obtained for both linearized and non-linear forms. Boundary conditions included no chemical reactions and no transport across boundaries. The formulations did not solve for concentration in bicomponent fiber reactors because insufficient data and knowledge of the bicomponent fiber process is available. However, future numerical models of the bicomponent fiber treatment process may be based on solutions derived in this research...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} argued and {{regularly}} found that cultural distance is {{negatively related to}} bilateral export flows, which are the sum of arm’s length and intra-firm exports. However, these macro-level studies overlook the firm-level insights that arm’s length exports are a substitute for arm’s length affiliate sales, and that firms’ choices between these substitutes are influenced by cultural distance. Moreover, intra-firm exports are a complement to arm’s length affiliate sales and hence likely to respond {{in the same way}} to cultural distance as such sales. The inclusion of intra-firm exports in export flows has thus obscured the effect of cultural distance on aggregate arm’s length exports. We overcome these conceptual and methodological deficiencies by examining how cultural distance influences aggregate arm’s length exports, while simultaneously considering its impact on aggregate arm’s length affiliate sales. Drawing on several strands of firm-level international business (IB) research, we argue that while arm’s length affiliate sales are likely to decline with cultural distance, this is not necessarily the case with arm’s length exports, whichmay in fact increase with cultural <b>distance.</b> Analyzing a <b>panel</b> dataset of US foreign affiliate sales and US exports to unaffiliated parties, we find that cultural distance negatively affects arm’s length affiliate sales but positively affects arm’s length exports.
