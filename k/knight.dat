5|$|After the war <b>Knight</b> {{returned}} to her previous themes of the ballet, the circus and Gypsies, and continued to divide her time between London and Malvern. In 1948 <b>Knight</b> painted backstage at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, mostly observing {{the work of the}} wardrobe department, still working under austerity restrictions. The same year she painted a large group portrait of Princess Elizabeth and several civic dignitaries opening the new Broadgate Centre in Coventry. A period of illness affected her work on this commission, and, despite Knight's repainting large parts of the canvas, the finished painting was not well received. A major exhibition of over eighty works by <b>Knight</b> was held at the Ian Nicol Gallery in Glasgow, in 1952. The following year <b>Knight</b> {{returned to}} the theatre, painting and producing crayon studies, backstage at the Old Vic in London during the Birmingham Repertory Theatre's production of Henry IV, Part 1 & Part 2.
