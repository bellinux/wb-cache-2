Throughout the album, West touches on a number of different issues drawn from his own experiences and observations, including organized religion, family, sexuality, excessive materialism, self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, and personal struggles. Music journalist Kelefa Sanneh wrote, [...] "Throughout the album, Mr. West taunts everyone who didn't believe in him: teachers, record executives, police officers, even his former boss at the Gap". West explained, [...] "My persona is that I'm the regular person. <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> whatever you've been through in the past week, and I have a song about that on my album." [...] The album was musically notable for West's unique development of his [...] "chipmunk soul" [...] production style, in which R and soul music samples were sped up and pitch shifted.|$|E

He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender, identified via discussion of the friendship between Bianca and Natalie. Girls viewed Natalie more favourably than Bianca in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in [...] "girl-culture" [...] – attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public – manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a [...] "nice person" [...] in contrast to Bianca, [...] " [...] can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> herself [...] ", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women.|$|E

He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope.

The males regarded Bianca as a [...] "saucy cow", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that [...] "such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down."

On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you <b>just</b> <b>think</b> <b>about,</b> it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
