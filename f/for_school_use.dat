Compare cost per student <b>for</b> <b>schools</b> <b>using</b> the program to the cost per student <b>for</b> <b>schools</b> not <b>using</b> the program. 3.

2500|$|During the case, creationists {{worked on}} a creationist biology textbook, {{with the hope of}} a huge market if the appeal went their way. Drafts were given various titles, {{including}} Biology and Creation. After the Edwards v. Aguillard ruling, the authors changed the terms [...] "creation" [...] and [...] "creationists" [...] in the text to [...] "intelligent design" [...] and [...] "design proponents", and the book was published as Of Pandas and People. This supplementary textbook <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>use</b> attacked evolutionary biology without mentioning the identity of the supposed [...] "intelligent designer". Promotion of intelligent design creationism by the intelligent design movement eventually led to the textbook's use in a school district being challenged in another court case. Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District went to trial on 26 September 2005, and was decided in U.S. District Court on 20 December 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139-page opinion of Kitzmiller v. Dover was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research. Because the Dover school board chose not to appeal, the case never reached a circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

6000|$|This physics {{course would}} cover an {{experimental}} quantitative {{treatment of the}} electric current, it would glance in an explanatory way at many of the phenomena of physical geography, {{and it would be}} correlated with a study of the general principles of chemistry. A detailed knowledge of chemical compounds is not a part of general education, it keeps better in reference books than in the non-specialized head, and it is only the broad conceptions of analysis and combination, and of the relation of energy to chemical changes, that have to be attained. Beyond this, and the application of map drawing to give accurate ideas and to awaken interest in geography and history, it is open to discussion whether any Fact subject need be taught as schooling at all. Ensure the full development of a man's mental capacity, and he will get his Fact as he needs it. And if his mind is undeveloped he can make no use of any fact he has. The subject called [...] "Human Physiology" [...] may be at once dismissed as absurdly unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>use.</b> One is always meeting worthy people who [...] "don't see why children should not know something about their own bodies," [...] and who are not apparently aware that the medical profession after some generations of fairly systematic inquiry knows remarkably little. Save for some general anatomy, it is impossible to teach school-children anything true about the human body, because the explanation of almost any physiological process demands a knowledge of physical and chemical laws much sounder and subtler than the average child can possibly attain. And as for botany, geology, history, and geography (beyond the range already specified), these are far better relegated to the school library and the initiative of each child. Every child has its specific range of interest, and its specific way of regarding things. In geology, for example, one boy may be fascinated by the fossil hunting, another will find his interest in the effects of structure in scenery, and a third, with more imagination, will give his whole mind to the reconstruction of the past, and will pore over maps of Pleistocene Europe and pictures of Silurian landscape with the keenest appreciation. Each will be bored, or at least not greatly interested, by what attracts the others. Let the children have an easily accessible library--that is the crying need of nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand schools to-day, a need every school- seeking parent may do something to remedy--and in that library let there be one or two good densely illustrated histories, illustrated travels, bound volumes of such a publication as Newnes' Wide World Magazine (I name these publications haphazard--there are probably others as good or better), Hutchinson and Co.'s Living Animals of the World, the Rev. H. N. Hutchinson's Extinct Monsters, the Badminton volumes on big game shooting, mountaineering, and yachting, Kerner's [...] "Botany," [...] collections of [...] "The Hundred Best Pictures" [...] sort, collections of views of towns and of scenery {{in different parts of the}} world, and the like. Then let the schoolmaster set aside five hours a week as the minimum for reading, and let the pupils read during that time just whatever they like, provided only that they keep silence and read. If the schoolmaster or schoolmistress comes in at all here, it should be to stimulate systematic reading occasionally by setting a group of five or six pupils to [...] "get up" [...] some particular subject--a report on [...] "animals that might still be domesticated," [...] for example--and by showing them conversationally how to read with a slip of paper at hand, gathering facts. This sort of thing it is impossible to reduce to method and system, and, consequently, it is the proper field for the teacher's initiative. It is largely in order to leave time and energy for this that I am anxious to reduce the more rigorous elements in schooling to standard and text-book.|$|E
