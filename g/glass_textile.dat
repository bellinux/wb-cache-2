40|$|AbstractJute textile {{reinforced}} polymer {{composite system}} {{was developed and}} its tensile, flexural behaviour was characterised and {{compared with that of}} carbon textile (CFRP) and <b>glass</b> <b>textile</b> (GFRP) reinforced polymer composite. As India {{is one of the largest}} producers of jute, hence its potential application in many branches of engineering should be developed. In the present work the efficacy of jute textile reinforced polymer composite (JFRP) as compared to CFRP and GFRP for the flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete beams was compared by carrying out bending test on reinforced concrete beams in three groups of fourteen beams. The work carries out the study of failure modes, flexural strengthening effect on ultimate load and load deflection behaviour as well as the deflection ductility study of RC beams bonded externally with JFRP, CFRP and GFRP, wrapped in U configuration in single layer, along the entire length of the beam in full wrapping and strip wrapping technique. The results depicted that JFRP, CFRP and GFRP, strengthening improved the ultimate flexural strength of the RC beams by 62. 5 %, 150 % and 125 %, respectively, with full wrapping technique and by 25 %, 50 % and 37. 5 %, respectively with strip wrapping technique. JFRP strengthening displayed highest deformability index and proved that jute textile FRP material has huge potential as a structural strengthening material...|$|E
40|$|The Aveston Copper and Kelly (ACK) Method {{has been}} {{routinely}} used in estimating {{the efficiency of}} the bond between the textile and cementitious matrix. This method however has a limited applicability due to the simplifying assumptions such as perfect bond. A numerical model for simulation of tensile behavior of reinforced cement-based composites is presented to capture the inefficiency of the bond mechanisms. In this approach the role of interface properties which are instrumental in the simulation of the tensile response is investigated. The model simulates the tension stiffening effect of cracked matrix, and evolution of crack spacing in tensile members. Independent experimental results obtained from literature are used to verify the model and develop composite tensile stress strain response using alkali resistant (AR) <b>glass</b> <b>textile</b> reinforced concrete. The composite stress strain response is then used with a bilinear representation of the composite obtained from the tensile stiffening model. The closed form and simplified equations for representation of flexural response are obtained and used for both back-calculation and also design. A method based on the average moment-curvature relationship in the structural design and analysis of one way and two way flexural elements using yield line analysis approaches is proposed. This comprehensive approach directly shows the interrelation of fundamental materials characterization techniques with simplified design equations for further utilization of textile reinforced concrete materials...|$|E
40|$|An {{innovative}} strengthening {{technique is}} {{applied for the}} first time in this study to provide flexural strengthening in two-way reinforced concrete (RC) slabs supported on edge beams. The technique comprises external bonding of textiles on the tension face of RC slabs through the use of polymer-modified cement- based mortars. The textiles used in the experimental campaign comprised fabric meshes made of long stitch-bonded fibre rovings in two orthogonal directions. The specimens measured 2 x 2 m in plan and were supported on hinges at the corners. Three RC slabs strengthened by textile reinforced mortar (TRM) overlays and one control specimen were tested to failure. One specimen received one layer of carbon fibre textile, another one received two, whereas the third specimen was strengthened with three layers of glass fibre textile having the same axial rigidity (in both directions) with the single-layered carbon fibre textile. All specimens failed due to flexural punching. The load-carrying capacity of the strengthened slabs was increased by 26 %, 53 %, and 20 % over that of the control specimen for slabs with one (carbon), two (carbon) and three (<b>glass)</b> <b>textile</b> layers, respectively. The strengthened slabs showed an increase in stiffness and energy absorption. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions based on existing models specifically developed for two-way slabs and the performance of the latter is evaluated. Based on the findings of this work the authors conclude that TRM overlays comprise a very promising solution for the strengthening of two-way RC slabs...|$|E
