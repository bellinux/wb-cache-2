40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} foreign exchange rate exposure of a large nonfinancial firm based on proprietary internal data including cash flows, derivatives and foreign currency debt, as well as external capital market data. While {{the operations of the}} multinational firm have significant exposure to <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> due to foreign currency-based activities and international competition, corporate hedging mitigates this gross exposure. The analysis illustrates that the insignificance of foreign exchange rate exposures of comprehensive performance measures such as total cash flow can be explained by hedging at the firm level. Thus, the residual net exposure is economically and statistically small, even if the operating cash flows of the firm are significantly exposed to exchange rate risk.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a model of}} a risk-averse multinational firm facing risk exposure to a foreign currency cash flow. Forward markets do not exist between the firm's own currency and the foreign currency, but do exist for a third currency. Because a triangular parity condition holds among these three currencies, the available forward markets, albeit incomplete, provide a useful avenue for the firm to indirectly hedge against its <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> exposure. This article offers analytical insights into the optimal cross-hedging strategies of the firm. In particular, the results show that separate unbiasedness of the forward markets does not necessarily imply a perfect full hedge that eliminates the entire <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> exposure of the firm. The optimal cross-hedging strategies depend largely on the firm's marginal utility function and on the correlation of the random spot exchange rates. Â© 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many Indonesian banks suffered problems and some even failed in the early 1990 s. This provided evidence that risk-based capital adequacy regulation in Indonesia had failed to prevent banks from taking excessive risks. Such observations provide the motivation for this thesis which seeks to identify the nature of bank risks in Indonesia and also analyses the operation of risk-based capital adequacy regulation in Indonesia. To obtain a general view of risk in Indonesian banks, this thesis includes an empirical study to identify the determinants of problem banks in Indonesia using a logit fixedeffect model. The model {{also can be used}} as an "early warning" device in banking supervision. This study finds that credit risk and operational risk contributed significantly to banking problems. State banks, non-foreign exchange banks and regional development banks are shown to be also sensitive to interest rate risk. <b>Foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> is less significant for banks (by group) in Indonesia. If we examine cases individually, however, there were some bank failures which were due to excessive <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk.</b> This thesis also finds that the adoption of risk-based capital adequacy regulation in Indonesia contains some deficiencies, such as focusing only on credit risk (ignoring market risk). This study suggests that market risk should be included in capital adequacy assessment and a number of alternative models of risk assessment [exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) and generalised autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH) ] are analysed. The results of the empirical study show that the inclusion of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> in capital adequacy assessment results in a higher capital requirement than that resulting from the application of the BIS's standardised methodology. This study also finds that the decay factor of 0. 94 suggested by J. P. Morgan (J. P. Morgan, 1995, 1996) is irrelevant for [DR (Indonesian Rupiah) exchange rate returns. Additionally, assessment of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> using GARCH suggests a lower capital charge than that applicable under the BIS's standardised methodology and EWMA.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Economics)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The current {{international}} monetary system {{is very different from}} that of a few decades ago. Many of the old restrictions that had been placed on currency and capital movements between countries have fallen away in favour of a much more liberal international payment and investment system. The global financial arena is now characterized by greater currency instability, volatility and heightened financial <b>risks.</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>risk</b> is one of the complex topics in the economic world. Since there are so many factors in the financial market that influence a country's currency value, it becomes very risky for importers, exporters and portfolio investors {{to be involved in the}} international trade and financial markets. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding on how the major economic indicators have an impact on the decision-making of the importers, the exporters and investors, to further influence the volatility of the Rand; and to provide various hedging and arbitraging strategies to reduce <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risks.</b> The layout of the study is based on six chapters.

Drawing on real interest rate data for 18 OECD countries for the period 1985 - 2008, persistent deviations from the world interest rate that cannot be explained by movements in the real exchange rate are documented.

40|$|Bank borrowers'' {{currency}} mismatches often {{result from}} unhedged foreign currency borrowing in economies {{where there is}} significant dollarization, exposing the financial sector to disguised credit risk. In the absence of standard tools or guidelines to counteract this risk, countries have resorted to outright regulatory limits in cases of moderate dollarization and to undesirable exchange controls in other cases.

Such a rule would help internalize the corresponding risks for banks and their borrowers in line with internationally accepted prudential and accounting standards.

It does so by explicitly developing a model which incorporates <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>risk</b> into the objective function of the firm and tests the model on cross-sectional data over the years 1974 to 1977 for investment in both developed and less developed countries. These are the only years for which data on all crucial variables are available. In all cases the risk aversity hypothesis was substantiated and the same model was appropriate for both developed and less developed countries.

40|$|We study some {{properties}} {{of a new}} continuous-time model for financial time series which is driven by a class of L'evy processes instead of a Brownian motion. This model emerged from extensive empirical investigations. We discuss path {{properties of}} the driving process and aspects of the valuation of derivatives. 1. Introduction Risk management based on quantitative methods has become a new challenge for the financial industry. On the one hand the heightened scrutiny on capital requirements forces financial institutions to implement risk management systems. On the other hand management itself as well as shareholders have a vital interest that sound models are used to drive business and strategy decisions. The accuracy of risk measurement depends crucially on how key risk factors such as equity prices, interest <b>rates,</b> indices, <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> default <b>risk,</b> and volatilities are modeled. Most of the models used at present are based on Brownian motion as the driving process. [...] ...|$|R
