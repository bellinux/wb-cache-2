The instrument has two nested channels and a postacceleration between the electrostatic and <b>E</b> <b>bar</b> x B bar analyzers for wide ranges {{of energy and}} mass responses. It is noted that the dual-channel construction not only doubles the data acquisition rate but also permits {{a reversal of the}} electrostatic field orientation in the inner channel for lighter ions. The outer channel is then optimized for ions of medium to high mass numbers, resulting in increased mass resolution for such heavy ions. When combined with a cylindrical <b>E</b> <b>bar</b> x B bar analyzer, a 90 -deg-deflection angle spherical electrostatic analyzer provides an extremely wide viewing angle.

Two satellite datasets indicate a positive trend (first time derivative) in global available energy from 1983 to 2006, suggesting that positive trends in evaporation may occur in "wet" regions where energy supply limits evaporation. However, decadal trends in evaporation estimated from water balances of 110 wet catchments ((<b>E)</b> over <b>bar</b> (wb)) do not match trends in evaporation estimated using three alternative methods: 1) (<b>E)</b> over <b>bar</b> (MTE), a model-tree ensemble approach that uses statistical relationships between E measured across the global network of flux stations, meteorological drivers, and remotely sensed fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation; 2) (<b>E)</b> over <b>bar</b> (Fu), a Budyko-style hydrometeorological model; and 3) (<b>E)</b> over <b>bar</b> (PML), the Penman-Monteith energy-balance equation coupled with a simple biophysical model for surface conductance.

The numerical simulations are divided into two main sections, i. <b>e.</b> <b>bar</b> calibration and conventional SHPB testing.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of meandering rivers are quasi-regular ridges of the point bar, evidence of a pulsed lateral migration of meander bends. Scroll bars formed on the inner bend are preserved on the point-bar surface as a series of ridges as meanders migrate, and in the subsurface of the point bar as inclined heterolithic stratification with lateral accretion surfaces. It is necessary to understand the formation and sedimentary architecture of these point bars, which are fundamental geomorphic building blocks of meandering rivers and potential reservoirs for water, oil, and gas. However, it remains unresolved whether the scroll-bar pattern forms in response to outer bend bank erosion during floods (i. e., bank pull), or is forced by bank progradation (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>bar</b> push). Here we use experimentally formed meandering rivers with a set of static and migrating bends to isolate the effects of sediment supply to the point bar, bank protection, and forced bank retreat. We find that channel widening caused by bank retreat near the bend apex causes deposition of new scroll ridges along the inner bend point bar, whereas scroll bars cannot be forced by sediment pulses. Thus channel width variations along meander bends cause bank pull, which is necessary for scroll-bar formation. Furthermore, we find that each newly attached scroll bar overlies a nonpermeable layer of finer-grained sediment caused by the temporary flow expansion, which explains the fining-upward tendency of point bars...|$|E
40|$|Time {{and length}} scales of beach {{variability}} have been quantified using 16 years of beach surveys sampled at the Army Corps of Engineers' Field Research Facility, {{located on the}} U. S. Atlantic coast. Between 50 % and 90 % of the bathymetric variability at this site was explained by alongshore-uniform response over the approximately 1 km alongshore span of the surveys. Although the incident wave height variance was dominated by frequencies at or higher than 1 cycle/yr, more than 80 % of the bathymetric variance at all cross-shore locations was explained by frequencies < 1 cycle/yr. Interannual cycles consisting of sandbar formation, migration, and decay contributed to the low-frequency variability. The observed behavior {{can be explained by}} a simple, heuristic model. The model assumes that bars migrate toward a wave height dependent equilibrium position. This position was shown to coincide with the wave “breakpoint. ” Additionally, the rate of bar response is taken to be variable and was empirically determined to be proportional to the wave height cubed. The net effect of a variable response rate is to shift the expected long-term mean sandbar position offshore, toward the equilibrium position associated with the largest waves. The model explained up to 80 % of the observed bar position time series variance and up to 70 % of the variance of bar crest velocity time series, which were extracted from three different sandbars. Characteristic bar response times (related to the inverse of the response rate) were found to be long relative to the characteristic timescale of the forcing (1 year in our case). As a result, transient response (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>bar</b> position far from equilibrium) tended to persist for many cycles of the forcing. Transient bar behavior appears in the observations when bars formed near the shoreline or when outer bars decayed and inner bars faced a changed wave climate. While the present model is able to explain the evolution of these transients, it does not contain a mechanism for their introduction...|$|E

This study investigates the effect caused by plastic and cementitious spacers, and steel wire chairs combined with different aggregate sizes, curing and conditioning regimes on the transport properties, microstructure and chloride-induced corrosion of concrete structures. Concrete cylindrical samples were prepared with 25 and 50 mm high plastic, steel and cementitious spacers. Samples were then cured, conditioned and tested for oxygen diffusivity, oxygen permeability, water sorptivity and chloride diffusivity. Selected samples were pressure impregnated with fluorescent epoxy to study the extent and spatial distribution of epoxy intrusion. The interfacial zone between the spacer and concrete was examined using field-emission scanning electron microscope in the backscattered electron (BSE) mode. The ingress of chloride, particularly near the interface between spacers and concrete matrix was studied using micro X-ray fluorescence (μXRF). The effect of plastic and cementitious spacers on chloride- induced corrosion via capillary rise and cyclic wetting/drying was investigated using small reinforced concrete beams. The feasibility of improving the bond between spacer and concrete by increasing surface roughness of plastic spacers was also investigated. Results show that concrete samples containing plastic spacers consistently gave the least resistance to transport and the highest epoxy penetration followed by samples with cementitious spacers, and then steel spacers. The control samples (samples without spacers) had the highest resistance to transport in all cases. The epoxy penetration occurred mainly through the spacer-concrete interface. The microstructure of the spacer-concrete interface showed significantly lower cement content and higher porosity compared to 'bulk paste' farther away form the interface. Higher penetration of chloride ions was detected along spacer-concrete interface compared to the control sample or the bulk paste farther away. It is evident that spacers initiate early corrosion and this may reduce the service-life of reinforced concrete structures. The implications of these findings on durability of concrete structures are discussed. Several recommendations to improve the bond at the interface between spacer and concrete are presented.

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{was conducted}} {{to gain a better}} theoretical understanding of the contribution of outcome expectancies to male undergraduate drinking behaviour. Two assumptions important to the construct validity of outcome expectancies were investigated: (1) outcome expectancies are situation-specific and (2) outcome expectancies are different from attitudes toward drinking.;In each of the four studies conducted in the first series of studies, environmental setting (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>bar</b> vs. lab) was manipulated and a second variable was manipulated through instructional set. Specifically, expected beverage content (i. e., beer vs. soda pop), social context (i. e., alone, with friends, no explicit instructions), and level of intoxication (i. e., early vs. latter) was manipulated in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 respectively. In Experiments 1 through 3, 2 ̆ 2 weighted 2 ̆ 2 outcome expectancies (i. e., likelihood x valence ratings) were assessed using {{a modified version of the}} Alcohol Effects Questionnaire, REQ-Revised (Rohsenow, 1983). Experiment 4 was a partial replication of Experiment 3, however, a modified version of the Alcohol Effects Scale, AES-Revised (Southwick, Steele, Marlatt, 2 ̆ 6 Lindell, 1981) was administered. Evidence for the situational-specificity hypothesis was obtained only in Experiment 4 in which the AES-Revised was employed.;In Experiment 5, the contribution of outcome expectancies (as assessed by both the REQ-Revised and the AES-Revised) to the Theory of Reasoned Action-TRA (Ajzen 2 ̆ 6 Fishbein, 1980) and the Theory of Planned Behaviour-TPB (Ajzen, 1988) was investigated. Overall, the TPB was superior to the TRA in predicting self-report excessive consumption episodes among male undergraduates. Outcome expectancies, as assessed by the AES-Revised, did not make a unique contribution to the TPB. In contrast, weighted expectancies for Enhanced Sexual Functioning (as assessed by the REQ-Revised) improved the prediction of self-report excessive monthly drinking episodes, over and above components of the TPB.;Three tentative conclusions are drawn. First, two types of outcome expectancies may exist: generalized and situation-specific. Secondly, investigations that examine the sole contribution of outcome expectancies to drinking behaviour may be too narrow in their approach. Finally, the TPB is a useful theoretical framework to explore both the construct validity of outcome expectancies and how these processes contribute to drinking behaviour...|$|E
