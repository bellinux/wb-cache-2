40|$|PACSInternational audienceThe {{production}} of residual nuclei in p + Fe collisions has been measured at GSI on the FRS facility {{by means of}} the reverse kinematic techniques at 300, 500, 750, 1000 and 1500 MeV/A. The cross-sections larger than 0. 01 mb of all isotopes with Z larger than 8 have been obtained. Velocity distributions were also measured. Comparisons to models describing spallation reactions and some empirical formulae often used in astrophysics are presented. These data are directly used to calculate <b>impurety</b> production and DPAs in a thin window as foreseen in spallation sources or accelerator-driven system...|$|E
40|$|The C 2 Π {{state of}} BaF has been excited by lines of an argon-ion laser. BaF {{molecules}} were produced in a heat-pipe in which barium was heated to 1000 °C m {{the presence of}} argon at a pressure of 1 Torr, fluorine appearing as an <b>impurety.</b> The induced emission was studied m the ranges 8500 to 9500 and 19 400 to 20 300 cm- 1. The spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform spectrometer at a resolution of about 0. 027 cm- 1. In these conditions we observe in emission the C 2 Π → X 2 Σ+ system in the visible region, and also fluorescence in the infra-red, which is assigned to C 2 Π → H' 2 C. This 2 Ɗ state is the third member, now found for the first time, of the d-complex whose other components are A 2 Π and B 2 Σ+. Until a more rational scheme is introduced, the new state will be labelled H' : the analogous state in BaH is labelled H, but this letter has already been used for a high-lying state in BaF...|$|E
