50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Weber {{switched}} from her early Pop aesthetic to Photorealist techniques. Working from photographs and slides of New York City, she made highly detailed paintings of <b>fruit-stands</b> (Bluebird, 1972), trash and litter (Heineken, 1976), which would become her dominant themes {{over the next}} several years. Weber became a leading member of the Photorealist movement and formed friendships with Duane Hanson, Robert Cottingham, Richard Estes, John DeAndrea, John Salt, and Ralph Goings, among others.|$|R
60|$|Every one {{was eager}} to do something; and, as the men stood at ease, the people mingled freely with them, {{offering}} gifts, hearty grips of the hand, and hopeful prophecies of victory in the end. Irresistibly attracted, my boy Tom and I drew near, and soon, becoming excited by the scene, ravaged the <b>fruit-stands</b> in our neighborhood for tokens of our regard, mingling candy and congratulations, peanuts and prayers, apples and applause, in one enthusiastic jumble.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of his life, Santiago Rusiñol put {{together}} a considerable collection of ceramics which today is concentrated mainly in two of the rooms {{on the ground floor of}} the Cau Ferrat, the Kitchen/Dining-room and the Sala del Brollador. Here the visitor will find a varied selection of more than 200 items ranging from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth century, mainly plates and dishes, but also bowls, pharmaceutical jars, washbasins, <b>fruit-stands,</b> pitchers, soup tureens and various tiled panels.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not only}} out of business, but I'm {{out of a}} home, Plums. You see, when I sold the <b>fruit-stand</b> of course I hadn't any right to count on sleepin' there, an'--" ...|$|E
60|$|After {{travelling}} {{several blocks}} I slackened my pace and {{dropped into a}} rapid walk. Coming to a <b>fruit-stand,</b> I invested {{in a couple of}} bananas, and then asked its proprietor where Hallock Street was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{see when}} I went into the <b>fruit-stand</b> I sold out my rights 'round the City Hall, to Dan Fernald, an' it wouldn't be the square {{thing for me to}} jump in down there ag'in." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of the Rialto Bridge, the market was {{preparing}} for the purchasers. Butchers were arranging their shops; <b>fruit-stands,</b> and stands for the sale of crockery, and--as I must say for want of a better word, if there is any--notions, were in a state of tasteful readiness. The person on the steps of the bridge who had exposed his stock of cheap clothing and coarse felt hats on the parapet, had so far completed his preparations as to have leisure to be talking himself hot and hoarse with the neighboring barber. He was in a perfectly good humor, and was merely giving a dramatic flavor to some question of six soldi.|$|R
6000|$|He admired each {{district}} {{along his}} familiar {{route to the}} office: The bungalows and shrubs and winding irregular drive ways of Floral Heights. The one-story shops on Smith Street, a glare of plate-glass and new yellow brick; groceries and laundries and drug-stores to supply the more immediate needs of East Side housewives. The market gardens in Dutch Hollow, their shanties patched with corrugated iron and stolen doors. Billboards with crimson goddesses nine feet tall advertising cinema films, pipe tobacco, and talcum powder. The old [...] "mansions" [...] along Ninth Street, S. E., like aged dandies in filthy linen; wooden castles turned into boarding-houses, with muddy walks and rusty hedges, jostled by fast-intruding garages, cheap apartment-houses, and <b>fruit-stands</b> conducted by bland, sleek Athenians. Across the belt of railroad-tracks, factories with high-perched water-tanks and tall stacks-factories producing condensed milk, paper boxes, lighting-fixtures, motor cars. Then the business center, the thickening darting traffic, the crammed trolleys unloading, and high doorways of marble and polished granite.|$|R
40|$|Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius L., Polygonaceae) is an agronomically {{important}} {{perennial weed}} causing decreases in pasture yields and fodder quality. Non-chemical control measures for dock are often limited to frequent pulling and cutting, additionally {{it is usually}} avoided by grazing animals. Here, the regeneration of R. obtusifolius in a Rumex-infested grassland grazed by a sheep breed that explicitly feeds on dock (Ovis aries L. cv. East Prussian Skudden) was compared to cutting. Therefore, regeneration of 90 R. obtusifolius plants of three different size classes was monitored in three plots during three grazing and cutting cycles. Plant height and number of <b>fruit-stands</b> of regrown R. obtusifolius was significantly lower, number of leaves significantly higher after grazing than after cutting, while plant diameter was unaffected. Initially medium and large-sized plants (> 40 cm diameter) were significantly more sensitive to grazing or cutting than initially smaller sized plants. Soil nitrate and ammonium concentrations {{in the vicinity of}} R. obtusifolius correlated with some regrowth parameters but were not affected by grazing or cutting. Sheep-grazed grassland communities comprised fewer legumes (p= 0. 002), more grasses (p= 0. 010) and fewer sward gaps (p= 0. 025) than cut grassland. At the end of the experiment, abundance of R. obtusifolius in sheep grazed plots was lower than in cut plots (p= 0. 089) suggesting that regrowth potential of this weed was depleted by continuous grazing and higher sward density. In conclusion, these data suggest that sheep could be considered in grassland management schemes to both directly and indirectly control Rumex infestations...|$|R
60|$|He made {{arrangements}} with Mrs. Green, whereby {{he could get}} into the house during the afternoon while she was attending to her <b>fruit-stand,</b> and by nine o'clock in the evening he had made seats enough to accommodate at least two hundred boys, providing, of course, that {{they were willing to}} stow themselves in snugly.|$|E
60|$|Ben was {{in favor}} of visiting Nelly Green, whose mother kept a <b>fruit-stand</b> on Chatham Square, and who was always to be found acting as clerk, while Johnny was anxious to visit a mutual friend by the name of Mopsey Dowd, who had risen from boot-black to the proud {{eminence}} of owning a pea-nut stand near Fulton Market.|$|E
6000|$|At eleven o'clock, agreeably to the {{appointment}} made by Ben, all the partners, except Paul, met at Mrs. Green's <b>fruit-stand,</b> wondering {{not a little}} {{as to why they}} had been summoned. Ben was there, almost bursting with importance; and when he found that all, including Mrs. Green and Nelly, were ready to listen to him, he said, as if he were again on the stage: ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{left this}} school and {{returned}} to the Toledo by one of those wonderful little side streets already mentioned, which are forever tumultuous with the oddest Neapolitan life--with men quarreling themselves purple over small quantities of fish--with asses braying loud and clear above their discord--with women roasting pine-cones at charcoal fires--with children in the agonies of having their hair combed--with degraded poultry and homeless dogs--with <b>fruit-stands</b> and green groceries, and the little edifices of ecclesiastical architecture for the sale of lemonade--with wandering bag-pipers, and herds of nonchalant goats--with horses, and grooms currying them--and over all, from vast heights of balcony, with people lazily hanging upon rails and looking down on the riot. Reëntering the stream of the Toledo, it carried us almost to the Museo Borbonico before we again struck aside into one of the smaller streets, whence we climbed quite to the top of one of those incredibly high Neapolitan houses. Here, crossing an open terrace on the roof, we visited three small rooms, in which there were altogether some hundred boys in the first stages of reclamation. They were under the immediate superintendence of Mr. Buscarlet and he seemed to feel the fondest interest in them. Indeed, there was sufficient reason for this: up to a certain point, the Neapolitan children learn so rapidly and willingly that it can hardly be other than a pleasure to teach them. After this, their zeal flags; they know enough; and their parents and friends, far more ignorant than they, are perfectly satisfied with their progress. Then the difficulties of their teachers begin; but here, in these lowest grade schools, they had not yet begun. The boys were still eager to learn, and were ardently following the lead of their teachers. They were little fellows, nearly all, and none of them had been in school {{more than a year and}} a half, while some had been there only three or four months. They rose up with [...] "Buon giorno, signori," [...] as we entered, and could hardly be persuaded to lapse back to the duties of life during our stay. They had very good faces, indeed, for the most part, and even the vicious had intellectual brightness. Just and consistent usage has the best influence on them; and one boy was pointed out as quite docile and manageable, whose parents had given him up as incorrigible before he entered the school. As it was, there was something almost pathetic in his good behavior, as being possible to him, but utterly alien to his instincts. The boys of these schools seldom play truant, and they are never severely beaten in school; when quite intractable, notice is given to their parents, and they usually return in a more docile state. It sometimes happens that the boys are taken away by their parents, from one motive or another; but they find their way back again, and are received as if nothing had happened.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's mighty bad. I {{got stuck}} on a bunch of bananas, and lost thirty-two cents last week. Then oranges went down till you couldn't hardly see 'em, an' I bought a box when they was worth two dollars. It seems like as if every Italian in the city, what ain't blackin' boots, has started a <b>fruit-stand,</b> an' it's jest knocked the eye out of business." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{friend of}} hers, whose mother kept a thread-and-needle emporium that was {{contained}} in a willow basket, and displayed to the public very near her <b>fruit-stand,</b> was skilful {{in the art of}} making paper flowers, {{and from time to time}} had presented Nelly with specimens of her skill, until everything in the house that could be pressed into service as a vase was filled with these never-fading and odorless roses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shinin'; that's blackin' boots, you know. Here's Joe, he scraped {{together}} seven dollars an' eighty-three cents, an' said to hisself that he'd be a howlin' swell, so {{what does}} he do but start a <b>fruit-stand</b> down on West Street, hire a clerk, an' go into the business in style. It didn't take him more'n two months to bust up, an' now he ain't got enough even to start in on sellin' papers, 'cause he spent it all on the princess." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ileen was a {{strictly}} vegetable compound, guaranteed under the Pure Ambrosia and Balm-of-Gilead Act {{of the year}} of the fall of Adam. She was a <b>fruit-stand</b> blonde--strawberries, peaches, cherries, etc. Her eyes were wide apart, and she possessed the calm that precedes a storm that never comes. But {{it seems to me that}} words (at any rate per) are wasted in an effort to describe the beautiful. Like fancy, [...] "It is engendered in the eyes." [...] There are three kinds of beauties--I was foreordained to be homiletic; I can never stick to a story.|$|E
60|$|The {{company were}} now ready for their arduous duties on the stage, and {{could afford the}} time to go to dinner. More than once had Mrs. Green called out to them that that very {{important}} meal was ready, and should be eaten if they expected her to get the dishes washed in time to act as door-keeper. She had also become imbued with the excitement of this first performance, and had packed away her <b>fruit-stand</b> fully two hours earlier than usual, in order that she might first feed her actor-boarders, and then look out for their interest at the door.|$|E
6000|$|An {{acquaintance}} of his {{had a large}} lot of card-board clippings, which he had gathered {{from time to time}} as he delivered papers in a printing-office, and these Ben had purchased, with the understanding that he was to give free admission to the entertainment for them during three evenings, providing, of course, that the theatre remained open to the public that length of time. From these odds and ends Nelly had cut about a hundred tickets during the afternoon while she {{was in charge of the}} <b>fruit-stand,</b> and these Ben was converting into orders for admission by printing on them, in rather a shaky hand, and with a new lead-pencil he had bought for that express purpose, the following: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no {{escaping}} the abundance. I bought a dozen chickens from a native out in the country, and the following day he delivered thirteen chickens along with a canoe-load of fruit. The French storekeeper presented us with pomegranates and lent us his finest horse. The gendarme did likewise, lending us a horse that was the very apple of his eye. And everybody sent us flowers. The Snark was a <b>fruit-stand</b> and a greengrocer's shop masquerading {{under the guise of}} a conservatory. We went around flower-garlanded all the time. When the himine singers came on board to sing, the maidens kissed us welcome, and the crew, from captain to cabin-boy, lost its heart to the maidens of Bora Bora. Tehei got up a big fishing expedition in our honour, to which we went in a double canoe, paddled by a dozen strapping Amazons. We were relieved that no fish were caught, else the Snark would have sunk at her moorings.|$|E
60|$|After Donatello {{had left}} the studio, Miriam herself came forth, and taking her way {{through some of the}} intricacies of the city, entered what might be called either a {{widening}} of a street, or a small piazza. The neighborhood comprised a baker's oven, emitting the usual fragrance of sour bread; a shoe shop; a linen-draper's shop; a pipe and cigar shop; a lottery office; a station for French soldiers, with a sentinel pacing in front; and a <b>fruit-stand,</b> at which a Roman matron was selling the dried kernels of chestnuts, wretched little figs, and some bouquets of yesterday. A church, of course, was near at hand, the facade of which ascended into lofty pinnacles, whereon were perched two or three winged figures of stone, either angelic or allegorical, blowing stone trumpets in close vicinity to the upper windows of an old and shabby palace. This palace was distinguished by a feature not very common in the architecture of Roman edifices; that is to say, a mediaeval tower, square, massive, lofty, and battlemented and machicolated at the summit.|$|E
60|$|A fat brown goose lay {{at one end}} of {{the table}} and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, {{stripped}} of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a <b>fruit-stand</b> which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.|$|E
50|$|As an {{indication}} of the popular and intellectual origins of recent Chinese nationalist sentiment, all coauthors of China Can Say No, the first in a string of defiant rebuttals to American imperialism , are college educated, and most are self-employed (a freelancer, a <b>fruit-stand</b> owner, a poet, and journalists working in the partly market-driven field of Chinese newspapers, periodicals, and television stations).|$|E
50|$|Lucinda quickly gets to know Mr. Gilligan the hansom {{cab driver}} and Patrolman M'Gonegal. The first friend {{of her own}} age is Tony Coppino, son of an Italian fruit stand owner. Lucinda enlists Officer M'Gonegal to stop the bullies who knock down Tony's father's <b>fruit-stand</b> and steal the fruit. In return Tony takes her for a city picnic where they meet a rag-and-bone man. Later Lucinda reads Shakespeare with her {{favorite}} uncle and is inspired {{to put on a}} puppet production of The Tempest.|$|E
