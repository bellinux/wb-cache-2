40|$|During radio {{frequency}} (RF) processing, geometrical {{factors such as}} distance between electrodes and projection of top electrode on the samples' exposed surface area (area that electric field passes through the sample) have a certain effect on power absorption, temperature distribution, heating rates and heating uniformity in the samples. Knowing {{the role played by}} these factors can be helpful for further studies in optimization of design parameters of an RF heating process. Therefore, to evaluate effect due to distance between electrodes and projection area during RF heating process, samples of same volume but exhibiting different projection areas were used to determine the variability in their power absorption, temperature change and heating rates. RF electrodes in this system were positioned with a fixed gap between samples' top-bottom surfaces and the electrodes and, case by case, at different distance between electrodes. The results indicated that both parameters have strong effect on power absorption, temperature distribution, heating rates and heating uniformity in the samples, which is further amplified when it is combined with the change of dielectric properties with temperature. In the investigated range, wider projection area and shorter distance between electrodes led to faster heating, in terms of average temperature, but less uniform temperature distribution, at least in the early stage of the RF heating process, before the changes in dielectric properties of the <b>heated</b> <b>load</b> started modifying the trend of the loss tangent and penetration depth. The results of this study are expected to be used in planning geometrical configuration and design parameters of RF systems and sample dimensions for further optimization studie...|$|E

A real-time <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> estimator is of interest for the process control of the cryogenic system in order to anticipate the arrival of pulsed <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> to the refrigerator and finally to optimize the operation of the cryogenic system. The large variation of the thermal loads affects the physical parameters of the supercritical helium loop (pressure, temperature, mass flow) so those signals can be used for calculating instantaneously the loads deposited into the loop.

The MAX-Wiggler {{is a cold}} bore superconducting wiggler magnet with 47 3. 5 T poles and a period length of 61 mm aimed {{for the production of}} X-rays at the 1. 5 GeV electron storage ring MAX-II at MAX-lab. This note describes the cryogenic system of the MAX-Wiggler, theoretical predictions of the <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> to the cryostat, and measured <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> at operation. The cryostat is a helium cooled bath type cryostat. The design criterion for the cryostat was to have a liquid He boil-off less than 3 1 /h, which corresponds to a <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> of 2. 1 W. The theoretical calculations predicted a <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> of 0. 87 W to the liquid He bath. Of the 0. 87 W predicted <b>heat</b> <b>load,</b> 0. 17 W was predicted to be induced by the stored beam in MAX-II, 0. 12 W from synchrotron radiation and 0. 05 W from image currents. The measured <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> to the liquid He bath is larger than predicted from the theoretical calculations and at nominal working conditions it is 1. 7 W. The measured contribution to the total <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from the stored beam of 200 mA in MAX-II is 0. 86 W, 0. 59 W from image currents and 0. 26 W from synchrotron radiation. The measured contribution from the image current is 0. 59 W, about 10 times larger than expected from the theoretical calculations, which is assumed to depend on that the Cu plating of the inner surfaces of the cold bore has a lower electrical conductivity than foreseen. The higher than expected <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from synchrotron radiation is assumed to come from a positioning error of the upstream absorber for synchrotron radiation. There is no observable increase of the <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> with the wiggler at full field. Even though the <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> are higher than expected, the design criterion of obtaining a cryostat with a liquid He boil-off inferior to 3 1 /h with 200 mA of stored current in MAX-II has been met.

A retrospective observational {{study was conducted in}} 25 predominantly Holstein-Friesian commercial dairy herds located in Australia. Associations between weather and conception rates were assessed using 16, 878 services performed over a 21 -mo period. Services were classified as successful based on rectal palpation. Two measures of <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> were defined for each 24 -h period: the maximum temperature-humidity index (THI) for the period, and the number of hours in the 24 -h period when the THI was > 72. Conception rates were reduced when cows were exposed to a high <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from the day of service to 6 d after service, and in wk - 1. <b>Heat</b> <b>loads</b> in wk - 3 to - 5 were also associated with reduced conception rates.

The influences of the effectiveness of the heat-exchangers and the heat-reservoir temperature-ratio on the <b>heating</b> <b>load,</b> the COP and the heating-load density are analyzed. The cycle performance optimizations are performed by searching the optimal distribution of heat conductance of the hot- and cold-side heat-exchangers for the fixed total heat-exchanger inventory. The influences of some design parameters, including heat-capacity rate of the working fluid, heat-reservoir temperature-ratio and heat-exchanger inventory on the optimal distribution of heat conductance, the maximum <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> and the maximum heating-load density are indicated by numerical examples. The different results obtained from the heating-load optimization and the heating-load density optimization are shown. The air heat-pump design, with heat-loading density optimization, leads to smaller size equipment.
