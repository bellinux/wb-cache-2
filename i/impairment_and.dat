40|$|Introduction: we {{have tested}} the {{hypothesis}} that the co-occurrence of common <b>impairments</b> (motor <b>and</b> cognitive <b>impairments,</b> vision <b>and</b> hearing loss, depressive symptoms) of later life have exacerbating effects on disability [activities and instrumental activities of daily living, social and role function, (in) activity]. Method: data were drawn from a community-based sample of 624 people aged 57 and older. Results: motor <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms were associated with all disability measures, even when the effects of other <b>impairments,</b> age <b>and</b> gender were controlled. This indicates independent, predominant effects of motor <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms. Although several significant first-order interaction effects (indicating exacerbation) of impairments on disability were found, they were not very strong, but vision and hearing losses exacerbate the impact of the other impairments on disability. Conclusions: impairments, particularly motor <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> depressive symptoms, largely act 'solo', by main effects on disability. Only a few combinations including vision or hearing loss further exacerbate the effects of other impairments on disability...|$|R

5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E

However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive <b>impairment</b> <b>and</b> paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{symptoms}} {{have been}} collectively ascribed to malfunctioning of dopamine-related nigro-striatal and cortico-striatal loops. However, some doubts about this proposition are raised by controversies about the temporal {{progression of the}} <b>impairments,</b> <b>and</b> whether they are concomitant or not. The present study consists of a systematic revision of literature data on both functional PD <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> dopaminergic medication effects in order to draw a coherent picture about the disease progression. It was done {{in terms of an}} explanatory model for the disruption of implicit knowledge acquisition, motor <b>and</b> cognitive <b>impairments,</b> <b>and</b> the effects of dopaminergic medication on these functions. Cognitive impairments arise at early stages of PD and stabilizes while disruption of acquisition of implicit knowledge <b>and</b> motor <b>impairments</b> are still in progression; additionally, dopaminergic medication reduces motor <b>impairments</b> <b>and</b> increases disruption of acquisition of implicit knowledge. Since this model revealed consistency and plausibility when confronted with data of others studies not included in model's formulation, it {{may turn out to be}} a useful tool for understanding the multifaceted characteristics of PD...|$|R

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive <b>impairment,</b> <b>and</b> a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal <b>impairment)</b> <b>and</b> is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
