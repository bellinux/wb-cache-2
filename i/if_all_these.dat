5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (and possibly a legion) are missing in our sources. If so, {{at least one of these}} units is likely to be a sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E

25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors. These trap large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane, which ocean warming {{has the potential to}} release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500â€“2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can be compared with the 5000 GtC estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.|$|E

This compares to a current ratio of 1km of motorway to every 6,017.32 people in Belgium. Although welcomed by many people, {{the construction of new}} motorways in Ireland has not been without controversy or opposition. In particular, the construction of the M3 motorway through the archaeologically significant Tara-Skryne valley (or Gabhra) near Tara has led to protests and calls for protection of its landscape from many, including Pat Wallace, Director of the National Museum of Ireland, and other prominent figures in Ireland and other countries. The Smithsonian Institution in the US has placed the Hill of Tara archaeological complex on its list of endangered cultural treasures {{as a result of the}} M3's construction.|$|E
500|$|In 1969 the UK {{television}} channel ITV televised a Christmas special recorded by Thames Television; entitled [...] "Carry On Christmas", it was watched by over eight million viewers. [...] Subsequent Christmas specials {{were recorded in}} 1972 and 1973. [...] In 1975 a 13-episode television series was commissioned by ATV for ITV. Carry On Laughing ran for two seasons, with six half-hour episodes in season one and seven in season two. [...] The writer Penelope Gilliatt wrote: [...] "The usual charge to make against the Carry On films {{is to say that}} they could be so much better done. [...] This is true enough. [...] They look dreadful, they seem to be edited with a bacon slicer, the effects are perfunctory and the comic rhythm jerks along like a cat on a cold morning. [...] But <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> things were more elegant I don't really think the films would be more enjoyable: the badness is part of the funniness." ...|$|E

Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> shows are canceled they might have a chance, the joke being all these shows had indeed already been canceled by Fox.

500|$|Early episodes based much {{of their}} comedy on Stewie's [...] "super villain" [...] antics, such as his {{constant}} plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions {{to get rid of}} things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. Family Guy often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in [...] "North by North Quahog", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared, Action, That '80s Show, Wonderfalls, Fastlane, Andy Richter Controls the Universe, Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up, The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real, Freakylinks, Wanda at Large, Costello, The Lone Gunmen, A Minute with Stan Hooper, Normal, Ohio, Pasadena, Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The $treet, The American Embassy, Cedric the Entertainer Presents, The Tick, Luis, and Greg the Bunny. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during Family Guys hiatus.|$|E
500|$|One {{aspect of}} death was the {{disintegration}} of the various kheperu, or modes of existence. Funerary rituals served to re-integrate these different aspects of being. Mummification served to preserve and transform the physical body into sah, an idealised form with divine aspects; the Book of the Dead [...] contained spells aimed at preserving the body of the deceased, which may have been recited during the process of mummification. The heart, which was regarded as the aspect of being which included intelligence and memory, was also protected with spells, and in case anything happened to the physical heart, it was common to bury jewelled heart scarabs with a body to provide a replacement. The ka, or life-force, remained in the tomb with the dead body, and required sustenance from offerings of food, water and incense. In case priests or relatives failed to provide these offerings, Spell 105 ensured the ka was satisfied. The name of the dead person, which constituted their individuality and was required for their continued existence, was written in many places throughout the Book, and spell 25 ensured the deceased would remember their own name. The ba was a free-ranging spirit aspect of the deceased. It was the ba, depicted as a human-headed bird, which could [...] "go forth by day" [...] from the tomb into the world; spells 61 and 89 acted to preserve it. Finally, the shut, or shadow of the deceased, was preserved by spells 91, 92 and 188. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> aspects of the person could be variously preserved, remembered, and satiated, then the dead person would live on {{in the form of an}} akh. An akh was a blessed spirit with magical powers who would dwell among the gods.|$|E
