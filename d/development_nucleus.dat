The implication of LIF-related cytokines in the <b>development</b> of this <b>nucleus</b> came to light with the analysis of mice mutant for the receptor of these cytokines, LIFRβ, which exhibit a massive loss of facial branchiomotor (fbm) neurons at birth and a severe decrease in GFAP expression, a marker of astrocytes.

The receptor is absent during the migration of fbm post-mitotic neurons but is strongly expressed when fbm neurons have reached rhombomere 6 at E 12. 5, and its expression is maintained until E 18. 5. From the analysis of lifrβ mutant embryos, we established that LIFRβ is necessary for fbm neurons’ identity determination. We also show that LIFRβ is implicated in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation, specifically within the facial nucleus...|$|R

40|$|Ciliates {{have evolved}} highly complex and {{intricately}} controlled pathways {{to ensure the}} precise and complete removal of all genomic sequences not required for vegetative growth. At the same time, they retain a reference copy of all their genetic information for future generations. This chapter describes how different ciliates use RNA-mediated DNA comparison processes to form new somatic nuclei from germline nuclei. While these processes vary in their precise mechanisms, they all use RNA to target genomic DNA sequences—either for retention or elimination. They also all consist {{of more than one}} individual pathway acting cooperatively—the two subsets of small RNAs in Paramecium and the guide RNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs in Oxytricha—to ensure a strong belt-and-braces approach to consistent and precise somatic <b>nucleus</b> <b>development.</b> Nonetheless, this genome comparison approach to somatic <b>nucleus</b> <b>development</b> provides an elegant method for trans-generational environmental adaptation. Conceptually, it is easy to imagine how somatic changes that occur during vegetative growth could be transferred to meiotic offspring, while an unaltered germline genome is retained. Further research in this area will have far-reaching implications for the trans-generational adaptation of more distantly related eukaryotes, such as humans...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 (Brandt) were {{surveyed}} {{for the presence}} of polyploid cells. Large polyploid cells were found in the hepatic cecum, gut and sheath of the testis. The relative DNA content of the polyploid nuclei was measured by means of two wavelength cytophotometry. Histograms plotted from the data provide information on the level and range of the nuclear DNA, and on changes during the course of <b>development.</b> <b>Nuclei</b> from the adult hepatic cecum range from 32 C to 256 C and do not conform to discrete DNA multiples. In juveniles, the hepatic cecum nuclei vary from 16 C to 64 C. In emergers, however, they are arranged in distinct classes of 2 C. 4 C, and 8 C nuclei. The incidence and development of ploidy in the midgut are similar to the hepatic cecum of both adults and juveniles. The hepatic cecum cells of newly emerged specimens, however, all have 2 C nuclei. Nuclei of testis sheath cells form a doubling series corresponding to discrete nuclear classes. In adults, 75 percent of the nuclei are 16 C, and the remainder 32 C. A bimodal distribution is also found in juvenile specimens, but the DNA values are lower. The frequency of nuclei in each class shifts as the animals grow. Simultaneous measurements of nuclear volume and DNA content were made on nuclei of the hepatic cecum. It was found that the correlation between these two factors is high, enabling a reasonably accurate estimation of the nuclear DNA content from a measurement of the nuclear diameter. Autoradiographic evidence indicates that adult testis sheath nuclei continue to synthesize DNA, while adult hepatic cecum and midgut nuclei do not. In juvenile specimens, nuclei of all three tissues synthesize DNA. Cells of the hepatic cecum and midgut do not respond to crustecdysone, whether exposed in vitro or in vivo. Testis sheath cells, however, respond to the molting hormone when exposed in vitro...|$|R
40|$|Separation of {{labelled}} nuclei by {{sedimentation velocity}} at unit gravity (Staput method) {{was used to}} study the timing of histone synthesis and replacement by testis-specific basic nuclear protein (TSP) during spermatogenesis in the mouse. Animals were injected (intratesticularly) with 1. 25 micronCi per testis 3 H-arginine or 2. 5 micronCi per testis 3 H-lysine, testis nuclei were separated, and the acid extract of each nuclear fraction was analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The distribution of labelled histones and TSP in separated nuclei was assessed 2 h after incorporation. Changes in the labelled histone and TSP content of nuclei during subsequent differentiation (1 [...] 34 days post-label) was followed in fractions of separated testis cell nuclei and in nuclei of cauda epididymal spermatozoa. Analysis of total histone and (TSP) content indicated quantitative changes during <b>development.</b> <b>Nuclei</b> from primary spermatocytes had relatively larger amounts of histones H 1 and H 4. Spermatid nuclei showed a relative reduction in histones H 1 and H 4, coincident {{with the appearance of}} TSP in these nuclei. These results suggested that synthesis and/or removal of certain histones must occur in late primary spermatocyte and early spermatid stages of spermatogenesis. Results of labelling experiments indicated several periods of histone synthesis during spermatogenesis: (1) closely associated with the last DNA synthesis(i. e., in early primary spermatocytes), (2) late in meiotic prophase (i. e., in pachytene primary spermatocytes) and (3) simultaneous with TSP synthesis (i. e., in late spermatids). Histone H 1 was more heavily labelled {{toward the end of the}} primary spermatocyte period. Histone H 4 was more heavily labelled in the early primary spermatocyte period, and again at the time of TSP synthesis in spermatids. Histones synthesized before the pachytene primary spermatocyte stage appeared to be replace, but histones synthesized later in spermatogenesis appeared to be at least partially retained in epididymal spermatozoa. These results suggested that repeated specific alterations in the protein complement of the nucleus are an integral part of spermatogenic differentiation in the mouse...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] To {{interpret}} the erratic conditions, rates, {{and extent of}} gibbsite crystallization from partially neutralized A 1 C 13 solution, the following hypothesis proposed: The initial OH-AI polymers in the freshly prepared solutions were probably unstable and transformed into either gibbsite or stable OH-AI polymers via two different reaction paths. In the presence of nuclei, the OH-A 1 polymers dissociated into monomeric ions, which then deposited onto nuclei to form gibbsite. In the absence of nuclei, the unstable polymers slowly converted tostable polymers. The erratic stability of OH-A 1 solutions and gibbsite crystallization are therefore attributed tothe relative magnitudes of these two reaction paths which, in turn, are attributed to two key factors: (1) the distribution of unstable vs. stable OH-A 1 polymers; and (2) {{the presence or absence}} of nuclei. The duration of aging of the parent solution governed the distribution ofunstable vs. stable polymers. The rate of neutralization resulted in varying localized high alkalinity in OH-AI solution preparation and thus varying <b>development</b> of <b>nuclei.</b> Key Words [...] Aluminum hydroxide, Crystallization, Gibbsite, OH-A 1 polymer, Nucleation...|$|R
