The results clarify the requirements on laser phase and frequency stability for performing photon-echo data erasure. The analysis of phase and frequency stability of a light source by the photon-echo erasure process is illustrated. A theoretical analysis emphasizing the physical processes that affect the erasure efficiency as well as an extensive discussion of possible error sources are given. Finally, an approach to bit-selective photon-echo data erasure that is insensitive to laser phase and frequency fluctuations is suggested...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{generated}} by computations {{is not only}} an obstacle to circuit miniaturization but also a fundamental aspect of the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics. In principle, reversible operations may be performed at no energy cost; given that irreversible computations can always be decomposed into reversible operations followed by the <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> the problem of calculating their energy cost is reduced to the study of erasure. Landauer's principle states that the <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> stored in a system has an inherent work cost and therefore dissipates heat. However, this consideration assumes that the information about the system to be erased is classical, and does not extend to the general case where an observer may have quantum information about the system to be erased, for instance by means of a quantum memory entangled with the system. Here we show that the standard formulation and implications of Landauer's principle are no longer valid in the presence of quantum information. Our main result is that the work cost of erasure is determined by the entropy of the system, conditioned on the quantum information an observer has about it. In other words, the more an observer knows about the system, the less it costs to erase it. This result gives a direct thermodynamic significance to conditional entropies, originally introduced in information theory. Furthermore, it provides new bounds on the heat generation of computations: because conditional entropies can become negative in the quantum case, an observer who is strongly correlated with a system may gain work while erasing it, thereby cooling the environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} “Right to Be Forgotten or Erasure” (RTBF), article 17 of {{the proposed}} General Data Protection Regulation, provides individuals with a means to oppose the often persistent digital memory of the Web. Because digital information technologies affect the accessibility of information over time and time plays {{a fundamental role in}} biological forgetting, ‘time’ is a factor that should play a pivotal role in the RTBF. This chapter explores the roles that ‘time’ plays and could play in decisions regarding the retention or <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> Two roles are identified: (1) ‘time’ as the marker of a discrete moment where the grounds for retention no longer hold and ‘forgetting’ of the data should follow and (2) ‘time’ as a factor in the balance of interests, as adding or removing weight to the request to ‘forget’ personal information or its opposing interest. The chapter elaborates on these two roles from different perspectives and highlights the importance and underdeveloped understanding of the second role. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – {{to analyse}} the {{compliance}} with {{basic principles of}} data protection in selected consumer oriented cloud services contracts, and also to highlight the adequate level of data protection in the mentioned contracts, evaluating existing data protection directive 95 / 46 /EC, also proposed General data protection regulation. Design/methodology/approach – various survey methods {{have been used in}} the work integrated. Documental analysis method has been used in analysis of scientific literature, legal acts and other documents, where aspects of legal data protection requirements have been included. Legal documents analysis method together with logical-analytic method has been used in analysing Directive 95 / 46 /EU, Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Comparative method has been applied for revealing difference between particular cloud services contracts and also comparing the compliance of cloud services contracts to requirements of basic European data protection principles, established in the international documents. Findings – from the brief analysis of selected consumer oriented cloud service providers, it may be implied that more or less all the legal principles, established in the legal acts, are reflected in the privacy policies and/or service agreements. However, it shall be noted that {{there is a big difference}} in wording of the analysed documents. Regarding other principles, all examined cloud service providers do not have indemnification provisions regarding unlawful use of personal data. Research limitations/implications – the concept of the contract was presented in a broad sense, including the privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of the service providers. In accordance with the content of the principles, the authors grouped data protection principles, applied in cloud services into fundamental and recommendatory. Practical implications – the research results will be helpful for cloud service providers, dealing with personal data of data subjects (natural persons). Originality/value – the mentioned research of cloud provider contracts examined 4 sets of standard terms and conditions of cloud service providers targeting individual consumers. The following personal data protection principles were evaluated: transparency, purpose specification and limitation, <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> confidentiality, availability, integrity, indemnification.

40|$|We {{describe}} SWIPE, {{an approach}} to reduce the life time of sensitive, memory resident data in large scale applications written in C. In contrast to prior approaches that used a delayed or lazy approach to the problem <b>of</b> erasing sensitive <b>data,</b> SWIPE uses a novel eager erasure approach that minimizes the risk <b>of</b> accidental sensitive <b>data</b> leakage. SWIPE achieves this by transforming a legacy C program to include additional instructions that erase sensitive data immediately after its intended use. SWIPE is guided by a highlyscalable static analysis technique that precisely identifies the locations to introduce erase instructions in the original program. The programs transformed using SWIPE enjoy several additional benefits: minimization of leaks that arise due to <b>data</b> dependencies; <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> sensitive <b>data</b> with minimal developer guidance; and negligible performance overheads...|$|R
40|$|To {{achieve an}} areal density of 1 terabits {{per square inch}} (1. 55 gigabits/mm 2) in hard disk drives, the size of {{magnetic}} grains in hard disks {{has been reduced to}} approximately 7 nm and the spacing between the magnetic head and the disk has been minimized to 1 to 2 nm. At a spacing on the order of 1 to 2 nm between the head and the disk, it is likely that contacts between the magnetic head and the disk occur during reading and writing, causing <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> or even failure of the head/disk interface. Wear particles can be generated as a consequence of contacts between slider and disk, and if particles enter the head/disk interface, catastrophic failure of the head/disk interface can occur. To reduce the generation of wear particles and avoid failure of the head/disk interface, it is important to investigate how the tribological performance of all contact interfaces in hard disk drives can be improved. In this dissertation, the tribological performance of the most important contact interfaces in a hard disk drive are investigated with a focus on the generation of wear particles and lubricant migration. First, fretting wear is investigated to study the effect of a diamond-like carbon (DLC) overcoat on wear of the dimple/gimbal interface. A numerical simulation model based on finite element analysis was developed to explain the experimental results. Then, lubricant migration on the air bearing surface and its effect on the head medium spacing (HMS) was investigated as a function of temperature, slider position, and “parking time” of the slider on the ramp. Thereafter, the thermal response of a thermal sensor during contact with asperities on the disk surface was analyzed. The effects of experimental and environmental conditions on the resistance change of the sensor were studied. Finally, experimental and numerical investigations were performed to analyze contact between the suspension lift tab and the ramp in hard disk drives. The voice coil motor current was used to characterize the change of the friction force and the generation of wear debris at the lift tab/ramp interface during load/unload testing. Numerical simulations were performed to analyze how to reduce contact stress between the lift-tab and the ramp. The results of this dissertation will be helpful in improving the tribological performance of hard disk drives...|$|E
50|$|Concerning the {{obligations}} and {{duties of the}} operator of a search engine, the Court held that {{in the present case}} Article 7(f) of the Directive, relating to legitimacy of processing, requires a balancing of the opposing rights and interests <b>of</b> the <b>data</b> subject (González) and the data controller (Google), taking into account the data subject's rights deriving from Articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection <b>of</b> personal <b>data)</b> <b>of</b> the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 14(a) of the Directive, relating to the data subject's rights, allows the data subject, at least in the cases covered by Articles 7(e) and 7(f), to object at any time on compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation to the processing <b>of</b> <b>data</b> relating to him, save where otherwise provided by national legislation. Article 12(b) of the Directive, relating to the <b>data</b> subject's right <b>of</b> access to the data, allows the data subject to request <b>erasure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>data.</b> Such request may be made directly of the controller, who must then duly examine the merits of the request.
