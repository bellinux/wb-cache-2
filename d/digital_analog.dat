500|$|However, {{despite the}} pending switch to <b>digital,</b> <b>analog</b> {{television}} remains being transmitted in most countries. An {{exception is the}} United States that ended analog television transmission (by all but the very low-power TV stations) on 12 June 2009 after twice delaying the switchover deadline,Kenya also ended analog television transmission in December 2014 after multiple delays. For analog television, there are three standards in use for broadcasting color TV (see a map on adoption [...] ). These are known as PAL (German designed), NTSC (North American designed), and SECAM (French designed). (It {{is important to understand}} that these are the ways of sending color TV, and they do not {{have anything to do with}} the standards for black & white TV, which also vary from country to country.) For analog radio, the switch to digital radio is made more difficult by the fact that analog receivers are sold at a small fraction of the price of digital receivers. The choice of modulation for analog radio is typically between amplitude (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). To achieve stereo playback, an amplitude modulated subcarrier is used for stereo FM.|$|E

[...] In the 2010s, new analog synthesizers, both in keyboard instrument and modular form, are released alongside current digital hardware instruments.
