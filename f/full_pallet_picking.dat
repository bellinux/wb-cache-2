This evidence emerges from a <b>full</b> <b>pallet</b> of human brain imaging and brain mapping methods with which multisensory processes are quantitatively assessed by taking advantage of particular strengths of each technique as well as advances in signal analyses.

Second, primary visual cortex is involved in multisensory processes during early post-stimulus stages (as revealed by EEG/ERP/ERFs as well as TMS). Third, multisensory effects in primary visual cortex directly impact behaviour and perception, as revealed by correlational (EEG/ERPs/ERFs) as well as more causal measures (TMS/tACS).

5000|$|Wave picking is a {{term for}} a process used in a {{warehouse}} management system (WMS) to support organizing of the daily flow of work of a warehouse or distribution center. Wave picking is an application of short-interval-scheduling. Managers, using the WMS, assign groups of orders into short intervals called [...] "waves", to initially simulate the flow for the day, consistent with the order departure plan and available labor. When the plan is satisfactory, it is accepted. The WMS then releases the waves to the warehouse sequentially throughout the day, to allow managers to coordinate the several parallel and sequential activities required to complete the daily work. One of the objectives of wave picking is to minimize the variation of workload in each work function by wave. The wave data includes the workload (order lines, cases, value added services, etc.) by order or function (case <b>picking,</b> repack <b>picking,</b> <b>pallet</b> movement, <b>pick</b> position replenishment, packing, etc.), providing management the information to calculate staff requirements (Reasonable Expectancies or Productivity Standards) to guide the assignment of staff by function, with the reasonable expectation that the work in each function, within each wave. Waves are often constructed (based on each day's order characteristics and available staffing) to last between 1 and 4 hours, with resulting 8 to 2 waves in a shift. There are three basic management tasks accomplished and benefits of wave picking.|$|R
40|$|VMI (Vendor managed inventory) is a {{relationship}} between vendor and customer where the vendor manage the customer’s inventory. After the first VMI rollout in February 2006, Atlas Copco identified problems with {{the definition of the}} max – and min inventory levels. The purpose of the thesis is to redefine the max – and min levels and identify the important variables in inventory dimensioning. Atlas Copco Tools VMI relation with the vendor Enics has been studied. Two general types of VMI relationships have been detected from the empirical study. The consignment inventory has been identified to be a self regulated system. In the case where the customer owns their own inventory there is a larger incentive for the customer to control the inventory level with a max level. The results are divided into two sections: Inventory cut up and inventory variables. The max – and min system should be redefined as a max – safety level system. The reason is that the safety level is defined to cover variations in demand and therefore should the vendor not be judged on basis on the ability to keep the inventory level above the safety level. The target level will work as a cycle stock and vary directly with lot size. To optimize the target level the lot size must be optimized. The authors recommend that lot size is determined by an adjustment of the EOQ (Economic Order Quanity) model. This results in an inventory level that shares logistics costs between the participants in the VMI relationship. The adjustment will be based on the delivery batch sizes to help optimize transportation planning and warehouse handling of <b>full</b> <b>pallet</b> at the distribution warehouse. The trade off between the deviation from the EOQ and the gain from the above mentioned factors were considered to be positive. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

40|$|In most {{distribution}} centers, {{products are}} {{received from the}} suppliers in units of pallet, stored in a rack, moved to the picking area for replenishment, picked according to customer orders, and shipped to customers. In some distribution centers, however, replenishment is made in not a whole pallet but {{only a portion of}} a pallet load, mainly due to the limited space in the order-picking area; as a result, partially loaded pallets occupy cells in the rack. As the number of slow-moving items increases, more cells are occupied by partially loaded pallets so that fewer empty cells are available for storing <b>full,</b> incoming <b>pallets.</b> This will necessitate the construction or leasing of additional storage space, which will entail significant cost.

40|$|AbstractThe {{order picking}} {{activities}} in distribution center are mainly sorting and arrangement works classified by destinations {{in accordance with}} customer's request.

If not rescued for upcycling pallets end up in landfills or burnt for firewood which can release harmful chemicals. There is an opportunity in this resource going beyond current design use to foster a more authentic pallet architecture – one where pallets are utilised to their module’s full potential as a primary and structural building element. This thesis explores to what extent pallets can be utilised in construction and determines their feasibility as structural entities. The themes of modularity and transportability act as key design drivers due to being inherent to the pallets nature. A construction system which effectively uses this nature is the aim, and designed systems are tested through application {{to the design of}} mobile architecture. The final outcome of this exploration is a <b>full</b> scale <b>pallet</b> pavilion utilising a modular – authentic – system which enables an easily portable and structural solution. However the application of similar systems to a larger scale is limited as pallets with consistent module and high strength are rare difficult to source. A new pallet design is proposed with inherent application as a building component. This design aims to be a highly precise modular and structural system as its primary function, allowing for universal use as wall, roof and floor. The central purpose of exploration is to create high quality, affordable, efficient and adaptable prefabricated dwellings from an otherwise discarded item – this is the potential for the research in future. If the ‘building pallet’ design was integrated into circulation the impact and application on construction from upcycling them into prefabricated building elements could be worldwide...|$|R
50|$|The aircraft, {{bound for}} Santo Domingo, lost control shortly after V1. Upon {{rotation}} the cargo shifted aft {{on the main}} cargo deck because none of the pallet locks were engaged upright to the cargo pallets on the main deck. The plane was loaded with two empty pallet positions that allowed for a significant shifting {{of the center of}} gravity aft toward the empty spaces. Ground crew interviews found that the flight was routinely <b>full</b> of <b>pallets</b> and the locks were rarely engaged in some opinions, and it was further stated this was because they were thought to be irrelevant if the pallets could not move. Pallets are held by rails at the sides from moving in an upward direction, but only the retractable end locks can stop forward and aft movement. The over-pitching on rotation at V1 pitched the aircraft nose up sharply to the point that air flow into the engines was significantly reduced (similar to blowing across the opening of a soda bottle to make it whistle from the drop in pressure) and causing the engines to stall. The plane then pitched back nose-down landing on its belly on the ground. In addition the aircraft was approximately 2700 kg overloaded, although given the pallet weighing process this was believed to be more common than thought beforehand. The pilots, departing from former Runway 27R (now 26L) attempted to recover but the stalled aircraft lacked any forward thrust rendering the control surfaces useless. The forward pitching aircraft rapidly lost forward momentum and lift with its wings cutting the airflow perpendicular to proper lift orientation.

40|$|Dit proefschrift ontwerpt een retail supply chain, die beter en goedkoper is dan de gangbare. Dit wordt bereikt door de distributie te synchroniseren op de productie¬momenten. Goederen zouden direct uit productie al stroomafwaarts moeten bewegen, van fabrikant naar {{retailer}}, tegen lage kosten, in volle pallets en in volle auto’s en in hoeveel¬heden die groot genoeg zijn om de vraag tot het volgende productiemoment te dekken. Door de formules van de "Krantenverkoper" en die van de economische ordergrootte (EOQ) aan te passen aan een multi-echelon divergerend distributienetwerk, kan ook theoretisch worden bewezen dat het stroomafwaarts positioneren van voorraden inderdaad optimaal is en dat de voorraden daardoor zullen dalen. De huidige magazijnen van de leveranciers kunnen worden gereduceerd tot overslagpunten, waar goederen van de verschillende fabrieken van een leverancier worden samengebracht om rijden met vollere vrachtwagens mogelijk maken. Kleinere hoeveelheden kunnen leveranciers beter afleveren bij het dichtstbijzijnde distributiecentrum van een retailer, waarna de retailer zelf het deel met bestemming elders verder vervoert. Tenslotte kan de winkelbevoorrading worden aangepast aan de schapruimte, waardoor de werkwijze in de distributiecentra kan worden gerationaliseerd. Piet van der Vlist (1947) {{was born}} in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel. He received his high-school diploma from the Marnix Gymnasium in Rotterdam. Also in Rotterdam he graduated as Electronics Engineer at the University of Applied Sciences. He obtained a Master of Science in Electronics at the Delft University of Technology and one in Management Sciences at the University of Twente. He worked 15 years with the Dutch Ministry of Defense on the design and realization {{of the first generation}} digital communications systems. Then he joined Bakkenist Management Consultants and later Deloitte Consultancy, together for over 20 years. As consultant he was involved in numerous projects on Data exchange and Supply Chain redesign. Besides that, he was for 11 years (part-time) professor in ICT and Logistics at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Piet wrote and edited several books on data exchange and published numerous articles in business and scientific journals. A fairly good overview of his scientific career {{can be found in the}} "Liber Amicorum" that his friends wrote when he left Eindhoven University 1. His current research interests lie in the design and management of retail supply chains, all the way from production down to the shelves. He found that the supply chain with the overall lowest costs requires synchronization of distribution to production and not the other way around as current practice seems to dictate. When he had to quit his jobs for health reasons, he finally found the opportunity to devote his time to research and extend the theory that supports Supply Chain Synchronization. He programmed built to purpose simulation models to get a better insight in the dynamics of synchronized supply chains. He joined both the Rotterdam Erasmus University to work with Professor Jo van Nunen and the Eindhoven University of Technology to work with Professor Ton de Kok. This PhD thesis is the result of that effort. This thesis is a design of a retail supply chain that is better and cheaper than the usual one. This is achieved by synchronizing distribution to production. Right from production goods should move downstream the supply chain at low cost in <b>full</b> <b>pallets</b> and in <b>full</b> truckloads, in quantities large enough to cover the needs till the next production run. By extending both the Newsvendor- and the EOQ-formulae to a multi-echelon divergent network, it can be proved that such forward positioning of inventory indeed is optimal and that overall supply chain inventories will drop. The suppliers’ warehouses become stockless cross docking points, where goods from the supplier’s various sourcing plants are brought together to consolidate them into full truckloads. Whenever suppliers deliver lower volumes, they better bring these goods to the nearest retailer’s facility; thereafter the retailer himself should move these goods onward to the proper destination within the retailer’s network. And finally shop replenishment should be rationalized based on shelf coverage, so as to enhance the retailer’s warehouse operations...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{differences}} in performance of heuristic and optimal strategies for routing orderpickers in a warehouse are compared. Specifically, modern warehouses are considered, where orderpicking trucks can pick up and deposit <b>pick</b> <b>pallets</b> {{at the head of}} every aisle without returning to a depot. Such environments can be found in many warehouses where paperless picking is performed from pallet locations with pickers having mobile terminals receiving instructions one by one. In order to find orderpicking routes of minimal length in the situation of decentralized depositing, we use an extension of the well-known polynomial time algorithm of Ratliff and Rosenthal (1983) that considered warehouses with a central depot. In practice, the problem is mainly solved by using the so-called S-shape heuristic in which orderpickers move in a S-shape curve along the pick locations. The performance of both routing strategies is compared by using simulation. The optimal algorithm can give substantial reductions in travel time per route. It turns out that the reduction in travel time strongly depends on the lay-out and operation of the warehouse. Simulation is very time consuming, both in creating computer programs and in calculation times. Therefore it is desirable to have statistically based, explicit formulas for the performance of the optimal algorithm and the S-shape heuristic. We adapt formulations of Hall (1993) for the case of decentralized depositing and improve their performance. After adaptation, the formulas perform fairly well, and are a good alternative for simulation to get a rough idea about differences in performance of the S-shape heuristic and the optimal algorith...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} finding ecient orderpicking routes is studied for both {{conventional}} warehouses, where pickers have a central depot for picking up and depositing carts and pick lists, and modern warehouses, where orderpicking trucks can pick up and deposit pallets {{at the head of}} every aisle without returning to the depot. Such environments can be found in many warehouses where paperless picking is performed from pallet locations with pickers having mobile terminals receiving instructions one by one. In order to find orderpicking routes with a minimal length in both the situations of a central depot or decentralized depositing, we extend the well-known polynomial algorithm of Ratli and Rosenthal [1] that considered warehouses with a central depot. In practice, the problem is mainly solved by using the so-called S-shape heuristic in which orderpickers move in a S-shape curve along the pick locations. The performance of the new algorithm and the S-shape heuristic are compared in three realistic orderpicking systems: (1) narrow-aisle high-bay <b>pallet</b> warehouse; (2) <b>picking</b> in shelf area with decentralized depositing of picked items; and (3) conventional orderpicking from wide-aisle pallet locations. The new algorithm gives a reduction in travel time per route of between 7 and 34 %. It turns out that the reduction in travel time strongly depends on the lay-out and operation of the warehouse. 1. Orderpicking in warehouses In warehouses and distribution centers, products have to be picked from specified storage locations on the basis of customer orders. In general, the orderpicking process i...|$|R
