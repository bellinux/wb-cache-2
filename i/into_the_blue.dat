5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> sky and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, Boone, {{his wife}} and four {{children}} {{moved back to the}} Yadkin River Valley from Culpeper. By the mid-1760s, with peace made with the Cherokee, colonial immigration into the area increased. The competition of new settlers decreased the amount of game available. Boone had difficulty making ends meet; he was often taken to court for nonpayment of debts. He sold his land to pay off creditors. After his father's death in 1765, Boone traveled with his brother Squire and a group of men to Florida, which had become British territory {{after the end of the}} war, to look into the possibility of settling there. According to a family story, Boone purchased land near Pensacola, but Rebecca refused to move so far away from her friends and family. The Boones moved to a more remote area of the Yadkin River Valley, and Boone began to hunt westward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Ridge Mountains.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} this radical new Irish {{parliamentary}} building, {{one of two}} purpose-built Irish parliamentary buildings (the other being Parliament Buildings, Stormont), was entrusted to a talented young architect, Edward Lovett Pearce, who was himself a member of parliament and a protégé of the Speaker of the House of Commons, William Conolly of Castletown House. While building was begun, Parliament moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Coat Hospital on Dublin's Northside.

25|$|This {{method of}} diving is {{commonly}} used in Philippines waters for pa-aling fishing, which is fishing with big nets on coral reef areas where a surface-dragged net would snag on coral; the compressor air hoses are also {{used to make a}} curtain of bubbles to corral and herd the fish into the nets, since muro-ami fishing was stopped in the area. At least one pa-aling fishing fleet has been found and arrested in a protected fishery area. Compressor diving was shown, and so called, used for pa-aling fishing, in episode 1 (Oceans: <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue)</b> of the BBC television series Human Planet. The cameramen used ordinary scuba gear, but one of them had a trial-dive with the crew's compressor-diving gear.|$|E
25|$|During 1969, Buckley {{began to}} write and record {{material}} for three different albums: Lorca, Blue Afternoon, and Starsailor. Inspired by the singing of avant-garde musician Cathy Berberian, he decided to integrate the ideas of composers such as Luciano Berio and Iannis Xenakis in an avant-garde rock genre. He started to fully use his vocal range. According to Underwood, Buckley knew that Lorca had little to no chance in the commercial market. Selecting eight songs that {{had yet to be}} recorded, these tracks evolved into the sessions for Blue Afternoon, an album that was quite similar to Happy Sad in style. In a 1977 article for Down Beat magazine, Underwood wrote that Buckley's heart was not <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Afternoon performances and that the album was a perfunctory response to please his business partners.|$|E

25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau drove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four {{miles from the}} Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching the passenger side door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer {{walked away from the}} car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E

500|$|Hurlbut's {{cinematography}} {{work on the}} 2005 film <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> received positive reception from {{film critic}} Roger Ebert.

Lou Lumenick wrote in the New York Post that the [...] "watery interludes" [...] in <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue</b> were [...] "gorgeously photographed by Shane Hurlbut". Though Associated Press writer David Germain gave a negative review overall of <b>Into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Blue,</b> he wrote positively of Hurlbut's cinematography work, commenting: [...] "Shane Hurlbut's cinematography buoys the movie, but his lovely pictures of the actors swimming among jellyfish and shimmery aquatic vegetation cannot compensate for everything else." ...|$|E

[...] Strauss also commented positively on Hurlbut's work on the 2005 film The Greatest Game Ever Played, writing he [...] "does {{a great job of}} making golf look cinematic". Soren Andersen of The News Tribune wrote of Hurlbut's work on The Greatest Game Ever Played: [...] "Shot by cinematographer Shane Hurlbut, the picture is extraordinarily handsome, with its velvety green fairways and its burnished, candlelit interiors." [...] Joan E. Vadeboncoeur of The Post-Standard was critical of the film's script, but praised Hurlbut's work: [...] "Director Bill Paxton does have a splendid cinematographer, Shane Hurlbut, contributing beauty and atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait of {{my wife and me}} together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue</b> moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E
500|$|More distantly, Haakon {{sought an}} {{alliance}} with Alfonso X of Castile, a potential next Holy Roman Emperor—chiefly as it would guarantee new supplies of grain in light of rising prices in England, and possibly giving access to Baltic grain through Norwegian control of Lübeck. Alfonso in turn sought to expand his influence in Northern Europe, {{as well as to}} gain Norwegian naval assistance for the campaign or crusade he had proposed in Morocco (seeing that the Iberian Moors received backing overseas from North Africa). Haakon could thus potentially also fulfill his papal vow of crusade, although he likely did not intend to. He sent an embassy to Castile in 1255, and the accompanying Castilian ambassador on the return to Norway proposed to establish the [...] "strongest ties of friendship" [...] with Haakon. At the request of Alfonso, Haakon gave his consent that his daughter Christina could go to Castile and marry one of Alfonso's brothers. Christina's death four years after the childless marriage, however, marked an effective end of the short-lived [...] "alliance", and the proposed crusade fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
