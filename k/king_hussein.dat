5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, Edward’s {{schooling}} included the Egyptian branch of Victoria College, Alexandria (VC), where one classmate was Michel Shaloub (later the actor Omar Sharif), whom he {{remembered as a}} sadistic, physically abusive Head Boy. Edward’s other classmates included (<b>King)</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan, and the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers would progress to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen in their respective countries.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and the PLO were over.|$|E
5|$|Throughout September 1973, Aman had {{received}} eleven warnings, including a warning from Jordan's <b>King</b> <b>Hussein,</b> that Egypt and Syria were bent on waging war, {{but they were}} all disregarded, as Aman maintained the belief that the Arabs would not launch an attack. Mossad director Zvi Zamir remained of the opinion that war was not an Arab option.|$|E
5|$|Abu Iyad {{appointed}} Abu Nidal in 1968 as the Fatah {{representative in}} Khartoum, Sudan, then (at Abu Nidal's insistence) {{to the same}} position in Baghdad in July 1970, two months before Black September, when over 10 days of fighting King Hussein's army drove the Palestinian fedayeen out of Jordan, {{with the loss of}} thousands of lives. Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E
5|$|At the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan {{agreed to}} {{negotiate}} a peace treaty sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union. The Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace was signed on 26 October 1994. In 1997, Israeli agents entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior Hamas leader. Israel provided {{an antidote to the}} poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin after <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> threatened to annul the peace treaty.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan bought {{a fleet of}} cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to be useless. In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{prides itself}} on its health services, {{some of the best}} in the region. Qualified medics, {{favourable}} investment climate and Jordan's stability has contributed to the success of this sector. The country's health care system is divided between public and private institutions. On 1 June 2007, Jordan Hospital (as the biggest private hospital) was the first general specialty hospital to gain the international accreditation JCAHO. The <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Cancer Center is a leading cancer treatment center. 66% of Jordanians have medical insurance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began {{accusing the}} PLO of cowardice over his Voice of Palestine {{radio station in}} Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the Black September Organization {{responsible}} for the 1972 Munich Massacre), calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against <b>King</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Israel besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, {{disagreed}} with the PLO's leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that the PLO pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF. PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, {{with most of the}} leadership relocating to Tunis, although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> allowed them to take credit.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} {{to blow up the}} building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> $12 million for his release.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{has three}} {{commercial}} airports, all receiving and dispatching international flights. Two are in Amman {{and the third}} is in Aqaba, <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> International Airport. Amman Civil Airport serves several regional routes and charter flights while Queen Alia International Airport is the major international airport in Jordan and is the hub for Royal Jordanian, the flag carrier. Queen Alia International Airport expansion was completed in 2013 with new terminals costing $700 million, to handle over 16 million passengers annually. It is now considered a state-of-the-art airport and was awarded 'the best airport by region: Middle East' for 2014 and 2015 by Airport Service Quality (ASQ) survey, the world's leading airport passenger satisfaction benchmark programme.|$|E
5|$|Abdullah was {{succeeded by}} his son Talal, who would soon abdicate due to illness in favour of his eldest son Hussein. Talal {{established}} the country's modern constitution in 1952. Hussein ascended to the throne in 1953 {{at the age of}} 18. Jordan witnessed great political uncertainty in the following period. The 1950s were a period of political upheaval, as Nasserism and Pan-Arabism swept the Arab World. On 1 March 1956, <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Arabized the command of the Army by dismissing a number of senior British officers, an act made to remove remaining foreign influence in the country. In 1958, Jordan and neighbouring Hashemite Iraq formed the Arab Federation {{as a response to the}} formation of the rival United Arab Republic between Nasser's Egypt and Syria. The union lasted only six months, being dissolved after Iraqi King Faisal II (Hussein's cousin) was deposed by a bloody military coup on 14 July 1958.|$|E
5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|Many events {{take place}} in Amman, {{including}} Redbull sponsored events, soundclash and soapbox race, {{the second part of}} Jerash Festival, Al-Balad Music Festival, Amman Marathon, Made in Jordan Festival, Amman Book Festival and New Think Festival. The New Think Festival is a yearly weekend event that is part of NewThink, a non-profit initiative that aims to inspire youth to think about the world in an innovative way. The festival {{is one of the many}} events throughout the year to get youth involved. In 2015 the festival hosted 40 different organizations at <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Business Park in Amman that inspired their audience to be visionary and think differently about the world through presentations and workshops. The variety of organizations included business, environmental, medical and educational groups.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned the camera to ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.|$|E
5|$|By 25 September, the Jordanian army {{achieved}} dominance, and {{two days}} later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a ceasefire in Amman. The Jordanian army inflicted heavy casualties on the Palestinians—including civilians—who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. After repeated violations of the ceasefire from both the PLO and the Jordanian Army, Arafat called for <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> to be toppled. Responding to the threat, in June 1971, Hussein ordered his forces to oust all remaining Palestinian fighters in northern Jordan, which they accomplished. Arafat {{and a number of}} his forces, including two high-ranking commanders, Abu Iyad and Abu Jihad, were forced into the northern corner of Jordan. They relocated near the town of Jerash, near the border with Syria. With the help of Munib Masri, a pro-Palestinian Jordanian cabinet member, and Fahd al-Khomeimi, the Saudi ambassador to Jordan, Arafat managed to enter Syria with nearly two thousand of his fighters. However, due to the hostility of relations between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (who had since ousted President Salah Jadid), the Palestinian fighters crossed the border into Lebanon to join PLO forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Deir Ghassaneh and Beit Rima were merged {{and granted}} {{municipal}} status in February 1966 during Jordanian rule, partially {{due to the}} efforts of Kassim al-Rimawi, the rural affairs minister at the time and a native of Beit Rima. Its first mayor, Adib Mohammed Rimawi, was appointed by <b>King</b> <b>Hussein.</b> The municipality building is located in Beit Rima. In June 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank after defeating Arab forces in the Six Day War. In 1972 the first municipal polls were held and Fa'eq Ali Rimawi was elected. In 1978 Bani Zeid was one of several Palestinian localities to append its municipal seal to the Memorandum from the masses and the institutions of the West Bank to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization in a display of unity with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The memorandum was a rejection of any solution, regardless of its origin, not containing a clear recognition of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to establishing an independent Palestinian national state. In 2000 Bani Zeid was incorporated into Area A giving the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), the Palestinian governing body established after the Oslo Agreements with Israel in 1993, full control over security and civilian affairs in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to persistent PLO raids against Israeli civilian targets, Israel attacked {{the town of}} Karameh, Jordan, {{the site of a}} major PLO camp. The goal of the invasion was to destroy Karameh camp and capture Yasser Arafat in reprisal for the attacks by the PLO against Israeli civilians, which culminated in an Israeli school bus hitting a mine in the Negev, killing two children. However, plans for the two operations were prepared in 1967, one year before the bus attack. When Jordan saw the size of the raiding forces entering the battle it was led to the assumption that Israel had another goal of capturing Balqa Governorate to create a Golan Heights similar situation. Israel assumed that the Jordanian Army would ignore the invasion, but the latter fought alongside the Palestinians and opened heavy fire that inflicted losses upon the Israeli forces. This engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian forces. The Israelis were repelled {{at the end of a}} day's battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 141 PLO prisoners. Both sides declared victory. On a tactical level, the battle went in Israel's favor and the destruction of the Karameh camp was achieved. However, the relatively high casualties were a considerable surprise for the Israel Defense Forces and was stunning to the Israelis. Although the Palestinians were not victorious on their own, <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> let the Palestinians take credit. Some have alleged that Arafat himself was on the battlefield, but the details of his involvement are unclear. However, his allies–as well as Israeli intelligence–confirm that he urged his men throughout the battle to hold their ground and continue fighting.|$|E

25|$|During {{their time}} in government, both Schröder and his foreign {{minister}} Joschka Fischer were widely considered sincerely, if not uncritically, pro-Israeli. Schröder represented the German government at the funeral service for <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan in Amman on 9 February 1999.|$|E
25|$|There are two border {{crossings}} between Israel and Jordan which cross the river over bridges. The northern one, Jordan River Crossing or Sheikh Hussein Bridge is near Beit She'an; the southern one, Allenby Bridge (also <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Bridge), is near Jericho.|$|E
25|$|Ambassador Goldberg briefed <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> on US assurances {{regarding}} territorial integrity. Goldberg {{said the}} US did not view Jordan {{as a country}} that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it {{would be required to}} give up. Finally, although {{as a matter of policy}} the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem. Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg's pledge regarding territorial integrity to <b>King</b> <b>Hussein.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the Jordanian side, nine {{international}} franchises {{have opened}} seaside resort hotels near the <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> Bin Talal Convention Center, along with resort apartments, {{on the eastern}} shore of the Dead Sea. The 9 hotels have boosted the Jordanian side's capacity to 2,800 rooms.|$|E

25|$|Following World War I, the Paris Peace Conference {{was held}} in 1919 between the allies to agree {{territorial}} divisions. It was a well known fact that France wanted a Syrian protectorate. At the conference, Prince Faisal, {{speaking on behalf of}} <b>King</b> <b>Hussein,</b> did not ask for immediate Arab independence. He recommended an Arab State under a British Mandate.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin, in his memoirs, claimed no {{recollection}} of the event but did make a passing reference to the incident when he met Borg a year later at the World Circle Kabaddi Cup in Hamilton, Ontario, where the pair {{had been invited to}} present the trophy. He made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan in February 1999.|$|E
25|$|At the Peace Conference in 1919, Emir Faisal, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} <b>King</b> <b>Hussein,</b> asked for Arab independence, or at minimum the right to pick the mandatory. In the end, he recommended an Arab state under a British mandate. The World Zionist Organization also asked for a British mandate, and asserted the 'historic title of the Jewish people to Palestine'.|$|E
25|$|The Dawson's Field hijackings were {{instrumental}} in provoking the Black September crackdown, which came close to destroying the PLO. The hijackings led <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan {{to carry out a}} major offensive against militant strongholds in his kingdom resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. In autumn 1970, Habash visited Beijing. After Black September, the PLO fedayeen relocated to Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{veracity}} of this story has been brought into question. Another version says that {{the release of the}} Soviet hostages was the result of extensive diplomatic negotiations with the spiritual leader of Hezbollah, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, who appealed to <b>King</b> <b>Hussein</b> of Jordan and the leaders of Libya and Iran to use their influence on the kidnappers.|$|E
