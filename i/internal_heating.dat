5|$|WASP-15 is host to {{the planet}} WASP-15b. The planet, which is a Hot Jupiter, orbits its host star at a {{distance}} of 0.0499 AU every 3.7520656 days.

WASP-15b's large radius cannot be explained solely by its proximity to its star, suggesting that some form of tidal heating or other <b>internal</b> <b>heating</b> mechanism is also involved.|$|E

5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently had a much simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in <b>internal</b> <b>heating</b> and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the <b>internal</b> <b>heating</b> and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the heat source for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's <b>internal</b> <b>heating,</b> which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractImproving {{the energy}} {{performance}} of buildings can contribute substantially to reducing energy demand. To evaluate the useful energy demand for space heating purposes from an energy economics perspective norm-based bottom-up models are applied that capture the energy-related characteristics of buildings. As electricity demand per household attributed to appliances and lighting has increased substantially in the EU 27 {{during the last}} two decades (+ 50 %), the question arises whether the static norm-based approach is underestimating the contribution of <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains to covering useful energy demand. To analyze the impact of dynamic <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains in the residential sector, a bottom-up vintage model is applied that covers the EU 27 building stock with a country-specific typology. This means the <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains are time-dependent and heat dissipation is distinguished by appliances, lighting and residents. The analysis consists of two explorative scenarios for the residential building stock of EU 27 until 2050. A reference scenario represents the static norm-based modelling of <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains while the second scenario considers their dynamic development. The study reveals that the norm-based approach underestimates the contribution of <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains to covering thermal heat demand. Comparing the countries throughout the EU 27 climate zones indicates that on average the static and the dynamic share of <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains differ in a range from 20 - 70 % by 2050. Especially in the case of nearly Zero-Energy Buildings (nZEB), e. g. with 30 kWh/m 2 *a useful energy demand, the <b>internal</b> <b>heat</b> gains are about 10 - 15 % higher using the dynamic approach compared to the norm-based approach...|$|R

25|$|Traditionally it {{was thought}} that during the period between 4.28 and 3.8Ga, changes in the orbits of the giant planets may have caused a heavy {{bombardment}} by asteroids and comets that pockmarked the Moon and the other inner planets (Mercury, Mars, and presumably Earth and Venus). This would likely have repeatedly sterilized the planet, had life appeared before that time. Geologically, the Hadean Earth would have been far more active {{than at any other time}} in its history. Studies of meteorites suggests that radioactive isotopes such as aluminium-26 with a half-life of 7.17×105 years, and potassium-40 with a half-life of 1.250×109 years, isotopes mainly produced in supernovae, were much more common. <b>Internal</b> <b>heating</b> as a result of gravitational sorting between the core and the mantle would have caused a great deal of mantle convection, with the probable result of many more smaller and more active tectonic plates than now exist.|$|E
500|$|Neptune's {{more varied}} weather when {{compared}} to Uranus {{is due in part}} to its higher <b>internal</b> <b>heating.</b> Although Neptune lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of [...] At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals , the temperature is [...] Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.|$|E

500|$|Ganymede {{probably}} {{formed by}} an accretion in Jupiter's subnebula, a disk {{of gas and}} dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation. The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years, much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for Callisto. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively [...] "gas-starved" [...] when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto. In contrast Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale. This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and differentiation: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core [...] In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation. This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition. Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater <b>internal</b> <b>heating</b> on the basis of tidal flexing or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment. In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a runaway process at Ganymede but not Callisto.|$|E

The main advantage to resistive heating is the precise measurement of temperature with thermocouples, but the temperature range is limited by the properties of the diamond which will oxidize in air at 700°C [...] The use of an inert atmosphere can extend this range above 1000°C. With laser heating the sample can reach temperature above 5000°C, but the minimum temperature that can be measured when using a laser-heating system is ~1200°C and the measurement is much less precise. Advances in resistive heating are closing the gap between the two techniques so that systems can be studied from room temperature to beyond 5700°C with the combination of the two.|$|E
