5000|$|In {{polymers}} {{the glass}} transition temperature, Tg, is often expressed {{as the temperature}} at which the Gibbs free energy is such that the activation energy for the cooperative movement of 50 or so elements of the polymer is exceeded [...] This allows molecular chains to slide past each other when a force is applied. From this definition, {{we can see that}} the introduction of relatively stiff chemical groups (such as benzene rings) will interfere with the flowing process and hence increase Tg.The stiffness of thermoplastics decreases due to this effect (see figure.) When the <b>glass</b> <b>temperature</b> has been reached, the stiffness stays the same for a while, i.e., at or near E2, until the temperature exceeds Tm, and the material melts.

50|$|Both in the Solar System and in circumstellar disks {{crystalline}} silicates {{are found}} at large distances from the star. The origin of these silicates {{is a matter}} of debate. Although in the hot inner-disk regions crystalline silicates can be produced by means of gas-phase condensation or thermal annealing, the typical grain temperatures in the outer-disk (2-20 au) regions are far below the <b>glass</b> <b>temperature</b> of silicates of approx 1,000 K. The crystals in these regions may have been transported outward through the disk or in an outward-flowing wind ''''. An alternative source of crystalline silicates in the outer disk regions is in situ annealing, for example by shocks or lightning. A third way to produce crystalline silicates is the collisional destruction of large parent bodies in which secondary processing has taken place.

40|$|Amorphous lactose {{has been}} {{identified}} as being one of the major factors in causing stickiness and caking problems when producing and storing dairy powders. Amorphous lactose becomes sticky when its <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> is exceeded. Above the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> it changes to a state where it is a very viscous liquid, and it can flow and build bridges between particles, causing them to become stuck together. Stickiness in amorphous substances depends on the viscosity of the substance, which is a function of how far above the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> the actual temperature of the powder is. This work details investigations into the rate and extent of sticking in amorphous lactose, at different <b>temperatures</b> above the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature,</b> to find what conditions should be avoided when processing and storing powders containing amorphous lactose. Methods for predicting the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> of amorphous lactose as a function of water activity and moisture content were identified. The <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> of pure amorphous lactose can be estimated from the moisture content, but in a commercial dairy powder the presence of other components makes this a very difficult exercise. It was concluded {{that the best way to}} estimate the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> was from a water activity measurement, using a third order model fitted to the available <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> data. It was found that the sticking behaviour of amorphous lactose depends on how far above the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> it is, irrespective of the temperature and humidity conditions required to achieve this. From investigations into the rate of sticking of amorphous lactose it was found that 25 °C above the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> amorphous lactose becomes very sticky instantaneously. As such, moisture and temperature conditions that cause the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> to be exceeded by this amount should be avoided in all regimes of powder processing. It is also recommended that for processing operations where particle contact times are of the order of a few seconds to a few minutes, the temperature should not be allowed to exceed the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature</b> by more than 10 °C in order to avoid possible stickiness problems. For long-term storage, powders containing amorphous lactose should be kept in conditions below the <b>glass</b> transition <b>temperature.</b> Crystallisation of amorphous lactose is recognised as contributing to caking problems, through moisture release and solidification of amorphous bridges. A model for amorphous lactose crystallisation has been confirmed by newly published data. Further crystallisation data is still required at low humidities and high temperatures, but the current model can be used to predict crystallisation rates with reasonable confidence...|$|R

Once the pellets are fully dissolved in the solvent, HA was added to the solution. 15 minutes were given for each sample to provide a homogenous mixture.
