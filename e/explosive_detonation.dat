The shock tube is designed to expose materials and structures to extreme loading conditions, such as accidental explosions or terrorist attacks. The intensity of the loading {{in the present study}} was determined by the initial conditions of the compressed gas, i. e. volume and pressure, and the resulting loading on the target plate was compared to experimental data from <b>explosive</b> <b>detonations</b> found in the literature. The square plates were manufactured from a low-strength aluminium alloy and had an exposed area of 0. 3 × 0. 3 [*]m 2. Piezoelectric pressure sensors were used for pressure recordings and synchronized with two high-speed cameras operating at a frame rate of 21, 000 fps in a stereoscopic setup to capture the dynamic response using a three-dimensional digital image correlation (3 D-DIC) technique.

5000|$|The Arrow {{system was}} {{originally}} designed and optimized to intercept short and medium-range ballistic missiles with ranges above 200 km. It {{is not intended}} to intercept either military aircraft or artillery rockets, the second of which are relatively small and short ranged. In contrast to THAAD, RIM-161 Standard Missile 3, and MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3, that use kinetic, direct impact to destroy the target ("hit-to-kill") the Arrow 2 relies on <b>explosive</b> <b>detonation.</b> [...] Arrow 2 is able to intercept its targets above the stratosphere, high enough so that any nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons do not scatter over Israel. [...] The developers' intention was to perform the destruction sequence away from populated locations. According to Dr. Uzi Rubin, the missile was tested to determine whether chemical warfare agents would reach the ground should such a warhead be intercepted. The conclusion was that nothing would reach the ground if the warhead is destroyed above the jet stream, which flows from west to east and would therefore blow any chemical residue. [...] Nevertheless, Arrow is also capable of low altitude interception, as well as multi-tactical ballistic missiles interception.|$|E
50|$|Generally, thermal hazards from {{explosives}} {{events are}} of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With {{the release of}} energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously. This {{does not imply that}} there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment. The time available to react to a thermal event does increases survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an <b>explosive</b> <b>detonation</b> on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&E) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&E is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death.|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional {{axisymmetric}} hydrodynamic {{models were}} developed using GEODYN {{to simulate the}} propagation of air blasts resulting {{from a series of}} high <b>explosive</b> <b>detonations</b> conducted at Kirtland Air Force Base in August and September of 2007. Dubbed Humble Redwood I (HR- 1), these near-surface chemical high <b>explosive</b> <b>detonations</b> consisted of seven shots of varying height or depth of burst. Each shot was simulated numerically using GEODYN. An adaptive mesh refinement scheme based on air pressure gradients was employed such that the mesh refinement tracked the advancing shock front where sharp discontinuities existed in the state variables, but allowed the mesh to sufficiently relax behind the shock front for runtime efficiency. Comparisons of overpressure, sound speed, and positive phase impulse from the GEODYN simulations were made to the recorded data taken from each HR- 1 shot. Where the detonations occurred above ground or were shallowly buried (no deeper than 1 m), the GEODYN model was able to simulate the sound speeds, peak overpressures, and positive phase impulses to within approximately 1 %, 23 %, and 6 %, respectively, of the actual recorded data, supporting the use of numerical simulation of the air blast as a forensic tool in determining the yield of an otherwise unknown explosion...|$|R
