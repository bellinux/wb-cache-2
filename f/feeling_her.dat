5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of red nail polish {{dripping}} from a bottle. It then cuts to Buchanan, who is lying and tapping her foot against the floor. She begins to start <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> body. In the next scene, Range is seen {{standing in front of}} a mirror with a red lollipop, where she later begins to dance against the sink. Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a hand dryer, which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively. The final scene shows the group in front of the cubicles where they begin dancing robotically.|$|E
5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. The rocket lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down the rocket with a 12 gauge shotgun, but the rocket crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> religion has lost its soul.|$|E
25|$|Clark started {{bringing}} prostitutes back {{to their}} apartment {{to have sex with}} both of them. Then, Clark began to take an interest in an 11-year-old girl who was a neighbor. Bundy helped lure the girl into sexual games and posing for sexual photographs. The pedophilia wasn't enough for them, however, and Clark started to talk about how much he would like to kill a girl during sex and persuaded Carol {{to go out and buy}} two automatic pistols for him to use. Reportedly, Clark was striving to fulfill his fantasy of killing a woman during sex and <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> vaginal contractions during the death spasms.|$|E

25|$|A {{locomotive}} cut {{the car in}} half, killing {{my father}} instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing – dazed but erect – beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> dress, {{as if trying to}} discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} to Lizaveta Prokofyevna and General Yepanchin that their {{daughter}} {{is in love with}} the Prince, but Aglaya denies this and angrily dismisses talk of marriage. She continues to mock and reproach him, often in front of others, and lets slip that, as far as she is concerned, the problem of Nastassya Filippovna is yet to be resolved. Myshkin himself merely experiences an uncomplicated joy in her presence and is mortified when she appears to be angry with him. Lizaveta Prokofyevna feels it is time to introduce the Prince to their aristocratic circle and a dinner party is arranged for this purpose, to be attended by a number of eminent and influential persons. Aglaya, who does not share her parents' respect for these people and is afraid that Myshkin's eccentricity will not meet with their approval, tries to tell him how to behave, but ends by sarcastically telling him to be as eccentric as he likes, and to be sure to wave his arms about when he is pontificating on some high-minded subject and break her mother's priceless Chinese vase. <b>Feeling</b> <b>her</b> anxiety, Myshkin too becomes extremely anxious, but he tells her that it is nothing compared to the joy he feels in her company. He tries to approach the subject of Nastasya Filippovna again, but she silences him and hurriedly leaves.|$|E
500|$|Nomura noted {{he liked}} Ayumi Ito as an actress, and wished {{to work with}} her on Advent Children. With Aerith's voice actor already decided, Nomura asked Ito to voice Tifa, <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> [...] "husky voice" [...] would offer a good {{contrast}} to Maaya Sakamoto's soft-spoken Aerith. Nomura additionally noted that after completing Tifa's updated design, the producers debated about her finalized details, but once Ito had been cast for the role they chose to blend many traits from the voice actress into the character's final appearance.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{signed a}} record deal with Columbia Records in 1998 {{and the next}} year she {{released}} her debut album titled Sweet Kisses. The album featured mostly ballads, and was targeted at a more mature audience than the works of her contemporaries, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Simpson even stayed true to her Christian beliefs and dressed conservatively, unlike her peers. The album only managed a peak of number twenty-five on the US Billboard 200, far from the success of her contemporaries. This led Simpson to reevaluate her career and although she was enjoying some success, she felt she could improve on this. <b>Feeling</b> <b>her</b> more [...] "innocent" [...] image would halt her career from developing further, Simpson adopted a sexier image and newer sound, at the suggestion of the Columbia executives.|$|E
500|$|Bryan Cranston {{plays the}} role of Shannon. He {{was one of the first}} actors Refn looked to cast, as he was a fan of the TV series Breaking Bad. Knowing Cranston had other opportunities, Refn tried to {{interest}} him by asking how he would like to develop the role. After not hearing back, Refn called him, at the very same time that Cranston was writing on a piece of paper the pros and cons of doing Drive. Moved by Refn's interest, he accepted the part. Christina Hendricks plays the small role of Blanche. [...] "Trying to work in a more reality arena for a character like that," [...] Refn originally auditioned porn stars for Blanche. He was unable to find anyone with the necessary acting talent. After meeting with Hendricks, he decided to cast the actress, <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> [...] "powerhouse" [...] persona would click with the character.|$|E
500|$|A melancholy love song, its lyrics {{depict a}} woman torn between love and ambition. [...] "West Coast" [...] {{also serves as}} a {{dedication}} to Del Rey's California hometown, and elicits imagery from its titular location. In the song, she sings about leaving a lover for the Californian promise of fame, and emphasizes on a gulf between a sweetly uncomplicated romance and a boozily dysfunctional relationship. Similarly to her previous works, the lyrics are both specific and vague, and complement the track's [...] "dreamlike" [...] sonics. [...] "West Coast" [...] sets up a disunity between form and content, and though a love song, its sound is more reminiscent to that of a breakup song. It was also noted that the lyrics depict a vivid picture of teenage summer memories and forgotten romance. Comparing the track's lyrical content to that of Sonic Youth's [...] "Superstar" [...] (1994), Grantland's Molly Lambert analyzed: [...] "While Born to Die–era Lana often displayed a preening 'please notice me, Mr. Producer!' energy, the Lana of 'West Coast' sounds like a starlet struggling not to become disaffected with show business after <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> way through a few too many casting-couch sessions, still hoping that big break might be on the horizon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonya Yakovlevna Parnokh {{was born}} into a well-to-do family of {{professional}} Jews in a provincial city outside the Pale of Settlement.

From a young age, she wrote poetry and acknowledged her uniqueness—her lesbianism, her Graves’ disease, and her religion—which set her apart from her peers.|$|E
2500|$|Homura {{attempts}} to face Walpurgisnacht, but is ultimately defeated and draws close to despair, <b>feeling</b> <b>her</b> efforts have become pointless. Just then, Madoka appears {{and uses the}} built up energy from several timelines to become a powerful magical girl with the wish to stop all witches in the past, present, and future before they are created. The scope of this wish rewrites history {{and the laws of}} the universe, and her existence as a human girl is erased from time. Instead, she transcends into a cosmic phenomenon called [...] "The Law of Cycles", which appears to all magical girls at the moment before they become witches and rescues them by taking them away to a heavenly paradise. In the new reality that is formed, Homura {{is the only one who}} remembers Madoka.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the second}} oldest of the four Shuzen vampire sisters. She has light hair and a dark complexion. Although she {{exhibits}} a naive, childlike personality, she is a top assassin. Her fighting style is like {{a child with a}} tantrum: when she cries, she can kill without <b>feeling.</b> <b>Her</b> crucifix earrings act as power restraints, similar to Moka's rosario; when one is taken off, she can transform her arm into an array of a sharp bat wing. She can block out pain during a battle, but risks incurring fatal wounds because of it. When both off her earrings are removed, her body becomes a blood-like liquid where she can survive decapitations, transform both hands into razor wings, and discharge drops of herself as high velocity concussive projectiles. Kahlua first appears in the Land of the Snow Fairies to facilitate alliance negotiations between the Snow Fairies and Fairy Tale; but if the alliance is not accepted, she is to execute everyone. She decimates the Newspaper Club, and fights Moka with an earring removed until Miyabi intervenes and cancels the order. At the Fairy Tale headquarters, she supports her mother in fighting the Newspaper Club. After Koko fatally stabs her while she is paralyzed by holy water, Kahlua reveals that the chaos she and her mother has been causing was to win back their father's heart. In the final Season II volume, Miyabi infuses her with his First Ancestor blood, stating that she was [...] "too innocent to die"; in the epilogue bonus comics, she makes a miraculous recovery, and partners with Aqua to grow the Shuzen family's influence. Her name is based on Kahlúa, a coffee-flavored liqueur.|$|E
