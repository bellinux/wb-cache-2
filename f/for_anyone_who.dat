Management of affected specimens includes washing and thorough drying, with a subsequent realocation to an archival setting.|$|E

5|$|A {{radiographic}} evaluation {{using an}} X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can {{determine if there}} is damage to the spinal column {{and where it is}} located. X-rays are commonly available and can detect instability or misalignment of the spinal column, but do not give very detailed images and can miss injuries to the spinal cord or displacement of ligaments or disks that do not have accompanying spinal column damage. Thus when X-ray findings are normal but SCI is still suspected due to pain or SCI symptoms, CT or MRI scans are used. CT gives greater detail than X-rays, but exposes the patient to more radiation, and it still does not give images of the spinal cord or ligaments; MRI shows body structures in the greatest detail. Thus it is the standard <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> has neurological deficits found in SCI or is thought to have an unstable spinal column injury.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments.
