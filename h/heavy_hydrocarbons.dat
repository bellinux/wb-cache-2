25|$|The chief use of ethane is the {{production}} of ethene (ethylene) by steam cracking. When diluted with steam and briefly heated to very high temperatures (900nbsp&°C or more), <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> break down into lighter hydrocarbons, and saturated hydrocarbons become unsaturated. Ethane is favored for ethene production because the steam cracking of ethane is fairly selective for ethene, while the steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons yields a product mixture poorer in ethene and richer in heavier alkenes (olefins), such as propene (propylene) and butadiene, and in aromatic hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{industry}} {{of the later}} Industrial Revolution was gas lighting. Though others made a similar innovation elsewhere, the large-scale introduction of this {{was the work of}} William Murdoch, an employee of Boulton & Watt, the Birmingham steam engine pioneers. The process consisted of the large-scale gasification of coal in furnaces, the purification of the gas (removal of sulphur, ammonia, and <b>heavy</b> <b>hydrocarbons),</b> and its storage and distribution. The first gas lighting utilities were established in London between 1812 and 1820. They soon became one of the major consumers of coal in the UK. Gas lighting affected social and industrial organisation because it allowed factories and stores to remain open longer than with tallow candles or oil. Its introduction allowed nightlife to flourish in cities and towns as interiors and streets could be lighted on a larger scale than before.|$|E
30|$|The {{processes}} of solution in, and exsolution from, formation water influence the component content {{of natural gas}} by contrasting the relative contents of components before the natural gas dissolves in water and those after exsolving from water under different conditions of high temperatures and pressures. Compared with the composition of original natural gas, the relative content of methane and nitrogen increased after the natural gas dissolved in water. The increase of nitrogen content exceeds that of methane, but the content of ethane, propane, pentane etc reduced. At the same temperature and with pressure increasing the content of methane increased and that of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced. At the same pressure the content of methane increased quickly from 90 °C to 120 °C, {{and the content of}} <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced. But at even higher temperatures, the increase of methane slowed down and the content of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> increased slightly. At the same temperature and different pressures, <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced much more with increasing carbon atom number, while with temperature increasing the content difference of <b>heavier</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> reduced. Therefore, the influence of the solution and exsolution should be considered {{in the study of the}} migration and accumulation mechanism of natural gas.|$|R

In this method we correlate the ratio of fugacity to mole fraction of the gas at zero pressure against the mixture solubility parameter and temperature. The high pressure fugacity is determined by adding a Poynting correction. The required partial volume of the gas is correlated against solubility parameter and temperature. ^ The K-values of the light gases calculated from this new correlation deviate from experimental data by about six percent on the average, which is an improvement over the Chao-Seader and Grayson-Stread correlations which have been used previously. ^ The new correlation is also used to predict the solubility of hydrogen and methane in coal liquids. These predictions also deviate from the experimental data by six percent on the average. ...|$|R
