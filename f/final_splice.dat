40|$|Protein {{splicing}} is a posttranslational modification {{in which}} an intein domain excises itself out of a host protein. Here, we investigate how the steps in the splicing process are coordinated so as to maximize {{the production of the}} <b>final</b> <b>splice</b> products and minimize the generation of undesired cleavage products. Our approach has been to prepare a branched intermediate (and analogs thereof) of the Mxe GyrA intein using protein semi-synthesis. Kinetic analysis of these molecules indicates that the high fidelity of this protein splicing reaction results from the penultimate step in the process (intein-succinimide formation) being rate-limiting. NMR experiments indicate that formation of the branched intermediate affects the local structure around the amide bond cleaved during succinimide formation. We propose that this structural change reflects a re-organization of the catalytic apparatus to accelerate succinimide formation at the C-terminal splice junction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTranslation of goose {{parvovirus}} (GPV) 72 kDa Rep 1 is initiated from unspliced P 9 -generated mRNAs in ORF 1 {{from the}} first in-frame AUG (537 AUG); however, this AUG is bypassed in spliced P 9 -generated RNA: translation of the 52 kDa Rep 2 protein from spliced RNA is initiated in ORF 2 at the next AUG downstream (650 AUG). Usage of the 537 AUG was restored in spliced RNA when the GPV intron was replaced with a chimeric SV 40 intron, or following specific mutations of the GPV intron which did {{not appear in the}} <b>final</b> <b>spliced</b> mRNA. Additionally, 650 AUG usage was gained in unspliced RNA when the GPV intron splice sites were debilitated. Splicing-dependent regulation of translation initiation was mediated in cis by GPV RNA surrounding the target AUGs. Thus, nuclear RNA processing of GPV P 9 -generated pre-mRNAs has a complex, but significant, effect on alternative translation initiation of the GPV Rep proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} of ATP {{in the second}} step of mRNA precursor splicing was examined by dissecting the two steps of the in vitro splicing reaction using a heat-treated nuclear extract from HeLa cells. When a mRNA precursor containing two exons and a single intron from the delta-crystallin gene was initially incubated for 60 min with the heated extract, thereby allowing {{only the first step}} of the splicing reaction to occur, and subsequently with a normal extract for 10 min, the <b>final</b> <b>spliced</b> product was produced without any lag. The production of the spliced molecule during the second incubation with the normal extract represents conversion of the intermediates already formed with the heated extract into the spliced product. The conversion was stimulated by the addition of ATP during the second incubation and inhibited by a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. These results led us to conclude that ATP is required for the second step of the splicing reaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of the {{two major}} simian virus 40 mRNA molecules (19 S mRNA and 16 S mRNA) made at late times in the infective cycle was reinvestigated. By using a modified S 1 nuclease technique, we were able to differentiate between pulse-labeled RNA precursor and the spliced mRNA. During a 5 -min pulse-labeling with [3 H]uridine in vivo, only precursor RNA molecules were detected. Experimental results with polyadenylic acid-selected 5 -min pulse-labeled RNA are consistent with the notion that simian virus 40 late RNA can be polyadenylated before <b>final</b> <b>splicing.</b> Finally, 19 S mRNA was spliced much more rapidly and appeared more quickly in the cytoplasm than 16 S mRNA. Nevertheless, approximately one-half the precursor molecules were destined to become 16 S mRNA. Thus, for at least these two viral mRNA's derived from a common transcription unit, the rate of splicing and the rate of nuclear exist are not major determinants of relative mRNA abundance...|$|R
40|$|Splicing by {{directed}} ligation (SDL) is {{a method}} of in-phase joining of PCR-generated DNA fragments {{that is based on}} a pre-designed combination of class IIS restriction endonuclease recognition and cleavage sites. Since these enzymes cleave outside of their recognition sites, the resulting sticky end can have any desired sequence, and the site itself can be removed and does not appear in the <b>final</b> <b>spliced</b> DNA product. SDL is based on the addition of class IIS recognition sites onto primers used to amplify DNA sequences. Cleavage of the PCR products results in elimination of the recognition site-containing flanking sequences and leaves the DNA fragments crowned with protruding ends. With careful design of the sticky ends, several segments can be ligated together in a predetermined order in a single reaction. SDL requires fewer rounds of amplification than overlap extension methods, and is particularly useful for creating a series of recombinants that differ in one segment...|$|R

Because the key value is the offset of text, the sorting result is the read-in order of file. When writing in the file, only the value part is output, and the <b>final</b> file <b>splices</b> partial ciphertexts based on the order and forms splices ciphertext for output.|$|R
40|$|Human RNPS 1 was {{originally}} {{characterized as a}} pre-mRNA splicing activator in vitro and was shown to regulate alternative splicing in vivo. RNPS 1 was also identified as a protein component of the splicing-dependent mRNP complex, or exon-exon junction complex (EJC), and a role for RNPS 1 in postsplicing processes has been proposed. Here we demonstrate that RNPS 1 incorporates into active spliceosomes, enhances {{the formation of the}} ATP-dependent A complex, and promotes the generation of both intermediate and <b>final</b> <b>spliced</b> products. RNPS 1 is phosphorylated in vivo and interacts with the CK 2 (casein kinase II) protein kinase. Serine 53 (Ser- 53) of RNPS 1 was identified as the major phosphorylation site for CK 2 in vitro, and the same site is also phosphorylated in vivo. The phosphorylation status of Ser- 53 significantly affects splicing activation in vitro, but it does not perturb the nuclear localization of RNPS 1. In vivo experiments indicated that the phosphorylation of RNPS 1 at Ser- 53 influences the efficiencies of both splicing and translation. We propose that RNPS 1 is a splicing regulator whose activator function is controlled in part by CK 2 phosphorylation...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{repeating unit}} of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome. Besides {{being involved in}} packaging DNA, nucleosome organization {{plays an important role}} in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a "ground state" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this "ground state" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the <b>final</b> <b>spliced</b> mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H 3 K 4 m 3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H 3 K 27 m 3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the conserved {{sequence}} features of inteins (protein "introns") reveals {{that they are}} composed of three distinct modular domains. The N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) domains are predicted to perform {{different parts of the}} autocatalytic protein splicing reaction. An optional endonuclease domain (EN) is shown to correspond to different types of homing endonucleases in different inteins. The N domain contains motifs predicted to catalyze the first steps of protein splicing, leading to the cleavage of the intein N terminus from its protein host. Intein N domain motifs are also found in C-terminal autocatalytic domains (CADs) present in hedgehog and other protein families. Specific residues in the N domain of intein and CADs are proposed to form a charge relay system involved in cleaving their N-termini. The intein C domain is apparently unique to inteins and contains motifs that catalyze the <b>final</b> protein <b>splicing</b> steps: ligation of the intein flanks and cleavage of its C terminus to release the free intein and spliced host protein. All intein EN domains known thus far have dodecapeptide (DOD, LAGLI-DADG) type homing endonuclease motifs. This work identifies an EN domain with an HNH homing-endonuclease motif and two new small inteins with no EN domains. One of these small inteins might be inactive or a "pseudo intein. " The results suggest a modular architecture for inteins, clarify their origin and relationship to other protein families, and extend recent experimental findings on the functional roles of intein N, C, and EN motifs...|$|R
40|$|Motivation. Alternative {{splicing}} events (ASEs) are {{prevalent in}} the transcriptome of eukaryotic species and are known to influence many biological phenomena. The identification and quantification of these events are crucial for {{a better understanding of}} biological processes. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have allowed deep characterization of transcriptomes and made it possible to address these issues. ASEs analysis, however, represents a challenging task especially when many different samples need to be compared. Some popular tools for the analysis of ASEs are known to report thousands of events without annotations and/or graphical representations. A new tool for the identification and visualization of ASEs is here described, which can be used by biologists without a solid bioinformatics background. Results. A software suite named Splicing Express was created to perform ASEs analysis from transcriptome sequencing data derived from next-generation DNA sequencing platforms. Its major goal is to serve the needs of biomedical researchers who do not have bioinformatics skills. Splicing Express performs automatic annotation of transcriptome data (GTF files) using gene coordinates available from the UCSC genome browser and allows the analysis of data from all available species. The identification of ASEs is done by a known algorithm previously implemented in another tool named Splooce. As a <b>final</b> result, <b>Splicing</b> Express creates a set of HTML files composed of graphics and tables designed to describe the expression profile of ASEs among all analyzed samples. By using RNA-Seq data from the Illumina Human Body Map and the Rat Body Map, we show that Splicing Express is able to perform all tasks in a straightforward way, identifying well-known specific events. Availability and Implementation. Splicing Express is written in Perl and is suitable to run only in UNIX-like systems. More details can be found at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|B-cell-specific plasma-membrane {{proteins}} {{are potential}} targets for either small molecule or antibody-based therapies. We {{have sought to}} annotate proteins expressed at the cell surface membrane in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using plasma-membrane-based proteomic analysis to identify previously uncharacterized and potentially B-cell-specific proteins. Proteins from plasma-membrane fractions were separated on one-dimensional gels and trypsinized fractions subjected to high-throughput MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Using this method, many known B-cell surface antigens were detected, but also known proteins not previously described in this disease or in this cellular compartment, including cell surface receptors, membrane-associated enzymes and secreted proteins, and completely unknown proteins. To validate the method, we show that BLK, a B-cell-specific kinase, {{is located in the}} CLL-plasma-membrane fraction. We also describe two novel proteins (MIG 2 B and B-cell novel protein # 1, BCNP 1), which are expressed preferentially in B cells. MIG 2 B is in a highly conserved and defined gene family containing two plasma-membrane-binding ezrin/radixin/moesin domains and a pleckstrin homology domain; the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog (UNC- 112) is a membrane-associated protein that colocalizes with integrin at cell-matrix adhesion complexes. BCNP 1 is a completely unknown protein with three predicted transmembrane domains, with three alternatively <b>spliced</b> <b>final</b> exons. Proteomic analysis may thus define new potential therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|We {{among others}} have {{recently}} demonstrated that normal cells produce “fusion mRNAs”. These fusion mRNAs do not derive from rearranged genomic loci, but rather they {{are derived from}} “early-terminated transcripts” (ETTs). Premature transcriptional termination takes place in intronic sequences that belong to “breakpoint cluster regions”. One important property of ETTs is that they exhibit an unsaturated splice donor site. This results in: (1) splicing to “cryptic exons” present in the <b>final</b> intron; (2) <b>Splicing</b> to another transcript of the same gene (intragenic trans-splicing), resulting in “exon repetitions”; (3) splicing to a transcript of another gene (intergenic trans-splicing), leading to “non-genomically encoded fusion transcripts” (NGEFTs). These NGEFTs bear the potential risk to influence DNA repair processes, since they share identical nucleotides with their DNA of origin, and thus, {{could be used as}} “guidance RNA” for DNA repair processes. Here, we present experimental data about four other genes. Three of them are associated with hemato-malignancies (ETV 6, NUP 98 and RUNX 1), while one is associated with solid tumors (EWSR 1). Our results demonstrate that all genes investigated so far (MLL, AF 4, AF 9, ENL, ELL, ETV 6, NUP 98, RUNX 1 and EWSR 1) display ETTs and produce transpliced mRNA species, indicating that this is a genuine property of translocating genes...|$|R
40|$|Since multi-site reconstructions {{are less}} {{affected}} by site-specific climatic effects and artefacts, regional palaeotemperature reconstructions {{based on a}} number of sites can provide more robust estimates of centennial- to millennial-scale temperature trends than individual, site-specific records. Furthermore, reconstructions based on multiple records are necessary for developing continuous climate records over time scales longer than covered by individual sequences. Here, we present a procedure for developing such reconstructions based on relatively short (centuries to millennia), discontinuously sampled records as are typically developed when using biotic proxies in lake sediments for temperature reconstruction. The approach includes an altitudinal correction of temperatures, an interpolation of individual records to equal time intervals, a stacking procedure for sections of the interval of interest that have the same records available, as well as a splicing procedure to link the individual stacked records into a continuous reconstruction. Variations in the <b>final,</b> stacked and <b>spliced</b> reconstruction are driven by variations in the individual records, whereas the absolute temperature values are determined by the stacked segment based on the largest number of records. With numerical simulations based on the NGRIP δ 18 O record, we demonstrate that the interpolation and stacking procedure provides an approximation of a smoothed palaeoclimate record if based on a sufficient number of discontinuously sampled records. Finally, we provide an example of a stacked and spliced palaeotemperature reconstruction 15000 – 90 calibrated 14 C yr BP based on six chironomid records from the northern and central Swiss Alps and eastern France to discuss the potential and limitations of this approach...|$|R
