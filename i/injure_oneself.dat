50|$|The {{purpose of}} the cart was to be light enough to be drawn by a well-tempered pony or cob, who would be gentle enough, {{according}} to the mores of the time, to be handled by a lady. This {{gave rise to the}} cart's name, as they were frequently used by governesses to transport their child charges. The governess rode in the cart with the passengers, where they could easily be observed. The cart was also relatively safe, being difficult to either fall from, overturn, or to <b>injure</b> <b>oneself</b> with either the horse or wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Hemilepidotus hemilepidotus {{lives in}} temperate, {{demersal}} marine environments between 66°N - 34°N. It usually lives close to rocky shores but can survive at depths {{as low as}} 450 meters. Adults feed on mussels, crabs, and barnacles. They are not harmful to humans, {{with the possible exception}} of <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself</b> on their various barbs and spines while handling one barehanded.|$|R
25|$|The Urumi:(Tamil: சுருள் பட்டாக்கத்தி surul pattai, lit. curling blade; Sinhalese: එතුණු කඩුව ethunu kaduwa; Hindi: aara) is a longsword with a {{flexible}} whip-like blade from India. Originating in the country's southern states, {{it is thought}} to have existed {{as far back as the}} Maurya dynasty (322–185 BC). The urumi is considered one of the most difficult weapons to master due to the risk of <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself.</b> It is treated as a steel whip, and therefore requires prior knowledge of that weapon.|$|R
50|$|The urumi (Malayalam: ഉറുമി, urumi; Tamil: உறுமி, urumi, Sinhalese: එතුණු කඩුව ethunu kaduwa; Hindi: āra) is a sword with a {{flexible}} whip-like blade from the Indian subcontinent. Originating in what are now southern India and Sri Lanka, {{it is thought}} to have existed {{as far back as the}} Maurya Empire. It is considered one of the most difficult weapons to master due to the risk of <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself.</b> It is treated as a steel whip, and therefore requires prior knowledge of that weapon as well as the sword. For this reason, the urumi is always taught last in Indian martial arts.|$|R
50|$|A type of {{abnormal}} behavior shown in captive animals is self-injurious behavior (SIB). Self-injurious behavior indicates any activity that involves biting, scratching, hitting, hair plucking, or eye poke {{that may result}} in <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself.</b> Although its reported incidence is low, self-injurious behavior is observed {{across a range of}} primate species, especially when they experience social isolation in infancy. Self-bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the arms, legs, shoulders, or genitals. Threat bite involves biting one’s own body—typically the hand, wrist, or forearm—while staring at the observer, conspecific, or mirror in a threatening manner. Self-hit involves striking oneself on any part of the body. Eye poking is a behavior (widely observed in primates) that presses the knuckle or finger into the orbital space above the eye socket. Hair plucking is a jerking motion applied to one’s own hair with hands or teeth, resulting in its excessive removal.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Injuries are {{a growing}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the world. Data from Southern Africa are limited, possibly because of limited research prioritization of the issue and pre-occupation with communicable diseases. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of, and assess factors associated with, self-inflicted serious injuries among in-school adolescents in Zambia. We used data collected from the 2004 Zambia Global School-Based Health Survey to estimate prevalence of self-inflicted serious injury within the past 12 months. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between selected predictor variables and reported history of having seriously <b>injured</b> <b>oneself.</b> Out of 2, 136 adolescents who participated in the Zambia 2004 Global School-based Student Health Survey, 927 (43. 4 %) reported seriously injuring themselves. Of these who reported injuries, 110 (11. 9 %) reported seriously injuring themselves on purpose. The following variables were associated with history of self inflicted injury: worry; sadness; suicidal behaviour; history of ever having been drunk and marijuana use. Reported history of injury and self-inflicted injury among in-school adolescents in Zambia are common. History of self-inflicted injury was associated with other lifestyle and psychological concerns among the study participants. ___________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
50|$|Injury {{is defined}} as damage or harm that is done or sustained. The {{potential}} of <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself</b> or others can be increased after consuming alcohol due to the certain short term effects related to the substance such as lack of coordination, blurred vision, and slower reflexes to name a few. Due to these effects the most common injuries include head, fall, and vehicle related injuries. These include a range of soft tissue damage and fractures. A study was conducted between November 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002 of patients admitted to The Ulster Hospital in Northern Ireland with fall related injuries. They found that 113 of those patients admitted to that hospital during that had consumed alcohol recently and that the injury severity was higher for those that had consumed alcohol compared to those that hadn't. Another study showed that 21% of patients admitted to the Emergency Department of the Bristol Royal Infirmary had either direct or indirect alcohol related injuries. If these figures are extrapolated {{it shows that the}} estimated number of patients with alcohol related injuries are over 7000 during the year at this ED alone.|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective: Suicide is {{the act of}} <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself</b> {{in order}} to {{destruct}} one’s life.  One of the worst ways to attempt suicide, especially in eastern countries, is self- burning. This study aimed to show the frequency of self- burning and its relationship with social and demographic status.   Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional study, all medical records of patients who admitted to Ghotbeddin E Shirazi hospital for burns during the years 2006 and 2011 were collected. The data were analyzed by SPSS- 16 software, descriptive statistical methods and chi-square tests.   Results: The results showed that from 2071 cases of burn patients admitted to Ghotbeddin E Shirazi Hospital, 439 cases (21. 1 %) {{have been caused by}} self-immolation. The proportion of self-immolation among women was 70. 7 %, in married was 58. 4 %, and in rural population was 56. 6 %. It was most prevalent in the age group of 25 - 44 years old (47. 4 %). In most cases, self-immolation was occurred with flammable liquids especially oil and gasoline (71. 8 % and 17. 3 %, respectively) and at home (90 / 8 %). 67. 8 % of cases lead to death. (Case-fatality rate was 67. 8 %). The most cause of self-immolation attempting was family disputes.   Conclusion: High self-immolation rate in females and the age group of adolescents and youth is significant which should be considered as an important issue in terms of health...|$|R
40|$|Deliberate self-harm is {{a serious}} health problem which is {{reported}} by around 3 - 11 % of adolescents in Scandinavia. The prevalence is highest {{in the age of}} 15 - 19 years. Delibrate self-harm is defined as intentionally <b>injuring</b> <b>oneself</b> in a manner that ends in damage to body tissue, but without any conscious suicidal intention. Deliberate self-harm is associated with high suicidal risk, PTSD, eating disorder, substance use disorders and personality disorders. Some risk factors for deliberate self-harm are childhood sexual and physical abuse, neglect, insecure attachment with the caregiver and too early separation from the caregiver. Dialectical behaviour therapy is developed by Marsha M. Linehan, an American psychologist, to treat suicidal women with borderline personality disorder. The therapy method is based on cognitive behaviour therapy, dialectical and zen-buddhist thinking. DBT works through skill trainings in group, individual therapy and telephon conversation. Mentalization based therapy is a new therapy method which is developed by Anthony Bateman and Peter Fonagy for treatment of patient with borderline personality disorder. This model suggests that disruption of the attachment relationship early in development, {{in the first year of}} life, in combination with later traumatic experience in an attachment context causes impaired neurobiological developments. This combination causes hyper- responsiveness of the attachment system which makes mentalizing, and unstable behaviour during emotional overwhelm. These cause a relational malfunction, unstable self-structure and destructive behaviour in borderline personality disorder. Patient with BPD try to maintain self-structure with self harm. Bateman and Fonagy mean that the correction of some of these malfunctions can be achieved by assisting patients by recovery of mentalizing...|$|R
40|$|Globally, poor {{mental health}} and {{injuries}} (includingsuicide) are ranked as {{the first and second}} highestcontributors of lost disability-adjusted life-years among young people. 1 Self-harm and suicide attempts are reported by 5 %– 17 % of people aged 14 – 25 years and may be increasing in prevalence. 2 − 5 Self-harm refers to the delib-erate <b>injuring</b> of <b>oneself</b> through such methods as superficial cutting, attempt ed hanging and poisoning. 6 Self-harm is per-formed most often by people with mental health problems and is a risk factor for suicide and other causes of death. 6 − 8 Reasons for this behaviour are not well known. They may include coping with feelings of distress, suicidal intent, cry-ing out for attention, addictive self-mutilation, impulsive behaviour, self-loathing and punishment, and attempting to feel in control. A recent study found the rate ratio of self-harm to suicide to be 36 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 34. 9 – 37. 1). ...|$|R
30|$|The {{human body}} is {{something}} substantive, resilient, and fragile, {{which suggests that}} one can see and touch other bodies, execute arduous physical actions, and easily <b>injure</b> or destroy <b>oneself</b> or others. Humans attempt to protect their bodies by taking precautions to protect it by the following means: clothing it, washing it, feeding it, and giving it medicine when necessary to cure an illness. If these observations are germane to people within the world, they are not necessarily true of ascetic attitudes towards the body that {{tend to be more}} negative by emphasizing the filthy aspects of the body. In fact, the renowned Buddhist scholar Buddhaghosa calls attention to the impurity of the body from its conception in a female body, birth, nurturing, and eventually producing another impure body as an adult (Buddhaghosa 1964).|$|R
