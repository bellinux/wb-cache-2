Various types of high speed modulators have been reported; {{among them the}} Mach-Zehnder <b>interferometric</b> <b>modulators</b> using Y-branches {{is one of the}} most widely used structures for broadband modulation because of its simplicity and easy fabrication. Traveling-wave integrated optical modulators fabricated in substrate materials for which the optical and microwave velocities are equal offer the potential of very broad modulation bandwidth.

A few of the most prominent areas of active devices are optical, thermo-optical, and electro-optical. All-optical devices have shown the capacity to become a viable source for information processing, communication, and data storage when used as a modulator. In one instance, the interaction of two light beams of different wavelengths was demonstrated by converting them into co-propagating surface plasmons via cadmium selenide quantum dots. Electro-optical devices have combined aspects of both optical and electrical devices {{in the form of a}} modulator as well. Specifically, electro-optic modulators have been designed using evanescently coupled resonant metal gratings and nanowires that rely on long-range surface plasmons (LRSP). Likewise, thermo-optic devices, which contain a dielectric material whose refractive index changes with variation in temperature, have also been used as <b>interferometric</b> <b>modulators</b> of SPP signals in addition to directional-coupler switches. Some thermo-optic devices have been shown to utilize LRSP waveguiding along gold stripes that are embedded in a polymer and heated by electrical signals as a means for modulation and directional-coupler switches.

The different inhomogeneities of the rough surface experience different polarizations, which control the ability for scattered waves to interfere at the detection plane and causes a spatially varying polarization profile.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} {{feedback}} for improving response linearity of electrooptic light modulators has been investigated. The modulator is configured as a straight channel waveguide flanked by electrodes in a lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrate. Light is coupled into the waveguide in both TE and TM polarizations, and a voltage applied across electrodes causes a relative phase shift between two polarization components. An output analyzer converts the phase modulation to intensity modulation. Optical feedback {{of light in}} both polarization modes results from reflection of light at the polished edges of the substrate. Channel waveguides supporting a single guided mode for TE and TM polarizations were fabricated in x-cut LiNbO 3 substrates using titanium-indiffusion technique. The waveguides and modulators were characterized at a wavelength of 1. 55 ??m using a distributed feedback laser. The modulators were driven with a sinusoidal voltage waveform. To minimize harmonics of the modulating frequency in the intensity output, {{the magnitude of the}} optical feedback and the substrate temperature were adjusted. The feedback level was altered by applying refractive index-matching liquid to one or both ends of the waveguide {{at the edges of the}} crystal. It was found that a high degree of response linearity in the presence of feedback was achievable at certain substrate temperatures. The spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) relative to the noise floor was measured at different feedback levels and substrate temperatures in an effort to maximize the modulator response linearity. An SFDR of 68. 04 dB, limited by third-order nonlinearity, was achieved by applying index-matching fluid to the input end of the substrate. This compares with an SFDR of 64. 84 dB limited by second-order nonlinearity when index-matching fluid was applied at both ends of the substrate. By changing the temperature of the same substrate to adjust the phase shifts experienced by TE and TM polarizations, the SFDR with index-matching fluid at the input end increased to 71. 83 dB, limited by third-order nonlinearity. In tests at constant modulation depth, an improvement of as much as 9. 6 dB in SFDR vs. the theoretical value for an <b>interferometric</b> <b>modulator</b> without feedback was achieved...|$|R

Here, we eval-uate the potential of GC x GC for the analysis of the fatty acid profile of milk from dairy cows fed either a control diet or the control diet supplemented with marine algae. Fatty acids were separated using two column combinations, a nonpolar/polar arrangement and a polar/nonpolar arrangement. Due to the difference in separation mechanism of the two columns, GC x GC resulted in an improved separation compared with analysis on the same column set without the use of the <b>modulator.</b> <b>Displaying</b> the peaks in a 2 -D contour plot showed a well-ordered structure of fatty acids according to their number of carbon atoms and degree of unsaturation, facilitating identification of known and unknown compounds. Based on these relations, identification of carbon number and degree of unsaturation of several 22 -fatty acids was possible. The large difference between the 22 -fatty acids from milk fat of cows fed the control and the marine algae-containing diet suggest that rumen hydrogenation of 22 : 6 n- 3 results in a similar com-plex profile of hydrogenation intermediates as observed for 18 : 2 n- 6 and 18 : 3 n- 3. In conclusion, this experiment suggests GC x GC to be a powerful technique for the analysis of fatty acids.
