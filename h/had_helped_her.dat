5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of Lefkada paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. When the men married, they agreed to let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> buy her freedom.|$|E
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|Having had {{the crown}} {{restored}} to her daughter, Elizabeth immediately proceeded to reward those who <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her,</b> giving a castle in Gimes to Blaise Forgách, {{the master of}} the cupbearers, who had mortally wounded Charles. In April, Sigismund was brought to Hungary by his brother Wenceslaus and the queens were pressured into accepting him as Mary's future co-ruler by the Treaty of Győr. Having Charles murdered did not help Elizabeth as much as she hoped it would, however, as Charles's supporters immediately recognized his son Ladislaus as heir and fled to Zagreb. Bishop Paul pawned church estates in order to collect money for an army against the queens.|$|E

5|$|Initial police {{speculation}} {{was that}} Kinne had bribed guards {{to look the}} other way while she escaped the prison—an unusual blackout had been reported at the prison on the evening of and at the approximate time of her escape, and investigation showed that a door that should have been locked had been left unsecured—but further questioning of prison guards and administration showed that oversight at the prison was generally lax and that it was staffed by fewer guards than it should have been. News reports of the time reported numerous theories about Kinne's escape, including that she had bribed prison guards, that she may have enlisted the help of a supposed boyfriend who was a Mexico City policeman, that Kinne's mother had been involved in the escape plan, that a former Mexican secret service agent had assisted in her escape, and that Kinne may have disguised herself as a man to effect her escape. A more modern theory speculates that the family of Francisco Parades Ordoñez <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> escape and then killed her.|$|E

At a young age, the Geyers moved to Sydney where her parents were managers of a migrant hostel. Geyer describes herself as a problem child, and her parents called her übermutig (German for reckless).

500|$|During the shoot, Harris {{suffered}} from depression, {{and believed that}} her co-stars {{did not take the}} film as seriously as she did. At times, she would cry in her makeup chair prior to the day's shoot. Bloom did not speak to Harris while filming continued, which worsened her depression. Afterward, Bloom told Harris that the lack of interaction <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> build her own performance and the two women reconciled. [...] Harris incorporated her own depression into her performance. Wise heightened the sense of character conflict by having the characters [...] "step on one another's lines", allowing one character to begin talking before the other had finished.

500|$|In an {{interview}} for a Billboard podcast, Nile Rodgers spoke about the song's recording sessions and working with Gaga and Warren. He had met Gaga in a party and she invited him to join them in the studio. During recording, Gaga was singing in a D note, over the F note of the music that was being played. Rodgers suggested to Warren that since the D vocals made the song sound like a country track, they could instead inverse the chords into thirteenth (an octave plus a sixth), thus serving a dominant function. Warren accepted the suggestion and the song was re-recorded. Gaga reportedly struggled while recording the song, since it caused her to recall her own trauma. Warren explained that it was: [...] "very emotional for her. She couldn't even talk through it at times". Gaga told {{an interview}}er with Variety that Warren <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> feel comfortable about the song and its subject matter, allowing her to transcend the singing and put the correct emotional depth in her performance.|$|E

500|$|Wallis's {{relationship}} with the King had become public knowledge in the United Kingdom by early December. She decided to flee the country as the scandal broke, and was driven {{to the south of}} France in a dramatic race to outrun the press. For the next three months, she was under siege by the media at the Villa Lou Viei, near Cannes, the home of her close friends Herman and Katherine Rogers. At her hideaway, Wallis was pressured by the King's Lord-in-Waiting, Lord Brownlow, to renounce the King. On 7 December 1936, Lord Brownlow read to the press her statement, which he <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> draft, indicating Wallis's readiness to give up the King. However, Edward was determined to marry Wallis. John Theodore Goddard, Wallis's solicitor, stated: [...] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but {{the other end of the}} wicket [...] was determined." [...] This seemingly indicated that the King had decided he had no option but to abdicate if he wished to marry Wallis.|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|Dr R. Nagulendran, a {{consultant}} psychiatrist, testified that Tan was mentally impaired by reactive psychotic depression. [...] According to {{him she was}} depressed before she met Lim, due to her family background. [...] Physical abuse and threats from Lim deepened her depression; drug abuse led her to hallucinate and believe the medium's lies. [...] Dr Chee disagreed; he said that Tan had admitted to being quite happy with the material lifestyle Lim gave to her, enjoying fine clothes and beauty salon treatments. [...] A sufferer from reactive psychotic depression would not have paid such attention to her appearance. [...] Also, Tan had earlier confessed to knowing Lim was a fraud, but changed her stance in court to claim she was acting completely under his influence. [...] Although Dr Chee had neglected Lim's physical abuse of Tan in his judgment, he was firm in his opinion that Tan was mentally sound during the crimes. [...] Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Chee agreed that Hoe suffered from schizophrenia long before she met Lim, and that her stay in Woodbridge Hospital <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> recovery. [...] However, while Dr Nagulendran was convinced that Hoe suffered a relapse {{during the time of}} the child killings, Dr Chee pointed out that none of the Woodbridge doctors saw any signs of relapse during the six months of her follow-up checks (16July 1980 [...] 31January 1981). If Hoe had been as severely impaired by her condition as Dr Nagulendran described, she would have become an invalid. [...] Instead, she methodically abducted and helped kill a child on two occasions. [...] Ending his testimony, Dr Chee stated that it was incredible that three people with different mental illnesses should share a common delusion of receiving a request to kill from a god.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, when Denmark was {{occupied}} by the Germans, Blixen started her only full-length novel, the introspective tale The Angelic Avengers, under another pseudonym, Pierre Andrezel. Though {{it was written in}} Danish, she claimed that it was a translation of a French work written between the wars and denied being its author. The book was published in 1944 and nominated for a third Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Blixen initially did not want the book to be nominated, but eventually accepted the distinction. The horrors experienced by the young heroines have been interpreted as an allegory of Nazism, though Blixen also denied that interpretation, claiming instead that the novel was a distraction that <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to escape the feeling of being imprisoned by the war. In 1956, in an interview for The Paris Review, she finally acknowledged that she was the author of the novel, saying that it was her [...] "illegitimate child".
