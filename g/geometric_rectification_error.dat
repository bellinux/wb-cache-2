40|$|When {{using the}} Range-Doppler model for SAR image {{geometric}} correction, {{the error of}} satellite orbit, imaging parameter and DEM elevation will affect the geometric correction accuracy. A new <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> method has been presented for spaceborne SAR image. First, polynomial was used for parameterizing SAR orbit. Then orbit parameters were corrected by control points that acquired by matching of simulated SAR image and real SAR image. Finally, the precise <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> using corrected parameters was accomplished. The presented method can be applied for SAR image <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> where the ground control points are difficult to be acquired.

40|$|As {{the linear}} array sensor such as {{multispectral}} and hyperspectral sensor has great potential in disaster monitoring and geological survey, {{the quality of}} the image <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> should be guaranteed. Different from the <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of airborne planar array images or multi linear array images, exterior orientation elements need to be determined for each scan line of single linear array images. Internal distortion persists after applying GPS/IMU data directly to geometrical rectification. Straight lines may be curving and jagged. Straight line feature -based geometrical rectification algorithm was applied to solve this problem, whereby the exterior orientation elements were fitted by piecewise polynomial and evaluated with the straight line feature as constraint. However, atmospheric turbulence during the flight is unstable, equal piecewise can hardly provide good fitting, resulting in limited precision improvement of <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> or, in a worse case, the iteration cannot converge. To solve this problem, drawing on dynamic programming ideas, unequal segmentation of line feature-based <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> method is developed. The angle elements fitting error is minimized to determine the optimum boundary. Then the exterior orientation elements of each segment are fitted and evaluated with the straight line feature as constraint. The result indicates that the algorithm is effective in improving the precision of <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification...</b>|$|R
40|$|Precise <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of {{satellite}} imagery normally requires knowing the geodetic location of features identifiable in the image, called ground control points (GCPs). In many cases, however, {{it is difficult}} to compute a precise <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> because too few GCPs are available {{due to the lack of}} ground data or the nature of the terrain (lakes or oceans, deserts, continuous forest, etc). When too few GCPs are available, Space Oblique Mercator (SOM) projection theory can be applied to provide continuous precise <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of image tiles or scenes. We use GCPs from adjacent, prim; or subsequent image tiles to create the projection geometry for the intermediate tiles. Ir. this paper, we report on the development of a procedure to implement the use of ancillary GCPs in georectifying under-controlled imagery. To validate our method, a test example was computed using 1999 data obtained by a panchromatic camera on board the Indian Remote Sensing satellite IRS- 1 C with a spatial resolution of 5. 8 m. The testing showed that the precision of <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> in a tile without GCPs is within three pixels (about 17. 4 m), and the speed of computation is faster than with traditional methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs the <b>{{geometric}}</b> <b>rectification</b> {{methods are}} mostly based on ground control points (GCPs), the geometric accuracy of {{remote sensing image}} usually fails {{to meet the demand}} in the area of lack of feature points. Straight-line features can be the supplement of GCPs. The advantages and disadvantages of ground control straight-lines (GCLs) used for <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> were discussed in detail first. After introducing the conventional geometric correction methods based on points, this paper proposed a novel geometric correction method based on straight-line features, which is not confined to a specific imaging geometric model. Feature points and straight-line features can be united to estimate the geometric model. In the test, instead of merely using control points, the geometric accuracy of model was guaranteed by using control points together with control straight-lines in the region deficient in feature points...|$|R

40|$|Two of the {{important}} stages {{in the production of}} maps from remotely sensed imagery are rectification and classification. Residual <b>geometric</b> <b>errors</b> following <b>rectification</b> produce a “component ” of the apparent classification error. Hence, besides being of value in its own right, reduction of the <b>rectification</b> <b>error</b> will enhance the quality of the classification stage, and the classification accuracy statistics will more closely refer to “pure ” classification error rather than classification error due to pixel mismatch. In rectification to ground control points (GCPs) there is a natural limit of what can be achieved in rectification of an image, and this is determined by the cost of collecting good GCPs. However, if we are concerned with a sequence of images, and are concerned primarily with estimating change and growth, the rectification is image-to image, and the process becomes one of pixel matching, and the only cost is processing time. We present a spectrally-based pixel-matching algorithm which seems to offer considerable scope for very accurate pixel-to-pixel and hence image-to-image matching. An algorithm is used which maximizes local correlations in each spectral band at each co-registration point: a multivariate anisotropic spatial auto-correlation approach.

40|$|Low-cost Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) {{equipped}} with consumer-grade imaging systems {{have emerged as}} a potential remote sensing platform that could satisfy {{the needs of a}} wide range of civilian applications. Among these applications, UAV-based agricultural mapping and monitoring have attracted significant attention from both the research and professional communities. The interest in UAV-based remote sensing for agricultural management is motivated by the need to maximize crop yield. Remote sensing-based crop yield prediction and estimation are primarily based on imaging systems with different spectral coverage and resolution (e. g., RGB and hyperspectral imaging systems). Due to the data volume, RGB imaging is based on frame cameras, while hyperspectral sensors are primarily push-broom scanners. To cope with the limited endurance and payload constraints of low-cost UAVs, the agricultural research and professional communities have to rely on consumer-grade and light-weight sensors. However, the geometric fidelity of derived information from push-broom hyperspectral scanners is quite sensitive to the available position and orientation established through a direct geo-referencing unit onboard the imaging platform (i. e., an integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS). This paper presents an automated framework for the integration of frame RGB images, push-broom hyperspectral scanner data and consumer-grade GNSS/INS navigation data for accurate <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of the hyperspectral scenes. The approach relies on utilizing the navigation data, together with a modified Speeded-Up Robust Feature (SURF) detector and descriptor, for automating the identification of conjugate features in the RGB and hyperspectral imagery. The SURF modification takes into consideration the available direct geo-referencing information to improve the reliability of the matching procedure in the presence of repetitive texture within a mechanized agricultural field. Identified features are then used to improve the geometric fidelity of the previously ortho-rectified hyperspectral data. Experimental results from two real datasets show that the <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of the hyperspectral data was improved by almost one order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores three topics: 1) <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> of cameracaptured document images, 2) camera-captured document mosaicing, and 3) layout structure recognition. The {{first two}} topics pertain to camera-based document image analysis, {{a new trend}} within the OCR community. Compared to typical scanners,cameras offer convenient, flexible, portable, and non-contact image capture, which enables many new applications and breathes new life into existing ones. The third topic {{is related to the}} need for efficient metadata extraction methods, critical for managing digitized documents. The kernel of our <b>geometric</b> <b>rectification</b> framework is a novel method for estimating document shape from a single camera-captured image. Our method uses texture flows detected in printed text areas and is insensitive to occlusion. Classification of planar versus curved documents is done automatically. For planar pages, we obtain full metric rectification. For curved pages, we estimate a planar-strip approximation based on properties of developable surfaces. Our method can process any planar or smoothly curved document captured from an arbitrary position without requiring 3 D data, metric data, or camera calibration. For the second topic, we design a novel registration method for document images, which produces good results in difficult situations including large displacements, severe projective distortion, small overlapping areas, and lack of distinguishable feature points. We implement a selective image composition method that outperforms conventional image blending methods in overlapping areas. It eliminates double images caused by mis-registration and preserves the sharpness in overlapping areas. We solve the third topic with a graph-based model matching framework. Layout structures are modeled by graphs, which integrate local and global features and are extensible to new features in the future. Our model can handle large variation within a class and subtle differences between classes. Through graph matching, the layout structure of a document is discovered. Our layout structure recognition technique accomplishes document classification and logical component labeling at the same time. Our model learning method enables a model to adapt to changes in classes over time...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectral}} analysis algorithm {{is a viable}} technique for processing synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in near real time throughput rates by trading the image resolution.

It also describes the results of a Study to determine whether increases in the sample rate and dwell time of the National Transonic Facility data system Would result in significant changes in force and moment data. Increases in sample rate from 10 samples per second to 50 samples per second were examined, as were changes in dwell time from one second per data point to two seconds. These changes were examined for a representative aircraft model in a range of tunnel operating conditions defined by angles of attack from 0 deg to 3. 8 degrees, total pressure from 15. 0 psi to 24. 1 psi, and Mach numbers from 0. 52 to 0. 82. No statistically significant effect was associated with the change in sample rate. The change in dwell time from one second to two seconds affected axial force measurements, and to a lesser degree normal force measurements. This dwell effect comprises a "rectification error" caused by incomplete cancellation of the positive and negative elements of certain low frequency dynamic components that are not rejected by the one-Hz low-pass filters of the data system. These low frequency effects may be due to tunnel circuit phenomena and other sources. The magnitude of the dwell effect depends on dynamic pressure, with angle of attack and Mach number influencing the strength of this dependence. An analysis is presented which suggests that the magnitude of the <b>rectification</b> <b>error</b> depends on the ratio of measurement dwell time to the period of the low-frequency dynamics, as well as the amplitude of the dynamics The essential conclusion of this analysis is that extending the dwell time (or, equivalently, replicating short-dwell data points) reduces the <b>rectification</b> <b>error...</b>|$|R
