5000|$|In 1988 {{the company}} celebrated its 30th anniversary and Fritz Dräxlmaier {{received}} the [...] "Bayerischer Verdienstorden" [...] {{on behalf of}} the approximately 3,400 employees from Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss.The concept of customer-specific wire harnesses provided the catalyst for the rapid transition from a Lower Bavarian group of companies to an international enterprise. Dräxlmaier became the first supplier capable of reacting to customers' mass-production needs by manufacturing and delivering customized electrical systems in lot size 1 and just in sequence. Customer-specific wire harnesses became a reality for all three major customers - Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi - within the space of a single year.In 1993 Dräxlmaier Group started expansion into the former East Bloc by entering Czechoslovakia and Romania. The following year Dräxlmaier won out over international mega-suppliers in a concept competition. The task of designing, manufacturing and delivering the entire cockpit for the Mercedes-Benz CLK (C208) made Eldra a system supplier of interiors.In 1995 Fritz Dräxlmaier, Sr. died at 80 years of age. In the words of Minister of Economics August R. Lang, the company lost one of [...] "Lower Bavaria's most prominent entrepreneurs". Two years later the [...] "Firmengruppe Dräxlmaier" [...] was rechristened [...] "Dräxlmaier Group" [...] "(DRX)". In the same year the company won a concept competition sponsored by BMW for the E65 <b>door</b> <b>module</b> as a [...] "Functionally Integrated System" [...] (FIS). The FIS order for the BMW 7 Series was the first design order for a <b>door</b> <b>module.</b> An order for FIS center consoles soon followed.

50|$|Rockwell International’s {{acquisition}} of Golde GmbH prompted a trend of consolidation {{that lasted for}} the next 33 years. Rockwell International continued its {{acquisition of}} European suppliers when it purchased both Wilmot Breeden and CIM in 1979, expanding its international footprint and its investment in <b>door</b> <b>module</b> technology.Inteva’s three major American predecessors took multiple steps before eventually merging to form a single supplier. In 1984, Guide Lamp and Fisher Body, who had both been divisions of General Motors for almost 60 years, merged their light and hardware activities to create the Fisher Guide Division and shipped its first <b>door</b> <b>module</b> in 1987. In the same year, Inland Manufacturing merged with the seating and interiors activities of Fisher Body to form the Inland Division. Five years after these mergers, the two new divisions consolidated once more to create Inland Fisher Guide.In 1991, General Motors consolidated further by organizing all of its separate parts divisions and creating the Automotive Components Group (ACG). Four years later the group was renamed Delphi Automotive Systems and Inland Fisher Guide section became Delphi Interior and Lighting Systems. In the same year, Rockwell International spun off its automotive business and created Meritor Automotive.In 1999 Delphi Automotive Systems became independent from General Motors and as it began to gain business its different systems became more distinctive. In 2001, Delphi introduced the first full modular door system and in 2002 added cockpit modules to its portfolio. Also in 2002, the company was renamed Delphi Corporation.In 2000, Meritor Automotive merged with Arvin Industries to create ArvinMeritor, Inc. Later in 2007, the company formed its Body Systems business unit, which had combined the former doors business units from Wilmot Breeden and CIM with the sunroofs business of Golde GmbH.In 2008, the Renco Group, Inc. acquired Delphi's global Interiors and Closures businesses from Delphi Corporation and renamed the business Inteva Products, LLC.|$|E
50|$|Regular {{production}} of auto parts {{continued in the}} United States and innovation became a crucial component to any manufacturing company’s success. Fisher Body, which had long since expanded its products beyond solely creating auto bodies, shipped its first latches in 1946. Inland also began selling new products in 1951 when it shipped its first door trim panels and later instrument panels in 1956.The automotive industry in Europe was not far behind the American companies. In 1950, Traugotte Golde was renamed Golde GmbH {{and became the first}} supplier of sliding sunroofs. The world’s first sealed <b>door</b> <b>module</b> was launched in France by the Compagnie Industrielle de Mecanismes SA (CIM) in 1968. Soon, window regulators made the shift from manual to electric operation and CIM became the industry’s leader in the investment of electric motors. In 1973, Golde GmbH began the {{production of}} the world’s first tilt and slide module and in the same year was acquired by Rockwell International, a company with a history in the automotive axle business in Detroit.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{manufacturing}} system to cope with frequently changing or increasing product variants and changing production volumes is a key competitive factor in today`s volatile operational environment. After giving an introduction into the concept of changeability, the paper describes a planning approach for the structure of changeable and reconfigurable assembly systems in automotive manufacturing. The planning approach uses flexibility linked process modules as structural feature of the assembly system`s structural concept. Types of processed modules, classified by characteristics of assembly parts, are designed to perform assembly operations not taking into account product structure restrictions on assembly sequence. Process modules are then located in a layout of chessboard-like pattern under flow-oriented consideration of the product precedence graph. The paper presents a <b>door</b> <b>module</b> assembly use case, for which the assembly system structure was developed using the described planning approach...|$|E
40|$|Long Fiber Thermoplastics (LFT) are {{promising}} new materials with high physical properties and low density. These high properties are obtained by embedding very long fibers (~ 100 mm) into a thermoplastic matrix. Such a high fiber length dictates {{the use of}} a compression molding process for manufacturing as the length of discontinuous fibers in injection molding is limited by pellet length. LFT composites are of great interest for the automotive industry. These materials are already used in some interior and exterior car parts such as bumpers, seat structures, <b>door</b> <b>module</b> etc. This research is inspired by the desire to manufacture load carrying parts for vehicles such as wheel rims which would dramatically reduce vehicle weight and subsequently save fuel. This, however, requires a much better understanding of long fiber orientation and distribution during compression molding. Current orientation models were developed for short fibers(several millimetres). Recently the models are being extended even for the LFT-D fibers which can reach up to 80 mm. Since several of the governing assumptions for short fiber models are not suitable for long fibers, the models can not provide accurate results for long fibers. Due to this limitation long fibers require independent treatments. This thesis presents a new model which is specifically designed for long flexible fibers. This model is confirmed by comparing results obtained for simple shear flow to results found in the literature. The model was implemented in a rheometric squeeze flow, which is defined as flow between two approaching to each other parallel plates, and provided results previously not seen in the literature. Interactions were implemented into the model and tested for rheometric squeeze flow and simple shear flow cases. In addition to providing insight into fiber orientation and deformation in rheometric squeeze flow, which was not previously studied in the literature, the proposed model shows more predictive results than previously found in the literature...|$|E

40|$|A {{smart home}} is a {{residential}} setting equipped {{with a set of}} advanced electronics, sensors and automated devices specifically designed for care delivery, remote monitoring, early detection of problems or emergency cases and promotion of residential safety and quality of life. Smart home has been developed using different technology using wired and wireless network. In this project, Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) system has been developed and tested in real experimental home environment. SHAAL system is designed on wireless sensor network (WSN) linked to the cloud network on the Internet. The development of SHAAL is divided into two phases: the design of SHAAL network and the development of SHAAL applications. SHAAL network is made up of the home network which is the WSN and the cloud network. The WSN has been designed using TelG mote as the sensor mote and various sensor modules which include <b>door</b> <b>module,</b> lighting module, appliance module, alarm module, camera module and the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) module. TelG mote operates on Zigbee based network. The cloud network is made up of the gateway, the server and user devices running on third generation (3 G) network. The development of SHAAL applications focuses on the smart door, smart lighting, smart appliances, smart surveillance and AAL applications. The various SHAAL applications run on different platforms which areWindows,Webbased and Android based smartphone. Since many applications may run on SHAAL network, a simple data scheduling scheme has been programmed to schedule data packets based on their application types and priorities. Results show packet reception rate is improved up to 22 % using priority scheduling algorithm than the conventional First-In-First-Out method. Additionally, the performance delay of priority scheduling in the experimental test-bed is 34. 2 % less compared to the theoretical study. It is also shown that the proposed scheme can ensure higher throughput to the high priority data while gives sufficient access to low priority data. The implementation of the experimental testbed has proven that SHAAL has been successfully designed and deployed in the real world. SHAAL provides smart home automation and allows individuals to live independently in their preferred environment...|$|E
