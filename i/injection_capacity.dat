40|$|Improving the {{interface}} between electrodes and neurons {{has been the focus}} of research for the last decade. Neuroelectrodes should show small geometrical surface area and low impedance for measuring and high charge <b>injection</b> <b>capacities</b> for stimulation. Increasing the electrochemically active surface area by using nanoporous electrode material or by integrating nanostructures onto planar electrodes is a common approach to improve this interface. In this paper a simulation approach for neuro electrodes' characteristics with integrated high aspect ratio nano structures based on a point-contact-model is presented. The results are compared with experimental findings conducted with real nanostructured microelectrodes. In particular, effects of carbon nanotubes and gold nanowires integrated onto microelectrodes are described. Simulated and measured impedance properties are presented and its effects onto the transfer function between the neural membrane potential and the amplifier output signal are studied based on the point-contact-model. Simulations show, in good agreement with experimental results, that electrode impedances can be dramatically reduced by the integration of high aspect ratio nanostructures such as gold nanowires and carbon nanotubes. This lowers thermal noise and improves the signal-to-noise ratio for measuring electrodes.

Furthermore, the topside offloading process was modelled using HYSYS.

The study quantified effects related to flow capacity (pump/compressor requirements and line sizing of the riser, pipeline and well), freezing, hydrate formation, phase change and heat transfer in the offloading and injection system. With an available injection pump discharge pressure of about 120 bar, the <b>injection</b> <b>capacities</b> were predicted to about 275 kg/s on Sn∅hvit and 400 kg/s on Sleipner when assuming 7 ” ID tubing size in the well and 700 m flowline length.

R 410 A, with a GWP of 2, 088, has been widely used in residential air-conditioning and heat pump systems. A potential substitute for R 410 A is R 32, which has a GWP of 675. This paper investigates the performance difference of R 410 A and R 32 in a vapor-injected heat pump system. A drop-in test was performed using R 32 in a heat pump system that was designed for R 410 A, for both cooling and heating conditions. Through experimentation, {{it was found that}} for a single-stage cycle without vapor <b>injection,</b> the <b>capacity</b> improvement of using R 32 was between 3. 4 % and 9. 7 %, and the COP improvement was between 2. 0 % and 9. 0 %, as compared to an identical cycle using R 410 A.

40|$|As {{the amount}} of CO 2 present in the atmospheres is {{increasing}} due to combustion emission, it {{is becoming more and}} more important to find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One of the ways to do that is through carbon sequestration. Saline formations (aquifers) provide viable destination for carbon sequestration. The storage potential in these reservoirs is estimated at several thousands of Giga Tonnes (Gt) of CO 2. Even though the capacity is substantial, the process of filling this capacity has a lot of challenges. Injection of large volumes within short period of time increases the formation pressure (which should be below fracture pressure) very fast. For each particular reservoir, <b>injection</b> <b>capacity</b> should be identified based on which CO 2 can be injected within a particular injection area and time. In order to achieve this, an in-depth sensitivity study needs to be done on the various reservoir parameters such as thickness, rock compressibility, permeability, porosity, reservoir temperature and pressure, aquifer fracture pressure, number and placement of injection’s wells. The objective of my Master's thesis work is finding ways to increase the storage <b>injection</b> <b>capacity</b> based on reservoir parameters and optimizing the well placement by identifying and developing analytical and numerical tools to do so. The research also focuses on conducting a sensitivity analysis on these parameters in order to find out the optimal injection scenario to obtain {{the amount of}} maximum CO 2 sequestration in a reservoir. This study can help in the CO 2 sequestration capacity predictions and screening suitable reservoir based on technical and economic criteria. In order to derive the <b>injection</b> <b>capacity</b> of the reservoir based on the reservoir parameters, two analytical models of multiple well injections were studied: i) Single-phase (Brine injection in a brine reservoir and ii) Two phase model (CO 2 injection in a brine reservoir). In both cases, the aim is to analyse the pressure build-up and the results are discussed in terms of comparison with numerical simulations. Although analytical modeling is less accurate (compare to numerical) and restricted to vertical well injection it allows large number of realizations for sensitivity analysis to find significant patterns of the process and reduces the number of numerical simulations needed at final stages of optimization. Analysis is done by considering infinite acting, homogenous, isotropic and isothermal reservoir condition. The Ei-function approximation method was used to simulate results on pressure profile across the reservoir. Once we have a validated model, we look into increasing the CO 2 <b>injection</b> <b>capacity</b> of saline aquifers by applying the multiple wells injection strategy. This was done by looking at the well interferences based on superposition principle and mapping the pressure build-up profile in the reservoir.
