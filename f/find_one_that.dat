He was keen to exercise as soon as he could during his rehabilitation. He tried several sports, including wheelchair tennis, wheelchair rugby and wheelchair basketball, following his accident in an attempt to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> made him feel able-bodied. He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E
25|$|Identity {{development}} is a stage in the adolescent life cycle. For most, the search for identity begins in the adolescent years. During these years, adolescents are more open to 'trying on' different behaviours and appearances to discover who they are. In an attempt to find their identity and discover who they are, adolescents are liklely to cycle {{through a number of}} identities to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> suits them best. Developing and maintaining identity (in adolescent years) is a difficult task due to multiple factors such as family life, environment, and social status. Empirical studies suggest that this process might be more accurately described as identity development, rather than formation, but confirms a normative process of change in both content and structure of one's thoughts about the self. The two main aspects of identity development are self-clarity and self-esteem. Since choices made during adolescent years can influence later life, high levels of self-awareness and self-control during mid-adolescence will lead to better decisions during the transition to adulthood. Researchers have used three general approaches to understanding identity development: self-concept, sense of identity, and self-esteem. The years of adolescence create a more conscientious group of young adults. Adolescents pay close attention and give more time and effort to their appearance as their body goes through changes. Unlike children, teens put forth an effort to look presentable (1991). The environment in which an adolescent grows up also {{plays an important role in}} their identity development. Studies done by the American Psychological Association have shown that adolescents with a less privileged upbringing have a more difficult time developing their identity.|$|E

500|$|The 1910 portion, {{which is}} set in Sargodha, Punjab, during the British Empire, was easy to {{recreate}} with [...] "a temple, mosque, market, a small village, brick houses etc." [...] Initially, the crew wanted to use an actual village as the set, but were unable to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> had not changed in the past century. Instead, they chose to construct a set that would be historically accurate.

500|$|After his baptism, Withers {{lived in}} a loosely {{affiliated}} religious community. While there, Withers almost got married but decided {{that he wanted to}} live a religious life instead. In 1984, he took private vows of [...] "poverty, chastity, and obedience" [...] and became a hermit. Before taking his vows, Withers had looked into several religious orders, but he could not <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> he felt compatible with. Passionate about the spirituality of the Desert Fathers, he and Sister Margaret McKenna debated about [...] "Where is the desert today?" [...] Deciding it was in the abandoned inner cities, in 1989 they moved into an abandoned row house that they began restoring, continuing their work even when their tools were regularly stolen by drug addicts. There, they founded New Jerusalem Laura, a treatment center for drug addicts.|$|E
500|$|McMillen {{worked on}} level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested {{primarily}} by the pair and their families. McMillen and Refenes lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, and met only a few times in person while working on the game. They developed the control scheme by iterating through several designs, trying to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> felt fluid and logical. Rather than use a pre-built game engine, Refenes programmed an original one. The game was initially set to include around 100 levels, and to have co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. During development, however, the multiplayer option was dropped and the number of levels was greatly increased. The pair designed the game to be deliberately [...] "retro", imitating the aesthetics of traditional platform games, but with a modern sensibility regarding difficulty. They wanted the game to be rewarding and challenging, rather than frustrating; to this end they included infinite lives, quick restarts of levels, obvious goals, and short levels. They felt the replay feature transformed death into a form of reward.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept for}} a movie based on the Bionicle toyline was {{proposed}} as early as 2001, when Bionicle became an unexpected commercial success for Lego: this idea was originally inspired {{by the fact that}} Lego advertised Bionicle {{as if it were a}} movie, and they had received inquiry emails and licensing requests from multiple film studios. Deciding to make the movie while retaining full creative control, Lego began discussing with potential partners, knowing that the film needed to come out while Bionicle was still looming large in the public consciousness. Lego's eventual partner was production entity Create TV & Film. With the initial partnership set up, Lego created some development assets and went round various animation studios to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> would develop the film. They narrowed it down to two studios, one of which was Creative Capers Entertainment. Creative Capers convinced Lego to employ them after producing a well-received short animated segment featuring Lewa. Creative Caper's three principles, directors Terry Shakespeare and David Molina, and producer Sue Shakespear, all took up their respective roles for the film's production. The deal was reportedly worth $5million. In a later interview, Shakespeare referred to the film's aesthetic as [...] "primary colors that were coded to the areas", saying it had a [...] "younger feel" [...] when compared to its prequel. He also referred to the film as [...] "very intimate, very organic".|$|E

2500|$|Lofty (George) Holloway {{was one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Both felt that to help complete the community there was a need for a character in his early twenties. He had to be someone a bit different. Not brash and confident like a lot of the older men, and not boisterous like the younger ones. A loner, maybe someone forced to be a loner. A person who [...] "stuck out like a sore thumb". Someone that was happiest in a group but still couldn't <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> he fit in with. Tony Holland had previously been in the army and found that ex-soldiers had these problems when they tried to reintegrate as civilians. So they decided that Lofty would be an ex-soldier, forced to quit because of his asthma. He was happiest in the army and felt incomplete without the group setting, the all-male camaraderie and even the security of the uniformity that the army provides.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the show's broadcast, it {{was stated}} that the set for the show, {{designed}} by the same designer of Conan's previous sets, John Shaffner, would be inspired by The Legally Prohibited Tour, adopting more of a [...] "theatre" [...] appearance than the previous shows. Shaffner commented on {{the choice of the}} show's chair, stating, [...] "You <b>find</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> you like and then you build it yourself to make it a little shallower and a little more upright and the cushion a little firmer [...] But not too firm or every time the guest sits down they’ll say, 'Oooh this is a hard chair.'" [...] The rest of the set has been described as being [...] "filled with warm wood tones and electric blue screens," [...] and has been compared to the set of his most recent stint on The Tonight Show. The new set features several differences, however, including a remote-controlled moon, and the backdrop being transformed into a giant blue ocean. [...] In keeping with a change made during The Tonight Show, Andy Richter joins O'Brien during celebrity interviews on the main set rather than remaining behind a lectern after the monologue.|$|E
