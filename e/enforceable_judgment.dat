Under the FAA awards must be confirmed within one year; while any objection to an award must be challenged by the losing party within three months. An arbitration agreement may be entered [...] "prospectively" [...] (ie., in advance of any actual dispute), or may be entered into by the disputing parties once a dispute has arisen.|$|E
50|$|Lord Mance {{started by}} {{referring}} to the governing sections of the Extradition Act 2003 which were {{to be found in}} Part 1 of the Act (which deals with European Arrest Warrants) and went on to look at the Council Framework Decision on the European arrest warrant issued by the European Union which was implemented in the United Kingdom via Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003. National courts are under an obligation to interpret national law as far as possible {{in the light of the}} wording and purpose of the framework decision in order to attain the result which it pursues. In particular, Lord Mance looked at Articles 1(1), 2(1) and 8(1) as well as sections (b) and (f) of the annexed modern European Arrest Warrant. In particular, Article 8(1)(c) provides that, “The European arrest warrant shall contain the following information… (c) evidence of an <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgment,</b> an arrest warrant or any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect, coming within the scope of Articles 1 and 2…”.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{an accused}} person is evading {{proceedings}} by being either abroad or in hiding, the proceedings may {{be conducted in}} absentia. The proceedings are then officially started by the formal delivery of charges to the defendant's attorney. If the defendant {{does not have an}} attorney, the court will appoint one. An attorney must in these circumstances be appointed throughout the entire proceedings, and will have all the defendant's rights. All documents intended for the defendant will be delivered to the attorney and the court must take [...] "appropriate measures" [...] to announce the trial publicly. Where the absent defendant subsequently appears during the trial, the proceedings shall continue in the normal way. The defendant may request that any evidence that had been presented in his absence be presented again; where this is not possible, he will be shown records of it and may comment on it. Where the case has ended with an <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgment,</b> the convicted party may request a fresh trial within eight days of the delivery of the judgment to him. The fresh trial may not lead to an outcome that would be less favorable to the defendant than the outcome of the previous in absentia trial.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than using}} force to solve {{international}} conflicts, political and judicial structures and procedures would be used. Although democratically elected national governments {{would still be}} in charge of domestic affairs at the country level, world courts with <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgments</b> would be able to try perpetrators of international and world-level crimes.|$|R
40|$|Inside the courts, {{one might}} {{distinguish}} between constitution-talk and justice-talk {{on the ground}} that the former, but not the latter, results in <b>enforceable</b> legal <b>judgments.</b> So, inside the courts, we might interpret the Constitution with justice in mind, but what we do is produce legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgments.</b> Outside the courts, however, it might seem that all we do is interpret and talk. It is not immediately obvious that cloaking justice-talk as constitution-talk outside the courts has much rhetorical force. As I will argue, the fact that invoking the Constitution outside the courts, in the course of discussing justice, does have some rhetorical force helps to provide a clue to the distinction between constitution-talk and justice-talk...|$|R
50|$|Most North American {{retailers}} did {{not sign}} the accord. Companies like Gap Inc. and Walmart cited liability concerns. According to spokespersons for the retail industry, American courts, which allow class actions, contingent fees, {{and do not}} require losing plaintiffs to pay legal fees, might permit liability claims against retailers {{in the event of}} another disaster which might result in substantial <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgments,</b> in contrast to European courts which generally do not allow class actions, forbid contingent fees, and require losing plaintiffs to pay winning defendants' legal fees and costs. However, as John C. Coffee, professor of corporate law at Columbia Law School, pointed out, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. might apply thus foreclosing suits by Bangladesh workers under the Alien Tort Claims Act, but this seems unlikely. It is more likely that liability would be based on contract law.|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the United States Supreme Court decided Buckhannon Board 2 ̆ 6 Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, which {{destroyed}} the so-called catalyst theory. The catalyst theory {{refers to the}} bringing of a lawsuit, but prior to {{the conclusion of the}} suit, the defendant settles with the plaintiff according to the plaintiffs basic original demand for relief. Every circuit except the Fourth Circuit had held that if you are a catalyst for a change in the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s conduct, you 2 ̆ 2 prevailed 2 ̆ 2 in the suit. Therefore, the plaintiff should be entitled to legal fees. In Buckhannon, the Court confirmed that a party must prevail in order to be entitled to legal fees, and a voluntary change by the defendant does not establish the legal requirement for obtaining fees. In other words, a party must obtain an <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgment</b> or a consent decree, which is the functional equivalent of a judgment, before it will be considered a prevailing party relative to fees...|$|E
40|$|After {{arbitration}} has occurred, {{parties may}} seek judicial {{enforcement of the}} arbitral award, converting the private determination into an <b>enforceable</b> <b>judgment.</b> Parties that did not prevail in the arbitration may, at the same time, seek to have the arbitral award vacated. This article concerns the doctrine that permits courts to vacate an arbitral award when the arbitrators “manifestly disregarded” the law, focusing on recent developments in the Second Circuit. Despite the exceedingly deferential scope of this doctrine, the Second Circuit has actually vacated a handful of arbitrations on grounds of manifest disregard, and the doctrine is routinely raised by litigants. We turn to three important issues the Second Circuit has recently considered, each of which helpfully illuminates the role of public courts in arbitration. The first issue is that the Second Circuit has identified manifest disregard as an extrastatutory form of judicial review, thus breaking from other circuits and from some of its earlier decisions. Although the issue {{does not appear to}} have been the subject of much focus, it has great consequence both for determining whether the doctrine is mandatory and whether it preempts conflicting state law. The second issue, building on the first, is whether parties may voluntarily choose either to eliminate review for manifest disregard or to permit review for error (which, as we will discuss, is a level of scrutiny foreign to the statutory scheme). The Second Circuit has held that parties may not prohibit courts from engaging in manifest disregard review. The circuits are divided as to whether parties may compel courts to engage in stricter review of arbitral awards than is provided either by the strict language of the Federal Arbitration Act or the manifest disregard doctrine. The third and last issue is the ephemeral rise and fall of the doctrine of manifest disregard of the evidence. Determining the limited instances when judges may examine the factual record developed at arbitration provides another opportunity to understand what courts mean by manifest disregard of the law...|$|E

In 2015, a Utah judge granted them a $134 million default judgment after Khadr {{did not respond}} to the suit.

40|$|In {{making an}} {{arbitration}} award, the arbitrator must define it clearly, unambiguously Justly and enforceability. Once {{the award is}} made and published, is a final and binding document and <b>enforceable</b> as a <b>judgment</b> of the High Court. However, the award can still be challenged when an arbitrator had committed a clear error of law {{on the face of}} an award where a court can set aside or remit the award to the arbitrator for further consideration. There is no provision in both 1952 Act and 2005 Act to limit and no clear definition as to what exactly means by "error of law on the face of award". Thus, it does not provide guidelines for the losing party to decide whether the award is error {{on the face of it}} and should they challenge the arbitral award under this ground. Normally it is for the court to decide. Hence, this research intends to determine the judicial interpretations on "error of law on the face of arbitration award". This research was carried out mainly through documentary analysis of law journals and law reports. Results show that there are four judicial interpretations for "error of law on the face of award". The first interpretation is when the award not satisfies the essential features of a valid award. Second, appears by the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally for instance decided using evidence which the law was not admissible or using principles of construction which the law did not countenance. Next interpretation is the error must be such that it can be found in the award, or in a document actually incorporated with it. Lastly, there is an error of law on the face of award when there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous. It is recommended that the four judicial interpretations should be included in the Arbitration Act so that it can be the guidelines for the party who wish to challenge the award under the ground of error of law on the face of award...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{international}} law consisted primarily of substantive norms, {{leaving it to}} individual nation states {{to determine how to}} implement and enforce those norms. Human rights class actions in U. S. courts represent one such fusion of international legal rights with domestic judicial remedies. Since the late 1980 s, victims of human rights violations have increasingly utilized Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 (Rule 23 ), which governs the certification and conduct of the class action in federal court. In certain respects, the rule embodies a unique feature of United States procedural law. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that class relief is peculiarly appropriate in cases in which the issues involved are common to the class as a whole and turn on questions of law applicable in the same manner to each member of the class.  Because human rights abuses are often committed on a widespread and systematic basis, and because many {{international law}} norms prohibit collective harms (for example harms directed against a group qua group), the class action device appears, at first glance, to provide a good fit for human rights litigation. And yet, measuring the success of human rights class actions by the number of cases that have achieved certification or proceeded to an <b>enforceable</b> class <b>judgment,</b> or by the satisfaction of victim classes with the process or the results of their efforts, suggests that a number of challenges exist to employing this procedural mechanism in the context of human rights litigation. This Article is an attempt to navigate a course between the unalloyed idealism toward and broad-based critique of the human rights class action in the academic literature. Its destination is a position that accepts that the class action device - notwithstanding its potential for abuse and the challenges to its application - may provide an appropriate litigation device for human rights litigants in certain circumstances. The Article begins with a brief survey of human rights class actions with an emphasis on the certification phases of the cases. It then analyzes these cases within the context of several long-running debates about the operation and propriety of class actions, by identifying some of the particular advantages and challenges posed by the class action mechanism to human rights litigation. The Article concludes that the class action device is especially well-suited for cases involving the doctrine of command responsibility (for abuses committed by subordinates) or abuses involving a corporate course of conduct or collective harms. However, the Article cautions that, while proceeding as a class action can provide an important vehicle for enforcing human rights norms on behalf of an affected population, it is imperative that class counsel be committed to providing victims with a meaningful experience through litigation and to promoting the principle of human dignity that underlies the human rights edifice. With these concerns in mind, the Article provides an interpretive framework for pursuing and managing human rights class actions within Rule 232 ̆ 7 s provisions and established certification doctrines. This framework accepts that courts should construe Rule 232 ̆ 7 s requirements in light of the unique characteristics of human rights claims and claimants, the clear congressional policy - as expressed by the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) and amendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA) - in favor of U. S. courts adjudicating alleged violations of human rights that occur abroad, and the courts 2 ̆ 7 capacity to adopt procedural innovations as a form of federal common law for violations cognizable under these statutes. In application, this will require class counsel to carefully manage relations with absentee class members in order to ensure a meaningful experience for class members. It may also require courts to adopt both more liberal and more stringent approaches to certain components of Rule 23. Although this framework cannot address all of the challenges that may arise in human rights class actions, it does attempt to address certain procedural obstacles and structural dilemmas that have appeared in the past and that are likely to appear in future cases. It is hoped that these modest recommendations will better enable individuals engaged in human rights litigation - as counsel, litigants, and judges - to capitalize upon the potential of the class action model to enforce universal human rights norms...|$|R
