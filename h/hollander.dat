5|$|SOLDIERs Zack Fair and Angeal Hewley are {{dispatched}} to Wutai {{to support the}} Shinra war effort. However, during the fighting, Angeal disappears, and Zack is appointed to find both him and an already missing SOLDIER, Genesis Rhapsodos. Zack, accompanied by Tseng, finds that Genesis and Angeal have betrayed Shinra, and, as such, Zack and Sephiroth are assigned to kill them. With help from Dr. <b>Hollander,</b> a scientist with a vendetta against Shinra, Genesis creates an army of clones to attack Shinra headquarters. After the forces are defeated, Zack and Sephiroth track down Hollander's secret laboratory, and learn that <b>Hollander</b> had used both Genesis and Angeal as part of Project G, an attempt to create soldiers infused with Jenova cells. Sephiroth faces off against Genesis, whilst Zack pursues <b>Hollander.</b> However, Angeal is intent on keeping <b>Hollander</b> alive as he wants {{to find a way}} to return to normal, and so he prevents Zack from killing the doctor by knocking Zack into the slums of Midgar.|$|E

The film was followed by two sequels: 1977's The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington and 1980's The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. In the following sequels <b>Hollander's</b> role was played by different actresses, Joey Heatherton and Martine Beswick respectively.

5|$|Wagner {{lived in}} Dresden {{for the next}} six years, {{eventually}} being appointed the Royal Saxon Court Conductor.

25|$|In 1323, the {{agreement}} between Holland and the Frisians fell apart when William III got impatient with Frisian intransigence and the Frisians started expelling <b>Hollanders</b> and their Frisian supporters. In 1324 the rebellion {{was in full}} swing and in 1325 it swept through Staveren. From 1325 to 1327 there were open hostilities, mainly at sea, between <b>Hollanders</b> and Frisians. Representatives of Staveren opened negotiations with the <b>Hollanders</b> in 1327, which led to a new agreement the next year, mainly on the same terms as the one from 1310, although Westergo did make some concessions on the appointments of certain officials.|$|R

5|$|Several {{artists have}} applied Ovid's account to new {{translations}} or reworkings, or adapted {{the story for}} the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work Tales from Ovid (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in The Great Whore of Babylon) and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in The Three Birds) wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John <b>Hollander.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom <b>Hollander)</b> of the East India Trading Company has a {{personal}} score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E

25|$|After {{the landing}} the Frisian {{strategy}} was to prevent the <b>Hollanders</b> from leaving the coast and coming inland.

He was, however, outvoted.|$|R
