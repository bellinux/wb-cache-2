40|$|The {{recently}} released Recommended Dietary Allowance of vitamin C for women, 75 mg daily, {{was based on}} data for men. We now report results of a <b>depletion–repletion</b> <b>study</b> with healthy young women hospitalized for 186 +/− 28 days, using vitamin C doses of 30 – 2, 500 mg daily. The relationship between dose and steady-state plasma concentration was sigmoidal. Only doses above 100 mg were beyond the linear portion of the curve. Plasma and circulating cells saturated at 400 mg daily, with urinary elimination of higher doses. Biomarkers of endogenous oxidant stress, plasma and urine F 2 -isoprostanes, and urine levels of a major metabolite of F 2 -isoprostanes were unchanged by vitamin C at all doses, suggesting this vitamin does not alter endogenous lipid peroxidation in healthy young women. By using Food and Nutrition Board guidelines, the data indicate that the Recommended Dietary Allowance for young women should be increased to 90 mg daily...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derived dietary {{reference}} values (DRVs) for thiamin (vitamin B 1). The Panel considers that data from depletion–repletion studies in adults {{on the amount of}} dietary thiamin intake associated with the erythrocyte transketolase activity coefficient (αETK) < 1. 15, generally considered to reflect an adequate thiamin status, or with the restoration of normal (baseline) erythrocyte transketolase activity, without a sharp increase in urinary thiamin excretion, can be used to estimate thiamin requirement. In the absence of new scientific evidence, the Panel endorses the average requirement (AR) of 0. 072 mg/MJ (0. 3 mg/ 1, 000 kcal) for all adults proposed by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1993 on the basis of one <b>depletion–repletion</b> <b>study,</b> in which both αETK and urinary thiamin excretion were measured. Results from other depletion–repletion studies are in agreement with this value. The Panel agrees on the coefficient of variation of 20 % used by the SCF to cover uncertainties related to distribution of thiamin requirements in the general population, and endorses the population reference intake (PRI) of 0. 1 mg/MJ (0. 4 mg/ 1, 000 kcal) set by the SCF for all adults. The same AR and PRI as for adults, expressed in mg/MJ, are proposed for infants aged 7 – 11 months, children aged 1 to < 18 years, and during pregnancy and lactation, under the assumption that the relationship between thiamin requirement and energy requirement is the same in all population groups...|$|E
40|$|Determinants of the {{recommended}} dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin C include the relationship between vitamin C dose and steady-state plasma concentration, bioavailability, urinary excretion, cell concentration, and potential adverse effects. Because current data are inadequate, an in-hospital <b>depletion-repletion</b> <b>study</b> was conducted. Seven healthy volunteers were hospitalized for 4 - 6 months and consumed a diet containing < 5 mg of vitamin C daily. Steady-state plasma and tissue concentrations were determined at seven daily doses of vitamin C from 30 to 2500 mg. Vitamin C steady-state plasma concentrations {{as a function of}} dose displayed sigmoid kinetics. The steep portion of the curve occurred between the 30 - and 100 -mg daily dose, the current RDA of 60 mg daily was on the lower third of the curve, the first dose beyond the sigmoid portion of the curve was 200 mg daily, and complete plasma saturation occurred at 1000 mg daily. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes saturated at 100 mg daily and contained concentrations at least 14 -fold higher than plasma. Bioavailability was complete for 200 mg of vitamin C as a single dose. No vitamin C was excreted in urine of six of seven volunteers until the 100 -mg dose. At single doses of 500 mg and higher, bioavailability declined and the absorbed amount was excreted. Oxalate and urate excretion were elevated at 1000 mg of vitamin C daily compared to lower doses. Based on these data and Institute of Medicine criteria, the current RDA of 60 mg daily should be increased to 200 mg daily, which can be obtained from fruits and vegetables. Safe doses of vitamin C are less than 1000 mg daily, and vitamin C daily doses above 400 mg have no evident value...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{consider}} functional endpoints in defining nutrient The first edition of the recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) was published nearly 55 y ago (1). At that time, knowledge about human nutrient requirements was limited and it was often necessary to extrapolate information from studies in experimental animals. Currently, primarily three different approaches are used to determine human nutrient requirements: 1) balance studies in which nutrient losses are measured in relation to intake; 2) <b>depletion-repletion</b> <b>studies</b> in which sub-jects are maintained on diets low or deficient in a nutrient, followed by correction of the deficit with measured amounts of the nutrient; and 3) the observed intakes of a nutrient by healthy people. In balance <b>studies</b> and <b>depletion-repletion</b> stud-ies, nutrient requirements are defined as the amount required i...|$|R
