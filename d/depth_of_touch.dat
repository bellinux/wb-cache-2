40|$|This paper proposes three {{measuring}} apparatuses, {{which provide}} a useful {{piece of information}} on snowfall and snowcover for reducing snow damage and for utilizing snow. 　The umbrella-like snowfall detector, which utilizes resistance change, indicates the instant when snowfall started or stopped {{and can be used}} as an element of a snow melting system. According to our field test, it is thought to be usable in practical applications. 　The composite snowfall detector, which detects snowfall by counting the number of the drops of the water whhich is produced by heating snowfall, is found to be capable of measuring snowfall intensity over a wide range. 　The automatic snowcover depth recorder can measure a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> snow without <b>touching</b> the snow surface. This device employs the reflected light from the surface which is illuminated by a light source operated by an a. c. supply. In order to eliminate light signals other than from the light source, only the reflected light of a. c. component is utilized. Field experiments for a few months provide a prospect of practical use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, an {{analytical}} and simulation solution for touch mode Micro-electromechanical systems pressure sensor operating in harsh environment is proposed. The {{principle of the}} paper is to design, obtain analytical solution and compare the results with the simulation using finite elements analysis for a circular diaphragm deflection before and after touch point. By looking at MEMS devices, when the diaphragm starts touching the fixed electrode by applying loads, {{it will have a}} major effect on the overall performance of the device. Therefore, one should consider the effect <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> mode in the system to achieve good linearity, large operating pressure range and large overload protection at output. As of so far the effect <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> mode has not been evaluated efficiently in the literatures. The proposed touch mode MEMS capacitive pressure sensor demonstrated diaphragm with radius of 180 µ m, the gap <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 0. 5 µ m and the sensor exhibit a linear response with pressure from 0. 05 Mpa to 2 Mpa...|$|R

40|$|The article {{reflects}} on digitality and interface design {{in terms of}} the multiple senses <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> Touching is presented as a ‘‘pathic’’ sense of being exposed, which implies that touching exceeds the tactile and even the phenomenal world. A particular focus is set on Aristotle’s and Husserl’s ways of thematizing the sense <b>of</b> <b>touch.</b> In this way, two extremes of the phenomenological thinking <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> are articulated: touching as an indistinct and heterogeneous constituent <b>of</b> sensitivity and <b>touching</b> as the guarantor of immediacy of the sense experience. Referring to Derrida’s critical notes concerning haptocentrism, the article attempts to problematize the hand and the finger as phenomenological figures <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and as holds of haptic realism. The article concludes that insofar as digital interface design aims at haptic realism it conceives of the sense <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in terms <b>of</b> narcissistic feedback and thus tends to conceal the pathic moment <b>of</b> <b>touching...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{western culture}} the use <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in {{interpersonal}} relations has, {{as far as}} possible, been avoided.

This view <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> has now been re-evaluated and the fun-damental nature <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> as a nurturant response is now more fully understood.

The present study was designed to investigate the functions <b>of</b> maternal <b>touching</b> during a Still-Face procedure between mothers and their fullterm 5 歔-month-old infants. The objectives were to (1) document how the overall duration, the types, and the functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> employed by mothers varied across both Normal periods, (2) clarify the impact of infants' and mothers' distress on the function and duration <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> provided to infants, (3) investigate the reciprocal relationship between functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> and infants' affect, and (4) examine how maternal regulatory behaviours provided in the transition period were predicted by infants' affect, and how they influenced the amount <b>of</b> nurturing <b>touch</b> during the Reunion Normal period. Maternal touch was systematically coded using the Caregiver Infant Touch Scale and the Functions <b>of</b> <b>Touch</b> Scale. Results indicated that mothers adapted the functions <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> they used across period, and according to infants' affect and distress level. Mothers used more nurturing function <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> when their infants were fretting or distressed, whereas they used more playful function <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> in order to get their infants smiling. Moreover, findings revealed that the transition periods played a critical regulatory role and influenced subsequent maternal behaviour.

However, despite focus on the transcorporeality <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> that is, the ability <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> to traverse bodily boundaries and entangle bodies with the world, the theoretical engagement with challenges to the notion of human corporeal integrity through bioscientific developments such as organ transplants, and the interaction of biology and technology through the plasticity of the body in incorporating organic and inorganic matter, has remained limited. This thesis, situated in a new materialist framework, explores a posthuman phenomenology <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> by diffractively reading Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of the flesh and Karen Barad’s quantum-philosophy <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> through one another. Within Wilsons (2015) framework for a feminist reading of the biological body, and efforts from disability studies scholars to crip feminist science and technology studies, this thesis engages with recent developments in neuroprosthetics – prosthetics connected directly with the nervous system, restoring sensimotoric function in amputees or tetraplegic patients. Specifically, this thesis will look at research by the Bensmaia Lab at the University of Chicago on the neural coding <b>of</b> <b>touch,</b> and explore the material entanglements <b>of</b> neuroscientific <b>touch</b> through exploring the military connections as well as practices of animal testing of the Bensmaia Lab.
