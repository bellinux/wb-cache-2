50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves castability. Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. <b>Forming</b> <b>behavior</b> is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or fine chips, and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Strong {{interest}} in producing ultra-light-weight, high corrosion-resistant, heat-proof and tougher advanced products has prompted potential development of titanium tailor-welded blanks (Ti-TWBs) {{to construct the}} critical parts of structures and panels in automotive applications and some other advanced industries. However, the capability to predict the <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> of the stamped TWBs without failure lags far behind the manufacturing technology. It is proven that the ductility {{for most of the}} titanium alloy sheets can be significantly improved at elevated temperatures. Nevertheless, such study of stress-strain behavior on the weldment of Ti-TWBs has not been fully investigated. This paper aims to analyze the <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> of the Ti-TWBs at different elevated temperatures using a finite element analysis. The distinctive mechanical properties of the base metals and weldment for the forming simulations will be acquired experimentally.

However, preheat - setting of gels containing wheat or potato starch had no significant effect on gel strength demonstrating an opposite trend in gel strength due to the differences in swelling power, water holding ability and gelatinization temperature between potato and wheat starches.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a model for the prediction of the formability of a multiaxial warp knitted (MWK) fabric to a 3 D surface. For this purpose, we first characterized in detail the <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> of MWK fabrics containing two bias inserting yarns (TBMWK fabric). Through experimental observation, it was found that the two bias inserting yarns always tend to gather along the weft direction. The angle between the two bias yarns has a linear relationship with the perpendicular distance from the measured points to the longitudinal axis of the hemisphere during forming process. The slope of this linear relationship is also linear with the magnitude of radius of the pressing hemisphere provided that the radius is larger than 7 cm. Based on the above finding, a mathematical model is established for predicting the deformations of TBMWK fabrics during the hemisphere-forming process. The shape of flat TBMWK fabric that can yield the corresponding hemisphere during the forming process as well as local deformations can be calculated through this model. The hemisphere-forming experiments show that the present model is workable and accurate. The results from both the model and experiments suggest that the shape of flat TBMWK fabric that can yield the corresponding hemisphere which is close to a rectangular, not to a square as presented by woven fabric. The method developed in the paper has laid a foundation for further modeling of the <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> of MWK fabrics onto other 3 D surfaces.

The parameters crucial to predicting <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> were determined by tensile tests, bending tests, cross-die tests, hole-expansion tests and forming limit curve analysis in the pre-aged temper after various storage periods following sheet production.

The study showed that <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> is strongly dependent on the type of alloy and that it is influenced by the storage period after sheet production.

Due to the dissimilarity between the metal skin sheets and the polymer core, characterizing the forming potential of such laminates is a necessity. In this study, steel skin sheets and polypropylene-polyethylene copolymer as core sheet – called sandwich laminates - were used. They were produced in a roll bonding process using an adhesive agent. One major research point in IMET is investigating the effect of core and skin thicknesses on the <b>forming</b> <b>behavior</b> and mechanical properties of the sandwich laminates. <b>Forming</b> <b>behavior</b> is evaluated using deep drawing in addition to determining the forming limit curves (FLC). Bonding strength is evaluated by lap shear tests. More-over, the durability of the steel/polymer joints are evaluated under hydrothermal ageing conditions following heating/cooling regime cycles. Basically, the mechanical properties were determined using tensile testing. The adhesion test results show good adhesion strength and a cohesive failure mode. The lap shear strength after ageing shows no remarkable deterioration. The deep drawability of the sandwich laminates depends on the thicknesses of the layers and their volume fraction. With increasing the core thickness, the limiting drawing ratio (LDR) decreases and the probability of wrinkling in the flange area and cracking is higher as well. In case of different skin thicknesses in one sandwich, the best setting condition is to position the thinner skin in contact with the forming tool (punch) if acceptable by design...|$|E

Everyone realizes how important the role of language as a means of communication, as well as through language, the culture of a nation can be nurtured and developed, and can be passed on to future generations of what has been achieved by previous generations. The choice of the right words in the language is also an important element. Therefore, reviewing the word as a sign is necessary to be able to express exactly what it wants to say. The purpose of this research is to know the <b>form,</b> <b>behavior</b> and component of bodoh word meaning, and the equation and difference of bodoh word with its synonym. This research is that used monolingual contrastive approach by using the technique of expansion. 	The results found 13 basic words that contain the meaning of ‘stupid’ in Indonesia language, such as bambung, bebal, bego, beloon, debil, domot, dongok, dungu, goblok, jahil, pandir, picik, and tolol. 	From the form analysis, ‘stupid’ in Indonesia language can join the ten affixes such as, ter-, se-, -kan, ke-/-an, pe-/-an, me-/-kan, me-/-i, memper-, diper-, dan di-/-i. 	From behavioral analysis, ‘stupid’ can be seen in terms of phrases and clauses. In the clause, the bodoh word is included in the adjective category that tends to occupy predicate functionality, either standing alone or becoming the core of the phrase. While in the phrase level, the ‘stupid’ word can be the core of endosentric phrase attributive type and can also be a coordinated endocentric phrase element.
