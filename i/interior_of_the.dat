5|$|Between 1904 and 1906 {{the castle}} was rented by the Morell family, after {{which it was}} {{occupied}} by the Dowager Lady Glanusk. The architect W. D. Caroe was employed to restore the house in 1910 and it was sold to the banker Benjamin Guiness in 1937. A major fire then destroyed the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{eastern side of the}} castle in 1939. Around 1961, the castle was acquired by Richard Booth who used it as a bookstore and as a location for parties, with a holiday cottage in the grounds. Much of the walled garden was sold for development in 1975, and another fire in 1977 destroyed the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western half of the castle: repairs were carried out from the 1980s onwards.|$|E
5|$|Elemental abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun is more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E

5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E

5|$|After Jonathan Martin's arson {{attack on}} York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were {{proposals}} by the dean and chapter {{to take the}} opportunity of the destruction to restructure the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.

A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.|$|E
5|$|Al-Aqsa's dome {{is one of}} the few domes to be {{built in}} front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the {{paintings}} were assumed to be irreparably lost, but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.|$|E
5|$|Although {{completed}} successfully, {{the building}} {{turned out to}} be little more than an extravagant nail in Price Brothers' coffin. The Great Depression pushed the company to the brink of bankruptcy, and the Price Family lost both control of the company and most of its fortune. Various restoration work was undertaken during the 1950s and '60s, mostly to the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E

5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} from the <b>interior</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, most notable {{are a large}} monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast.

The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
