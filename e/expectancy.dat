5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life <b>expectancy</b> statistics. All three Northern England {{statistical}} regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease.

However, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life <b>expectancy</b> in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life <b>expectancy</b> in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E

40|$|A {{major issue}} in smoking {{prevention}} research is that no study has tried to equate program success <b>expectancies</b> across experimental and placebo control conditions. Equivalent overall program success <b>expectancies</b> should be established to help rule out the effects of extra-theoretical variables which influence program outcomes. The present study tested whether an attention-placebo (information based) smoking prevention program would produce equivalent <b>expectancies</b> about the likelihood of program success in comparison to an experimental social influences program. To try to equate program success <b>expectancies,</b> {{the design of the}} two programs differed in content but was similar in procedure. Fourteen middle schools were randomly assigned to the two conditions. As hypothesized, baseline <b>expectancies</b> were found to predict outcome measures, even after controlling for baseline smoking intentions, ethnic group, and gender. Second, the equivalence of program <b>expectancies</b> at posttest was tested. Youths held equivalent overall <b>expectancies</b> for success across conditions.

40|$|Abstract Background Simultaneous use {{of alcohol}} and {{cannabis}} predicts increased negative consequences for users beyond individual or even concurrent use of the two drugs. Given {{the widespread use of}} the drugs and common simultaneous consumption, problems unique to simultaneous use may bear important implications for many substance users. Cognitive <b>expectancies</b> offer a template for future drug use behavior based on previous drug experiences, accurately predicting future use and problems. Studies reveal similar mechanisms underlying both alcohol and cannabis <b>expectancies,</b> but little research examines simultaneous <b>expectancies</b> for alcohol and cannabis use. Whereas research has demonstrated unique outcomes associated with simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use, this study hypothesized that unique cognitive <b>expectancies</b> may underlie simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use. Results: This study examined a sample of 2600 (66 % male; 34 % female) Internet survey respondents solicited through advertisements with online cannabis-related organizations. The study employed known measures of drug use and <b>expectancies,</b> as well as a new measure of simultaneous drug use <b>expectancies.</b> <b>Expectancies</b> for simultaneous {{use of alcohol}} and cannabis predicted simultaneous use over and above <b>expectancies</b> for each drug individually. Discussion Simultaneous <b>expectancies</b> may provide meaningful information not available with individual drug <b>expectancies.</b> These findings bear potential implications on the assessment and treatment of substance abuse problems, as well as researcher conceptualizations of drug <b>expectancies.</b> Policies directing the treatment of substance abuse and its funding ought to give unique consideration to simultaneous drug use and its cognitive underlying factors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Since {{alcohol is}} an {{integral}} part of many Jewish religious customs and practices, unhealthy alcohol use may be easily overlooked or difficult to identify as Orthodox Jewish community members work to develop and transmit an appropriate, balanced, and controlled approach to moderate alcohol use, a value of the historical Judaism, from one a generation to another. ^ Although previous research has examined the impact of parental alcohol <b>expectancies,</b> parental alcohol behaviors, and parent-child relationship quality on their children 2 ̆ 7 s alcohol use, there is a dearth of research on this topic as it relates to the Orthodox Jewish community. In this study, the influence of parental alcohol <b>expectancies</b> (both positive and negative) and behaviors on their young adult children 2 ̆ 7 s alcohol <b>expectancies</b> and behaviors in the Orthodox Jewish community are examined, in addition to the variables of religiosity and parent-child relationship quality. ^ Using SEM, results indicated significant positive effects of parental negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> on young adult negative alcohol <b>expectancies,</b> and parental positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> on young adult positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> suggesting the important role parents play the development of their children 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with alcohol. Religiosity was found to have a significant negative effect on both young adult positive <b>expectancies</b> and young adult alcohol behaviors.

A significant positive indirect effect that was identified included the impact of parental positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> on young adult alcohol behaviors by way of young adult positive alcohol <b>expectancies.</b> Implications for school and clinical psychology are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{cognitive}} model of intergenerational transference, modeling of alcohol use is an indirect {{process in which}} parental drinking shapes alcohol <b>expectancies</b> of children, which in turn are associated with later alcohol use in adolescents.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examined {{predictors of}} change in college freshmen and sophomore cognitions of alcohol <b>expectancies</b> through secondary analyses of data collected in a randomized brief motivational interview (BMI) intervention for at-risk college drinkers (N= 1067). Positive and negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> were assessed at 6 time points over a 2 year period. Information on the selected predictors, which include demographic, peer and family influence, alcohol use and problem, and other drug use variables, was collected at baseline. Change in alcohol <b>expectancies</b> over time was evaluated using linear mixed effects regression and hierarchical modeling procedures. Results indicated that positive and negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> developed differently, yet aligned with established trends in alcohol use within this population. Positive <b>expectancies</b> were observed to increase over the first 6 months of the study which coincides with a time period associated with elevated college drinking; entry into college or {{the start of the}} academic year. During this same period, negative <b>expectancies</b> decreased significantly. Further, in addition to randomly-assigned treatment condition, change in positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> was moderated by race and alcohol-related problems. Non-Whites and students experiencing a low level of problems at baseline maintained healthier (lower levels) positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> throughout the study. Treatment effects on change in positive alcohol <b>expectancies</b> were moderated by gender, class year and binge frequency. Across all levels of predictors, students that did not receive the intervention exhibited greater gains in positive alcohol <b>expectancies.</b> Positive effects did not extend beyond 1 year follow-up. Negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> were moderated by treatment, gender, cigarette and marijuana use. Students that received the intervention exhibited greater reductions in negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> from baseline to 6 -month follow-up. Males and females exhibited similar reductions in negative <b>expectancies</b> {{over the course of the}} study with little evidence indicating that mean differences at each time point were stastistically significant. Finally, students that reported frequent use of cigarettes and marijuana at baseline maintained the lowest levels of negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> over time. The effects of treatment were not conditional on any predictors. These findings support the BMI employed in this study as an effective strategy for facilitating healthier cognitions related to alcohol use. Future studies examining the longitudinal mediation effects of alcohol <b>expectancies</b> on alcohol use by college students could extend current findings. Motivational interventions are only effective if they produce changes in the way people think about problem behavior that precipitates actual behavior change. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Problematic {{substance}} use {{among young people}} is a major public health problem. Despite availability of services, attrition rates among young people with {{substance use}} are high. Past studies have found treatment <b>expectancies</b> {{to be an important}} predictor of treatment retention and outcomes. Methods: The current pilot study aimed to explore predictors of treatment <b>expectancies</b> among 25 young people between 18 and 21 who attended a youth Drug Health Services in Victoria, Australia. Twenty-five participants were administered self-report questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the strongest predictors of treatment <b>expectancies.</b> Results: Treatment <b>expectancies</b> were most strongly predicted by satisfaction with past services. These <b>expectancies</b> were also associated with first impressions of the current service. Young people's <b>expectancies</b> about drug and alcohol treatment are shaped by past experiences with services and by early impressions of the current service. Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of past and early service satisfaction for treatment <b>expectancies.</b> Given the small sample size employed in the current study, larger studies are required to support such findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{analyzed}} {{the impact of}} trust-based prayer <b>expectancies</b> {{on the relationship between}} attachment to God and perceived stress levels. High trust-based prayer <b>expectancies</b> indicate a high trust in God to answer prayers in His time and in His way. It was hypothesized that trust-based prayer <b>expectancies</b> would mediate the relationship between attachment to God and perceived stress, since prayer <b>expectancies</b> are heavily reliant on trust in and a belief that God is a secure base. Three-hundred fifteen college students were surveyed on their trust-based prayer beliefs, perceived stress, and attachment to God. Results of the study indicated a significant indirect effect in which avoidance in one’s attachment to God predicted perceived stress by way of trust-based prayer <b>expectancies.</b> However, there was not a significant indirect effect linking anxiety in one’s attachment to God and perceived stress by way of trust-based prayer <b>expectancies.</b> Implications of the research suggest that trust-based prayer <b>expectancies</b> may be useful in reducing stress for individuals with avoidant attachment styles. Other possible mediators of the relationship between attachment to God and perceived stress may exist...|$|R

The purpose of this study was to examine whether <b>expectancies</b> mediated the relationship between perceived injustice and return to work in patients with whiplash injury. Method: One hundred and fifty-two individuals (81 men, 71 women) with a primary diagnosis of whiplash injury completed self-report measures of pain intensity, perceived injustice and return-to-work <b>expectancies</b> following admission to a rehabilitation programme. Work status was assessed 1  year after discharge. Results: Consistent with previous research, high scores on a measure of perceived injustice were associated with prolonged work disability. Results indicated that high perceptions of injustice were associated with low return-to-work <b>expectancies.</b> Causal mediation analyses revealed that <b>expectancies</b> fully mediated the relationship between perceived injustice and return to work. Conclusion: The findings suggest that intervention techniques designed to target <b>expectancies</b> could improve return-to-work outcomes in patients with whiplash injury. Discussion addresses the processes by which <b>expectancies</b> might impact on return-to-work outcomes and the manner in which negative return-to-work <b>expectancies</b> might be modified through intervention. Significance: The study confirms that <b>expectancies</b> are the mechanism through which perceived injustice impacts return to work following whiplash injury.

40|$|Abstract. Although the <b>expectancies</b> {{component}} of the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire has previously {{been shown to be}} factorially valid, the factor structure of its valuations component has not previously been examined. The aims of this paper were: (i) to replicate the factor structure of the <b>expectancies</b> items; (ii) to explore the factor structure of the valuations items; and (iii) to investigate the utility of using the Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire to predict drinking behavior. The questionnaire was administered to 1004 university students along with measures of quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption. Fromme, Stroot, and Kaplan’s (1993) factor structure of the <b>expectancies</b> scales was replicated. The factor structures of the negative valuations scales were characterized by 2 rather than 3 factors. Negative <b>expectancies</b> improved upon the prediction of drinking quantity and frequency over-and-above positive <b>expectancies,</b> and valuations further improved prediction over-and-above <b>expectancies.</b> Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life <b>expectancy.</b> Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{relationships}} among positive and negative alcohol <b>expectancies</b> and alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems in a sample of Hispanic, predominantly Mexican-American, college students. It was hypothesized that positive <b>expectancies</b> would be positively related to alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems and that negative <b>expectancies</b> would be negatively related to alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems. Little is known and understood about the role of positive and negative <b>expectancies</b> in Hispanic college students and even less is known about how <b>expectancies</b> relate to alcohol related problems in this population. ^ This study was a secondary analysis of data previously collected from participants in an alcohol risk reduction program conducted on the UTEP campus (i. e., the BASICS Program). Measures used in this study included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), The Comprehensive Effects of Alcohol Questionnaire (CEAQ), The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI), and the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (DDQ). ^ Results showed that both positive and negative <b>expectancies</b> in a sample of Hispanic College Students were positively associated with alcohol-related problems. Findings that positive alcohol <b>expectancies,</b> such as Sociability and Liquid Courage, which are positively associated with alcohol-related problems are consistent with the literature presented in this study. ^ Implications of this study suggest that interventions designed to lower drinking might focus on high <b>expectancies</b> in Sociability, Liquid Courage, and Risk/Aggression. Programs that help reduce alcohol consumption should tailor programs that focus on changing <b>expectancies</b> in inexperienced drinkers, and try other methods like Motivational Interviewing for moderate to heavy drinkers with greater likelihood of alcohol-related problems. ...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol-related cognitions, {{particularly}} <b>expectancies</b> {{for drinking}} and nondrinking and motives for nondrink-ing, {{are involved in}} the initiation, maintenance, and cessation of alcohol use and are hypothesized to play key roles in adolescent decision making. This study explored (a) the relationships between alcohol use expectan-cies, nondrinking <b>expectancies,</b> and nondrinking motives; (b) the roles of these cognitions across hypothesized developmental stages of adolescent alcohol use; and (c) the relationships between these cognitions and recent or intended future changes in drinking behavior in a cross-sectional sample. Surveys assessing alcohol use behaviors and attitudes were administered to 1, 648 high school students. Heavier drinkers reported more positive alcohol use <b>expectancies</b> and fewer nondrinking motives than did lighter drinkers or nondrinkers; however, nondrinking <b>expectancies</b> only differed between nondrinkers and rare drinkers and all subsequent drinking classes. Alcohol use <b>expectancies,</b> nondrinking <b>expectancies,</b> and nondrinking motives differentiated students who recently initiated alcohol from those who had not, while nondrinking <b>expectancies</b> and nondrinking motives differentiated binge-drinking students who had made recent efforts to reduce/stop their drinking from those who had not. Intentions to initiate or reduce drinking in the coming month were also associated with these alcohol-related cognitions.
