5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took the elevator to the top floor.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2013 {{issue of}} New York magazine, Scalia {{revealed}} that <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>The</b> Wall Street Journal and The Washington Times, {{got most of}} his news from talk radio, and did not read The New York Times or The Washington Post. The latter he described as [...] "shrilly liberal".|$|E
60|$|Faintly out of {{the night}} there came to Carthoris's ears the purring of a distant motor. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> heavens.|$|E
50|$|Kevin tries {{desperately to}} believe in his students. <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> class {{looking for someone to}} inspire him.|$|R
6000|$|Was {{the guide}} resting? Was <b>he</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> country from some high point? Was he inquiring {{of a chance}} mountaineer? Stop,--had he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety? ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>he,</b> too, <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> love-birds [...] On {{entering}} {{there that}} day, [...] 'Twas {{as if he}} had nought to say Of his long journey citywards, When <b>he,</b> too, <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> love-birds, [...] On entering there that day.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled the}} {{newspaper}} out. It was a good-sized rosy sheet, as if flushed by {{the warmth of}} its own convictions, which were optimistic. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> pages rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|... "God help us!" [...] murmured Stanley, in an undertone, as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> seaward horizon, {{which was}} covered with leaden clouds and streaks of lurid light, beneath which the foaming sea leaped furiously.|$|E
60|$|A talk lasting {{the best}} part of an hour followed, and at last the worthy doctor had his eyes opened to the unworthiness of his assistant. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> sheets of paper and the writing the boys had brought with interest.|$|E
50|$|A {{naval officer}} calls his sailors {{to the deck}} to {{assemble}} around <b>the</b> cannon while <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> horizon, when the ship is suddenly hit {{and one of the}} sailors is injured.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> Ass from limb to limb, [...] And ventures now to uplift his eyes; [...] More steady {{looks the}} moon, and clear, [...] More like {{themselves}} the rocks appear [...] And touch more quiet skies. [51] [...] 495 ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} to be Mr. Smith, my former friend Stephen's father,' said Knight, {{directly}} <b>he</b> had <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> embrowned and ruddy features of John.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused at}} the rough gate and leaned over it while <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> house and its {{surroundings}} eagerly. As he looked, the kitchen door opened and Min, clad in the old overcoat, came out and walked swiftly across the yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, sir, it is {{your wish}} to see Mr. Effingham--or--" [...] hesitating an instant, as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> stranger's appearance--"some of his people. The first will soon pass this spot, {{and you will find}} most of the latter on the lawn, {{watching}} the rockets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... but I do {{not think}} we need read more into the lines than that the boy [...] felt--as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> country with his eyes, on the 'qui vive' at [...] every rise in the ground--the {{feelings}} of a scout, who questions [...] constantly the distant prospect.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} said that his {{performance}} gives the importance he gave to expressional restraint and <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> ragas with an eye on beauteous light and shade. In the present generation of musicians, {{he is one of the}} few instrumentalists who can provide this experience to listeners and create in their minds nostalgic memories of a bygone era. He travels extensively on musical tours all over the world.|$|R
50|$|After Ray finds no leads {{with the}} police {{officers}} for {{the identity of the}} young man, causing intense frustration, <b>he</b> begins <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> system for a matching photo. He finds a match.|$|R
50|$|Reilly {{leaves the}} ship, stating {{his job is}} to find milgonite. Assisted by Alan Carter, <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> parent rock. His {{geophysical}} assessment confirms it is not milgonite, but an amalgam of several other minerals. As Koenig and Maya arrive, Reilly intends to inspect a smear of the rock fluid under a portable microscope. Koenig protests, but Maya insists research is necessary to save Verdeschi. The fluid is found to contain structures similar to blood corpuscles—the rock is a living organism.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, here is news at last!" [...] cried Dave, as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> communication. [...] "Come on out here, {{away from}} the crowd, Roger, and I'll read it to you;" [...] and then {{he led the way}} to a corner and acquainted his chum with the {{contents}} of the letter, which was as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the second}} time that evening Hardy told his story. It seemed more discreditable each time he told it, and <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> girl's face anxiously as he proceeded, but, like her father, she sat still and made no comment until he had finished. Then she {{expressed}} a strong feeling of gratitude that the Nugent family had not been mixed up in it.|$|E
60|$|The slope {{before him}} seemed to swell into obscurity {{to lose its}} {{definite}} outline in a misty, opaque cloud that shaded into the over-shadowing wall. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> rim where the serrated points speared the sky, and he found the zigzag crack. It was dim, only a shade lighter than the dark ramparts, but he distinguished it, and that served.|$|E
5000|$|Knowing {{about the}} dead Kitty wants to hand {{it over to the}} party who demanded it and he finds a murdered person. In the later course of time they finds it belongs to a {{minister}} and the money inside make them greedy. In such a situation Kitty wants to know why terrorists are behind that body in his truck of <b>the</b> car [...] <b>He</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> body and finds a pen drive tucked inside. That explains a terrorist gang is up to a major demolition of peace.|$|R
40|$|<b>He</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> horizon, {{using his}} one sunglassed eye: nothing. The sea is hot metal, the sky a {{bleached}} blue, {{except for the}} hole burnt in it by the sun. Everything is so empty. Water, sand, sky, trees, fragments of past time. Nobody to hear him…. He listens. The salt water is running down his face again. He never knows when that will happen and he can never stop it. His breath is coming in grasps, as if a giant hand is clenching around his chest—clench, release, clench. Senseless panic. (Margaret Atwood) We keep enshrined in our minds our loved people. (Melanie Klein...|$|R
2500|$|As a student, Munroe often drew charts, maps, and [...] "stick figure battles" [...] in {{the margins}} of his school notebooks, besides solving {{mathematical}} problems unrelated to his classes. By the time he graduated from university, Munroe's [...] "piles of notebooks" [...] became too large and <b>he</b> started <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> images.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have it your way." [...] Hendricks {{raised his}} glasses again, {{suddenly}} tense. For a moment--had something moved? <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> ridge carefully. Everything was silent. Dead. No life up there, only tree trunks and ash. Maybe a few rats. The big black rats that {{had survived the}} claws. Mutants--built their own shelters out of saliva and ash. Some kind of plaster. Adaptation. He started forward again.|$|E
60|$|Half {{way between}} the Case farm and Millsville detective Burton saw, far ahead along the road, two figures scale a fence and {{disappear}} behind the fringing blackberry bushes which grew in tangled profusion on either side. When they came {{abreast of the}} spot he ordered the driver to stop; but though <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> open field carefully he saw no sign of living thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said Tommy {{with his}} cheerful grin. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> great lawyer eagerly. Like Tuppence, {{he felt the}} {{magnetism}} of the other's personality. He was reminded of Mr. Carter. The two men, totally unlike so far as physical resemblance went, produced a similar effect. Beneath the weary manner of the one and the professional reserve of the other, lay the same quality of mind, keen-edged like a rapier.|$|E
2500|$|At each concert, Brooks {{and crew}} {{return to the}} stage and perform [...] "The Fever". Brooks dances on a {{conveyor}} belt as the drummer's sphere rises above the stage. Following the performance, the band leaves the stage once again. Brooks then returns, often unaccompanied, for what he dubs the [...] "housekeeping segment", in which <b>he</b> <b>scans</b> <b>the</b> crowd for fans with signs requesting songs, performing them acoustically. In some instances (such as the Atlanta concerts in September 2014), he may also perform acoustic covers of songs like [...] "Amarillo By Morning", [...] "Night Moves", and [...] "Piano Man". Regardless, the encore set commonly concludes with the band returning to perform [...] "Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)".|$|R
60|$|As the Elsinore {{swung around}} on her heel Mr. Pike {{put her on}} the back track so as to cover the water she had just crossed over. He lowered the glasses through which <b>he</b> was <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> sea and pointed down the {{hatchway}} that opened into the big after-room beneath. The ladder was gone.|$|R
60|$|Not {{more than}} a minute had elapsed after her {{withdrawal}} when Tess woke, and then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them, though they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which it engendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed <b>he</b> narrowly <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.|$|R
60|$|She {{took the}} other seat, {{and for the}} first time she noticed that the wind had grown very light. She watched him with a piteous impatience while he shifted the sail from side to side, keeping the sheet in his hand for {{convenience}} in the frequent changes. <b>He</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> sky, and turned every current of the ebbing tide to account. It was useless; the boat crept, and presently it scarcely moved.|$|E
60|$|Walking did {{not afford}} him the leisure {{to study the}} {{surrounding}} country; however, from time to time, when he surmounted a bench <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> different landmarks that had grown familiar. It took hours of steady walking to reach and pass the yellow peak {{that had been a}} kind of goal. He saw many sheep trails and horse tracks in the vicinity of this mountain, and once he was sure he espied an Indian watching him from a bold ridge-top.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Isn't it funny, {{what they}} DO {{put in the}} newspapers,' he said. 'Here are two leaders--' {{he held out his}} DAILY TELEGRAPH, 'full of the {{ordinary}} newspaper cant--' <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> <b>the</b> columns down--'and then there's this little--I dunno what you'd call it, essay, almost--appearing with the leaders, and saying there must arise a man who will give new values to things, give us new truths, a new attitude to life, or else we shall be a crumbling nothingness in a few years, a country in ruin--' ...|$|E
60|$|What {{he wanted}} was four months back, in December. It was a tiny item, so small that he almost missed it. His hands trembled as <b>he</b> <b>scanned</b> it, using <b>the</b> small {{dictionary}} {{for some of the}} archaic terms.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{waited until}} Gernois had {{had time to}} get well out of hearing, then he {{pushed open the door}} and stepped into the room. He was on top of Rokoff before the man could rise from the chair where <b>he</b> sat <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> paper Gernois had given him. As his eyes turned and fell upon the ape-man's face his own went livid.|$|R
60|$|Before Merry could answer, {{the eyes}} of Barnstable, which even while <b>he</b> spoke was <b>scanning</b> <b>the</b> state of the vessel's rigging, {{encountered}} the kind looks of Griffith, and from that moment perfect harmony was restored between the friends.|$|R
