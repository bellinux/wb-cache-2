5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate choice on her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly up to it to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up in <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E
25|$|Nut was {{the goddess}} {{of the sky and}} all heavenly bodies, a symbol of {{protecting}} the dead when they enter the afterlife. According to the Egyptians, during the day, the heavenly bodies—such as the sun and moon—would make their way across her body. Then, at dusk, they would be swallowed, pass through <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> during the night, and be reborn at dawn.|$|E

25|$|Hearing the commotion, Paules {{went down}} the hall to Taboada's bedroom and saw Rolling. She {{attempted}} to barricade herself in her bedroom but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped her mouth and wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her onto <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> and stabbing her three times in the back. Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.|$|E
25|$|Iwate {{took out}} a knife and {{assaulted}} the woman, slicing open <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> {{and took out the}} liver from the fetus. However, at that moment, Iwate caught sight of the protective charm that the woman had on her, giving Iwate a great surprise. It was the very same one that she left for her daughter when she left the capital. The woman she had just killed was none other than her very own daughter.|$|E
25|$|Shakira is {{well known}} for her dancing in various music videos and in concert. Her moves are based on the art of belly dancing, a part of her Lebanese heritage. She often {{performs}} barefoot; Shakira says she learned this form of dance as a young teen to overcome her shyness. She also mentioned in a MTV interview that she learned how to belly dance by trying to flip a coin with <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{the subject}} of L'Âme de la France has its own {{individual}} characteristics that contrast strongly with its martial attributes. First, she was “lovingly fashioned down to the smallest details, from {{the folds of her}} dress to her splendid braids”, two long pigtails that “slide down her back”. In addition and even more importantly, she represents a young half-nude woman, <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> and her breasts bared “to the open air”, the slender body and the head turned to the right in a position that is ultimately very sensual.|$|E
25|$|To {{convince}} Hitchcock {{that the}} scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting {{of the final}} shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh’s stand-in Marli Renfro to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor George Tomasini, he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray {{of blood on the}} chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> getting stabbed.|$|E
25|$|Before he {{directed}} the episode, director Chris Hardwell spent five {{weeks on the}} Numb3rs set watching {{the cast and crew}} film the series. While filming, he gave the writers some insight into his direction. Since series regular Diane Farr was five months pregnant at the time, Hardwell filmed around <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b> He also directed guest star Robin Weigert to act like the perfect housewife in order to disguise the plot twist. Several scenes were shot at Caltech, including one near the Beckham Auditorium and one at an outdoor restaurant. For the final scene, Hardwell used a crane shot on the Numb3rs sound stage.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} a strong {{gust of wind}} tore away the last veils of mist, {{revealing}} the red face of the risen sun, and not {{a hundred yards away}} from them--for the tide was high--the tall masts of a galley creeping out to sea beneath her banks of oars. As they stared the wind caught her, and on the main-mast rose <b>her</b> <b>bellying</b> sail, while a shout of laughter told them that they themselves were seen. They shook their swords in the madness of their rage, knowing well who was aboard that galley; while to the fore peak ran up the yellow flag of Saladin, streaming there like gold in the golden sunlight.|$|R

25|$|A macaque mother {{moves to}} the {{periphery}} of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot, unless the group is moving, when the female must stay with it. Macaques usually give birth on the ground. Infants are born with dark-brown hair. They consume their first solid food at five to six weeks old, and can forage independently from their mothers by seven weeks. A mother carries her infant on <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother carries her infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year. A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members, and the mother may socialize again very slowly. However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females which have not had infants of their own. Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.|$|E
25|$|When he was 37, {{he married}} his 22-year-old backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia, on Valentine's Day 1996. Mayte Garcia {{wrote in her}} memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince that she was 16 when she first met Prince {{backstage}} at a concert in Germany after submitting a tape of <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> dancing. When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian. At 19, Prince {{told her it was}} time to go on birth control and took her virginity just one week later. They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; he was born with Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. Garcia said that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes. She eventually learned from a friend that Prince had burned everything in their son's nursery, including the boy's crib and the urn with his ashes.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} by Madonna on The Virgin Tour (1985) and the Sticky & Sweet Tour (2008). on the Virgin Tour, Madonna performed the song wearing a black, fringed micro-top and similar skirt, with <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> button exposed, and multiple crucifixes in different sizes, hanging {{from different parts of}} her body. Madonna performed the song in its original version. She appeared from behind a silhouette, and descended the steps while waving her hands and singing.

60|$|In the meantime, {{the ship}} became more {{distinct}} {{to the naked}} eye: she was a stout, round Dutch-built vessel, with high bow and poop, and bearing Dutch colours. The evening sun gilded <b>her</b> <b>bellying</b> canvas, as she came riding over the long waving billows. The sentinel who had given notice of her approach, declared, that he first got sight of {{her when she was}} in the centre of the bay; and that she broke suddenly on his sight, just as if she had come out of the bosom of the black thunder-cloud. The bystanders looked at Hans Van Pelt, to see what he would say to this report: Hans Van Pelt screwed his mouth closer together, and said nothing; upon which some shook their heads, and others shrugged their shoulders.|$|R
500|$|The seven-foot tall [...] "Venus" [...] statue {{represents}} {{a naked woman}} {{standing in front of}} a huge but dilapidated fountain on a nine foot high granite pedestal. Her arms are wrapped around <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> and the lower part of the body consists of straight legs placed slightly apart. The breasts are damaged, and the hair is straight. The statue wears two bands as her only ornamentation. The first band is tied around head whereas the other is around the neck, with the ends hanging down in front of the body, reaching down to the thighs, and broad enough to cover the genital area.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} set {{predominantly}} {{in an apartment}} block on New York City's Upper West Side; however, the third season was shot and mostly in filmed CBS Studio Center in Studio City, California. The show features Jerry Seinfeld as himself, Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine Benes, and Michael Richards as Kramer. Due to Julia Louis-Dreyfus's off-screen pregnancy, her character had to spend {{the latter half of}} this season hiding <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> behind furniture and laundry baskets. Harris Shore played the role of Mr. Lippman in [...] "The Library"; however, Richard Fancy took over the role {{for the remainder of the}} series. The Babu Bhatt character was originally scripted under the name of Vong Sim, but was later changed.|$|E
500|$|During {{the mating}} season, which can occur {{at any time}} in the North Atlantic, right whales gather into [...] "surface-active groups" [...] made up of as many as 20 males consorting a single female. The female has <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> to the surface while the males stroke her with their {{flippers}} or keep her underwater. The males do not compete as aggressively against each other as male humpbacks. The female may not become pregnant but she is still able to assess the condition of potential mates. The mean age of first parturition in North Atlantic right whales is estimated at between 7.5 and 9 years. Females breed every 3–5 years where the most commonly seen calving intervals are 3 years and may vary from 2 up to 21 years due to multiple factors.|$|E

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{production}} on the second season, lead actor Amy Poehler became pregnant and the producers of the show were forced to go into production on season three early and film an additional six episodes to accommodate not only Poehler's pregnancy, but also a projected September 2010 air date. Amy Poehler said the cast was [...] "a little fried" [...] by the intense shooting schedule, but that the addition of Adam Scott and Rob Lowe to the cast provided an energy boost. Since Poehler was six months pregnant {{at the time of}} filming the first six episodes, she was often strategically placed behind items to conceal <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b> Although the third episode to be shown, [...] "Time Capsule" [...] was the last of these six episodes to be filmed because the story presented the highest amount of props to place Poehler in front of objects to hide her pregnancy, most notably the time capsule itself.|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E
500|$|The tigress is a {{solid-cast}} statuette weighing [...] {{and measuring}} [...] {{from head to}} tail. She {{was designed to be}} soldered onto some other object as its handle; traces of tin were found beneath her rear paws, which have a [...] "smoothly concave curve". She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of her head, back, rump, and tail form a line at an angle of about 45°, when the rear paws are flat, allowing for their curve. Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged teats under <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b> She is carefully decorated on her back, but her underside is [...] "quite perfunctorily finished". Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines, with a black niello inlay between them, in most places not meeting the engraved lines. Neither her elongated body, nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species; she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine {{to the start of the}} tail, which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers. The figure has no stripes around her tail, which thickens at the end, suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion's tail, which tigers do not have, although Roman art usually gives them one.|$|E
