25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that it should be a subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Palm wine (called bunuk or bounouk in the Jola language) is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{derived from the}} natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of grapes. The recent partial Islamization of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated calabash or, more recently, a bottle. The alcohol content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest {{the popularity of the}} drink, such as Bunuk abajut birto, which means [...] "With palm wine, one never stands up," [...] or Ulako, kumusaet jígabulaju, which means [...] "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine." ...|$|E

500|$|Sigyn {{appears in}} the books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál in the Prose Edda. In Gylfaginning, Sigyn is {{introduced}} in chapter 31. There, she is introduced as the wife of Loki, {{and that they have}} a son by the name of [...] "Nari or Narfi". Sigyn is mentioned again in Gylfaginning in chapter 50, where events are described differently than in Lokasenna. Here, the gods have captured Loki and his two sons, who are stated as Váli, described as a son of Loki, and [...] "Nari or Narfi", the latter earlier described as also a son of Sigyn. Váli is changed into a wolf by the gods, and rips apart his brother [...] "Nari or Narfi". The guts of [...] "Nari or Narfi" [...] are then used to tie Loki to three stones, after which the guts turn to iron, and Skaði places a snake above Loki. Sigyn places herself beside him, where she <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bowl to catch the dripping venom. However, when the bowl becomes full she leaves to pour out the venom. As a result, Loki is again described as shaking so violently that the planet shakes, and this process repeats until he breaks free, setting Ragnarök into motion.|$|E

Hamlet, whose eyes never leave the face of King Claudius, narrates the action of the mimed play (Hamlet: C'est le vieux Roi Gonzague et la Reine Genièvre [...] "This is the aged King Gonzago and Queen Guinevere"). The play proceeds as follows: With protestations of love Guinevere leads Gonzago to a lonely spot. The drowsy king soon falls asleep in her arms. The villain enters. She <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> cup, he seizes it, and pours the fatal potion, then takes the crown and places it on his head.|$|E

2500|$|The 2009 {{statement}} by U.S. President Barack Obama on Armenian Remembrance Day claimed that, [...] "reckoning {{with the past}} <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> powerful promise of reconciliation," [...] before going on to state that, [...] "the best way to advance that goal right now is for the Armenian and Turkish people to address {{the facts of the}} past as part of their effort to move forward," [...] and reaffirming his strong support for [...] "efforts by the Turkish and Armenian people to work through this painful history {{in a way that is}} honest open and constructive," [...] but although, as previously indicated, US President Obama did not use the word ‘genocide’ his use of the Armenian term Meds Yeghern, translated as [...] "Great Crime" [...] or [...] "Calamity", managed to offend both sides of the dispute. Armenian groups felt betrayed at the reversal of promises of recognition made during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election whist Turkish authorities felt that Obama had gone back on promises made during the recent 2009 US presidential visit to Turkey. Despite not saying the word genocide, Obama made it clear that he had not changed his views about the Armenian Genocide in the statement, saying [...] "I have consistently stated my own view of what occurred in 1915, and my view of that history has not changed." ...|$|E
