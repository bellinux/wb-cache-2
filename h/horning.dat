5|$|Italy was MGM's top {{choice for}} hosting the {{production}}. However, {{a number of}} countries—including France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom—were also considered. Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. <b>Horning</b> and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five years of research which had already been completed for the production. A skeleton crew of studio technicians arrived in the summer of 1956 to begin preparing the Cinecittà soundstages and back lot.|$|E

25|$|The crime {{families}} biggest racket were {{control of}} labor unions. During Bruno's and Scarfo's reigns, the Philadelphia crime family maintained {{some degree of}} influence over Roofers Union Local 30, Iron Workers Union Local 405, Laborers Union Local 332 and Teamsters Union Locals 107, 158, 331 and 837. The crime family used this influence to extort businesses, steal from the union treasuries and receive paychecks and benefits for little to no work. Scarfo also got the crime family heavily involved in methamphetamine trafficking, which was the drug of choice in the Philadelphia/south Jersey area. At first, the family extorted money from local meth dealers. When Greek-American mob boss Chelsais Bouras began <b>horning</b> in on the methamphetamine trade in Philadelphia and refused to pay Scarfo's street tax, Scarfo had him killed. Bouras was eating dinner with his girlfriend, friends and Scarfo soldier Raymond Martorano when a hit team ambushed and killed him and his girlfriend. The crime family then started controlling the meth trade in the area by supplying illicit P2P (a key meth ingredient) to meth manufactures. By controlling the supply of P2P the Philadelphia crime family was generally {{able to control the}} methamphetamine trade in the Philadelphia/South New Jersey area. Some criminals borrowed money from Mafia members to finance meth operations (and benefited from working with the Mafia instead of being extorted by them). The crime family also had some involvement in cocaine and marijuana trafficking.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Morley derided the {{seriousness}} of contemporary music writers: [...] "Many of the self-proclaimed American anti-rockists - or popists, or poptimists, or pop pricks - actually write {{with a kind of}} fussy, self-important rockist sheen. And for all their studious over-analysis, any definition of rockism is the same today as it's always been." [...] That same year, Rosen forewarned possible excesses of the new movement; that a hierarchy of music biased toward pop is no better than one biased toward rock because both genres have respectable qualities that cannot be ignored. A week later, PopMatters Rob <b>Horning</b> responded to Rosen's embracing of poptimism and wrote that it is [...] "sad to think the sharpest critics drowning in self-importance while believing they are shedding themselves of it. Basically by rejecting all that was once deemed important by a previous generation and embracing the opposite, you can make the case for your own importance. This is not optimism, it’s reaction." [...] Writing for The Quietus in 2017, Michael Hann argued that [...] "the poptimists are just as proscriptive as the rockists", and lists the following as a few poptimist [...] "sacred cows, which are beyond challenge": ...|$|E
500|$|M.I.A.'s {{relationship}} with some media outlets has been controversial. M.I.A. confronted Pitchforkmedia in 2007, citing sexism and racist mechanisms as possible reasons for misattribution {{of some of}} her work in her career. In 2010, M.I.A. tweeted [...] "Fuck the New York Times," [...] after The New York Times [...] published a critical article by Lynn Hirschberg about M.I.A. and the conflict that portrayed the musician as politically naive and hypocritical. Both M.I.A. and several pop culture media outlets were highly critical of Hirschberg's article and reporting. Hirschberg later published a correction, apologising for reporting quotes made by the artist out of order. Rob <b>Horning,</b> writing for PopMatters, believed that Hirschberg's incorrect quotes were a deliberate effort to defame the artist. M.I.A. responded on her Twitter account, posting of a telephone number and asking followers to call in and give feedback on the piece, and the revelatory content of the conversations, which she secretly taped. In 2010, she expressed disappointment that Wikileaks distributed their documents to other news publications – including the New York Times — to gain wider coverage, as she stated their [...] "way of reporting" [...] did not work.|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} {{benefited from}} the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, flaunting the most extravagant displays of wealth in the city's history. The [...] neon red tower belonging to the WEBQ-A.M. radio station was the tallest structure {{in the city and}} could be seen for miles. Harrisburg had just finished the new three-story <b>Horning</b> Hotel around 1920, and two new theaters with a combined total of 1,600 seats: the Orpheum and the Grand the same year. The eight-story Harrisburg National Bank building, the O'Gara Coal Headquarters, the Cummins Office building, and the four-story Harrisburg Hospital were all built in 1923. The new four-story Harrisburg City Hall building was constructed in 1927, and a complex highway system was constructed through the city, with Illinois Route 13 and Illinois Route 34 constructed in 1918; U.S. Route 45 and Illinois Route 145 constructed in 1925–1926. During this time the city expanded to 15,000 people. The annexation of Dorrisville and Dorris Heights created blue collar, multiple, and single family homes filling in between. On Vine Street south of the town square was [...] "Wiskey Chute", a saloon vice district for local miners. It was also during this time that the town was home to prohibition-era bootlegger Charles Birger, whose gang was said to have protected local business owners better than the law enforcement. For a time, the gangster's prized Tommy gun was displayed in a glass case in the City Hall. The geography around Harrisburg changed indefinitely, with coal areas producing a surface mining landscape the size of San Jose, California, roughly , aptly named The Harrisburg Coal Field. The field completely encased the towns of Carrier Mills and Harrisburg, while creating partial borders to Stonefort, Galatia, and Raleigh. Near the mines were gob piles that spontaneously combusted. The horizon around the city for many years flickered with burning coal refuse.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork {{referred to the}} songs as a [...] "dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals." [...] The site's endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts. In his review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman described Anniemal as [...] "cunning" [...] but also [...] "deeply affecting". Dylan Hicks' review for The Village Voice stated that the blogosphere and British music press overrated Anniemal but that [...] "an overrated good record is still a good record". Jody Rosen wrote for The New York Times that the album [...] "is a true album, strong from top to bottom" [...] and that [...] "there is charm in [...] deadpan delivery, and her songwriting is full of the flair for melody for which Scandinavian pop is famous." [...] Rosen also contributed a review to Slate, where she noted that [...] "other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than 'Chewing Gum,' but [...] includes several other superb songs". Kitty Empire's review in The Observer stated that the album's songs [...] "boast a winning combination of innocence and experience, breezy blonde melodies and just-so productions". PopMatters Pierre Hamilton called Anniemal [...] "riveting" [...] for how [...] "it lacks the waxy sheen" [...] that listeners were used to hearing in manufactured pop music. However, a second PopMatters review, written by Rob <b>Horning,</b> criticised the album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop, adding that the result was [...] "exquisitely empty…enough to suck the feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant, blank and unburdened." [...] In his review for Billboard magazine, Michael Paoletta described the album as [...] "slinky and sensual, cool and classy, fun and fiery" [...] and labeled it [...] "one of the best debut albums of 2005." ...|$|E

Performances of the proposed <b>horn</b> have been evaluated by experiments. The displacement amplification of the proposed <b>horn</b> is 41. 4 % and 8. 6 % {{higher than that of}} the traditional catenoidal <b>horn</b> and a Bézier-profile <b>horn,</b> respectively, with the same length and end surface diameters.
