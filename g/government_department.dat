40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rise and}} use of balanced scorecard performance measurement systems in Australian <b>government</b> <b>departments.</b> Through a survey of all Australian federal, state and territory <b>government</b> <b>departments</b> we find that Australian <b>government</b> <b>departments</b> include a broad set of financial and non-financial measures within a balanced scorecard approach. Theoretically, our findings lend support for both economic and ‘external’ institutional rationales for the implementation and use of balanced scorecard measures. We find that those <b>government</b> <b>departments</b> reporting greater implementation of balanced scorecard performance measures also report greater benefits for organisational decisions. Our findings {{shed light on the}} use, and further potential, of BSC performance measurement systems as part of the management control system in <b>Government</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R

Life-event service is a sound concept in which services are designed to cater with citizen real needs instead of <b>government</b> <b>departments</b> needs. But this type of services requires interoperability between <b>government</b> <b>departments.</b> Among other things, interoperability implies the exchange of information between <b>government</b> <b>departments</b> which traditionally has been implemented by direct communication. This direct communication raises privacy concerns on citizens since their personal information is potentially exchanged without their knowledge and control. In this paper we propose an e-government model where the citizen controls the exchange of his personal information between <b>government</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R

In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions.

Prince William of Orange valued English cannons, and Warwickwho fervently believed in the international Protestant causeseems willingly to have supplied him with what he wanted. The Spanish ambassador officially protested against this practice in 1576, since the weapons would have been used against Spanish rule in the Netherlands. In 1573 Warwick {{was admitted to the}} Privy Council. His attendance to business was quite regular until it declined sharply due to his deteriorating health in the 1580s.

5|$|In 1936 the Air Ministry, the British <b>government</b> <b>department</b> {{responsible}} for the Royal Air Force, believed that {{in the event of}} war enemy aerial bombing of London would cause up to 200,000 casualties per week. British government commissions under Warren Fisher and Sir James Rae in 1937 and 1938 considered that key government offices should be dispersed from central London to the suburbs, and non-essential offices to the Midlands or North West. Pending this dispersal, in May 1938 Sir Hastings Ismay, then Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, ordered an Office of Works survey of Whitehall to identify a suitable site for a temporary emergency government centre. The Office concluded the most suitable site was the basement of the New Public Offices, a government building located on the corner of Horse Guards Road and Great George Street, near Parliament Square. The building now accommodates HM Treasury.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Convict Establishment (or just The Establishment), Fremantle Prison was {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using convict labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The <b>government</b> <b>department</b> in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.|$|E
