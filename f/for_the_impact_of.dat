25|$|Cato {{is famous}} {{not only as}} statesman or soldier, but also as author. He was a historian, the first Latin prose writer of any importance, and the first author {{of a history of}} Italy in Latin. Some have argued that if it were not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> Cato's writing, Latin might have been supplanted by Greek as the {{literary}} language of Rome. He {{was also one of the}} very few early Latin authors who could claim Latin as a native language.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} {{effects of the}} Second World War are clearly visible. Towards {{the end of the}} war, 90% of the historical old town had been destroyed in 73 aerial raids and half of the city was in ruins. Estimates <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> these raids on the population offer the figure of 6,000 dead. In total, Munich lost 34% of its population, with 279,000 people displaced through evacuation, migration, deportation, and made homeless through aerial attacks. The total population decreased from 829,000 in May 1939 to 550,000 in May 1945. The prewar population level was not regained until 1950.|$|E

500|$|After {{averaging}} 17points {{per game}} as a rookie and more than 22per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89million contract, but the Miami Heat outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth [...] $98 to $101million. However, according to the NBA league office, the Heat miscalculated their available salary under the salary cap by excluding performance bonuses for Tim Hardaway and P. J. Brown and failing to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> renegotiating Alonzo Mourning's contract before {{coming to terms with}} Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because Howard's $9million for the 1996–97 season placed the Heat over the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in NBA history to sign a contract worth more than $100million; his seven-year contract was worth $105million. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign Tracy Murray and Lorenzo Williams if they forfeited their 1997 NBA draft first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in Florida state courts, seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract. [...] Although an arbitration case involving the two contracts that Howard had signed appeared likely, ESPN reported that the Heat dropped their legal pursuit of Howard. The league moved for federal jurisdiction although the case remained on the docket for New York University law professor Daniel Collins to serve as arbitrator on three issues: [...] "1.) Did the Heat circumvent the cap in first signing Mourning?; 2.) Did the Heat miscalculate bonus money for forward P. J. Brown and guard Tim Hardaway that was not counted correctly against the cap.?; 3.) Did the Heat add an illegal performance clause to Brown's contract?." [...] Meanwhile, the Heat's contract was protected by a temporary injunction in Florida state court, which forbade any newer contract by Howard from abrogating his Miami contract. The Heat eventually dropped their case but the team, especially head coach Pat Riley, continued to vehemently claim that their case of wrongdoing in the form of erroneous rulings by the league had been very solid. If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5million and Heat coach Riley could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties. [...] In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for Rod Strickland and Harvey Grant.|$|E

Reverend Barry Bailey of the United Methodist Church in Fort Worth, who was Vaughan's AA sponsor, opened the service with personal thoughts: [...] "We're here to thank God for this man's life.

I recovered myself, however, and, as I did so, saw the bull lurch forward, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> a three-ounce bullet in the flank will quicken the movement even of an elephant. By this time I had realized the folly of the shot, and devoutly hoped that the bull would take no further notice of it. But he took a different view of the matter. Pulling himself up in a series of plunges, he spun round and came for me with outstretched ears and uplifted trunk, screaming terribly. I was quite defenceless, for my gun was empty, and my first thought was of escape. I dug my heels into the sides of my horse, but he would not move an inch. The poor animal was paralyzed with terror, and he simply stood still, his fore-legs outstretched, and quivering all over like a leaf.|$|E
