While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E

Out of all the characters, Shimura is most pleased with Kanako Sasa. For the designs of clothes for the female characters, Shimura consulted various fashion magazines for girls in their early teens, especially Nicola. Shimura commented self-deprecatingly in the afterword of volume one that, like her other series, her characters do not look very <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> her panels are too white, and there is much pathos.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

Separate deities could even be syncretized, or linked, as a single being. Thus the creator god Atum was combined with Ra to form Ra-Atum.|$|E

25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{in medical}} genetics is {{the condition of}} having two heterogeneous recessive alleles at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state. That is, an organism is a compound heterozygote when it has two recessive alleles for the same gene, but with those two alleles being <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (for example, both alleles might be mutated but at different locations). Compound heterozygosity reflects {{the diversity of the}} mutation base for many autosomal recessive genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated alleles, who technically are heterozygotes, but both the alleles are defective.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce. Although distinctly <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often cause errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair and these errors are a major source of mutation.|$|E
25|$|Humans of {{the same}} sex are 99.9% genetically identical. There is {{extremely}} little variation between human geographical populations, and most of the variation that does occur is at the personal level within local areas, and not between populations. Of the 0.1% of human genetic differentiation, 85% exists within any randomly chosen local population, be they Italians, Koreans, or Kurds. Two randomly chosen Koreans may be genetically as different as a Korean and an Italian. Any ethnic group contains 85% of the human genetic diversity of the world. Genetic data shows that no matter how population groups are defined, two people from the same population group are about as <b>different</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as two people from any two different population groups.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a kind of}} imidazolium ionic liquid, 1 -butyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium {{chloride}} ([BMIM]Cl) was synthesized, and {{the chemical}} structures of the ionic liquids were characterizaed by FT-IR and NMR. The solubilities of the ionic liquid for duabanga grandiflora powder activated with different modified conditions were studied respectively. Dissolution rate of wood pretreated with about 25 % NaOH solution was the best, due to {{the reduction of the}} hydrogen bond applied force. The chemical structure and crystal behavior of duabanga grandiflorar powder before and after dissolution were analyzed by FT-IR and XRD, respectively. The dissolution mechanism has also been discussed. The results showed that the ionic liquids had a good solubility for cellulose in activated duabanga grandiflorar powder.
