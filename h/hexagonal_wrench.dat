40|$|Quick-connect {{fastener}} actuated {{by simple}} motion of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wrench.</b> Enables assembly of truss by heavily gloved technician or by robot. Originally {{designed for use}} by Astronaut or robot assembling a truss in outer space, fastener also adapts to various connection applications requiring quick assembly or disassembly...|$|E
40|$|The HEXPANDO is an expanding-head <b>hexagonal</b> <b>wrench</b> {{designed}} to retain fasteners {{and keep them}} from being dislodged from the tool. The tool is intended to remove or install socket-head cap screws (SHCSs) in remote, hard-to-reach locations or in circumstances when a dropped fastener could cause damage to delicate or sensitive hardware. It is not intended for application of torque. This tool is made of two assembled portions. The first portion of the tool comprises tubing, or a hollow shaft, at a length that gives the user adequate reach to the intended location. At {{one end of the}} tubing is the expanding hexagonal head fitting with six radial slits cut into it (one at each of the points of the hexagonal shape), and a small hole drilled axially through the center and the end opposite the hex is internally and externally threaded. This fitting is threaded into the shaft (via external threads) and staked or bonded so that it will not loosen. At {{the other end of the}} tubing is a knurled collar with a through hole into which the tubing is threaded. This knob is secured in place by a stop nut. The second assembled portion of the tool comprises a length of all thread or solid rod that is slightly longer than the steel tubing. One end has a slightly larger knurled collar affixed while the other end is tapered/pointed and threaded. When the two portions are assembled, the all thread/rod portion feeds through the tubing and is threaded into the expanding hex head fitting. The tapered point allows it to be driven into the through hole of the hex fitting. While holding the smaller collar on the shaft, the user turns the larger collar, and as the threads feed into the fitting, the hex head expands and grips the SHCS, thus providing a safe way to install and remove fasteners. The clamping force retaining the SHCS varies depending on how far the tapered end is inserted into the tool head. Initial tests of the prototype tool, designed for a 5 mm or # 10 SHCS have resulted in up to 8 lb (. 35. 6 N) of pull force to dislodge the SHCS from the tool. The tool is designed with a lead-in angle from the diameter of the tubing to a diameter the same as the fastener head, to prevent the fastener head from catching on any obstructions encountered that could dislodge the fastener during retrieval...|$|E
5000|$|Metric hexagon bolts, {{screws and}} nuts are specified, for example, in British Standard BS 4190 (general purpose screws) and BS 3692 (precision screws). The {{following}} table lists the relationship given in these standards between the thread {{size and the}} maximal width across the <b>hexagonal</b> flats (<b>wrench</b> size): ...|$|R
40|$|Addition of PTFE {{pressure}} pad increases utility of <b>hexagonal</b> socket <b>wrench.</b> Pad presses against opposing inside socket walls, causing frictional force that retains socket-head screw against gravitational and handling forces. Developed for spacecraft repairs, tool is useful wherever tight clearance prevents insertion or removal of screw by hand...|$|R
2500|$|Drummers use a drum key for tuning their {{drums and}} {{adjusting}} some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) {{there are various}} tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and <b>hexagonal.</b> Ratchet-type <b>wrenches</b> allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums [...] "by ear" [...] or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which [...] "measures tympanic pressure" [...] on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.|$|R
50|$|An {{eccentric}} {{toothed gear}} {{is mounted on}} a <b>hexagonal</b> shaft. The <b>wrench</b> is introduced inside the pipe (especially a close nipple, which has threading its entire length, and therefore no surface for an outside wrench). As the wrench is turned, the eccentric gear is forced to grip {{the inside of the}} pipe. As with a regular pipe wrench, the mechanism is such that the grip on the pipe increases with the torque applied on the wrench.|$|R
