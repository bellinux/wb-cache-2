40|$|We {{present an}} {{infrared}} imaging {{study of the}} low-mass pre-main sequence binary system Haro 6 - 10. This system {{is one of a}} handful in which the optically-visible primary has the characteristics of a normal T Tauri star, while the secondary is a so-called "infrared companion" (IRC), a strongly <b>extincted</b> object which emits most of its luminosity in the infrared. A speckle holographic technique was used to produce nearly diffraction-limited images on three nights over a one-year period starting in late 1997. The images show that the IRC is obscured and surrounded by a compact, irregular, and variable nebula. This structure is in striking contrast to the well-ordered edge-on disk associated with HK Tauri B, the <b>extincted</b> companion to another T Tauri star of similar age. A new, resolved intensity peak was found 0 ". 4 southwest of the IRC. We suggest that it may represent light scattered by a clump of dusty material illuminated by starlight escaping along an outflow-carved cavity in the IRC envelope. The primary star became fainter and the companion became more extended during the observing period. Comment: 6 pages, including 2 figures, LaTeX 2 e, aastex macro...|$|R

We measure accurate redshifts in the range 1. 3 1900 km s− 1) Hα or Hβ emission lines; the remaining three are type II AGN. Given their large mid-IR luminosities and faint optical magnitudes, we might expect these sources to be heavily <b>extincted</b> quasars, and therefore only visible as type II AGN. The visibility of broad lines in 70 % of the sources {{suggests that it is}} unlikely that these AGN are being viewed through the mid-plane of a dusty torus. For four of the sources we constrain the Hα/Hβ Balmer decrement and estimate the extinction to the emission line region to be large for both type I and type II AGN, with AHα> ∼ 2. 4 − 5 mag. Since the narrowline region is also <b>extincted</b> and the UV continuum emission from the host galaxies is extremely faint, this suggests that much of the obscuration is contributed by dust on large (∼kpc) scales within the host galaxies. These sources may be examples of "host-obscured " AGN which could have space densities comparable or greater to that of optically luminous type I AGN with similar bolometric luminosities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many large {{photometric}} {{surveys are}} based on new or unusual systems. The users of the information they provide {{need to be aware}} of certain pitfalls. This paper outlines some of them. Very often the stated fiducal colours of stars in a given survey {{are based on}} modelling from theoretical atmospheres or spectrophotometry rather than actual observational data made with the same set of filters. While models may be satisfactory at the initial stage of data interpretation, for refined studies they may prove inadequate. The output of a particular detector is dependent, inter alia, on its quantum efficiency, its foreoptics including filters, and the transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere. These can virtually never be reproduced exactly between one installation and another. However, for objects with smooth spectra and not suffering severe interstellar reddening, colour transformations are usually reliable between systems with filters having similar central wavelengths and bandwidths. In studies of <b>extincted</b> regions, such as along the Galactic Plane, the calculation of reddening amounts can depend on detailed filter characteristics and not merely on their “effective wavelengths”. Confusion may become significant according to source densities and pixel sizes. In heavily <b>extincted</b> areas, there is a danger of identifying nearby faint sources with distant ones observed at longer wavelengths where the extinction is less. It is therefore necessary to understand the process that is used in cross-correlating the different images when cataloguing colours. Key words. Stars: standard 1...|$|R
