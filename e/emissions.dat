5|$|An <b>emissions</b> trading {{scheme for}} {{greenhouse}} gas <b>emissions</b> (GHGs) works by establishing property {{rights for the}} atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG <b>emissions</b> are an international externality (p.21). The <b>emissions</b> from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of <b>emissions</b> trading, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual <b>emissions</b> with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The environmental integrity of <b>emissions</b> trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

The on-road <b>emission</b> {{data were collected}} from five highway locations in Houston using a Remote <b>Emission</b> Sensor (RES) called Smog Dog, which was developed by the Santa Barbara Research Center (SBRC). The SMOG DOG is used to collect the <b>emission</b> concentrations of CO, HC, and NOx, as well as to simultaneously record a vehicle's instantaneous speed value and acceleration/deceleration rates while its <b>emission</b> is detected. During the <b>emission</b> data collection, the ambient temperature and humidrty were periodically recorded. The collected <b>emission</b> data are used to develop the ONROAD <b>emission</b> estimation model, which consists of a series of <b>emission</b> estimation equations. In these <b>emission</b> estimation equations, the <b>emission</b> rates are made functions of a vehicle's instantaneous speed, acceleration/deceleration rate, ambient temperature and humidrty.

40|$|Air-quality models require as input <b>emission</b> {{inventories}} of individual compounds high {{temporal and spatial}} resolution. These <b>emission</b> inventories are calculated by complex <b>emission</b> models. To evaluate these models, <b>emission</b> rates of CO and NO, {{of the city of}} Augsburg were determined in March and October using two independent methods and were compared with <b>emission</b> rates calculated by an <b>emission</b> model. This paper outlines the source-tracer-ratio (STR) method, describes its implementation in Augsburg, and presents the results obtained in four successful experiments. The CO <b>emission</b> rate was derived directly from the STR method, whereas the NO, <b>emission</b> rate is calculated from the CO <b>emission</b> rate using the average CO/NOx correlation in the city plume from the long-term dataset obtained within the Augsburg experiment. The CO and NO, <b>emission</b> rates obtained on 10, 22, and 23 October 1998, were in reasonable agreement with <b>emission</b> rates determined by a mass balance method. The CO <b>emission</b> rate on 23 March 1998, was about twice as large as the autumn <b>emission</b> rates. This observation is consistent with the observed mean <b>emission</b> ratios in March and October obtained from long-term measurements. The CO <b>emission</b> rates were also used to calculate absolute <b>emission</b> rates for a number of hydrocarbons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independenceâ€”pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide <b>emissions</b> between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx <b>emissions</b> halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced <b>emissions</b> of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) <b>emissions</b> in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG <b>emissions</b> is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's {{radio and}} {{particle}} <b>emissions</b> are strongly modulated by its rotation, {{which makes the}} planet somewhat similar to a pulsar.

40|$|As {{the country}} with the second largest emitter of {{energy-related}} CO 2 gas, China experienced a dramatic decline in CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity from 1991 to 2000, but since then the rate of decline slowed and CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity actually increased in 2003. In this paper, the complete decomposition method developed by Sun is used to analyze the nature of the factors that influence the changes in energy-related CO 2 <b>emission</b> and CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity during the period 1991 - 2006. We find that: (1) energy intensity effect is confirmed as the dominant contributor to the decline in CO 2 <b>emission</b> and CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity, (2) economic activity effect is the most important contributor to increased CO 2 <b>emission,</b> and (3) economic structure and CO 2 <b>emission</b> coefficient effects are found to contribute little to the changes in CO 2 <b>emission</b> and CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity, which actually increased CO 2 <b>emission</b> and CO 2 <b>emission</b> intensity over the period 1991 - 2006 except for several years.

5|$|One {{issue that}} has often raised {{concerns}} {{is the use of}} cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal that has the tendency to accumulate in ecological food chains. It is used as semiconductor component in CdTe solar cells and as buffer layer for certain CIGS cells in the form of CdS. The amount of cadmium used in thin-film PV modules is relatively small (5â€“10 g/mÂ²) and with proper recycling and emission control techniques in place the cadmium <b>emissions</b> from module production can be almost zero. Current PV technologies lead to cadmium <b>emissions</b> of 0.3â€“0.9 microgram/kWh over the whole life-cycle. Most of these <b>emissions</b> arise through the use of coal power for the manufacturing of the modules, and coal and lignite combustion leads to much higher <b>emissions</b> of cadmium.
