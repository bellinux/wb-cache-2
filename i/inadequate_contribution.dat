The occurrence of natural disasters has increased significantly {{in the recent past}} resulting a higher number of mortalities and economic and social losses. It is evident that the impacts and severity of natural disasters are linked to the unplanned urban development. Due to rapid urbanisation and population growth the cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to disasters. Therefore there is a high need for disaster-sustainable urban areas in today's context, incorporating proper risk reduction mechanisms to make cities resilient for future disasters. This requires a serious effort of various stakeholders including governmental and non-governmental institutions. The local governments being the first responder and the one responsible for community development, has a key role to play in achieving society's resilience to disasters and to ensure the resilience of the cities under their jurisdiction. Even though there is a growing concern among the researchers and practitioners {{on the role of the}} local governments in making cities resilient to disasters and contributing for the development of disaster resilient cities, several incidents have been reported on the <b>inadequate</b> <b>contribution</b> of local governments in taking the lead role of disaster risk reduction initiatives.

40|$|The recent {{increase}} in international retail activity within Africa has plunged the continent into a retail revolution. At {{the forefront of}} this revolution are major retail chains from South Africa. Although, this {{increase in}} retail internationalization in Africa has stimulated FDI and trade within the continent, South African retailers making this move have generally been criticised for their <b>inadequate</b> <b>contribution</b> to local economies of the countries they go into.

This necessitates the implementation of disaster risk reduction measures in order to achieve a disaster resilient environment. The risk reduction through improved resilience requires a multi-sectoral approach with the participation of various stake holders. As such, the local governments being the first responder and the one responsible for community development, has a key role to play in achieving society’s resilience to disasters.

The literature review method has been used to address this potential role of the local governments in disaster risk reduction and the data and information has been gathered from research papers on electronic databases along with conference proceedings and reports published by various institutions. The review of literature reveals that the local government has a significant role to play in implementing disaster risk reduction initiatives. However several incidents have been reported on <b>inadequate</b> <b>contribution</b> of local governments in disaster risk reduction activities.

40|$|Urban {{areas are}} growing very rapidly {{all over the}} world, {{particularly}} in developing countries. As a result of rapid urbanisation, the world’s population is increasingly concentrated in large cities leading to unplanned urban development with inappropriate and poor quality housing, infrastructure and services. This excessive unplanned urban growth leads to various physical, social and economic vulnerabilities. As a result, the consequences of disasters are highly detrimental when they occur in urban environments. Thus, it has become necessary to strengthen the resilience of cities to disasters. The built environment provides a core to many human activities and plays {{a critical role in}} any city. Thus, it is necessary to develop the built environment with an effective degree of resilience, in order to withstand and adapt to the threats of disasters. This requires a serious effort to be made by various stakeholders including governmental and non-governmental institutions. As local governments are responsible for local area development, they have a key role to play in achieving the resilience of the cities under their jurisdiction. Even though there is a growing concern {{on the role of the}} local governments in making cities resilient, several incidents have been reported on the <b>inadequate</b> <b>contribution</b> of local governments in taking the lead role of initiating risk reduction. In this context, the research aims to explore and propose mechanisms to empower the local governments to make cities resilient to disasters within the context of the built environment. Accordingly this paper intends to analyse the challenges faced by the Sri Lankan local governments in creating a disaster resilient built environment within their cities and to propose the ways and means of addressing the challenges faced by the local governments.

He thanks Philip Booth, Chris Daykin and Emma Jackson for helpful advice. 2 Introduction This paper seeks to outline the major economic issues relating to regulation of pension funds, using as an example the situation in the United Kingdom. The UK is a suitable case study given the success of private pensions in terms of coverage of the labour force on a voluntary basis (attaining 75 %), asset size (over 80 % of GDP) and investment performance (with returns averaging 6 % per annum in real terms over 1970 - 95, and 10 % over 1980 - 952). The UK can thus offer some positive lessons to other countries wishing to set up funded pension schemes 3. But equally, some of the well-known failures of the UK regime may give some warnings about the pitfalls that can arise from inadequacies in regulation. This applies particularly to the Maxwell fraud scandal as well as excessive commissions, <b>inadequate</b> <b>contributions</b> and mis-selling of personal pensions by insurance companies. Given the UK features both a sizeable occupational and a personal pension sector, we seek to cover regulatory issues relating to both types. Whereas regulations of both defined benefit and defined contribution funds are comprehensive, there are particular regulatory problems with personal defined contribution pension schemes – which hav...|$|R

In traditional CDNs, replication ensures high availability of data, with server-loads and content-popularity often used as parameters to tightly control the process. However, the highly transient properties of such wireless and mobile devices constitute a major hurdle for any replication algorithm, rendering most simplified methods <b>inadequate.</b> Our <b>contribution</b> begins with a unique message-pulsing mechanism operating within a wireless cluster, that detects devices and ascertains their reliability. Results show the viability of our pulsing algorithm in determining a base replication level. Next, a Markovian queueing model is introduced, allowing us to induce replication based on the required speed of service. This affords finer control over the replication process, creating a more effective replication strategy suited for mobile-based CDNs. Extensive analysis of the model were performed, with parameters derived from real-world conditions. Results indicate that the model is able to compute logical values for the expected waiting times in service and thus, control the speed of replication within the CDN...|$|R

The scientific and regulatory conditions for their procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution have been reflected upon widely and developed in both the civil law and the common law domains.

40|$|Accurate {{analysis}} and forecasting of tidal level {{are very important}} tasks for human activities in oceanic and coastal areas. They can be crucial in catastrophic situations like occurrences of Tsunamis {{in order to provide}} a rapid alerting to the human population involved and to save lives. Conventional tidal forecasting methods are based on harmonic analysis using the least squares method to determine harmonic parameters. However, a large number of parameters and long-term measured data are required for precise tidal level predictions with harmonic analysis. Furthermore, traditional harmonic methods rely on models based on the analysis of astronomical components and they can be <b>inadequate</b> when the <b>contribution</b> of non-astronomical components, such as the weather, is significant.

In diesem Beitrag argumentieren die Verfasser deshalb für verbindliche Menschenrechts-Standards für multinationale Unternehmen und untersuchen, welchen Beitrag auf Freiwilligkeit basierende Konzepte wie Corporate Citizenship und Corporate Social Responsibility zur Klärung von entsprechenden Pflichten von 'Multinationals' machen können - dies speziell in Bezug auf die oft kontingenten Verantwortlichkeiten bezüglich sog. positiven Menschenrechten.

Using {{the case of the}} Moreton Bay Marine Park (MBMP), south east Queensland, Australia, this study explored how management and stakeholders interact in Marine Park Area (MPA) management planning, what meaning they give to their actions, and what issues concern them. Based on a qualitative thematic analysis of the zoning plan and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 23 stakeholders, it was evident that little co-learning practice occurred in the management and planning process for the MBMP. The plan and onsite management had little success in incorporating the diverse knowledge of local stakeholders because of poor information sharing and communication mechanisms. In addition, many other factors, such as lack of monitoring, mistrust among stakeholders, political interference and a lack of legislative requirement for comprehensive consultation significantly influenced the overall learning environment. Like many other MPAs, MBMP planning and management also suffers from data scarcity. Collaborative and participative approaches, which engender co-learning, could {{play a vital role in}} overcoming the issue of <b>inadequate</b> data.

40|$|Following {{watershed}} amendments in Schedule Y India's star rose rather rapidly on {{the clinical}} research (especially clinical trials) horizon. Just as dramatic was {{the fall of}} this empire. At the centre of these events has been the participant and indirectly, the Ethics Committee (EC) that is established primarily to protect this individual. This paper traces {{the evolution of the}} concept of ECs in India, examines the current state of these committees in the country and suggests the way forward. The Past: The requirement for an EC to oversee clinical research was first made in the ICMR Policy Statement for Ethics published in 1980 and then again in the Schedule Y (1988). Later, both the Amended Schedule Y (2005) assigned regulatory responsibility on the EC and the ICMR Guidelines (2006) described the functioning of ECs. Several challenges including <b>inadequate</b> formal training, <b>contribution</b> from non-technical members, administrative support as well no SOPs and a heavy workload were identified. In the absence of regulatory oversight of ECs, the introduction of the Clinical Trial Registry - India (CTRI) and self-regulation through voluntary accreditation programs brought a measure of accountability and transparency. The Present: A slew of regulatory reforms led to more than 1000 ECs to be registered with CDSCO although the actual impact on participants' protection and safety of these new regulations still remains to be seen. Way Forward: A method to oversee all ECs, improved functioning of ECs including on site monitoring, central ECs for multicentric studies, the development of metrics to assess the ability of ECs to protect the participant are other ideas for the future. Conclusions: Although ECs in India have evolved from being mere rubber stamps for approval of protocols to efficiently functioning accredited ECs, yet there is much to be done for and by Ethics Committees...|$|R

The traditional Grunwald-Winstein scale of solvent ionizing power (Y) has proved to be <b>inadequate</b> due to <b>contributions</b> from nucleophilic assistance to solvolysis of t-butyl chloride, the standard substrate. As structural features of both the 1 - and 2 -adamantyl systems preclude not only the intervention of nucleophilic participation, but also the possibility of rate-determining elimination, the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives much better reflect the true ionizing power of a particular solvent system. Recent studies have also shown that a single scale of solvent ionizing power is inadequate to correlate the specific rates of solvolysis of a number of leaving groups. Y X scales of solvent ionizing power based on the solvolyses of adamantyl derivatives have been reported for seven anionic leaving groups. In this dissertation, three additional Y X scales are defined. A Y ONO 2 scale is defined by the specific rates of solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate at 50. 0 ∘C. Constant integrated first-order rate coefficients are observed in all solvents except 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanol, where an autocatalytic mechanism is proposed to operate. It is found that Y ONO 2 values correlate much better with Y OTs values, based on 2 -adamantyl p-toluenesulfonate, than with Y OClO 3 values, based on 2 -adamantyl perchlorate. Distributions of products from the solvolysis of 1 -adamantyl nitrate in ethanol/water mixtures are also examined. The specific rates of solvolysis of 2 -adamantyl 2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethanesulfonate and 2 -adamantyl pentafluorobenzenesulfonate are used for the definition of, respectively, Y OTr and Y PFBS values. These sulfonates solvolyze at rates intermediate to those of the corresponding p-toluenesulfonate and trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTS < OTr < PFBS < OTf), thus providing a bridge in the 105 - to 106 -fold nucleofugality gap between the two latter leaving groups. Y OTr and Y PFBS values are correlated against Y OTs values and against Y OTf values. The results of these correlations suggest that the sensitivities of the rates of solvolysis of these sulfonates to the effects of specific electrophilic solvation decline as the ability of the particular sulfonate to disperse a developing negative charge internally increases...|$|R
40|$|Background context: Multifidus {{cross-sectional}} area was often measured in chronic {{low back pain}} (LBP) patients to estimate the muscle activity for spinal stability. However, such estimation may be <b>inadequate</b> as the <b>contribution</b> of muscle elasticity in muscle activity is ignored. In vivo quantitative data on multifidus elasticity is therefore important {{for the study of}} muscle contractile function in response to motor control for spinal stability in chronic LBP patients. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the elasticity, {{cross-sectional area}}, and fat area of the multifidus for the contractile function and the distribution of deformable muscle tissue and nondeformable fat tissue at different postures in patients with and without chronic LBP. Study design/setting: This is a prospective study. Force-deformation data of the multifidus were acquired using ultrasound elastography. The anatomical changes of the multifidus were measured on the cross-sectional images of the multifidus acquired using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Patient sample: The sample comprised 12 adult male patients with chronic LBP and 12 asymptomatic male controls. Outcome measures: The outcome measure was the elasticity of the multifidus at the L 4 level for the assessment of muscle contractile function when patients were in the prone, upright, and 25 ° and 45 ° forward stooping positions. The cross-sectional area and fat area were also measured on the B-mode ultrasound images of the multifidus acquired at the same vertebral level and the postures. Methods: With the patients in each of the prone, upright, and 25 ° and 45 ° forward stooping positions, ultrasound elastography and B-mode ultrasound imaging were performed on the left and right multifidus at the L 4 level. The elasticity of multifidus indicated by the effective Young's modulus was derived from the force-deformation data acquired using ultrasound elastography. The cross-sectional area and fat area were assessed on the B-mode ultrasound images. The effective Young's modulus, cross-sectional area, and fat area were analyzed with multivariate general linear model analysis to investigate the possible effects of LBP and posture. Results: There was an increasing stiffness of multifidus demonstrated by increasing effective Young's modulus from the prone to upright position and 25 ° and 45 ° forward stooping positions. Differences in multifidus stiffness between chronic LBP patients and asymptomatic controls were shown in the upright and 25 ° and 45 ° forward stooping positions but not in the prone position. The cross-sectional area of the multifidus increased from the prone position to the greatest value in the upright position and decreased in 25 ° and 45 ° forward stooping positions. Smaller multifidus cross-sectional area was demonstrated in chronic LBP patients than that in controls at all postures. No effect of posture on fat area within the multifidus was shown although the fat area within the multifidus was larger in chronic LBP patients. Conclusions: Different, changing patterns of elasticity and cross-sectional area were identified in the multifidus in relation to posture. Increased stiffness of multifidus in response to the physiologic range of static loads and smaller cross-sectional area was characterized in the chronic LBP condition for spinal stability. Ultrasound elastography offers in vivo assessment of muscle contractile function of deep trunk muscles, which benefits the future investigation of the neuromuscular regulating mechanism in LBP. It can also be applied to refine the palpatory skill for the physical assessment in sports training and physical therapy. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R
