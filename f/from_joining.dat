5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids {{the country}} <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> a military alliance, but some politicians, such as Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO {{as part of}} a larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> NATO.|$|E
5|$|The deputies had legal immunity, {{although}} {{that did not}} prevent two liberal deputies, brothers Bonawentura and Wincenty Niemojowski, from being placed under temporary house arrest to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the Sejm in 1825.|$|E
5|$|After his {{frustrating}} junior year, Chamberlain {{wanted to}} become a professional player before finishing his senior year. However, at that time, the NBA did not accept players until after their college graduating class had been completed. Therefore, Chamberlain was prohibited <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the NBA for a year, and decided to play for the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958 for a sum of $50,000 (equal to about $ today).|$|E

5|$|However, Balfour's need {{to liaise}} with the 2nd Duke of Westminster, {{who had just}} {{inherited}} the Grosvenor Estate, prevented him <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> his force when they travelled to South Africa {{at the end of}} 1899. He remained in command of the London Scottish until 1900, when he resigned in protest at financial controls that prevented payments to volunteers if there was an insufficient number of raised troops.|$|E
5|$|In 1075, Walter {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} of the force that {{prevented}} Roger de Breteuil <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> up with the other rebels during the Revolt of the Earls.

5|$|Since the Belgian {{military}} had officially surrendered in May 1940 and the Belgian Constitution specifically forbade Belgians <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> foreign militaries, the Free Belgian forces were officially committing treason; {{the charge was}} only annulled in 1948 and nobody was prosecuted. Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many Belgian volunteers – {{especially those in the}} Royal Air Force – served in majority British units, particularly in the early years after the formation of the Free Belgian forces.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Service is {{formally}} {{governed by}} Privy Council Orders, {{as an exercise}} of the Royal prerogative. One such order implemented HM Government's ban of GCHQ staff <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> a Trade Union. Another, the Civil Service (Amendment) Order in Council 1997, permitted the Prime Minister to grant up to three political advisers management authority over some Civil Servants.|$|E
5|$|The French tactics were {{sufficient}} to prevent Amherst's army <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> James Wolfe at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. However, they also tied up 3,000 {{of their own}} troops that {{were not able to}} assist in Quebec's defense. The capture of the fort, which had previously repulsed a large British army a year earlier, contributed to the Annus Mirabilis of 1759.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite carabinier brigade <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.|$|E
5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest, in 1066, Æthelwig {{was one of}} the few Englishmen trusted by the new King William the Conqueror, and {{was given}} {{authority}} over parts of western England. As part of his duties, he was a royal judge and held important prisoners. During the Harrying of the North in 1069–1070, Æthelwig gave aid to refugees from the north of England. He also helped the king in the rebellion of 1075, preventing one of the rebels <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the others. Æthelwig died on 16 February in either 1077 or 1078, and was memorialised in a work on his life that was later incorporated in the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, a 13th-century history of the abbey and its abbots.|$|E

5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to gain control of the system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|Bruix's {{orders were}} {{to combine the}} French and Spanish fleets and rescue Napoleon's army, {{stranded}} in Egypt following the Battle of the Nile, but the ships in Cádiz were prevented <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> their French allies by an opposing wind, and although the British offered their line-of-battle, it was declined and the Brest fleet instead stood out for the Straits of Gibraltar. Elphinstone followed as far as Cape Spartel before first returning {{to check on the}} fleet in Cádiz, then sailing to join Jervis at Gibraltar, arriving at 09:00 on 10May. Elphinstone made several further attempts to track down and bring the French to action, without success. Bruix was able to amass a powerful fleet of 59 ships but failed to achieve his ultimate goal and returned to Brest on 8August.|$|E
5|$|Built by Blohm & Voss {{at their}} yard in Hamburg, Derfflingers keel was laid in January 1912. She {{was to have}} been {{launched}} on 14 June 1913, but the wooden sledges upon which the ship rested became jammed; the ship moved only 30–40 centimeters. A second attempt was successful on 12 July 1913. A crew composed of dockyard workers took the ship around the Skagen to Kiel. In late October, the vessel was assigned to the I Scouting Group, but damage to the ship's turbines during trials prevented her <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the unit until 16 November.|$|E

5|$|In 1194, Béla {{appointed}} {{his eldest}} son, Emeric, {{who had already}} been crowned as the future king, to administer Croatia and Dalmatia. After a united Bulgarian, Cumanian and Vlach army defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of Arcadiopolis in 1194, Béla was willing to assist the Byzantine Empire. However, his campaign was cancelled, because Béla's son-in-law, Emperor Isaac II, was dethroned by Alexios III Angelos in April 1195. Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, was planning to launch a campaign against the Byzantine Empire {{on behalf of the}} dethroned emperor, but Béla prohibited his subjects <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> Henry.|$|E
5|$|In 1379/80, Isa {{defected}} from Baybars' successor, Qalawun, {{and joined}} the rebellion of the Mamluk viceroy of Syria, Sunqur al-Ashqar. However, Isa dissuaded Sunqur <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the Ilkhanids' army, and was dismissed from his post when Qalawun's forces suppressed the rebellion. Isa was reinstalled by 1280, and in the following year, played a decisive role as a commander in the Mamluk victory over the Ilkhanate at the Second Battle of Homs. After his death, Isa was succeeded by his son Muhanna, and throughout the 14th century, Isa's direct descendants held the office of amir al-ʿarab with occasional interruption.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia {{has been}} prevented <b>from</b> <b>joining</b> the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
