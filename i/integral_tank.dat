2500|$|The Mk I PR Type D (also {{called the}} Extra Super Long Range Spitfire) {{was the first}} PR variant {{that was not a}} {{conversion}} of existing fighter airframes. The Type D carried so much fuel that it was nicknamed [...] "the bowser." [...] The D shaped wing leading edges, ahead of the main spar, proved to be an ideal location for an <b>integral</b> <b>tank.</b> Accordingly, in early 1940, work started on converting the leading edges, between rib four through to rib 21, by sealing off the spar, outer ribs and all skin joins allowing 57 gal (259 l) of fuel to be carried in each wing. Because the work was of low priority, and with the urgent need for fighters the first two, hand-built prototypes of the PR Type Ds were not available until October. In addition to the leading edge tanks these prototypes also had a 29 gal (132 l) tank in the rear fuselage. An additional 14 gal (63 l) oil tank was fitted in the port wing. The cameras, two vertically mounted F24s with 8inch (20.3cm) or 20inch (50.8cm) lens or two vertically mounted F8s with [...] lens, were located in the rear fuselage. With the full fuel load the center of gravity was so far back the aircraft was difficult to fly until the rear fuselage tank had been emptied. Despite these difficulties the type quickly proved its worth, photographing such long distance targets as Stettin, Marseilles, Trondheim and Toulon.|$|E
50|$|A hydro-mechanical {{fuel control}} system {{delivers}} {{fuel to the}} engine. The aircraft's fuel system consists of the fuel tanks and the fuel supply/transfer, vent/pressurization, fuel quantity measuring/indicating, fuel refueling and fuel drain subsystems. The total fuel is contained in two fuselage bladder-type rubber tanks and a wing <b>integral</b> <b>tank</b> of 1720 lb. The capacity of each drop tank is 250 litres.|$|E
50|$|Marine Development (Glasgow) Ltd., {{established}} in Scotland in 1972, developed the linkspan for over 30 years. They pioneered <b>integral</b> <b>tank,</b> submerged tank, and mobile linkspans {{under the direction}} of John Rose. These semi-buoyant ship-to-shore bridges minimise engineering infrastructure requirements and were originally designed a cheap and simple means of using ro-ro ferries in the Western Isles of Scotland, but later found wider applications.|$|E

40|$|Fully {{reusable}} {{launch vehicle}} concepts being studied for post-Shuttle era transports present major challenges for the structural design of large propellant tankage. The dominant structural elements are internal tankage for both cryogenic and non-cryogenic propellants which must operate in {{a broad range of}} thermal environments while meeting requirements for low weight and reusability. Several approaches to <b>integral</b> <b>tank</b> design are discussed and an analysis of a hot structure honeycomb sandwich tank for a circular body vehicle is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} the art, criteria, and {{recommended}} practices for the theoretical and experimental analyses of discontinuity stresses and their distribution in metallic pressure vessels for space vehicles are outlined. The applicable types of pressure vessels include propellant tanks ranging from main load-carrying <b>integral</b> <b>tank</b> structure to small auxiliary tanks, storage tanks, solid propellant motor cases, high pressure gas bottles, and pressurized cabins. The major sources of discontinuity stresses are discussed, including deviations in geometry, material properties, loads, and temperature. The advantages, limitations, and disadvantages of various theoretical and experimental discontinuity analysis methods are summarized. Guides are presented for evaluating discontinuity stresses so that pressure vessel performance will not fall below acceptable levels...|$|E

40|$|Detailed and {{supporting}} {{analyses of the}} hazards of a disabled spacecraft in a tumbling mode and of crew escape, rescue, and survivability are presented for earth orbital operations {{of the space shuttle}} program. Tumbling conditions, arresting tumbling by external means, and escape from a tumbling vehicle are discussed. Details on design concepts for the modular space station, <b>integral</b> <b>tank</b> orbiter, drop tank orbiter, and a small space vehicle are included. Results of the crew safety study indicate that the shuttle orbiter should be the primary vehicle for dealing with emergencies and one vehicle should be available for rapid emergency rescue. An Apollo command module should be carried in the orbiter cargo bay in case an orbiter is not available. Approaches for a quicker escape or rescue capability are also recommended...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analytical {{study was}} made to investigate the effects of fuselage cross section (circular and elliptical) and the structural arrangement (integral and nonintegral tanks) on aircraft performance. The vehicle was a 200 passenger, liquid hydrogen fueled Mach 6 transport designed to meet a range goal of 9. 26 Mn (5000 NM). A variety of trade studies were conducted {{in the area of}} configuration arrangement, structural design, and active cooling design in order to maximize the performance of each of three point design aircraft: (1) circular wing-body with nonintegral tanks, (2) circular wing-body with integral tanks and (3) elliptical blended wing-body with integral tanks. Aircraft range and weight were used as the basis for comparison. The resulting design and performance characteristics show that the blended body <b>integral</b> <b>tank</b> aircraft weights the least and has the greatest range capability, however, producibility and maintainability factors favor nonintegral tank concepts...|$|E
