5|$|Prevention {{of malaria}} {{may be more}} {{cost-effective}} than treatment of the disease in the long run, but the <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> required are {{out of reach of}} many of the world's poorest people. There is a wide difference in the costs of control (i.e. maintenance of low endemicity) and elimination programs between countries. For example, in China—whose government in 2010 announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the Chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health. In contrast, a similar program in Tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{reformed}} {{the system}} of silver coins in England in 1247, replacing the older Short Cross silver pennies with a new Long Cross design. Due to the <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> of the transition, Henry required the financial help of his brother Richard to undertake this reform, but the recoinage occurred quickly and efficiently. Between 1243 and 1258, the King assembled two great hoards, or stockpiles, of gold. In 1257, Henry needed to spend the second of these hoards urgently and, rather than selling the gold quickly and depressing its value, Henry decided to introduce gold pennies into England, following the popular trend in Italy. The gold pennies resembled the gold coins issued by Edward the Confessor, but the overvalued currency attracted complaints from the City of London and was ultimately abandoned.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this to be possible.|$|E
30|$|In addition, we {{calculate}} the MWTP for <b>initial</b> <b>cost</b> in each pricing scheme. The MWTP for <b>initial</b> <b>cost</b> is calculated by {{the ratio of}} the coefficient of each price scheme to that of “First.” Preference ranking of each pricing scheme for <b>initial</b> <b>cost</b> and monthly fee is exactly same. This tells we can understand which dynamic pricing rules better for consumers as both calculation results of MWTP show the same ranking. However, consumers might not clarify well the difference between <b>initial</b> <b>cost</b> and monthly fee.|$|R

5|$|Initially, {{the library}} had {{a cache of}} books waiting for the {{completion}} and grand opening that was provided by local residents and schools, as Carnegie's gift for the construction did not cover the <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> of new books. A call was also put out for citizens to donate books to the new facility to expand the collection. In 1907, the Seattle Public Library {{took control of the}} Carnegie library, when Ballard was annexed by the neighboring City of Seattle government. Early Scandinavian immigrants to Ballard and the Pacific Northwest in particular made use of the new facility; Ballard as an area has a strong historical presence of Scandinavian people. Early in the library's existence, it had a turnstile at the entrance to its book stacks, to count the number of book borrowers that passed through. With the arrival of World War I, the Carnegie Library became home to various community activities, such as dispensing information on the war, and also provided Red Cross and English language classes. In 1942, during World War II, one of the first African American librarians in Seattle, Lucille Smith, was assigned to the Carnegie library.|$|E

25|$|After a {{pause for}} {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued its use of reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor (ML-1), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, larger {{sections}} of swamps and bogs in Western Russia were drained for agricultural and mining purposes. Plans are underway to increase peat output and increase peat's contribution to Russian energy generation. There is {{concern about the}} environmental impact as peat fields are flammable, drainage degrades ecosystems, and burning of peat releases carbon dioxide. Due to 2010 forest and peat fires, the Russian government is under heavy pressure to finance re-flooding of the previously drained bogs around Moscow. The <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> for the programme {{are estimated to be}} about 20 to 25 billion rubles; that is close to 500 million euros (540 million USD).|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Matthias Rath, a vitamin entrepreneur, sued Goldacre and The Guardian {{over three}} articles, in which Goldacre criticised Rath's {{promotion}} of vitamin pills to AIDS sufferers in South African townships.

25|$|In {{the domain}} of food and agriculture, IPS {{facilitates}} agricultural extension to farmers, {{in order to make}} possible their participation in global markets. Using a participatory programme of education and technical skills training for farmers, IPS supports the rural economies of developing countries by facilitating exports to developed regions. For the <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> of such production until harvest revenues are generated, microloans are provided to farmers by non-profit agencies of the AKDN. In addition to microfinance and education, the agency works to improve the health and sanitation conditions of its beneficiaries, and considers employee welfare to be of paramount concern, providing equitable opportunity between genders and making child-care provisions for its employees.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1866, the Guion Line was {{successful}} in the Liverpool-Queenstown-New York steerage trade. In 1875, Guion began commissioning express liners to compete for first class business, but its first two ships were total failures. William Pearce, the controlling partner of the John Elder shipyard, was convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port. When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the Guion line at a bargain price of £140,000 {{at a time when}} express liners typically cost £200,000. He also agreed to share the <b>initial</b> <b>costs.</b> Stephen Guion, managing director of the line, personally owned the new vessel.|$|E
25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, {{yet have a}} much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices have changed the economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on <b>initial</b> <b>costs</b> and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E

First, a camera configuration with only one camera is proposed to achieve lower <b>initial</b> <b>cost.</b> This configuration requires more robustness. Second, in order to realize the vision, a robust control system is designed in the presence of uncertainty and constraint. Finally, the validity is confirmed by experiments in an actual open field. The camera configuration can not work well without the designed controllers. That is, the robust controllers reduce the <b>initial</b> <b>cost...</b>|$|R

25|$|In particular, FRP rods {{are useful}} for {{structures}} where the presence of steel would not be acceptable. For example, MRI machines have huge magnets, and accordingly require non-magnetic buildings. Again, toll booths that read radio tags need reinforced concrete that is transparent to radio waves. Also, where the design life of the concrete structure {{is more important than}} its <b>initial</b> <b>costs,</b> non-steel reinforcing often has its advantages where corrosion of reinforcing steel is a major cause of failure. In such situations corrosion-proof reinforcing can extend a structure's life substantially, for example in the intertidal zone. FRP rods may also be useful in situations where {{it is likely that the}} concrete structure may be compromised in future years, for example the edges of balconies when balustrades are replaced, and bathroom floors in multi-story construction where the service life of the floor structure is likely to be many times the service life of the waterproofing building membrane.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Col. Ashley C. McKinley, {{because of}} his {{experiences}} in ferrying aircraft to the Soviet Union, suggested in 1943 that all aircraft and equipment be operable at temperatures as low as −65°F (−54°C) and that a refrigerated hangar be erected at Eglin AFB to produce such an environment under controlled conditions. Since testing in Alaska was expensive and had produced only meager results, Col. McKinley reasoned that testing under controlled conditions would be far superior in useful results and up to ten times more economical. Construction of the Climatic Laboratory that allowed the Air Proving Ground Command to simulate virtually all climatic conditions “indoors” was completed 24 May 1947. <b>Initial</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated at nearly $2,000,000. The actual cost, {{at the end of}} construction, had risen to $5,500,000, indicative of the many problems encountered by the designers and builders. Testing began in May 1947. The first items tested included the Fairchild C-82 Packet, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Lockheed F-80, North American P-51, Lockheed P-38, and the Sikorsky H-5D helicopter.|$|E
25|$|Electric cars enjoyed {{popularity}} {{between the}} late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity {{was among the}} preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation {{that could not be}} achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s. However, in recent years, increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery technology, and the prospect of peak oil, have brought about renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run, despite high <b>initial</b> <b>costs,</b> after a failed reappearance in the late-1990s.|$|E
