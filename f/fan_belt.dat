25|$|In 2005, Carly Jones, {{her twin}} brother Nick, her boyfriend Wade, {{her best friend}} Paige, Paige's boyfriend Blake and Nick's friend Dalton {{are on their way}} to a {{football}} game in Louisiana. When night falls, the group sets up camp, after which a foul smell hangs in the air. A stranger in a pickup truck visits their campsite, shines his lights and refuses to leave or address them until Nick smashes one of his headlights. The next morning, Wade discovers that his car's <b>fan</b> <b>belt</b> is broken. Carly and Paige wander into the woods, where Carly tumbles down a hill and falls into a pit filled with rotting animal carcasses. After rescuing her, the group meets a strange, rural man named Lester, who offers to drive Carly and Wade to the nearby town of Ambrose to get a new <b>fan</b> <b>belt,</b> while the rest of them go to the football game.|$|E
25|$|The two {{arrive at}} Ambrose, which is {{virtually}} a ghost town. Unable {{to find an}} attendant at the gas station, they wander into the church, disrupting a funeral. There, they meet a mechanic named Bo, who offers to sell them a <b>fan</b> <b>belt</b> after the funeral. While waiting for the services to end, Carly and Wade visit the 'House of Wax', a wax museum which itself is made of wax and is the central feature of the town. The gas station {{does not have the}} right size <b>fan</b> <b>belt,</b> so they follow Bo to his house. Inside, Wade is knocked out by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who is wearing a wax mask to cover his disfigured face. Outside, Carly realizes Bo is the one who visited them the night before, after noticing his car's broken headlight. She runs to the church for help, but finds out that it is populated only by wax sculptures. Bo captures Carly and brings her to the cellar of the gas station, where she is restrained and her lips are glued. Meanwhile, Vincent strips Wade naked and straps him to a chair, where he is both injected and covered in molten wax.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after its}} introduction, the Corvair faced {{competition}} from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problems—though according to a 1960 Time report, [...] "many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car." [...] Problems included an engine cooling <b>fan</b> <b>belt</b> that tended to pop off its 2-axis pulleys (unless the fan ran constantly, the air-cooled engine would overheat and seize), carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage [...] "which sometimes runs well under 20 m.p.g." [...] The 1960 model gasoline heater was cited as a problem, which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hour—with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair's carburetors to improve economy.|$|E

Houlihan agrees, and takes the <b>fan</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, Cooksey was an {{unsuccessful}} {{candidate in the}} Republican primary for the United States Senate seat held until 2015 by the Democrat Mary Landrieu.

He never overcame the blunder. In the November general election, the losing Republican candidate was Cooksey's intraparty rival, Suzanne Haik Terrell of New Orleans.|$|R

50|$|Beyond {{the unusual}} power train (batteries, {{controller}} and motor), the remaining {{systems in the}} RAV4 EV are comparable to the gasoline-powered RAV4. The power brakes, power steering, tire wear and suspension components are similar except that they use electric power sources. The power brakes use an electric pump to provide vacuum instead of deriving vacuum from the engine manifold. The power steering use an electric motor instead of mechanical energy delivered by <b>fan</b> <b>belts.</b> The passenger compartment is heated and cooled electrically using a heat pump (the first fleet application of a heat pump in a road vehicle) with supplemental electrical resistance heating as backup.|$|R

500|$|Paving of SR84 had {{commenced}} by 1934, {{with the}} portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved. A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934, due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego, and made a request to the federal government to have it paved. The entire future corridor of I-8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935. Drivers were told to bring spare <b>fan</b> <b>belts,</b> radiator hoses, and additional drinking water for the journey traversing the desert. A [...] "Shortcuts Association" [...] began in 1952 to promote SR84 as a route to bypass Phoenix on the way to San Diego.|$|R

5000|$|As of September 2015, {{there have}} been a number of catastrophic fires aboard the fleet's natural gas powered buses, known as [...] "Gas Buses" [...] (Mercedes-Benz OC 500 LE). It was {{discovered}} that there were possible faults in the on-board fire suppression system installed in the engine compartment at the rear of the bus. A bus fire at the Elizabeth Quay bus station (previously known as Esplanade Busport) in July was said to have been caused by a leaking coolant cell. A series of one-off fires have occurred in two of the fleet's Mercedes-Benz O405NH diesel buses, both of which were sparked by frayed <b>fan</b> <b>belts.</b> Nobody was injured in any bus fires as the drivers were quick to respond and evacuate any passengers before the fires became lethal.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, {{on another}} back road, the girls burn out their radiator. Finally, {{a man by}} the name of Kurt Martin appears walking down the road. He tells them that he was on his way to Las Vegas. He fixes the <b>fan</b> <b>belt</b> by using Lisa's {{expensive}} belt and replenishes the radiator with the girls drinking water. In return, he asks to be driven to Las Vegas. The girls get to Las Vegas first.|$|E
50|$|This {{is why a}} {{squirrel-cage}} {{blower motor}} may cause household lights to dim upon starting, but does not dim the lights on startup when its <b>fan</b> <b>belt</b> (and therefore mechanical load) is removed. Furthermore, a stalled squirrel-cage motor (overloaded or with a jammed shaft) will consume current limited only by circuit resistance as it attempts to start. Unless something else limits the current (or cuts it off completely) overheating and destruction of the winding insulation is the likely outcome.|$|E
