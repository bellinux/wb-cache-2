While natural frequencies are relatively easily identified even with simplified FE models, damping ratios are not identified with such an ease. In order to determine to what extent external factors influence dampingidentification, different tests have been carried out. The external factors considered, apart from temperature, are accelerometers, connection cables {{and the effect of}} the <b>glass</b> <b>layers.</b> To analyse the influence of the accelerometers and their connection cables a laser measuring device was employed considering three possibilities: sample without instrumentation, sample with the accelerometers fixed and sample completely instrumented. When the sample is completely instrumented, accelerometer readings are also analysed.

50|$|Anodic bonding on silicon {{substrates}} {{is divided}} into bonding using a thin sheet of glass (a wafer) or a <b>glass</b> <b>layer</b> that is deposited onto the silicon using a technique such as sputtering. The glass wafer is often sodium-containing Borofloat or Pyrex glasses. With an intermediate <b>glass</b> <b>layer,</b> {{it is also possible}} to connect two silicon wafers. The glass layers are deposited by sputtering, spin-on of a glass solution or vapor deposition upon the processed silicon wafer. The thickness of these layers range from one to a few micrometers with spin-on glass layers needing 1 µm or less. Hermetic seals of silicon to glass using an aluminum layer with thickness of 50 to 100 nm can reach strengths of 18.0 MPa.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} glass used in {{buildings}} and presents a criterion for fail-safe optimal design of glass plates. First, the paper {{shows that the}} glass plate is fail-safe only if the load-bearing system is composed of two <b>glass</b> <b>layers</b> bonded to one another with an elastomeric interlayer (Laminated Glass), and if the live loads act upon a sacrificial glass ply (tri-layer system). Then, activity was directed at analyzing the simply-supported fail-safe glass plate loaded out-of-plane, and carrying out research targeted at reducing the incidence of weight and cost (optimal design). The results, obtained using an analytical exact model, show that the limit states are always dictated by the maximum deflection and not by the load-carrying capacity. Thus, optimal design requires finding {{the thickness of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>layers</b> and the stiffness of the interlayer that provide the plate with exactly the minimum allowable stiffness, while the stress verifications are fulfilled automatically. Finally, for every span and load that is found in building applications of glass, the paper provides the thicknesses and the materials of the <b>glass</b> <b>layers</b> and interlayers that adjust capacity to match demand. These results may also replace structural analysis and assessment of Laminated Glass plates...|$|R

50|$|The {{properties}} of bullet-resistant glass {{can be affected}} by temperature and by exposure to solvents or UV radiation, usually from sunlight. If the polycarbonate layer is below a <b>glass</b> <b>layer,</b> it has some protection from UV radiation due to the glass and bonding layer.

50|$|Firing, where coated {{substrates}} {{are passed}} through a furnace to experience long periods of stable high temperatures, converts the adhering particles of frit into a continuous <b>glass</b> <b>layer.</b> The effectiveness of the process is highly dependent on the time, temperature, and the quality or thickness of the coating on the substrate. Most frits for industrial applications are fired for as low as 20 minutes, but frits for very heavy-duty industrial applications may take double this time. Porcelain enamel coatings on aluminium substrates may be fired at temperatures as low as 530°C, but most steel substrates require temperatures in excess of 800°C.|$|E

40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{and strength of}} laminated glass, a composite of <b>glass</b> <b>layers</b> bonded together by polymeric interlayers, depend upon shear coupling between the glass plies through the polymer.

Traditional formulations have been proposed for a package of two <b>layers</b> of <b>glass</b> and one polymeric interlayer, but their extrapolation to a higher number of layers gives in general inaccurate results. Here, the recently-proposed Enhanced Effective Thickness method is extended {{to the case of}} laminated glass beams composed i) by three <b>layers</b> of <b>glass</b> of arbitrary thickness, or ii) by an arbitrary number of equally-thick <b>glass</b> <b>layers.</b> Comparison with numerical experiments confirms the accuracy of the proposed approach...|$|R

50|$|Glass frit bonding, also {{referred}} to as glass soldering or seal glass bonding, describes a wafer bonding technique with an intermediate <b>glass</b> <b>layer.</b> It is a widely used encapsulation technology for surface micro-machined structures, e.g., accelerometers or gyroscopes. This technique utilizes low melting glass ("glass solder") and therefore provides various advantages including that viscosity of glass decreases with an increase of temperature. The viscous flow of glass has effects to compensate and planarize surface irregularities, convenient for bonding wafers with a high roughness due to plasma etching or deposition. A low viscosity promotes hermetically sealed encapsulation of structures based on a better adaption of the structured shapes. Further, the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass material is adapted to silicon. This results in low stress in the bonded wafer pair.|$|E
50|$|The Sainte-Chapelle has had {{various stages}} of {{restoration}} from the 1970s onwards. Air pollution, the elements and {{the large number of}} visitors all cause damage to the stained glass windows. Also, in 1945 a layer of external varnish had been applied to protect the glass from the dust and scratches of wartime bombing. This had gradually darkened, making the already fading images even harder to see. In 2008 a more comprehensive seven-year programme of restoration was begun, costing some 10 million euros, to clean and preserve all the stained glass, clean the facade stonework and conserve and repair some of the sculptures. Half of the funding was provided by private donors, the other half coming from the Villum Foundation. Included in the restoration was an innovative thermoformed <b>glass</b> <b>layer</b> applied outside the stained glass windows for added protection.

5000|$|One {{approach}} to OGS is called [...] "sensor on lens."

You add a thin insulator layer to the bottom of that, and then deposit a second ITO layer on the back of that, patterning it to create electrodes running at right angles to the first layer. This module then gets laminated onto a standard LCD panel.The other approach is called [...] "on-cell" [...] capacitive touchscreen. (Here the [...] "cell" [...] refers to the LCD.) A conductive layer of ITO is deposited directly onto the top layer of glass in the LCD panel, and then patterned into electrodes. A thin insulating layer is applied, and then the second ITO layer is patterned with the second layer of electrodes. Finally, the top polarizing layer is applied on top, and the display is completed by adding the cover glass.|$|E

5000|$|Doped {{metal oxides}} {{for use as}} {{transparent}} conducting layers in photovoltaic devices are typically grown on a glass substrate. This glass substrate, apart from providing a support that the oxide can grow on, has the additional benefit of blocking most infrared wavelengths greater than 2 µm for most silicates, and converting it to heat in the <b>glass</b> <b>layer.</b> This in turn helps maintain a low temperature of the active region of the solar cell, which degrades in performance as it heats up. TCO films can be deposited on a substrate through various deposition methods, including metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), metal organic molecular beam deposition (MOMBD), solution deposition, spray pyrolysis, ultrasonic nozzle sprayed graphene oxide and air sprayed Ag Nanowire [...] and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), however conventional fabrication techniques typically involve magnetron sputtering of the film. The sputtering process is very inefficient, with only 30% of planar target material available for deposition on the substrate. Cylindrical targets offer closer to 80% utilization. In the case of ITO recycling of unused target material is required for economic production. For AZO or ZnAl sputtering target material is sufficiently inexpensive that recovery of materials use is of no concern. There is some concern {{that there is a}} physical limit to the available indium for ITO Growth typically is performed in a reducing environment to compensating acceptor defects within the film (e.g. metal vacancies), which degrade the carrier concentration (if n-type).|$|E
