50|$|In 1956 modern colour light {{signalling}} {{was installed}} on the line, controlled from Stobcross and Bridgeton, with track circuit control intermediately. This enabled the closure of boxes at Dalmarnock, Glasgow Green, Glasgow Cross, Glasgow Central, Anderston Cross and Partick Central No.2. Each signal had an electric <b>detonator</b> <b>placer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{signalling}} at Longforgan was {{basic and}} lacking in many safety features. The Starting signal had no AWS that would have warned {{the driver of the}} Aberdeen train, nor was there an adjuster for the pull wire. There was also no repeater in the signal box, nor was a <b>detonator</b> <b>placer</b> provided.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{mechanical}} signal {{boxes in the}} UK were equipped with <b>detonator</b> <b>placers</b> that placed <b>detonators</b> on a running line when a lever was operated. The levers were painted a striking white and black chevron pattern, pointing upwards for the [...] "Up" [...] line, downwards for the [...] "Down" [...] line. In some cases, the placers were fed from a cartridge holding a number of detonators.|$|R
50|$|The inquiry {{made several}} recommendations. Most {{concerned}} {{the enforcement of}} regulations on drivers, firemen, guards and signalmen to ensure closer attention to their primary duty; the care and safety of trains. The more extensive use of Automatic Train Control (ATC), then under extended trial on the Great Western Railway, was discussed. This would sound a siren in the cab to alert the crew of a train if they passed a signal at danger or caution and then automatically apply the brakes if they failed to acknowledge and cancel the warning. Signalboxes should be fitted with <b>detonator</b> <b>placers,</b> to alert engine crews who missed signals or were unable to observe them in fog or thick weather. Electric lighting was clearly safer than gas oil lighting, and steel-framed carriages {{were less likely to}} be crushed than wooden-framed stock.|$|R
