Newer, external inductor type lamps use low frequency ballasts that usually have FCC or other certification, thus suggesting compliance with RFI regulations.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} circuits, methods and devices are {{implemented}} for radiofrequency amplifiers. According to one such implementation, a radiofrequency amplifier circuit is implemented in a SMD package. The circuit amplifies a radiofrequency signal having a base-band portion and {{a plurality of}} carrier signals frequency-spaced larger than the base-band bandwidth. The circuit includes a radiofrequency transistor connected to a circuit output having a parasitic output capacitance. The source-drain terminal is electrically connected to the circuit output. An <b>internal</b> shunt <b>inductor</b> provides compensation for the parasitic output capacitance.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the assessment {{and design of}} a 10 dBm 2. 4 GHz CMOS PA including driver stage. The PA is designed in a 0. 18 um CMOS technology. A three stage PA has been designed due to the high voltage gain needed. Class F has been chosen for the output stage. An output filter short-circuiting the second harmonic frequency and reflecting the third harmonic frequency is used to obtain the near-square drain voltage that is characteristic to class F. A lowered supply voltage of 0. 9 V is used to avoid exceeding the transistor break-down voltage of 2 V. The typical output power achieved is 10. 2 dBm. The drain efficiency of the output stage is 47. 7 %, and the PAE of the entire PA is 30. 5 %. The final layout excluding bonding pads consumes an area of 0. 66 mm 2, including four <b>internal</b> <b>inductors</b> consuming a total of 0. 59 mm 2. The PAE obtained is {{higher than those of}} a selection of recently published PAs that are comparable in technology, frequency and output power...|$|R
5000|$|Loop1 {{represents}} {{the interaction of}} an inductor's current with its internal and external series resistance. The current through an inductance is the time integral of the voltage across the inductance. When a voltage is first applied, all of it appears across the inductor. This is shown by the forward path through [...] As the current increases, voltage is dropped across the <b>inductor</b> <b>internal</b> resistance RM and the external resistance RS. This reduces the voltage across the inductor and {{is represented by the}} feedback path -(RM + RS). The current continues to increase but at a steadily decreasing rate until the current reaches the point at which all the voltage is dropped across (RM + RS). Loop 1 is intrinsic.|$|R
40|$|ISBN: 978 - 1 - 4244 - 4320 - 8 International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a detailed electromagnetic modeling {{for a new}} structure of a monolithic CMOS micromachined inductive microphone. This study is of capital importance for the optimization of this new microphone structure based on the variation of mutual inductance between an external fixed <b>inductor</b> and an <b>internal</b> suspended <b>inductor.</b> A prototype fabrication of this microphone {{has been done in}} a CMOS compatible process using a 0. 6 µm technology. The modeling results show that the use of an AC current in the primary fixed inductor gives a much larger induced voltage in the secondary inductor comparing to the case when a DC current is used. The induced voltage evaluated, in the μV range using a DC current solution, is multiplied by a factor of 3 to 6 when using the AC alternative current. We find a value of 1 nA for the current induced in the secondary inductor, which indicates that the Laplace force generated will have a negligible effect on the membrane displacement. We have proposed the use of the symmetric dual-layer spiral inductor structure that can increase the induced emf value by a factor of 4...|$|R
50|$|The voltage-fed {{inverter}} {{features a}} filter capacitor on the input to the inverter {{and a series}} resonant output circuits. The voltage-fed system is extremely popular {{and can be used}} with either SCRs up to frequencies of 10 kHz, IGBTs to 100 kHz and MOSFETs up to 3 MHz. A voltage-fed inverter with a series connection to a parallel load is also known as a third order system. Basically this is similar to solid state, but in this system the series connected <b>internal</b> capacitor and <b>inductor</b> are connected to a parallel output tank circuit. The principal advantage of this type of system is the robustness of the inverter due to the internal circuit effectively isolating the output circuit making the switching components less susceptible to damage due to coil flash-overs or mismatching.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{possibility}} of using an active internal matching element in {{several types of}} metamaterial-inspired, electrically small antennas (ESAs) to overcome their inherent narrow bandwidths is demonstrated. Beginning with the Z antenna, which is frequency tunable through its <b>internal</b> lumped element <b>inductor,</b> a circuit model is developed to determine an internal matching network, i. e., a frequency dependent inductor, {{which leads to the}} desired enhanced bandwidth performance. An analytical relation between the resonant frequency and the inductor value is determined via curve fitting of the associated HFSS simulation results. With this inductance-frequency relation defining the inductor values, a broad bandwidth, electrically small Z antenna is established. This internal matching network paradigm is then confirmed by applying it to the electrically small stub and canopy antennas. An electrically small canopy antenna with = 0 0467 that has over a 10 % bandwidth is finally demonstrated. The potential implementation of the required frequency dependent inductor is also explored with a well-defined active negative impedance converter circuit that reproduces the requisite inductance-frequency relations.

40|$|AbstractThe DC {{output voltage}} of some {{renewable}} energy {{systems such as}} photovoltaic systems and fuel cells is often of a low value. This requires some power electronic devices to step up the voltage to a suitable value which is required by inverters. Since the DC–DC converter is a nonlinear dynamic system due to its operation mode, a nonlinear method {{should be used for}} system analysis and design. This paper aims at analysis of the dynamic system, estimating the impact of inductor resistance on that behaviour and determining the stable operation regions of the system. The converter is simulated by a set of differential equations with considering the <b>inductor</b> <b>internal</b> resistance. The solutions have been derived and the outcome is a development of a mathematical model which is suitable for the discrete time map. Based on the established model, an algorithm for producing bifurcation diagrams is designed and a computer program in Matlab environment is written. Several computer simulations have been carried out and conclusions drawn, which would be useful for convertor and control design and for optimization of the operation mode of the converter system, avoiding the possible bifurcation and chaos phenomena in the long term...|$|R
40|$|Integrated inductors, {{also called}} spiral inductors, on-chip inductors, or planarinductors, are inseparable part in radio {{frequency}} integrated circuits (RFICs). Increasing growth in RFICs {{from the past}} few decades has forced study of these components in greater detail. Apart from IC inductors, there are several components mounted on a chip - namely capacitors, resistors, MOSFETs, diodes etc. It is extremely important to understand the electrical and magnetic behavior of all these components. Electrical behavior of these components is easy to understand. However, the real challenge lies in realizing and predicting the magnetic behavior of components, namely, inductors and capacitors. Capacitors have their own physical model developed for accurate modeling, but for inductors there are many factors to be considered. As the frequencies in RFICs are in the GHz range, factors such as self resonant frequency (SRF), quality factor (Q), self and mutual inductance are critical to design due to the very small size of inductor. Past research in this field has made it possible to predict magnetic behavior accurately by theoretical methods and/or electromagnetic simulators. Apart from these simulators, various equations have been derived for accurate calculation of inductance related to several geometries. Lumped physical models developed in the past help to model parasitic elements most accurately. This thesis concentrates on a brief study of integrated inductors, their construction and modeling. Different electromagnetic simulators available in the market are reviewed. A MATLAB based spiral and pi network calculators have been developed. Spiral calculators help to compare different equations while a pi calculator solves for parasitic components depending on substrate material, dielectric layer thickness, and metal oxide thickness. The main aim of this research was to design a theoretical design procedure for designing <b>inductor</b> <b>internal</b> dimensions. It has been described briefly with the design example. The proposed method makes it easy to design internal dimension such as the inner diameter (d), width (w), spacing (s), height (h), and number of turns (N). The results obtained are closer to the desired ones...|$|R
