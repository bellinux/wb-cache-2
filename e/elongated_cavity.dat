Clast macrofabric strengths weakened through time, presumably in response to increasingly wetter substrate conditions, until the emplacement of the fluted till when clast alignment was more tightly constrained. The fluting phase was initiated only after boulders were plucked from an adjacent bedrock cliff and lodged at the ice–till interface. This suggests that the parallel-sided flutings constrained shearing at the ice–bed interface {{in a similar fashion}} to a fault gouge, thereby strengthening clast alignments but allowing the till to mould around larger obstacles to produce herringbone fabric patterns. Strong clast macrofabric strengths in the till esker are not parallel to the ice flow direction, but instead align parallel with the local axis of the meandering ridge. This suggests that the till esker was likely produced by the squeezing of a dilatant till into an <b>elongated</b> <b>cavity</b> or R-channel after meltwater evacuation, followed by localized deformation, constrained by the channel walls, as the channel moved downvalley because of ice flow.

A high-resolution correspondence between radio and X-rays argues that the pulsar is interacting with the SNR via an opposed pair of collimated outflows. The outflow itself is seen as an elongated X-ray feature surrounded by a highly polarized radio sheath, while the interaction with the SNR manifests itself as a ring of radio/X-ray knots within the optical nebula RCW 89. We reject the hypothesis that the pulsar outflow powers the entire RCW 89 region. SNR G 320. 4 - 01. 2 and PSR B 1509 - 58 agree in distance and in rotation measure, and appear to be interacting. We thus conclude that the two objects are associated and have an age of <~ 1700 yr.

40|$|Background: Lignin {{degradation}} {{leads to}} the formation of a broad spectrum of aromatic molecules that can be used by various fungal micro-organisms as their sole source of carbon. When grown on phenolic compounds, Penicillium simplicissimum induces the strong expression of a flavin-containing vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO). The enzyme catalyses the oxidation of a vast array of substrates, ranging from aromatic amines to 4 -alkylphenols. VAO is a member of a novel class of widely distributed oxidoreductases, which use flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor covalently bound to the protein. We have carried out the determination of the structure of VAO in order to shed light on the most interesting features of these novel oxidoreductases, such as the functional significance of covalent flavinylation and the mechanism of catalysis. Results: The crystal structure of VAO has been determined in the native state and in complexes with four inhibitors. The enzyme is an octamer with 42 symmetry; the inhibitors bind in a hydrophobic, <b>elongated</b> <b>cavity</b> on the si side of the flavin molecule. Three residues, Tyr 108, Tyr 503 and Arg 504 form an anion-binding subsite, which stabilises the phenolate form of the substrate. The structure of VAO complexed with the inhibitor 4 -(1 -heptenyl) phenol shows that the catalytic cavity is completely filled by the inhibitor, explaining why alkylphenols bearing aliphatic substituents longer than seven carbon atoms do not bind to the enzyme. Conclusions: The shape of the active-site cavity controls substrate specificity by providing a ‘size exclusion mechanism’. Inside the cavity, the substrate aromatic ring is positioned at an angle of 18 ° to the flavin ring. This arrangement is ideally suited for a hydride transfer reaction, which is further facilitated by substrate deprotonation. Burying the substrate beneath the protein surface is a recurrent strategy, common to many flavoenzymes that effect substrate oxidation or reduction via hydride transfer. ...|$|E

This host has an <b>elongated</b> <b>cavity</b> with oval-shaped portals. It is intrinsically fluorescent, and more importantly, this fluorescence is sensitive to guest encapsulation, allowing {{for the study of}} the inclusion of nonfluorescent guests by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the case of benzene as guest, significant enhancement of the cucurbit[6]uril analogue host fluorescence was observed upon addition of benzene; this allowed for the determination of the binding constant for 1 : 1 host-guest complexation, yielding a value of K = 6900 ? 1100 M- 1. This complexation was also studied by 1 H NMR, yielding a similar value of K = 8980 ? 500 M- 1. The binding of a much larger guest, the dye Nile Red, was also studied, but in this case using guest fluorescence. Significant suppression of the Nile Red fluorescence was observed upon 1 : 1 complexation with the cucurbit[6]uril analogue, with an extremely large binding constant of 8. 2 ? 0. 5 ? 106 M- 1, indicating a very strong host-guest interaction and an excellent size and shape match. In both cases, binding was much stronger than in the case of the same guests with cucurbit[6]uril itself, and in the case of Nile Red, binding was also much stronger than with modified - or -cyclodextrins. This is partly a result of the partial aromatic nature of the host walls, which allow for - interactions not possible in cucurbiturils or cyclodextrins. The ability to study its inclusion complexes using either host or guest fluorescence, and the very high binding constants observed, illustrates the versatility and potential usefulness of this new host compound.

40|$|Cavity {{formation}} {{resulting from}} the water-entry of solid objects {{has been the subject}} of extensive research owing to its practical relevance in naval, military, industrial, sports and biological applications. The cavity formed by an impacting hydrophobic sphere normally seals at two places, one below (deep seal) and the other above the water surface (surface seal). For Froude numbers, the air flow into the resulting cavity is strong enough to suck the splash crown above the surface and disrupt the cavity dynamics before it deep seals. In this research work we eliminate surface seals by means of a novel practice of using cone splash-guards and examine the undisturbed transient cavity dynamics by impact of hydrophobic spheres for Froude numbers ranging. This enabled the measurement of extremely accurate pinch-off heights, pinch-off times, radial cavity collapse rates, and jet speeds in an extended range of Froude numbers compared to the previous work of Duclaux et al. (2007). Results in the extended regime were in remarkable agreement with the theoretical prediction of scaled pinch-off depth, and experimentally derived pinch-off time for. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of confinement on cavity formation by varying the cross-sectional area of the tank of liquid. In conjunction with surface seal elimination we observed the formation of multiple pinch-off points where a maximum of four deep seals were obtained in a sequential order for the Froude number range investigated. The presence of an <b>elongated</b> <b>cavity</b> beneath the first pinch-off point 5 resulted in evident "kinks" primarily related to the greatly diminished air pressure at the necking region caused by supersonic air flows (Gekle et al. 2010).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{results on the}} {{formation}} of He-cavities in Si {{in the presence of}} vacancies and hydrogen produced by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) high-density hydrogen plasma treatment. Epitaxial Si (111) samples were first implanted with 1. 55 MeV He ions at a dose of 5 × 10 16 cm- 2. Subsequent annealing at 800 °C for 30 min creates a band of cavities around the He projected range. This band is mainly made up of big <b>elongated</b> <b>cavities</b> in the middle surrounded by a high density of small ones. Other defects (mainly dislocations) have also been observed within and beneath the cavity band. Additional hydrogen plasma treatment, however, changes the morphology of the He-cavities. Plasma hydrogenation tends to increase both the width of cavity band and the cavity size, while, the density of cavities decreases. Moreover, with the plasma hydrogenation step, the cavities are accompanied by a significant concentration of dislocation loops. Such effects have been interpreted in terms of the vacancy-type defects and atomic hydrogen introduced by plasma hydrogenation, and thus their interactions with He-cavities. We have confirmed the generation of high concentrations of vacancies by hydrogen plasma treatment through positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) measurements...|$|R

This series of five fluid dynamics videos illustrates several subtle but interesting variations that can be seen. The first series of videos contrasts the nature of impact (F r = Uo / √ gd = 5. 15) between a hydrophilic (wetting angle of α = 60 ◦) and hydrophobic sphere (α = 120 ◦), and illustrates how surface coating can affect whether or not an air cavity is formed; the views from the side and from above are synchronized in time. The second video series illustrates how spin and surface treatments can alter the splash and cavity formation following water entry. The spinning sphere (S = ωr/Uo = 1. 7; F r = 5. 15) causes a wedge of fluid to be drawn into the cavity due to the no-slip condition and follows a curved trajectory. The non-spinning sphere (F r = 5. 15) has two distinct surface treatments on the left and right hemispheres: the left hemisphere is hydrophobic (α = 120 ◦) and the right hemisphere is hydrophilic (α = 60 ◦). Interestingly, the cavity formation for the half-and-half sphere has many similarities to that of the spinning sphere especially when viewed from above. The third video series compares two millimetric nylon spheres impacting at slightly different impact speeds (Uo = 40 cm/s and Uo = 45 cm/s); the faster sphere fully penetrates the free surface, forming a cavity, whereas the slower sphere does not. The fourth series shows the instability of an elongated water-entry cavity formed by a millimetric steel sphere with a hydrophobic coating impacting at Uo = 600 cm/s.

The latter technique is applied by mounting a polycapillary half-lens in front of the energy dispersive detector, thereby effectively reducing the volume defined by the intersection of the incoming beam and the sample to a volume defined by the acceptance of the polycapillary. A linear Fresnel lens assembly or a KB-mirror system, were used to reduce the dimensions of the incoming X-ray beam to the 200 - 300 nm level. The recorded XRF data have been evaluated using XMI-quant, a software package made by the XMI-UGent group in order to perform quantitative evaluation of micro-XRF spectra with special focus on data from confocal XRF imaging experiments. This software package includes an implementation of the fundamental parameter method allowing the analysis of the complex Stardust particles. The presented quantitative results confirm the earlier findings concerning the presence of Ca-Al-rich inclusions in the cometary dust...|$|E
40|$|Glutaminyl cyclases (QCs) (EC 2. 3. 2. 5) {{catalyze}} the intramolecular cyclization {{of protein}} N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamic acid with the concomitant liberation of ammonia. QCs may be classified in two groups containing, respectively, the mammalian enzymes, and the enzymes from plants, bacteria, and parasites. The crystal {{structure of the}} QC from the latex of Carica papaya (PQC) has been determined at 1. 7 A resolution. The structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using sulfur and zinc as anomalous scatterers. The enzyme folds into a five-bladed beta-propeller, with two additional alpha-helices and one beta hairpin. The propeller closure is achieved via an original molecular velcro, which links the last two blades into a large eight stranded beta-sheet. The zinc ion present in the PQC is bound via an octahedral coordination into an <b>elongated</b> <b>cavity</b> located along the pseudo 5 -fold axis of the beta-propeller fold. This zinc ion presumably plays a structural role and {{may contribute to the}} exceptional stability of PQC, along with an extended hydrophobic packing, the absence of long loops, the three-joint molecular velcro and the overall folding itself. Multiple sequence alignments combined with structural analyses have allowed us to tentatively locate the active site, which is filled in the crystal structure either by a Tris molecule or an acetate ion. These analyses are further supported by the experimental evidence that Tris is a competitive inhibitor of PQC. The active site is located at the C-terminal entrance of the PQC central tunnel. W 83, W 110, W 169, Q 24, E 69, N 155, K 225, F 22 and F 67 are highly conserved residues in the C-terminal entrance, and their putative role in catalysis is discussed. The PQC structure is representative of the plants, bacterial and parasite enzymes and contrasts with that of mammalian enzymes, that may possibly share a conserved scaffold of the bacterial aminopeptidase.

40|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of Lowenstam and Weiner that crustaceans are the “champions of mineral mobilization and deposition {{of the animal}} kingdom,” relatively few proteins from the two main calcification sites in these animals, i. e., the exoskeleton and the transient calcium storage organs, have been identified, sequenced, and their roles elucidated. Here, a 65 -kDa protein (GAP 65) from the gastrolith of the crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, is fully characterized and its function in the mineralization of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) of the extracellular matrix is demonstrated. GAP 65 is a negatively charged glycoprotein that possesses three predicted domains: a chitin-binding domain 2, a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A domain, and a polysaccharide deacetylase domain. Expression of GAP 65 was localized to columnar epithelial cells of the gastrolith disk during premolt. In vivo administration of GAP 65 dsRNA resulted in a significant reduction of GAP 65 transcript levels in the gastrolith disk. Such gene silencing also caused dramatic structural and morphological deformities in the chitinous-ACC extracellular matrix structure. ACC deposited in these gastroliths appeared to be sparsely packed with large <b>elongated</b> <b>cavities</b> compared with the normal gastrolith, where ACC is densely compacted. ACC spherules deposited in these gastroliths are significantly larger than normal. GAP 65, moreover, inhibited calcium carbonate crystallization in vitro and stabilized synthetic ACC. Thus, GAP 65 is the first protein shown to have dual function, involved both in extracellular matrix formation and in mineral deposition during biomineralization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{report an}} {{environmentally}} stable nanotube mode-locked fiber laser producing linearly-polarized, nanosecond pulses. A simple all-polarization-maintaining fiber ring cavity is used, including 300 m of highly nonlinear fiber to <b>elongate</b> the <b>cavity</b> and increase intracavity dispersion and nonlinearity. The laser generates scalar pulses {{with a duration}} of 1. 23 ns at a center wavelength of 1042 nm, with 1. 3 -nm bandwidth and at 641 -kHz repetition rate. Despite the long cavity, the output characteristics show no significant variation when the cavity is perturbed, and the degree of polarization remains at 97 %.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) {{plays a key}} role in the evolution of gas in groups and clusters of galaxies. Unequivocal evidence comes from quasi-spherical X-ray cavities observed near cluster centers having sizes ranging from a few to tens of kpc, some containing radio emission. Cavities apparently evolve from the interaction of AGN jets with the intracluster medium (ICM). However, in numerical simulations it has been difficult to create such fat cavities from narrow jets. Ultra-hot thermal jets dominated by kinetic energy typically penetrate deep into the ICM, forming radially <b>elongated</b> <b>cavities</b> at large radii unlike those observed. Here, we study very light jets dominated energetically by relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) with axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations, investigating the jet evolution both when they are active and when they are later turned off. We find that, when the thermal gas density in a CR-dominated jet is sufficiently low, the jet has a correspondingly low inertia, and thus decelerates quickly in the ICM. Furthermore, CR pressure causes the jet to expand laterally, encounter and displace more decelerating ICM gas, naturally producing fat cavities near cluster centers similar to those observed. Our calculations of cavity formation imply that AGN jets responsible for creating fat X-ray cavities (radio bubbles) are very light, and dominated by CRs. This scenario is consistent with radio observations of Fanaroff-Riley I jets that appear to decelerate rapidly, produce strong synchrotron emission and expand typically at distances of a few kpc from the central AGN.
