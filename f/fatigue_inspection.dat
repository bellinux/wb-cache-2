40|$|Offshore {{wind turbine}} (OWT) support {{structures}} account for 20 - 25 % {{of the capital}} cost for offshore wind installations, making it essential to optimize {{the design of the}} tower, substructure, and foundation to the extent possible. This dissertation focuses on monopile foundations, as the vast majority (approximately 75 %) of currently installed OWTs are supported by monopile structures. The objective of this dissertation is to provide information on the behavior of monopile support structures to better substantiate design and planning decisions and to provide a basis for reducing the structural material costs. In pursuit of these objectives, research is presented on the topics of hysteretic soil-structure damping (referred to as foundation damping), cyclic degradation of soil properties, and the impact of marine growth on OWT monopile support structures. OWTs are lightly damped structures that must withstand highly uncertain offshore wind and wave loads. In addition to stochastic load amplitudes, the dynamic behavior of OWTs must be designed with consideration of stochastic load frequency from waves and mechanical load frequencies associated with the spinning rotor during power production. The close proximity of the OWT natural frequency to excitation frequencies combined with light damping necessitates a thorough analysis of various sources of damping within the OWT system; of these sources of damping, least is known about the contributions of damping from soil-structure interaction (foundation damping), though researchers have back-calculated foundation damping from “rotor-stop” tests after estimating aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and structural damping with numerical models. Because design guidelines do not currently recommend methods for determining foundation damping, it is typically neglected. The significance of foundation damping on monopile-supported OWTs subjected to extreme storm loading was investigated using a linear elastic two-dimensional finite element model. A simplified foundation model based on the soil-pile mudline stiffness matrix was used to represent the monopile, and hysteretic energy loss in the foundation was converted into a viscous, rotational dashpot at the mudline to represent foundation damping. The percent critical damping contributed to the OWT structural system by foundation damping was quantified using the logarithmic decrement method on a finite element free vibration time history, and stochastic time history analysis of extreme storm conditions indicated that mudline OWT foundation damping can significantly decrease the maximum and standard deviation of mudline moment. Further investigation of foundation damping on cyclic load demand for monopile-supported OWTs was performed considering the design situations of power production, emergency shutdown, and parked conditions. The NREL 5 MW Reference Turbine was modeled using the aero-hydro-elastic software FAST and included linear mudline stiffness and damping matrices to take into account soil-structure interaction. Foundation damping was modeled using viscous rotational mudline dashpots which were calculated as a function of hysteretic energy loss, cyclic mudline rotation amplitude, and OWT natural frequency. Lateral monopile capacity can be significantly affected by cyclic loading, causing failure at cyclic load amplitudes lower than the failure load under monotonic loading. For monopiles in clay, undrained clay behavior under short-term cyclic soil-pile loading (e. g. extreme storm conditions) typically includes plastic soil deformation resulting from reductions in soil modulus and undrained shear strength which occur as a function of pore pressure build-up. These impacts affect the assessment of the ultimate and serviceability limit states of OWTs via natural frequency degradation and accumulated permanent rotation at the mudline, respectively. Novel combinations of existing p-y curve design methods were used to compare the impact of short-term cyclic loading on monopiles in soft, medium, and stiff clay. Marine growth increases mass and surface roughness for offshore structures, which can reduce natural frequency and increase hydrodynamic loads, and can also interfere with corrosion protection and <b>fatigue</b> <b>inspections.</b> Design standards and guidelines do not have a unified long-term approach for marine growth on OWTs, though taking into account added mass and increased drag is recommended. Some standards recommend inspection and cleaning of marine growth, but this would negate the artificial reef benefits which have been touted as a potential boon to the local marine habitat. The effects of marine growth on monopile-supported OWTs in terms of natural frequency and hydrodynamic loading are examined, and preliminary recommendations are given from the engineering perspective on the role of marine growth in OWT support structure design...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A reliability-based {{method for}} {{inspection}} scheduling of steel bridges is proposed to yield the optimal (most economical) inspection strategy that meets an acceptable safety level through the planned ser-vice life. Two fatigue reliability formulations {{that can be}} applied for most details in steel bridges are pre-sented. For details classified according to AASHTO fatigue categories, a limit state function related to the number of stress cycles to failure based on Miner’s rule is used to evaluate the fatigue reliability; for details not classified according to AASHTO fatigue categories, a limit state function related to crack size and growth rate is used to evaluate the <b>fatigue</b> reliability. The <b>inspection</b> scheduling problem is modeled as an optimiza-tion problem with an objective function that includes the total expected cost of inspection, repair, and failure formulated using an event tree approach, appropriate constraints on the interval between inspections, and a specified minimally acceptable (target) structural reliability. An optimal inspection-scheduling plan can thus be developed for any specified fatigue details or fracture-critical sections in steel bridges. Examples pre-sented demonstrate the advantage of the reliability-based optimal inspection scheduling in cost saving and structural reliability control over alternative inspection plans.

This information was used to develop an inspection guideline that provides information on where to look during an <b>inspection</b> for <b>fatigue</b> damage. An <b>inspection</b> plan was formulated by using a crack propagation analysis to evaluate crack growth under the most critical wind loading environment. Based on these analyses, an inspection period of four years was recommended for single and double mastarm cantilever sign structures (Class A) and an eight year inspection cycle was recommended for box-truss, tri-chord, and monotube sign structures...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} apply the damage {{tolerance}} design philosophy to design marine structures, accurate prediction of fatigue crack growth under service conditions is required. Now, {{more and more people}} have realized that only a fatigue life prediction method based on fatigue crack propagation (FCP) theory has the potential to explain various fatigue phenomena observed. In this book, the issues leading towards the development of a unified fatigue life prediction (UFLP) method based on FCP theory are addressed. Based on the philosophy of the UFLP method, the current inconsistency between <b>fatigue</b> design and <b>inspection</b> of marine structures could be resolved. This book presents the state-of-the-art and recent advances, including those by the authors, in fatigue studies. It is designed to lead the future directions and to provide a useful tool in many practical applications. It is intended to address to engineers, naval architects, research staff, professionals and graduates engaged in fatigue prevention design and survey of marine structures, in fatigue studies of materials and structures, in experimental laboratory research, in planning the repair and maintenance of existing structures, and in rule development. The book is also an effective educational aid in naval architecture, marine, civil and mechanical engineering.

40|$|Railway bridges are {{expensive}} {{to build and}} when damage occurs, it can cause serious problem in traffic due to repairing or in worst case total collapse of the bridge. Today most railway bridges are older, but the traffic on them is increasing both in numbers and tons. This sets high demands on service of the bridges and on numerical calculations to uphold the infrastructure. When damage occurs on a bridge, the load at the damaged area will increase and standard calculation methods can not be applied anymore. To fully estimate lifetime in a bridge due to the cyclic loading that occurs when a train passes over the bridge, advanced numerical methods can be used. To avoid wear and <b>fatigue</b> problem, regular <b>inspections</b> are necessary. In this work literature study, analysis and numerical modelling are used to study the dynamics of railway bridges. The interaction between the vehicle and the bridge is important and four different load models were created. These load models were used to load two different beam spans at three different velocities. By this, the basic theory of moving loads were verified showing that the velocity has {{a significant impact on}} the loading of the beam. Present method used by civil engineers follows the basic theory of moving loads. The numerical results shows that the more degrees of freedom the load models have the less the displacement will be. When analysing the dynamics of bridges the finite element method works for both simple cases e. i. constant moving force and more advanced cases e. i. more realistic load models and bridge models.

40|$|Physics-based {{models are}} {{routinely}} {{used to predict}} the performance of engineered systems to make decisions such as when to retire system components, how to {{extend the life of}} an aging system, or if a new design will be safe or available. Model verification and validation (V&V) is a process to establish credibility in model predictions. Ideally, carefully controlled validation experiments will be designed and performed to validate models or submodels. In reality, time and cost constraints limit experiments and even model development. This paper describes elements of model V&V during the development and application of a probabilistic fracture assessment model to predict cracking in space shuttle main engine high-pressure oxidizer turbopump knife-edge seals. The objective of this effort was to assess the probability of initiating and growing a crack to a specified failure length in specific flight units for different usage and inspection scenarios. The probabilistic fracture assessment model developed in this investigation combined a series of submodels describing the usage, temperature history, flutter tendencies, tooth stresses and numbers of cycles, <b>fatigue</b> cracking, nondestructive <b>inspection,</b> and finally the probability of failure. The analysis accounted for unit-to-unit variations in temperature, flutter limit state, flutter stress magnitude, and fatigue life properties. The investigation focused on the calculation of relative risk rather than absolute risk between the usage scenarios. Verification predictions were first performed for three units with known usage and cracking histories to establish credibility in the model predictions. Then, numerous predictions were performed for an assortment of operating units that had flown recently or that were projected for future flights. Calculations were performed using two NASA-developed software tools: NESSUS(Registered Trademark) for the probabilistic analysis, and NASGRO(Registered Trademark) for the fracture mechanics analysis. The goal of these predictions was to provide additional information to guide decisions on the potential of reusing existing and installed units prior to the new design certification...|$|R
