25|$|Agriculture is the {{cultivation}} and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants {{and other products}} used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development {{in the rise of}} sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural method.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} {{societies}} with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> irrigation-based <b>agriculture</b> {{have been less}} likely to adopt democracy than societies with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> rainfed <b>agriculture.</b> Rather than actual irrigation, the empirical analysis is based on how much irrigation potentially can increase yields. Irrigation potential is derived {{from a range of}} exogenous geographic factors, and reverse causality is therefore ruled out. Our results hold both at the cross-country level, and at the subnational level in premodern societies surveyed by ethnographers. ...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the wild}} {{vegetation}} of the area is that of grassland with very little forest mostly due to a long <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> in the area. One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life is the growing of crops, especially {{in the east and}} south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, and walnuts. There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa. Most {{of the wild}}life of the area has been extinguished because of human encroachment but in the Santa Catarina mountains there are still badgers, cacomistle and bats as well as various kinds of rodents and birds found throughout the borough.|$|E

500|$|The first {{wild animal}} to be domesticated was the dog. Half-wild dogs, perhaps {{starting}} with young individuals, {{may have been}} tolerated as scavengers and killers of vermin, and being naturally pack hunters, were predisposed {{to become part of}} the human pack and join in the hunt. Prey animals, sheep, goats, pigs and cattle, were progressively domesticated early in the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 13,000 BC, and sheep followed, some time between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. A cow was a great advantage to a villager as it produced more milk than its calf needed, and its strength could be put to use, pulling a plough to increase production of crops, and drawing a sledge, and later a cart, to bring the produce home from the field. Draught animals were first used about 4,000 BC in the Middle East, increasing agricultural production immeasurably. In southern Asia, the elephant was domesticated by 6,000 BC. Fossilised chicken bones dated to 5040 BC have been found in northeastern China, far from where their wild ancestors lived in the jungles of tropical Asia, but archaeologists believe that the original purpose of domestication was for the sport of cockfighting. [...] Meanwhile in South America, the llama and the alpaca had been domesticated, probably before 3,000 BC, as beasts of burden and for their wool. Neither was strong enough to pull a plough which limited the development of agriculture in the New World.|$|E

2500|$|Agriculture {{has been}} theorized {{to have become}} the {{dominant}} way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution. [...] Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. [...] As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, {{it was discovered that}} specific organisms and their by-products could effectively fertilize, restore nitrogen, and control pests. Throughout the <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture,</b> farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.|$|E
