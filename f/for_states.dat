Following a series of international meetings on the subject, the UN General Assembly approved resolution 50/64, which appealed <b>for</b> <b>states</b> to follow the PTBT and called for conclusion of the CTBT talks. In September 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was signed and superseded the PTBT, though the PTBT is still in effect <b>for</b> <b>states</b> not party to the CTBT. The CTBT has yet to enter into force, as 8 required states have not ratified the treaty, including the US and China. France, Russia, and the UK have ratified the CTBT.
