The Transvaal marks the eastern {{limit of the}} range, from where it extends westward to the Atlantic and northward to {{southern}} Angola and Botswana. In Botswana, they mostly occur in the Kalahari <b>desert</b> <b>in</b> the southwestern and central parts of the country. They are widespread across Namibia and the vast grasslands of the Free State and the shrublands of Karoo in South Africa; however, they are confined to the Namib <b>Desert</b> <b>in</b> Angola.|$|E

5|$|Although in most cacti, {{the stem}} {{acts as the}} main organ for storing water, some cacti have in {{addition}} large taproots.

5|$|During the Flavian dynasty, the princes of the Iazyges {{were trained}} in the Roman army, officially as an honor, but in reality serving as a hostage, because the kings held {{absolute}} power over the Iazyges.

5|$|The {{northern}} half of Africa {{is occupied}} by the world's most extensive hot, dry region, the Sahara Desert. Some deserts are also occupying much of southern Africa : the Namib and the Kalahari. Across Asia, a large annual rainfall minimum, composed primarily of deserts, stretches from the Gobi <b>Desert</b> <b>in</b> Mongolia west-southwest through western Pakistan (Balochistan) and Iran into the Arabian <b>Desert</b> <b>in</b> Saudi Arabia. Most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, making it the world's driest inhabited continent. In South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina. The drier areas of the United States are regions where the Sonoran Desert overspreads the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin and central Wyoming.|$|E

5|$|A. Keene Richard was {{the first}} American known to have {{specifically}} bred Arabian horses. He traveled to the <b>desert</b> <b>in</b> 1853 and 1856 to obtain breeding stock, which he crossed on Thoroughbreds, and also bred purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, his horses were lost during the Civil War and have no known purebred Arabian descendants today. Another major U.S. political figure, William H. Seward purchased four Arabians in Beirut in 1859, prior to becoming Secretary of State to Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|From a {{behavioral}} standpoint, {{one of the}} most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the Gobi <b>Desert</b> <b>in</b> 1971. It included a Velociraptor attacking a Protoceratops, providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other. Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged {{in such a way that}} shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived. Cannibalism amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod Majungasaurus.|$|E
5|$|In the Peoples Republic of China, ten {{reactors}} provide about 2% {{of electricity}} and five more are under construction.

Geological disposal has been studied since 1985, and a permanent deep geological repository was required by law in 2003. Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi <b>desert</b> <b>in</b> northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E

5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar <b>Desert</b> <b>in</b> the northwest and the Himalayas {{in the north}} work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E
5|$|Many centuries later, both {{world wars}} saw {{fighting}} in the <b>desert.</b> <b>In</b> the First World War, the Ottoman Turks were engaged with the British regular army in a campaign that spanned the Arabian peninsula. The Turks were defeated by the British, who had the backing of irregular Arab forces that were seeking to revolt against the Turks in the Hejaz, made famous in T. E. Lawrence's book Seven Pillars of Wisdom.|$|E
