50|$|The tank {{suspension}} {{was composed}} of 17 twin small diameter rollers, an idler at the front, and rear <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The 1st and 17th road wheels had individual suspension, the three middle rollers connected to the common carriage, and the remaining pairs were in 6 bogies. To facilitate {{the management of the}} tank, {{as in the case of}} TG, Grotte decided to apply an electric transmission and servo control that, although increasing the ergonomics of the tank, further complicated the suspension and raised its cost.|$|E
50|$|The hull, with {{a length}} of 4.02 m, {{consisted}} of three cast modules, with a maximum thickness of 43 millimetres, that were bolted together. Total weight was 10.6 metric tonnes (9.8 tonnes without fuel and ammunition). The bottom module carried on each side an independently sprung front wheel, two bogies and the <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the extreme front. The final drive and differentials were housed at the right in the nose module. It was steered through a Cletrac differential with five gears and by engaging the brakes. The driver was seated somewhat {{to the left and}} had two hatches. The Renault V-4 85 hp engine was to the right in the short rear with the self sealing 166 litre fuel tank at its left. It rendered a road speed of 20 km/h and a range of 130 km. Cross-country speed did not exceed 14 km/h and the fuel consumption totaled 212 litre/100 km. From 1940 onward they were fitted with AMX tails to help in trench crossing.|$|E
5000|$|Roberts, {{from this}} {{experience}} of the War Office competition, had the vision to design a vehicle for the British Army which {{would be able to}} traverse unstable ground. Vehicles such as Hornsby's 12-ton tractor would quickly be hindered by waterlogged surfaces with wheels sinking in mud. On 23 July 1904, his patent (No. 16,345) obviated this problem, with a vehicle where [...] two pitched chains of links and pins with cross bars and blocks of metal and wood to make contact with the ground are passed around the front and rear sprocket wheels, one {{on each side of the}} vehicle and form a track. The weight of the vehicle body (and engine) is taken by side brackets provided with curved pathways or bearing surfaces resting on rollers which, in turn, are supported on the chains, or on rollers of large diameter revolving on fixed pins. With this arrangement, when the vehicle is running the body is, so to say, rolled forward on the chains. Steering may be accomplished by varying the speed of the <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket</b> wheels on either side of the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The chassis of the SU-152G {{was based}} on that of the SU-100P {{self-propelled}} anti-tank gun, and consisted of 6 pairs of rubberized support and three pairs of supporting rollers. On the rear part of the vehicle the guide wheels were installed, while the <b>driving</b> <b>sprockets</b> were mounted on the front. The tracks consisted of small links with rubber-metal forged hinges. Each track measured 412 by 133 millimeters. The SU-152G used individual torsion for suspension. Gydraulic shock absorbers were installed on {{the first and the}} sixth pair of rollers.|$|R
50|$|Pedals were {{initially}} attached to cranks connecting {{directly to the}} driven (usually front) wheel. The safety bicycle, {{as it is known}} today, came into being when the pedals were attached to a crank <b>driving</b> a <b>sprocket</b> that transmitted power to the driven wheel by means of a roller chain.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized <b>driving</b> <b>sprockets</b> and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized driven sprockets, allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the sprockets on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the final drive gear ratio.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{conveniently}} analyze the dynamic performance of tracked vehicles, mathematic models are established {{based on the}} actual structure of vehicles and terrain mechanics when they are moving on the soft random terrain. A discrete method is adopted to solve the coupled equations to calculate the acceleration of the vehicle’s mass center and tractive force of <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket.</b> Computation results output by the model {{presented in this paper}} are compared with results given by the model, which has the same parameters, built in the multi-body dynamic software. It shows that the steady state calculation results are basically consistent, while the model presented in this paper is more convenient {{to be used in the}} optimization of structure parameters of tracked vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the impact and the polygon effect of the chain and the sprocket during the meshing process and achieve the purpose of noise reduction, a Hlow noiseH nano-structured metal mesh-polyurethane composite material split roller chain was designed by means of changing structure and material of chain roller. Noise testing and frequency spectrum analysis were conducted, for the new roller chain {{and the other three}} kinds of the same specification chains with different structural rollers, on the closed force flow noise test bench researched and developed independently. The results show that the new roller chain can absorb some of the impact energy, and reduce vibration and noise of chain drive. The noise level generated by the new roller chain is significantly lower than the other tested roller chains, especially in high frequency and high speed. The difference in noise level is actually 3 - 11 dB in <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket</b> speed of 1000 r/min, and a significant noise reduction is achieved. The results also verify low noise characteristics of the new roller chain and rationality of design method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} analyze {{deformation}} and stress state of round link chain which {{is generated by}} <b>driving</b> <b>sprocket</b> for sudden loading or starting moment between the chains during the working conditions, the symmetric penalty function method was utilized in contact-impact interface of LS-DYNA program and the finite element software ANSYS/LS-DYNA was used to carry on 3 D nonlinear contact analysis of three round link chains, the curves of stress and deformation with varying time were gained by simulating {{the process of the}} instant contact-impact of chains. The results show that the largest stress value is appeared on the contacting curved arm of driven round link chain, the second stress value is connecting round link chain, the least stress value is driving round link chain; it is circular shape of the contact area of round link chains and it is the main reasons of damage that the largest stress and deformation values of impact is caused by instant changing loading when time lasts 0. 05 s, and the series gradually fluctuation of strength is led to fatigue through finite element analysis software. The symmetric penalty function method of finite elements can provide a theoretical basis and simulation methods for analyzing the round link chain driving in a variety of different working conditions under the conditions of contact-impact...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article {{describes}} the original method proposed by authors that provides decreasing of the dynamic loading of tractor transmission by means of change of the reactive element torsional stiffness. One of the most loaded elements in tracked vehicles is the final drive unit which is loaded by high dynamic modes. The tractor Chetra 6 C- 315 has an epicyclic final drive with a stopped ring gear. Authors propose use of a strictly resilient mount of the ring gear instead of a rigid connection. To analyze efficiency of the proposed method, a 3 D-model of transmission {{was created in the}} “Universal Mechanism” software. Also, the model of a caterpillar mover was created in the same software for analysis of influence on transmission loads of the complex of kinematic and dynamic factors impacting on the forming of torque on <b>driving</b> <b>sprockets.</b> This article presents results of modeling of loading processes in transmission elements with the elastic coupling and without it during the longitudinal motion at various speeds and in turns with various radii. The results show that element dynamic load at high loading dynamic modes decreases by 20 - 30 % in case the coupling is installed...|$|R
25|$|A ghost or {{floating}} chainring is {{an additional}} chainring in the drive train between the <b>driving</b> chainring and <b>sprocket.</b> The top of the chain moves it forward {{at the same speed}} that the bottom of the chain moves it backwards, giving the appearance that it is floating in the chain.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interest}} of simplicity, all models used a friction-drive transmission. A roller (a metal wheel with a rubber surface vulcanized to increase its grip) on the front sprocket shaft was pressed against the machined rear surface of the engine flywheel, thus <b>driving</b> the <b>sprocket</b> shaft, the drive chains and the rear wheels. Moving the shift lever set the drive roller to various positions on the flywheel, either nearer the center or nearer the edge, effectively changing the [...] "gear ratio" [...] for climbing hills or driving on level roads. Moving the roller past the center point spun it backwards to give reverse gear. The front sprocket drive shaft was free to slide forward and backwards slightly, just enough to allow the roller {{to move away from}} the flywheel. The [...] "clutch pedal" [...] worked differently from most other cars, in that the operator had to hold their foot on the pedal to keep the roller pressed against the flywheel (the catalog claimed that the weight of the operator’s foot was sufficient to provide forward motion). Removing the foot from the pedal allowed the roller to spring back from the flywheel, effectively providing [...] "neutral" [...] so the car could be cranked without moving forwards.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} of shape memory alloys spurred {{a period of}} intense interest {{in the area of}} heat engines in the late 70 's and early 80 's. It was believed that these engines could use heat from low temperature sources such as solar heated water, geothermal hot water and rejected heat from conventional engines as a significant source of power. The interest has since dwindled, largely because small prototype devices developed in the laboratory could not be scaled up to produce significant power. It is believed that the scaled-up designs failed because they were dependent on friction as the driving mechanism, which led to large energy losses and slip. This thesis proposes a new chain and <b>sprocket</b> <b>driving</b> mechanism that is independent of friction and should therefore allow for large-scale power generation. This thesis begins by presenting properties and applications of shape memory alloys. The proposed design is then described in detail, followed by a review of the evolution that led to the final design. A brief chapter on thermodynamic modeling and a summary chapter suggesting improvements on the current design follow...|$|R
50|$|The M3 was the solution. The {{design was}} unusual because the main weapon — a larger caliber, low-velocity 75 mm gun — {{was in an}} offset sponson mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was {{necessary}} because, at the time, American tank plants were incapable of casting a turret {{big enough to hold}} the 75mm main gun. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37 mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a machine gun. The use of two main guns was seen on the French Char B1 and the Mark I version of the British Churchill tank. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel high explosive ammunition and armor-piercing ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern having a main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for efficiently piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain urgently needed tanks. A draw-back of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a hull-down position and use its 75 mm gun at the same time.The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret cage to the gearbox <b>driving</b> the front <b>sprockets.</b> Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of 37 ft. The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system {{in the form of an}} electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.|$|R
