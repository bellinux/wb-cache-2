5|$|The M2 Light Tank {{led to the}} US M3-series and M5-series light tanks. The Ordnance Department {{viewed the}} M2A4 as a stopgap tank; work to improve it further began in June 1940. The first M3 Stuart tanks began to be {{produced}} in March 1941; the original riveted M3s closely resembled the M2A4, and the two types occasionally served in the same units; the easiest recognition feature is the rear <b>idler</b> <b>wheel.</b> On the M2A4, the idler is raised; on the M3 it trails on the ground, increasing the flotation of the heavier vehicle. The M3 retained the same Continental W-670 engine, but incorporated ½-inch thicker (1½ inch total thickness) armor; weight increased to 14 tons. The tank initially kept the same 37mm gun and the forward firing hull machine guns, but the turret incorporated improvements. Eventually over 4,500 examples of all variants were produced.|$|E

25|$|For {{her third}} album, Extraordinary Machine (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion, and began {{recording}} the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly {{unhappy with the}} production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to erroneously protest Epic Records, believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005 to critical acclaim. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, The <b>Idler</b> <b>Wheel...,</b> which also received critical praise and was followed by an extensive tour of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{armament}} was a Type 91 6.5×50mm machine gun, {{although in}} later models carried a Type 92 7.7 mm machine gun. The suspension consisted of four bogies - two on each side. These were suspended by bell-cranks resisted by armored compression springs placed horizontally, one {{each side of}} the hull, externally. Each bogie had two small rubber road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the idler at the rear. There were two track-return rollers. In combat service the Type 94 was found to be prone to throwing its tracks in high speed turns. Further redesign work was carried out in 1937 on the suspension and the small idler was replaced by a larger diameter <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> suspended from a rocker arm which was now in ground contact; it did not completely solve the problem. A better suspension on a longer chassis appeared in later models of the Type 94.|$|E
500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted drive sprockets. The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front <b>idler</b> <b>wheel,</b> and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1945, the now-Major Verdeja {{was ordered}} to begin {{designing}} an artillery piece using a rapid-firing 75millimeter L/40 howitzer designed by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval, based on the Verdeja1 chassis. [...] The chassis' roof and rear wall were eliminated, and instead a gun shield placed over the front. A mechanical brake was installed next to the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel,</b> stopping rearwards movement of the artillery piece during the firing process. [...] The availability of the required parts {{and the lack of}} complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively. The fate of the self-propelled piece was much {{the same as that of}} the Verdeja2, and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973, when it was moved to the Spanish base Alfonso XIII, housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment Wad Rassnº55. It was soon moved to another base, and finally delivered to the base of El Goloso, outside of Madrid, as a part of an armored vehicles museum.|$|E
500|$|The next version, the Ausf.H, began {{production}} in June 1943 {{and received the}} designation Sd.Kfz.161/2. The integrity of the glacis armor was improved by manufacturing it as a single [...] plate. A reinforced final drive with higher gear ratios was introduced. To prevent adhesion of magnetic anti-tank mines, which the Germans feared would be used in large numbers by the Allies, Zimmerit paste was added to all the vertical surfaces of the tank's armor. The turret roof was reinforced from [...] to [...] and [...] segments. The vehicle's side and turret were further protected {{by the addition of}} [...] hull skirts and [...] turret skirts. This resulted in the elimination of the vision ports located on the hull side, as the skirts obstructed their view. During the Ausf.H's production run, its rubber-tired return rollers were replaced with cast steel, a lighter cast front sprocket and rear <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> gradually replaced the previous components, the hull was fitted with triangular supports for the easily damaged side skirts, the Nebelwurfgeraet was discontinued, and a mount in the turret roof, designed for the Nahverteidigungswaffe, was plugged by a circular armored plate due to initial production shortages of this weapon.|$|E

30|$|Three-year-old Cizhu bamboo (Neosinocalamus affinis) was {{obtained}} from Yibin, Sichuan Province, China. The bamboo culm (about 900  mm longitudinally and about 42  ×  4.2  mm in cross section) were selected {{from the middle of}} the trunk. The bamboo material had an initial moisture content (MC) of about 65  %. For material preparation, bamboo tubes were first split into four pieces of approximately the same size. The bamboo nodes were removed using a hatchet. An untwisting machine was used to broom and roll the bamboo strips into a loosely laminated sheet. The untwisting machine was made up of drive unit, <b>idler</b> <b>wheels,</b> and an adjustment device (to regulate the pressure between the <b>idler</b> <b>wheels).</b> By adjusting the distance of the upper and lower pressure rollers, the teeth could realize different brooming and decongesting effects during the bamboo feeding process. The laminated sheet was cross-linked in the width direction with no fracture along the length direction and was nearly uniform in thickness, maintaining the original bamboo fiber arrangement. The laminated sheets were finally cut into pieces 300  mm in length and air-dried to a MC between 8 and 12  %.|$|R

Production started in December 1943 at Büssing-NAG. Early examples used a truck-like, unarmored cabin similar to the earlier half-tracks it replaced, while later examples featured an armored cabin and engine compartment that looked similar to the Sd.Kfz. 251 armored personnel carrier. Like the earlier Demag-designed Sd.Kfz. 10, the sWS's suspension system consisted of five double roadwheels per side, overlapping and interleaved in the [...] layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars.

Cooling air was designed to draw air in through the commander's and driver's hatches. This had the advantage of rapidly dispersing gun combustion gases when firing, but several disadvantages. The constant draft generated by the engine greatly affected the crew during cold weather, an engine fire would force the crew to evacuate and the engine noise and heat increased crew fatigue. It had a top speed on the road of [...] and a range between [...] The semi-automatic Praga-Wilson transmission had five forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the forward-mounted drive sprocket.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the kinetic {{characteristic}} of a new continuously-variable-transmission (CVT), a three-dimensional model of the CVT was first established by Pro/E solid design and it was saved as Parasolid file format. Then, a kinematics simulation model of drive system of the CVT was established by importing the Parasolid file into ADAMS and the simulation was realized by replacing the traction drive of elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) oil film with the contact constraint joints between the input and output wheel discs and the intermediate <b>idler</b> <b>wheels.</b> The simulation results demonstrate that the three-dimensional simulation model of the CVT is accurate, and the equivalent drive system of the CVT is reasonable...|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} design change to tracked loaders {{came with the}} {{integration}} of hydraulic systems. Using hydraulics to power the loader linkages increased {{the power of the}} loader. More importantly, the loaders could apply downpressure to the bucket, vastly increasing their ability to dig unworked ground. Most of the tracked loaders were still based on a bulldozer equivalent. The weight of the engine was still on the front half of the tracks along with the heavy loader components. This caused many problems with heavy wear of the front <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> and the undercarriage in general. The Caterpillar 983 tracked loader, the second largest tracked loader ever built, was notorious for heavy undercarriage wear.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, {{the size}} of an <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> in a non-geared {{friction}} drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel,</b> and then from the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> to the output shaft. A larger or smaller <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by <b>idler</b> <b>wheels,</b> so the tape heads, instead of {{moving across the}} tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiences}} gained {{with the}} two prototypes {{were used for the}} main production T-35 Model 1935, which was again improved from the second prototype, with a longer chassis, improved hull and 45-mm guns in place of the 37s. It started production in 1935, and about 35 were built by 1938. In general, throughout its production run small improvements were made to the individual tanks. Production tanks had turrets similar to the ones on the BT-5, but without the rear overhang. Some examples had flamethrowers instead of one of the 45 mm guns. The final batch was a run of six T-35 Model 1938s, which had new turrets with sloped armour all around, as well as modified side skirts and new <b>idler</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The M1917 was a US tank {{accepted}} by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French Renault FT.
