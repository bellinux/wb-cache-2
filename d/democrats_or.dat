5|$|Orkney is {{represented}} in the House of Commons {{as part of the}} Orkney and Shetland constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP), the current incumbent being Alistair Carmichael. This seat has been held by the Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> their predecessors the Liberal Party since 1950, longer than any other they represent in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Initially, President Grinius {{refused to}} resign, {{but he was}} {{eventually}} persuaded that Polish invasion was imminent and that Smetona had sworn to uphold the constitution. On 19 December 42 delegates of the Seimas met (without the Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> the Peasant Popular Union) and elected Aleksandras Stulginskis as the new Speaker of the Seimas. Stulginskis was the formal head of state {{for a few hours}} before Smetona was elected as the President (38 deputies voted for, two against, and two abstained). The Seimas also passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet formed by Voldemaras. Constitutional formalities were observed thereby. The Lithuanian National Union secured other major roles: Antanas Merkys assumed office as Minister of Defense and Ignas Musteikis as Minister of the Interior.|$|E

25|$|The Australian Government did {{not hold}} a {{majority}} in the Senate, and thus required the support of the opposition Labor party, the Greens, <b>Democrats,</b> <b>or</b> independent senators in order to secure ratification. The Government put heavy pressure on Labor Party leader Mark Latham to secure Opposition support of the agreement (knowing that Latham, among many Labor members, viewed the FTA as beneficial). The issue had divided the party, with the Left faction in particular arguing that Labor should reject the agreement.|$|E
25|$|According to a Pew Research poll, the Democratic Party {{has become}} more {{socially}} liberal and secular compared to how it was in 1987. Based on a poll conducted in 2014, Gallup found that 30% of Americans identified as Democrats, 23% as Republicans, and 45% as Independents. In the same poll, a survey of registered voters stated that 47% identified as <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> leaned towards the party; the same poll found that 40% of registered voters identified as Republicans or leaned towards the Republican party.|$|E
25|$|The Republicans {{absorbed the}} {{previous}} traditions of its members, {{most of whom}} had been Whigs, while others had been <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> members of third parties (especially the Free Soil Party and the American Party, also known as the Know Nothings). Many Democrats who joined were rewarded with governorships, or seats in the U.S. Senate, or House of Representatives. Since its inception, its chief opposition has been the Democratic Party, but the amount of flow back and forth of prominent politicians between the two parties was quite high from 1854 to 1896.|$|E

25|$|Chalmers {{wrote to}} Republican President Chester A. Arthur in December 1882 {{about how to}} defeat the regular Democrats in Mississippi. Independents like him {{sometimes}} affiliated with Greenbackers, other men who had left the regular party, and even Republicans in a fusionist ticket. In this period, Senator William Mahone of Virginia had gathered various factions into {{what was called the}} Readjuster Party, which was prominent in Virginia politics. Chalmers proposed the same for Mississippi. Neither he nor Mahone were successful in breaking up Mississippi <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> the Solid South.|$|E
25|$|Their most {{influential}} leader, László Rajk, who was minister {{of foreign affairs}} at the time, was arrested in May 1949. He was accused of rather surreal crimes, such as spying for Western imperialist powers and for Yugoslavia (which was also a Communist country, but in very bad relations with the Soviet Union at the time). At his trial in September 1949, he made a forced confession to be an agent of Miklós Horthy, Leon Trotsky, Josip Broz Tito and Western imperialism. He also {{admitted that he had}} taken part in a murder plot against Mátyás Rákosi and Ernő Gerő. Rajk was found guilty and executed. In the next three years, other leaders of the party deemed untrustworthy, such as former Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> other Hungarian illegal Communists such as János Kádár, were also arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party {{lost its}} {{influence}} in the early 20th century due {{to the growth of}} the Labour Party. In Russia, liberalism was defeated when the Communists came to power under Vladimir Lenin in October 1917, in Italy when Mussolini set up his dictatorship in 1922, in Poland in 1926 under Józef Piłsudski, and in Spain in 1939 after the Spanish Civil War. Before World War I, liberal parties dominated the European political scene, but they were gradually displaced by socialists and social democrats in the early 20th century. The fortunes of liberal parties since World War II have been mixed, with some gaining strength while others suffered from continuous declines. The fall of the Soviet Union and the breakup of Yugoslavia {{at the end of the}} 20th century, however, allowed the formation of many liberal parties throughout Eastern Europe. These parties developed varying ideological characters. Some, such as the Slovenian Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> the Lithuanian Social Liberals, have been characterised as centre-left. Others, such as the Romanian National Liberal Party, have been classified as centre-right.|$|E

500|$|Factionalism {{between the}} pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, {{especially}} within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Hards" [...] of New York were deeply {{skeptical of the}} Pierce administration, which was associated with Marcy (who became Secretary of State) and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Softs".|$|E
500|$|The {{members of}} the city council are each elected from single member districts within the city. The mayor and city {{attorney}} are elected directly by the voters of the entire city. The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year terms, with a two-term limit. Elections are held on a non-partisan basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify themselves as either <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city, and Democrats currently (...) hold a 5–4 majority in the city council. The current mayor, Kevin Faulconer, is a Republican.|$|E
500|$|As media {{scrutiny}} on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These {{began in}} North Africa when some reporters {{worried that he}} was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies. His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke. Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at Knutsford England and said, in part, [...] "since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do." [...] The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians. On a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them [...] "the real heroes" [...] of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers {{who had been killed}} in action. His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said [...] "enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> Republicans and that would take some time." [...] This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.|$|E

5000|$|In 1870, Harper {{was elected}} to the 42nd United States Congress as a <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Conservative," [...] as some North Carolina Democrats were calling {{themselves}} at the time. He did not run for re-election in 1872.|$|R
50|$|Mullins, a {{real estate}} manager by profession, was chosen by then-Governor John G. Rowland to {{challenge}} Wyman {{the week of the}} state Republican Convention. He is the only African-American nominee for state comptroller, <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> Republican, in Connecticut history.|$|R
500|$|Like his Republican predecessors, Arthur {{struggled}} {{with the question of}} how his party was to challenge the Democrats in the South and how, if at all, to protect the civil rights of black southerners. [...] Since the end of Reconstruction, conservative white <b>Democrats</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "Bourbon Democrats") had regained power in the South, and the Republican party dwindled rapidly as their primary supporters in the region, blacks, were disenfranchised. [...] One crack in the solidly Democratic South emerged with the growth of a new party, the Readjusters, in Virginia. [...] Having won an election in that state on a platform of more education funding (for black and white schools alike) and abolition of the poll tax and the whipping post, many northern Republicans saw the Readjusters as a more viable ally in the South than the moribund southern Republican party. [...] Arthur agreed, and directed the federal patronage in Virginia through the Readjusters rather than the Republicans. [...] He followed the same pattern in other Southern states, forging coalitions with independents and Greenback Party members. [...] Some black Republicans felt betrayed by the pragmatic gambit, but others (including Frederick Douglass and ex-Senator Blanche K. Bruce) endorsed the administration's actions, as the Southern independents had more liberal racial policies than the Democrats. [...] Arthur's coalition policy was only successful in Virginia, however, and by 1885 the Readjuster movement began to collapse with the election of a Democratic president.|$|E
2500|$|Bruner has equated being a Democrat or {{a liberal}} {{with being a}} mass-murderer, writing, [...] "all of the {{terrorist}} mass-murderers have described themselves as <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> liberals. Is there a pattern developing here?" ...|$|E
2500|$|All of Pierce's cabinet {{nominations}} {{were confirmed}} unanimously and immediately by the Senate. Pierce {{spent the first}} few weeks of his term sorting through hundreds of lower-level federal positions to be filled. This was a chore, as he sought to represent all factions of the party, and could fully satisfy none of them. Partisans found themselves unable to secure positions for their friends, which put the Democratic Party on edge and fueled bitterness between factions. Before long, northern newspapers accused Pierce of filling his government with pro-slavery secessionists, while southern newspapers accused him of abolitionism. Factionalism between the pro- and anti-administration Democrats ramped up quickly, especially within the New York Democratic Party. The more conservative Hardshell <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Hards" [...] of New York were deeply skeptical of the Pierce administration, which was associated with Secretary of State Marcy and the more moderate New York faction, the Softshell <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> [...] "Softs".|$|E

2500|$|Opposition {{views of}} the Peace <b>Democrats</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "Copperheads") filled the columns of The Chicago Times, the {{mouthpiece}} of the rival Democratic Party. It was the nation's loudest and most persistent critic of Lincoln and emancipation. At one point early in the Gettysburg Campaign in June 1863, Union troops forcibly closed the newspaper at bayonet point. It was only reopened when Democratic mobs threatened to destroy the rival Republican paper and President Lincoln intervened.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the 2015 {{elections}} all the councillors, since 1983, for Friary & St Nicolas {{had been}} Liberal <b>Democrats</b> (<b>or</b> their predecessors).

[...] In 2003 the Liberal Democrat majority had been 1014, in 2007 it was 553, and in 2011 it fell to 241. [...] In 2015, the Conservatives took one of the three Liberal Democrats seats on Friary & St Nicolas ward.|$|E
2500|$|Centrist <b>Democrats,</b> <b>or</b> New Democrats, are an ideologically centrist faction {{within the}} Democratic Party that emerged after {{the victory of}} Republican George H. W.
