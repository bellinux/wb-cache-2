Though the child's mind is difficult to understand, they obtain a third location.

The killer attempts to escape, and Olivia stabs him to death with his own knife during the struggle.|$|E
25|$|Field goal : Scored by a {{drop kick}} or place kick (except on a kickoff) when the ball, after being kicked and without again {{touching}} the ground, {{goes over the}} cross bar and between the goal posts (or between lines extended {{from the top of}} the goal posts) of the opponent's goal, worth three points. If the ball hits the upright above the cross-bar before <b>going</b> <b>through,</b> <b>it</b> is not considered a dead ball, and the points are scored. (Rule 5, Sect 4, Art 4(d)) If the field goal is missed, but the ball is not returnable after crossing the dead-ball-line, then it constitutes a rouge (see below).|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street did {{not address}} the subject of divorce until November 2012, when its {{producers}} created, as part of their resiliency initiative, Little Children, Big Challenges: Divorce. It was made available to military families and to the general public through family courts, counseling services, and parenting and child care programs. It included a 22-minute DVD, a caregiver guide, a storybook, a tip sheet for extended families and friends, mobile apps and social networking sites, and an online toolkit. Like in [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce", the Little Children, Big Challenges production also used a Muppet, Abby Cadabby, to represent the child experiencing divorce. Whereas Snuffy was shown <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> in real time, Abby's parents' divorce was in the past, which gave her time to adjust.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was {{planning}} to extend PA 145 and US 222. Traffic engineer Samuel D. Darrohh said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> After the plan was introduced, he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 is extended along Hamilton Boulevard {{to connect with the}} proposed PA 145 corridor. PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension, stating that the route [...] "is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system, and therefore, does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO's 'Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways'". In addition, the route did not meet the criteria for a business route. In 1991, it was commissioned as PA 222. PA 145 was extended south of the US 22 freeway to the I-78/PA 309 overlap near Lanark.|$|E
500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{receives}} the mail {{of her new}} neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm). After <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> she believes he is the perfect man for her. To try and woo him, she follows the actions of an evil Spanish soap character called [...] "The Generalissimo" [...] from Los Amantes Clandestinos, despite the warnings of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Elisa (Salma Hayek). She invites Drew to a nonexistent party, and, when he arrives expecting a party, she informs him that the party is scheduled for the following evening, but nevertheless invites him in. While this plan initially appears to work, things go wrong when Liz accidentally gives Drew Rohypnol and he finds some of his opened mail in her handbag. The next day Drew receives some of Liz's mail and reads it. He says that based on her mail {{he probably would have}} wanted to meet Liz, in the same vein as she had wanted to meet him. They decide to start with a clean slate and go on a real date.|$|E

2500|$|By 1972, Samael Aun Weor {{referenced}} {{that his}} death and resurrection would be occurring before 1978. In the chapter entitled The Resurrection in his work The Three Mountains (1972), he stated that the eight years of ordeals within the Trial of Job would occur between his 53rd and 61st birthdays. Furthermore, in the same work, it is stated that this ordeal occurs prior to resurrection, and the one <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> is [...] "deprived of everything, even of his own sons, and is afflicted by an impure sickness." [...] By August 1977 he had developed stomach cancer. During this time he continued to speak to both his students and the general public, giving radio and television interviews while touring Mexico. Eventually {{he was forced to}} stop, due to debilitating stomach pain. As his condition steadily worsened he would mention to those at his bedside, [...] "Don't cling to my battered body, instead cling to my doctrinal body." [...] Samael Aun Weor died on December 24, 1977. He was survived by his wife and children.|$|E
2500|$|John Foster wrote {{a review}} for the April 1811 Eclectic Review which said, [...] "We must repeat then, {{in the first}} place, our censure of the {{adoption}} or creation of so absurd a fable" [...] and [...] "The next chief point of censure would be, that this absurdity is also paganism; but this has been noticed so pointedly and repeatedly in our analysis, that a very few words here will suffice." [...] In an analysis of other aspects, Foster argued, [...] "The general diction {{of the work is}} admirably strong, and various, and free; and, in <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it,</b> we have repeatedly exulted in the capabilities of the English language. The author seems to have in a great measure grown out of that affected simplicity of expression, of which he has generally been accused. The versification, as to measure and rhyme, is a complete defiance of all rule, and all example... This is objectionable, chiefly, as it allows the poet to riot away in a wild wantonness of amplification". An anonymous review in the June 1811 Literary Panorama stated, [...] "If we were desired to name a poet whose command of language enables him to express in the most suitable and energetic terms the images which agitate his mind, we should name Mr. Southey; if we were requested to point out a poem which to freedom of manner in the construction of its stanzas, united a condensation of phrase, with a happy collocation of words, thereby producing force, we should recommend Kehama".|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} [...] "Catherine of Aragon" [...] was {{originally}} {{a piece that}} Wakeman wrote for Fragile with a working title of [...] "Handle With Care". Its title came about as staff at Trident Studios recommended the tape's storage box be labelled something misleading to {{lower the risk of}} theft and the tapes being sold as bootlegs. The box that had the song's tape in had a label that read [...] "Handle with care for the Joe Loss Orchestra", which Wakeman took and adapted for the track's title. [...] "I thought, 'No one is going to nick that!', and they didn't". Recorded at Trident Studios in London, the track features Yes's guitarist Steve Howe and bassist Chris Squire with percussionist Ray Cooper. By the time production began on [...] "Catherine Howard", engineer Ken Scott was replaced by Paul Tregurtha. Strawbs member Chas Cronk, who plays the bass guitar on the track, recalled the [...] "total confusion" [...] during the recording and [...] "couldn't make head or tail of what [...] were doing. We were <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> part by part and I couldn't see how all the parts were going to match up." [...] He noted that Rick [...] "knew exactly {{what he was going to}} do although he had nothing written down. It was all stored in his head." [...] Wakeman describes [...] "Anne of Cleves" [...] as a [...] "rather free-form" [...] track, [...] "almost having no form at all, there was a contradiction in what everyone was playing. The guys in the band thought I was completely barking, but it had to be like that." ...|$|E
