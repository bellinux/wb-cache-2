5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This {{is a type of}} symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of binary search {{can be analyzed}} by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree, where the root node is the middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> array. The middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search; starting from the root node, {{the left or right}} subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration, representing the successive elimination of elements.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring and an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal {{the structure of the}} ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

5|$|Analogously, the {{alternating}} {{group is a}} subgroup of index 2 in the symmetric group on n letters. The elements of the {{alternating group}}, called even permutations, are the products of even numbers of transpositions. The identity map, an empty product of no transpositions, is an even permutation since zero is even; it is the identity <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{persuaded the}} Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to allow bases for U.S. ground troops and war {{planes in the}} nation. This was an {{important}} <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> success of the Gulf War, {{as well as a}} lightning-rod for Islamists, such as Osama bin Laden, who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture was lacking a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game.

30|$|The {{experiment}} utilized a 2 (teacher {{gesture to}} graphs: yes or no)[*]×[*] 2 (teacher gesture to equations: yes or no) design which yielded four lesson conditions: no gesture, gesture to equations only, gesture to graphs only, or gesture to both equations and graphs. In all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions, the teacher gazed to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual representations when she mentioned them; her gaze was scripted {{and did not}} vary across conditions. In the no-gesture condition, the teacher did not produce any hand gestures to the visual representations; however, she did gaze to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs and equations when she spoke about them. In the gesture-to-graphs-only condition, the teacher pointed (and gazed) to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs when she mentioned them during the lesson, {{but she did not}} point to the equations. Thus, she pointed and gazed to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs, but only gazed to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations. In the gesture-to-equations-only condition, the teacher gestured to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations when she mentioned them during the lesson, but did not point to the graphs. Thus, she pointed and gazed to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equations, but only gazed to <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graphs.

5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes.

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely {{and replace it with a}} newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard. On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to surrender to the New Zealanders at all.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Apogee, Jackson {{entered into}} {{a joint venture with}} Clair Brothers to design a digital {{loudspeaker}} controller for control of complex concert sound systems. Jackson estimated that the project would cost $800,000 in U.S. dollars, but it ended up costing Clair Brothers more than $2M. From the same garage in which he started Apogee, Jackson developed the proprietary Clair iO: a two-input, six-output digital audio matrix with opto-isolated output circuits. An essential <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system was its ability to be controlled by wireless tablet computer by an audio engineer walking around to various seating sections in a concert venue, to tailor the system's response more precisely.|$|E
