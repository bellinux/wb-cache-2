His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was given}} {{yesterday}} {{at a club}} your volume [...] "Boon, etc.," [...] from a loose leaf in which I learn that you kindly sent it me and which yet appears to have lurked there for a considerable time undelivered. I have just been reading, to acknowledge it intelligently, {{a considerable number of}} its pages--though not all; for, to be perfectly frank, I have been in that respect beaten for the first time--or rather for the first time but one--by a book of yours; I haven't found the current of it draw me on and on this time--as, unfailingly and irresistibly, before (which I have repeatedly let you know.) However, I shall try again--I hate to lose any scrap of you that may make for light or pleasure; and meanwhile I have more or less mastered your appreciation of H. J., which I have found very curious and interesting after a fashion--though it has naturally not filled me with a fond elation. It is difficult of course for a writer to put himself fully in the place of another writer who finds him extraordinarily futile and void, and who is moved to publish that to the world--and I think the case isn't easier when he happens to have enjoyed the other writer enormously from far back; because there has then grown up the habit of taking some common meeting-ground between them for granted, and the falling away of this is like the collapse of a bridge which made communication possible. But I am by nature more in dread of any fool's paradise, or at least of any bad misguidedness, than in love {{with the idea of a}} security proved, and the fact that a mind as brilliant as yours can resolve me into such an unmitigated mistake, can't enjoy me in anything like the degree in which <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> may be enjoyed, makes me greatly want to fix myself, for as long as my nerves will stand it, with such a pair of eyes. I am aware of certain things I have, and not less conscious, I believe, of various others that I am simply reduced to wish I did or could have; so I try, for possible light, to enter into the feelings of a critic for whom the deficiencies so preponderate. The difficulty about that effort, however, is that one can't keep it up--one has to fall back on one's sense of one's good parts--one's own sense; and I at least should have to do that, I think, even if your picture were painted with a more searching brush. For I should otherwise seem to forget what it is that my poetic and my appeal to experience rest upon. They rest upon my measure of fulness--fulness of life and of the projection of it, which seems to you such an emptiness of both. I don't mean to say I don't wish I could do twenty things I can't--many of which you do so livingly; but I confess I ask myself what would become in that case of some of those to which I am most addicted and by which interest seems to me most beautifully producible. I hold that interest may be, must be, exquisitely made and created, and that if we don't make it, we who undertake to, nobody and nothing will make it for us; though nothing is more possible, nothing may even be more certain, than that my quest of it, my constant wish to run it to earth, may entail the sacrifice of certain things that are not on the straight line of it. However, there are too many things to say, and I don't think your chapter is really inquiring enough to entitle you to expect all of them. The fine thing about the fictional form to me is that it opens such widely different windows of attention; but that is just why I like the window so to frame the play and the process! ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2010 Ray Davies {{stated the}} song was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Liverpool Sunset". In {{an interview with the}} Liverpool Echo, he explained: [...] "Liverpool is my favourite city, and {{the song was}} originally called Liverpool Sunset. I was inspired by Merseybeat. Id fallen in love with Liverpool by that point. On every tour, that was the best reception. We played The Cavern, all those old places, and I couldnt get enough of it. I had a load of mates in bands up there, and that sound - not The Beatles but Merseybeat - that was unbelievable. It used to inspire me every time. So I wrote Liverpool Sunset. Later it got changed to Waterloo Sunset, but theres still that play on words with Waterloo.

He was an intellectual and came from a well-known family of painters and he preferred to live like an aristocrat.” However, this should be read in conjunction with that of the artist, John Nash, who had known him since 1913: 'Robert Bevan was a significant figure to us both and was, therefore, a bond between us. This was Bobby’s “cosy side” - he could be moody and at times rather formidable but beneath this one sensed always his intense loyalty to his real friends mixed with an affection that his undemonstrative nature hardly allowed him to disclose. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> partook of these latter qualities. He was a very private person, talking little about his personal deeds even less about his personal thoughts and worries.

40|$|ABSTRACT—How is {{information}} about people conveyed through their preferences for {{certain kinds of}} music? Here we show that individuals use their music preferences to communicate information about their personalities to ob-servers, and that observers can use such information to form impressions of others. Study 1 revealed that music {{was the most common}} topic in conversations among strangers given the task of getting acquainted. Why was talk about music so prevalent? Study 2 showed that (a) observers were able to form consensual and accurate im-pressions on the basis of targets ’ music preferences, (b) music preferences were related to targets ’ personalities, (c) the specific cues that observers used tended to be the ones that were valid, and (d) music preferences reveal information that is different from that obtained in other zero-acquaintance contexts. Discussion focuses on the mechanisms that may underlie the links between person-ality and music preferences. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> present an innocuous, well-socialized face to the world—nothing for anyone to worry about. But if you know that I like [alternative music] then you know a little something else about me. You’ve gotten a new data point. If you have all of my songs, the points coalesce to form a picture, an intimate one that doesn’t quite match the public persona. (Schwarz, 2004, p. 6) What is the process by which unacquainted strangers become acquaintances, and possibly friends? Without doubt, getting acquainted is a long and multifaceted process, but at the broadest level it comes down to transferring information. Getting to know people better means getting to know more about them. Past research has pointed to many cues that individuals can use to piece together a picture of what someone else is like. Studies have shown, for example, that observers can glean in-formation from such cues as physical appearance (Kenny...|$|E
