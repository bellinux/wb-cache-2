500|$|In February 1992, Al Rendon {{was hired}} by EMI Latin to take {{photographs}} for Entre a Mi Mundo. A previous photographer had taken some photos of the singer, which were not well received by the company, and Rendon was asked to do a [...] "quick session". Rendon rented a studio and hired John MacBurney—whom Abraham constany argued with—to do the makeup. MacBurney [...] "privately complained" [...] to EMI Latin that Abraham was difficult to deal with. Rendon and MacBurney, however, found Selena [...] "real easy to work with". Selena picked out the outfit for herself to wear in the cover picture; this outfit included a black top with a mesh see-through midriff, a long-sleeve black jacket with black-and-white striped long sleeves, a wide black leather belt, and tight black pants. She chose a pose where she runs <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> her hair, a pose that Abraham was noticeably bothered with. In 1998, the outfit that she wore for the album cover was added to a museum that her family operates in Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Call the Shots" [...] {{was directed by}} Sean de Sparengo, and filmed in October 2007 in Malibu, California, while Girls Aloud were filming The Passions of Girls Aloud.

The girls are also shown in different locations with individual story lines. Cole is simply seen looking out of a sunny window. Walsh is {{sat in front of}} a mirror, putting on make-up; her fictional boyfriend comes to get her and they hug, though she appears to be sad. Coyle is seated on a couch, flipping through photographs featuring her and a man. She takes a lighter to the photos and sets them alight. Roberts is lying down by a swimming pool, running <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the water. A young man walks up to her with a bouquet of flowers and tosses them into the water. Harding watches her boyfriend in the shower and goes through his phone. The video premiered on 17 October 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In his summing up, the coroner, H.R. Oswald, {{stated that}} Kempton {{was in a}} {{depressed}} state and short of money, [...] "Her life was precarious, and {{she was one of}} those who tried to turn night into day". He doubted the evidence of Chang which contradicted that of Heinberg but thought there was insufficient evidence to bring a charge of manslaughter against Chang. After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, at which, according to the News of the World, [...] "Chang smiled broadly and quickly left the court. As he passed out, several well-dressed girls patted his shoulder, while one ran <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> his hair".|$|E

60|$|In Sibyl's {{own room}} they parted. There was jealousy in the lad's heart, and a fierce, murderous {{hatred of the}} {{stranger}} who, as it seemed to him, had come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> strayed <b>through</b> his hair, he softened, and kissed her with real affection.

6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't {{know what}} to say," [...] replied Mrs Brand, {{with a look of}} deep anxiety, as she passed <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> her son's hair, and kissed his brow.

60|$|He stooped {{down toward}} her. She linked <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> {{together}} <b>through</b> his left arm, and, leaning a little heavily upon him, began the ascent. He {{was conscious of}} some subtle fragrance from her clothes, a perfume strangely different from the odor of the ghostlike flowers that bordered the steep path up which they were climbing.

60|$|Cecilia {{sat down}} on the bed and waited, drawing <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the girl's hair, which had fallen loose; and while she sat there she {{experienced}} all that sore, strange feeling--as of being skinned--which comes to one who watches the emotion of someone near and dear without knowing the exact cause.|$|E
60|$|Betty {{looked down}} with tear-blurred {{eyes on the}} haggard face. Unconsciously she had been running <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>through</b> the fair hair that lay so damp over his brow.

6000|$|There {{was a wild}} {{light in}} her eye, and her {{straight}} hair was out demonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its own. <b>Her</b> <b>fingers</b> were bursting <b>through</b> <b>her</b> gloves, as if to get at once into touch with Ann Veronica. [...] "You're Glorious!" [...] said Miss Miniver in tones of rapture, holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann Veronica's face. [...] "Glorious!

5000|$|Meanwhile, Bree becomes {{excited when}} Susan and Julie {{move in and}} {{attempts}} to make Danielle feel the same. Danielle is concerned since Andrew left and that Bree is acting weird.

Danielle then writes a letter to Bree informing her that she has run away with Matthew and is unlikely to return. Bree then checks herself into a mental institution because she feels {{on the verge of a}} nervous breakdown.|$|R
60|$|Barker was astounded, dismayed, even terror-stricken. Mrs. Horncastle crying! Mrs. Horncastle, the imperious, the collected, the coldly critical, the cynical, smiling {{woman of}} the world, {{actually}} crying! Other women might cry--Kitty had cried often--but Mrs. Horncastle! Yet, there she was, sobbing; actually sobbing like a schoolgirl, her beautiful shoulders rising and falling with her grief; crying unmistakably <b>through</b> <b>her</b> long white <b>fingers,</b> <b>through</b> a lace pocket-handkerchief which she had hurriedly produced and shaken from behind her like a conjurer's trick; her beautiful eyes a thousand times more lustrous for the sparkling beads that brimmed her lashes and welled over like the pool before her.|$|R
