50|$|The {{standing}} <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> theory, {{which was}} introduced by Guza and Inman (1975), suggests that swash is superimposed upon the motion of standing edge waves that travel alongshore. This produces a variation in swash height along the shore and consequently results in regular patterns of erosion. The cusp embayments form at the eroding points and cusp horns occur at the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> nodes. The beach cusp spacing can be predicted using the sub-harmonic <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> modelwhere T is incident wave period and tanβ is beach gradient.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem with}} the {{standing}} <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> theory {{is that it would}} only account for the initial formation of the cusp and not their continued growth afterwards because as the cusp increases in size the amplitude of the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> decreases {{to the point where it}} is no longer a factor.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of ®exural waves con ned {{to the free}} edge of a ®uid-loaded plate is established theoretically. Whereas analogous in vacuo <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> exist for all parameter values, submerged plates are shown herein to support such waves only under very light ®uid-loading conditions. For example, thin plates of aluminium, brass or Plexiglas will not support <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> in water, although <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> are permissible {{for each of these}} materials in air. The analysis is based on classical thin-plate theory and employs the Wiener{Hopf technique to derive the dispersion relation for the edge-wave wavenumber as a function of frequency. In the limit of zero ®uid loading the dispersion relation predicts the well-known result of Konenkov for <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> on thin plates in vacuo...|$|R

Use {{is made of}} the full three-dimensional water wave theory but only beach angles β = π/(2 N), where N is an integer, are considered. A weakly nonlinear stability analysis is used to investigate the interaction of subharmonic, synchronous and 3 / 2 -frequency <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> with the incoming wave field. It is shown that values of β exist for which an energy transfer from the incoming wave to the synchronous <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> takes place through the intermediary of the subharmonic components...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> in a thinly layered laminated medium with stress couples under initial stresses is examined. Based upon an approximate {{representation of a}} laminated medium by an equivalent anisotropic continuum with average initial and couple stresses, an explicit form of frequency equation is obtained to derive the phase velocity of <b>edge</b> <b>waves.</b> <b>Edge</b> <b>waves</b> exist under certain conditions. The inclusion of couple stresses increases the velocity of wave propagation. For a specific compression, the presence of couple stresses increases the velocity of wave propagation {{with the increase of}} wave number, whereas the reverse is the case when there is no couple stress. Numerical computation is performed with graphical representations. Several special cases are also examined...|$|R
5000|$|The {{standing}} <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> {{theory is}} based on an interaction, near the shoreline, between the waves that are approaching the shore and waves that have been set up perpendicular to the shoreline called 'edge waves'. The regular arrival of incoming waves in the near shore waters causes the development of waves perpendicular to the direction of the incoming waves; these are termed 'edge waves'. These edge waves become trapped near the shoreline and when two of them come together from opposite directions, a standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> is formed. The movement patterns of these waves are fixed and so can be defined as two regions of interest, the nodal and antinodal points.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nonlinearity}} {{on the evolution}} of free <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> is investigated by solving numerically the nonlinear shallow water equations. The numerical scheme is the two-dimensional WAF method, originally developed by Toro [Riemann Solvers and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics, Springer, 1997]. First, a simple beach geometry [J. Fluid Mech. 381 (1999) 271] is considered and the numerical results are validated against available analytical solutions for small amplitude <b>edge</b> <b>waves.</b> Then, results are obtained for <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> of larger amplitude. Nonlinear effects are found to be relevant even for moderate values of the nonlinearity parameter a which is the ratio between the wave amplitude and the water depth. In particular a resonance phenomenon has been observed which causes a modulation in time of the ultra-harmonic components of the wavefield. Larger values of a lead to a complex time evolution...|$|R
40|$|A {{sheet of}} {{graphene}} in {{a magnetic field}} perpendicular to the sheet has electronic edge states with nonzero velocities. These edge states are localized {{to the edge of}} the sheet on the order of the magnetic length. In addition, there are also vibrational edge states — mechanical waves which propagate along the edge and decay exponentially into the bulk. These <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> are analogous to the well-known surface acoustic waves in 3 D systems; the edge being a 1 D surface. This thesis considers a zigzag edge of a graphene sheet in a perpendicular magnetic field and investigates the interaction of in-plane vibrational <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> with electronic <b>edge</b> states. It is found that propagation of low-amplitude vibrational <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> is significantly blocked for certain acoustic wave vectors — those leading to resonant absorption due to electronic-acoustic interaction. For a finite gate voltage and a fixed acoustic frequency, tuning the magnetic field can bring the system through a number of such electronic resonances. Considering vibrational <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> of larger amplitude, so that nonlinear effects become important, it is further demonstrated that the coupled system of electronic and acoustic equations has a family of solutions in which the mechanical displacement is in the shape of a localized and stable profile traveling along the edge — a soliton. This type of acoustic soliton can attain velocities significantly higher than the speed of sound...|$|R
50|$|This {{theory was}} {{initially}} dismissed due to complications with it but by using more advanced computer simulations, {{it has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it now provides a reasonable alternative to the standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> theory.

50|$|The antinodal {{point is}} {{where all the}} {{movement}} takes place as the water rises and falls, creating a series of peaks and troughs. Between these antinodal points are the nodal points where no vertical movement takes place. An incoming wave has an almost uniform height but when it collides with a standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave,</b> this is changed. If it collides with a peak, then the wave height is increased and if it collides with a trough, then its height is decreased. In the diagram on the right, the two waves cancel each other out, creating a flat surface. However, this is a highly simplified version of events. The incoming wave has the same wave period as the <b>edge</b> <b>wave,</b> so the incoming wave changes from a peak to a trough {{over the same period}} as it takes the standing wave to change so they keep the same pattern. These are known as synchronous waves and are very uncommon.|$|E

The computation reasonably reproduced the distribution of surveyed tsunami height as well as the time records of surface elevation recorded at ports in Hokkaido.

50|$|The {{more common}} {{standing}} edge waves are subharmonic and these {{can have a}} wave period twice that of the incoming wave. This produces a far more complex system of waves as {{by the time the}} incoming wave has completed one cycle from peak to trough, the standing edge waves have done two. So what started as the peak of a standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> within the trough of the incoming wave will change to a trough before the incoming wave has changed so what was initially being given a boost in height now experiences a drop. Essentially {{what this means is that}} there are a regularly spaced series of peaks and troughs along the length on the incoming wave that are caused by its interaction with the standing edge waves and it is these that caused the development of beach cusps.|$|E
40|$|If {{waves are}} {{generated}} in a restricted region far away along the coast, their direction {{is easy to}} determine. For a wave gage at a longand straight coastline, the measured wave can be classified into three ategories, viz. direct plane wave from the source, short-crested wave eflected once by the shoreline, and progressive <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> repeatedly reflected and refracted along the coast. Traditionally, an <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> is measured along a long and straight coast {{with a couple of}} pressure-gage/current-meter arrays to acquire the frequency-wavenumber dispersion diagram. In the present study, flow-pressure relations for both infragravity edge and short-crested waves are used to identify the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> mode. This new approach is a useful tool if there is just one dominating <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> mode and the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> is propagating away from a known source. <b>Edge</b> <b>wave</b> tsunamis and infragravity storm waves are analyzed as two examples. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} and theoretical {{study of the}} transition from strongly reflected surging to dissipative plunging breakers on a relatively steep plane beach (1 : 8) has revealed the following: (1) The run-up and offshore variation of sea surface elevation of surging waves are well predicted by linear theory. (2) The fluctuating part of the run-up (related to the amplitude of the reflec-ted incident wave) reaches a maximum value; a further increase in incident progressive wave energy results in increased dissipation. (3) Subharmonic <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> (the growing instabilities of surging waves) are driven primarily by the swash motion, which does not increase with increasing incident breaking wave height. However, the turbulence accompanying incident wave breaking, and the effective eddy viscosity, rapidly increases with increasing breaker height. As a result, subharmonic resonances do not occur with spilling or steep plunging waves; very strong viscous effects suppress the nonlinear instabilities. (4) <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> generated by a surging incident wave can be suppressed by superimpos-ing an additional breaking wave of different frequency on the incident wave field. Thus, any excited <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> {{are likely to have}} length scales at least the order of a surf zone width...|$|R

40|$|In the Eady model, {{where the}} meridional {{potential}} vorticity (PV) gradient is zero, perturbation energy growth can be partitioned cleanly into three mechanisms: (i) shear instability, (ii) resonance, and (iii) the Orr mechanism. Shear instability involves two-way interaction between Rossby <b>edge</b> <b>waves</b> {{on the ground}} and lid, resonance occurs as interior PV anomalies excite the <b>edge</b> <b>waves,</b> and the Orr mechanism involves only interior PV anomalies. These mechanisms have distinct implications for the structural and temporal linear evolution of perturbations. Here, a new framework is developed in which the same mechanisms can be distinguished for growth on basic states with nonzero interior PV gradients. It is further shown that the evolution from quite general initial conditions can be accurately described (peak error in perturbation total energy typically less than 10...|$|R
40|$|Synchronous runup {{records were}} {{collected}} from 14 locations spaced irregularly over a 7 km stretch of a low-slope beach. The significant runup height, herein defined as the significant vertical excursion of water level at the shoreline, was typically 2 m, 60 % of the incident significant wave height at the breakpoint. The runup spectra were dominated by the energy at low frequencies, with 99. 9 % {{of the variance in}} motions with periods longer than 20 s and 83 % for periods longer than 50 s. A peak between 0. 005 and 0. 010 Hz was present in all spectra. Analysis of this band showed the motion to be a standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> with wavelength between 5 and 10 km and significant <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> height at the antinode of 1. 3 m, accounting for half of the local significant runup height. The <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> period was approximately 140 s and the mode number in the range 3 - 7. An apparently linear sand bar was present 175 m offshore, roughly the same location as the first node of cross-shore velocity for the <b>edge</b> <b>wave.</b> While the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> could not have been the cause of the bar (a standing <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> does not create a linear bar), the opposite may be true, with the bar potentially providing a topographic resonance.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{theoretically}} that surface waves incident {{on a beach}} from deep water can excite edge waves. In particular, a monochromatic wave train normally incident and reflected on a beach of constant gentle slope is found to transfer energy to edge waves through a weak resonant interaction resulting from an instability of the incident wave with respect to perturbation by edge waves. The analysis {{is based on the}} shallow water approximation and ignores the earths rotation and consequently applies only to relatively low mode, high frequency waves. Coupling coefficients. frequencies and longshore wave numbers of the excited waves are given. In accord with Hasselmann's (1967) rule, only edge waves with frequencies lower than the incident wave are excited by this mechanism. Viscous effects suggest that an <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> with mode number zero and frequency one-half that of the incident wave (a subharmonic <b>edge</b> <b>wave)</b> is preferentially excited. The minimum incident wave amplitudes for which this resonance can occur are predicted by consideration of viscous effects. Higher order terms, not studied in detail, suggest that an <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> with frequency equal that of the incident wave (a synchronous <b>edge</b> <b>wave)</b> may also be resonantly excited when the incident wave is strongly reflected. Experiments show that a very strong subharmonic <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> resonance occurs on nonerodable plane laboratory beaches when single frequency incident waves are surging and strongly reflected at the beach. Smaller synchronous edge waves occur when the basin geometry or viscous effects exclude the subharmonic. Neither type <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> is visible on the beach face when the incident wave is so large that it plunges rather than surges, incident wave energy being dissipated in the surf zone rather than reflected at the beach face as assumed in the resonance theory. This observation is quantified, and leads to a classification of beach face dynamics into reflective and dissipative systems. Large subharmonic edge waves on plane laboratory beaches are shown to rearrange sand tracers into accumulations which resemble natural beach cusps. These <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> induced morphologies, however, interfere with the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> excitation process so the <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> amplitudes decrease as the cusps grow. Small edge waves can form longshore periodic morphologies by providing destabilizing perturbations on a berm properly located in the swash zone. In this case, the retreating incident wave surge is channelized into breeches in the berm caused by the edge waves. Various theories for <b>edge</b> <b>wave</b> generation on dissipative beaches with complex incident wave fields are briefly reviewed, and differences and similarities with the reflective beach case are stressed...|$|E
