50|$|Petermann first drafted maps of Barth & Overweg’s routes for {{the journal}} of the German Geographical Society and {{followed}} these up with maps in PGM in 1855, 1857, and 1859. These were later worked into the maps for Barth’s voluminous work on his African voyage of 1850-55. The route maps were used in new maps up to 1893.When we compare the maps in Barth’s work and in PGM we may get an idea how the information was turned into images. The first map in Barth’s work gives an overview of his routes. The routes of Livingstone have already been engraved, but have not been highlighted by coloring. The 1857 issue of PGM uses the same copperplate, but with both routes highlighted and another title. Sheets 2-14 of Barth’s work are route maps on the scale 1:800,000 and 1:1,000,000. In 1855 PGM gives only a summary of the routes {{of the first half of}} the total tour, on scale of 1:2,100,000, with added profiles along the borders that do not appear on the <b>detail</b> <b>maps.</b> This was a corrected issue of a map first published in London. In the 1857 issue the map of Touareg-country is a copy, but mainly uncolored. Maps 15 and 16 of Barth’s work form a beautifully drafted and colored two-sheet map at a scale of 1:6,000,000 and measures 57 x 85 cm. It depicts the approximate territories of the indigenous tribes. The other maps in the 1857 issue show rather small details of the routes, not beautifully executed, while in the text a plan of Agades is inserted (I do not know if it exists in Barth’s work). All in all there is little overlap, also because the scales used for the different works are mostly different. But the smaller maps are clearly generalizations of the maps in Barth’s work. The images in Barth’s look sharper, but of course that is also because they are engraved on a larger scale, while all the areas outside the routes, of which nothing or not enough is known are blank.These routes, like many others, were reused in many new maps, such as Barth’s route, supplemented with the 1828 routes of René-Auguste Caillé (1799-1838) and Léopold Planet (1850).|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} "detail maps", a {{technique}} that {{is a combination of}} texture compression and texture synthesis. We decompose a given input texture into its high and low frequency components and, at runtime, recombine these components to generate a visually acceptable reconstruction of the original texture. <b>Detail</b> <b>maps</b> use less memory than the original texture, and they can be implemented in either software or graphics hardware. Our specific contributions are: the elimination of seam artifacts; showing how <b>detail</b> <b>maps</b> can be used for texture transfer and volume textures; and demonstrating how to texture very large spatial areas without visible tile repetition, loss of resolution, or large texture memory overhead. Finally, we present preliminary investigations into the quantitative determination of the textures and the corresponding input parameters that are ideal for this technique...|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} of weathered appearance {{is essential in}} the realistic modeling of urban environments. A representative and particularly difficult effect to produce {{on a large scale}} is the effect of fluid flow. Changes in appearance due to flow are the result of both the global effect of large-scale shape, and local effects, such as the detailed roughness of a surface. With digital photography and Internet image collections, visual examples of flow effects are readily available. These images, however, mix the appearance of flows with the specific local context. We present a methodology to extract parameters and <b>detail</b> <b>maps</b> from existing imagery in a form that allows new target-specific flow effects to be produced, with natural variations in the effects as they are applied in different locations in a new scene. In this article, we focus on producing a library of parameters and <b>detail</b> <b>maps</b> for generating flow patterns; and this methodology can be used to extend the library with additional image exemplars.
