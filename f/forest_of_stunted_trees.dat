60|$|Then {{there came}} a respite from the steep climb, and the way led in a winding course through a matted, storm-wrenched <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees.</b> Even up to this {{elevation}} the desert reached with its gaunt hand. The clouds overspreading the sky, hiding the sun, made a welcome change. The pack-train rested, and Stewart and Madeline waited for the party to come up. Here he briefly explained to her that Don Carlos and his bandits had left the ranch {{some time in the}} night. Thunder rumbled in the distance, and a faint wind rustled the scant foliage of the cedars. The air grew oppressive; the horses panted.|$|E

50|$|Single trunk trees {{can also}} pose {{measurement}} problems. Consider trees with very large girths, such {{as some of}} the sequoias growing the western United States. If they are growing on even a gentle slope, if girth is measured at 4.5 feet above where the pith of the tree emerges from the ground, the upside of the tape could easily be below ground level. In this case a better option would be to measure the standard girth measurement at 4.5 feet above ground level on the high side of the tree and note this in the measurement description. If measuring a mountaintop <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> only six feet tall, a girth measurement made at 4.5 feet would be meaningless. In the case of these stunted trees a girth taken at 1 foot above the base might be more appropriate. Girth measurements should be taken at the standard heights whenever possible. Where this measurement is not meaningful, an additional girth measurement should be taken at a more appropriate position and that height noted.|$|E

50|$|Plant {{life in the}} {{dry climate}} of the lower Sonoran zone {{contains}} a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree {{is found in the}} Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by <b>forests</b> <b>of</b> small shrubs, <b>stunted</b> <b>trees,</b> and herbaceous plants. Nemophila, mint, Phacelia, Viola, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica) - the state flower - also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here {{than anywhere else in the}} world.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{distinct}} vegetation types within the municipality. There is tropical forest vegetation {{in the lower}} parts from the villages of Nkong, Bangang through Besali to Egumbo; wooded savanna in the middle part around the villages Talung, Alongkong, Nchingang and Banteng and the tropical savanna vegetation at the higher attitudes of M’mouck Leteh to Magha. The lower tropical forest and the wooded middle zones hold {{the highest level of}} flora - timber and non-timber forest species including medicinal plants. Much <b>of</b> the primary <b>forest</b> have been converted to secondary <b>forests</b> and void <b>of</b> major timber species. The tropical savanna zone has grassy vegetation, with isolated patches <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> (<b>stunted</b> <b>trees)</b> or planted eucalyptus trees.|$|R
50|$|Trees {{with very}} large girths, such {{as some of}} the sequoias growing the western United States, can also pose girth {{measurement}} problems. If they are growing on even a gentle slope, if girth is measured at 4.5 feet about where the pith of the tree emerges from the ground, the upside of the tape could easily be below ground level. In this case a better option would be to measure the standard girth measurement at 4.5 feet above ground level on the high side of the tree and note this in the measurement description 17 The height of this measurement point above the standard base point at midslope should also be noted.If measuring a mountaintop <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> only six feet tall, a girth measurement made at 4.5 feet would be meaningless. In the case of these stunted trees a girth taken at 1-foot above the base might be more appropriate. The point is that the girth measurements should be taken at the standard heights whenever possible. Where this measurement is not meaningful, an additional girth measurement should be taken at a more appropriate position and that height noted.Converting the girth measurement to a diameter will always overstate the cross-sectional area of the trunk, therefore it is best to record the raw girth numbers directly rather than convert them to diameters. The conversion of girth values to approximate diameters can always be done later if needed for other types of analysis.|$|E

Within the atrium of a Roman house or villa, a place that had formerly been quite plain, the art of the topiarius produced a miniature landscape (topos) which might employ the art <b>of</b> <b>stunting</b> <b>trees,</b> also mentioned, disapprovingly, by Pliny (Historia Naturalis xii.6).|$|R
50|$|Near Walluf {{was also}} once found the easternmost {{entrance}} through the Rheingauer Gebück, an impenetrable 50 to 100 meter-wide “hedge” <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> which formed {{a kind of}} border defense to protect against attacks from the north. The name comes from the German word bücken, meaning “to stoop,” {{a reference to the}} trees’ thick, low boughs. The Gebück, which extended as far as Lorch, was put in place by the Archbishopric of Mainz, which controlled the Rheingau. It also gave Walluf its nickname Pforte des Rheingaus (“Gateway to the Rheingau”). The village entrance, facing the Johannis fountain (Johannisbrunnen), was fortified with a great bulwark, which from its shape was known as the Backofen - “the Oven”.|$|R
60|$|The country round was as {{lonely and}} desolate as the road. And {{that sense of}} desolation seemed to pervade the very {{atmosphere}} right through the darkness which had descended on upland and valley and hill. Though nothing now could be seen through the gloom and the mist, the senses were conscious that even in broad daylight {{there would be nothing}} to see. Loneliness dwelt in the air as well as upon the moor. There were no homesteads for miles around, no cattle grazing, no pastures, no hedges, nothing--just arid wasteland with here and there a group <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> or an isolated yew, and tracts of rough, coarse grass not nearly good enough for cattle to eat.|$|R
60|$|This had not {{proved a}} {{difficult}} task, for some caulking {{was all that}} was required, but in order to reach the leak they had to lay her on the beach, and Jimmy thought it a desirable opportunity for filling up the water-breakers. Taking them ashore in the dory, they carried the small craft up; and after getting the water they set out for a walk across the island, because the sloop would not float until nearly high tide. The island was barren except for a few clumps <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees,</b> but they enjoyed the ramble, and were now feeling tired by the unusual exercise, as well as hungry, because they had not troubled about taking any lunch.|$|R

The night was clear, and we found no difficulty in picking our steps among the low shrubs. When we were about half-way through this wood, I observed a female form gliding among the bushes. She ran towards Maximus, who walked in advance and concealed me with his bulky form. But a slight bend in the road revealed my figure, and the woman paused, as if uncertain what to do.|$|R
25|$|At {{the highest}} elevations, {{near the top}} of Cerro de Punta, Cerro Maravilla and similar peaks, grows the Bosque enano forest, also known as dwarf forest, cloud forest, elfin forest and moss forest.

In the Middle Ages, Lorch served as the northern bastion of the Archbishopric of Mainz facing toward the Rheingau. Beginning in the twelfth century, Lorch found itself {{at the southern end of}} the Rheingauer Gebück, a kind of border defence made out of an impenetrable “hedge” <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> (the word itself comes from the root of the German word bücken, meaning “stoop”, a reference to the trees’ thick, low boughs). This was put in place by the Archbishops of Mainz. In the thirteenth century, a parish, whose first documentary mention came in 1254, was established in Lorch.|$|R
60|$|Cothouses {{marked by}} glimmering lights went by; they sped through a dim, white village; and Whitney opened out his engine {{as they went}} rocking past a line <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees.</b> They were the last and highest, for after them the rough ling and bent-grass rolled across the haunts of the sheep and grouse. Whitney changed his gear as the grade got steeper, the hedges gave place to stone walls until they ran out on an open moor, round which the hills lifted their black summits against the fading sky. The three men made a heavy load on the long incline, but the machine brought them up, and {{the last of the}} light had gone when they stopped in front of a lonely hotel.

40|$|Abstract. Predicted future {{changes in}} {{regional}} climate under {{a doubling of}} atmospheric CO 2 concentrations were applied to the 1951 - 80 normals of 254 climate stations to examine future impacts on the boreal <b>forest</b> <b>of</b> western Canada. Previous analyses have indicated that in this region, the southern boreal forest is presently restricted to areas where annual precipitation (P) exceeds potential evapotranspiration (PET). The present analysis suggests that a predicted 11 % increase in P would be insufficient to offset the increases in PET resulting from a predicted warming of 4 - 5 ~ As a result, half of the western Canadian boreal forest could be exposed to a drier climate similar to the present aspen parkland zone (P < PET), where conifers are generally absent and aspen is restricted to patches <b>of</b> <b>stunted</b> <b>trees</b> interspersed with grassland. Future changes could result in permanent losses <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> cover following disturbance {{and an increase in}} the proportion of exposed edge habitat in remaining stands, where environmental conditions might induce additional stresses on tree growth. Thus if the predicted warming and drying occurs, productivity of aspen and other commercial species in the southern boreal forest would be greatly reduced...|$|R
