50|$|Considering the broad-range {{distribution}} of B. ranarum and its high ubiquity, subcutaneous zygomycosis {{is not really}} prevalent. In addition, the fact that infections were only reported at tropical and subtropical regions further limits its prevalence. Currently, {{the reason why the}} infections were limited to those regions is not fully understood. However, the low prevalence might be <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>speculations</b> that <b>the</b> widespread immunity of other species was developed against its infection or the number of the B. ranarum strains with pathogenic characteristics is much lower than the saprophytic strains. Its transmission mode has not been fully understood though certain general ideas about its transmission are widely accepted. Ingestion of B. ranarum is thought to help disperse the agent through the deposition of feces at a distant place where human and other non-human animals might be exposed. As well, the agent may transmit through traumas or insect bites on skin.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1991 Swedish general {{election}} {{won by a}} right-wing coalition {{it was expected that}} the SVT monopoly of terrestrial TV broadcasting would be broken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction of TV3. However the new government favored {{the creation of a new}} channel, TV4, instead and it was not until Swedish TV converted to digital between 2004 and 2007 across the different parts of the country that TV3 was on terrestrial TV. The reason why the Carl Bildt Ministry decided no to let TV3 become terrestrial was not <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government. <b>Speculation</b> at <b>the</b> time was that the channel planned to locate in Gothenburg instead of the capital, Stockholm. Although Sweden has a large area with long distances north and south, it is one of the most capital-centralized countries in Europe. MTG applied several times for analogue terrestrial broadcasting licenses, but was always declined after the 1994 election when the Social Democrats returned into power. Following that rejection TV3 offered shorter and shorter news programmes, poorer quality productions and low viewer ratings.|$|R

5|$|Beaumont almost {{instantly}} became a boomtown with investors {{from around the}} state and the nation participating in land speculation.

40|$|This article {{applies the}} debate on the recent {{emergence}} of outsider candidates in Latin America to independent presidential candidate Marco Enríquez-Ominami (ME-O) in Chile in 2009. The authors test five competing hypotheses to explain his electoral success. First, his support is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> consolidation of democracy, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to disregard the authoritarian/democratic-aligned candidates. Second, his support is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decline of ideological identification, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to prefer nontraditional candidates. Third, his support is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> resurgence of <b>the</b> left, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> disposition of voters to identify with anti-Washington Consensus candidates. Fourth, his support is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> demand for quick government action, reflected in the predisposition of voters to consider candidates who will solve problems fast even if they do not ask voters for their opinions. Fifth, his support is <b>explained</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> declining support for established parties, reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> predisposition of voters to favor antisystemic candidates. The authors use survey data to test these hypotheses. They find no evidence to support the claims that ME-O fits any of the explanations. Though he was widely referred to as an outsider, his success seems to respond to national affairs rather than to a regional pattern. " (author's abstract...|$|R
