40|$|Thrombocytosis, i. e. an {{elevation}} of the <b>platelet</b> <b>count,</b> is a common finding in clinical practice. In general, patients with thrombocytosis are distinguished into two main categories, primarily based on the cause underlying the <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> The term "reactive thrombocytosis (RT) " has commonly been applied to the condition of an <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> {{after a period of}} bone marrow suppression associated with chronic or acute inflammation or infections, malignant diseases, hemorrhage, iron deficiency, or after splenectomy. In contrast, the condition in those patients in whom there is a clonal proliferative drive to enhanced platelet production is termed "thrombocythemia". Thrombocythemia may occur in its primary form (also known as essential thrombocythemia) or may accompany any of the other myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera (PV), myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as well as myelodysplastic syndromes. The clinical course, treatment and prognosis vary considerably for patients with reactive thrombocytosis, myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. Therefore, a thorough analysis of the cause for the <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> is warranted.

50|$|The {{blood smear}} {{of a person}} with iron {{deficiency}} shows many hypochromic (pale and relatively colorless) and rather small RBCs, and may also show poikilocytosis (variation in shape) and anisocytosis (variation in size). With more severe iron-deficiency anemia, the peripheral blood smear may show hypochromic pencil-shaped cells, and occasionally small numbers of nucleated red blood cells. Very commonly, the platelet count is slightly above the high limit of normal in iron deficiency anemia (this is mild thrombocytosis). This effect was classically postulated {{to be due to}} high erythropoietin levels in the body as a result of anemia, cross-reacting to activate thrombopoietin receptors in the precursor cells that make platelets; however, this process has not been corroborated.

MethodsA total of 82 epithelial ovarian cancer patients were enrolled in this study. Cluster analysis was used for grouping patients’ Prgb (Red-R; Green-G; Blue-B; Average percentage of RGB, Prgb) values. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed for detecting the diagnostic standard of purple-bluish tongue. χ 2 {{test was used to}} assess the relationship between purple-bluish tongue and platelet counts, and the recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer. The perioperative (preoperative) platelet level was examinedwith tongue image and disease recurrence. ResultsTongue images were classified into two groups basing on Prgb values of images by cluster analysis. The numbers of cases in cluster “ 1 ” (normal color tongue) was 16 and cluster “ 2 ” (purple-bluish tongue) was 66. Two groups of Prgb values, classified by cluster analysis, were significantly correlated with vision-based tongue color recognition (Kappa = 0. 852, P < 0. 001). ROC curve showed that the ratio of Pb to Pr had the highest diagnostic value. The sensitivity and the specificity of the ratio of Pb to Pr were 95. 3 % and 88. 9 % respectively and the optimal cut-off point was 0. 71. Purple-bluish tongue was significantly correlated with <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> (P < 0. 001). Both the <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> (P = 0. 01) and purple-bluish tongue were associated with recurrence of epithelial ovarian cancer (P < 0. 001). ConclusionThe ratio of Pb to Pr greater than 0. 71 could serve as an indicator for purple-bluish tongue diagnosing used in symptom pattern identification in Traditional Chinese Medicine.

40|$|Abstract: Immune {{thrombocytopenia}} (ITP) is {{an acquired}} bleeding autoimmune disorder {{characterized by a}} markedly decreased blood <b>platelet</b> <b>count.</b> The disorder is variable, frequently having an acute onset of limited duration in children and a more chronic course in adults. A number of therapeutic agents have demonstrated efficacy in <b>increasing</b> the <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in both children and adults. Anti-RhD immunoglobulin (anti-D) is one such agent, and has been successfully used {{in the setting of}} both acute and chronic immune thrombocytopenia. In this report we review the use of anti-D in the management of ITP. While the FDA-approved dose of 50 mg/kg has documented efficacy in <b>increasing</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in approximately 80 % of children and 70 % of adults, a higher dose of 75 μg/kg has been shown to result in a more rapid <b>increase</b> in <b>platelet</b> <b>count</b> without a greater reduction in hemoglobin. Anti-D is generally ineffective in patients who have failed splenectomy. Anti-RhD therapy has been shown capable of delaying splenectomy in adult patients, but does not significantly increase the total number of patients in whom the procedure can be avoided. Anti-D therapy appears to inhibit macrophage phagocytosis by a combination of both FcR blockade and inflammatory cytokine inhibition of platelet phagocytosis within the spleen. Anti-RhD treatment is associated with mild to moderate infusion toxicities. Rare life-threatening toxicities such as hemoglobinuria, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported. Recommendations have been proposed {{to reduce the risk of}} these complications. Anti-D immunoglobulin can be an effective option for rapidly <b>increasing</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in patients with symptomatic ITP...|$|R

40|$|There is an unmet {{need for}} thrombopoietic agents that can {{increase}} platelet counts {{in patients with}} thrombocytopenia. The development of recombinant versions of the main thrombopoietic hormone, thrombopoietin (Tpo), were terminated due to the unwanted formation of antibodies to endogenous thrombopoietin. Eltrombopag is an orally bioavailable, non-peptide, small molecule agonist of the thrombopoietin receptor that increases platelet counts in humans, by driving differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytes. The development of eltrombopag {{as a treatment for}} thrombocytopenia involved iterative experiments in a series of in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies in which eltrombopag was shown to activate the Tpo receptor leading to signal transduction via the JAK-ST AT pathway in megakaryocyte cell lines, drive megakaryopoiesis in primary human bone marrow cells and increase platelet counts after oral administration to chimpanzees. The target exposure for increasing platelet counts was 30 - 90 ~g. h/ml, while the no observed adverse effect level was 164 ~g. h/ml. When administered to healthy subjects for 10 days, eltrombopag <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in a dose dependent manner at doses of 30, 50 and 75 mg, where exposures exceeded the predicted 30 ~g. h/ml. A Phase II study in adult subjects with chronic ITP showed that doses of 50 mg and 75 mg of eltrombopag <b>increased</b> <b>platelet</b> <b>counts</b> in up to 80 % of subjects, compared to only 11 % of subjects that received placebo. Thorough characterization of the pharmacology of eltrombopag during preclinical and early clinical development allowed for data-driven dose selection decisions and provided a strong foundation for successful Phase III clinical studies and regulatory approval of eltrombopag as a much needed treatment for thrombocytopenic patients.
