40|$|Brain-expressed {{genes are}} known to evolve slowly in mammals. Nevertheless, since brains of higher {{primates}} have evolved rapidly, one might expect acceleration in DNA sequence evolution in their brain-expressed genes. In this study, we carried out full-length cDNA sequencing on the brain transcriptome of an Old World monkey (OWM) and then conducted three-way comparisons among (i) mouse, OWM, and human, and (ii) OWM, chimpanzee, and human. Although brain-expressed genes indeed appear to evolve more rapidly in species with more advanced brains (apes > OWM > mouse), a similar lineage effect is observable <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes.</b> The broad inclusion of genes in the reference set to represent the genomic average is therefore critical {{to this type of}} analysis. Calibrated against the genomic average, the rate of evolution among brain-expressed genes is probably lower (or at most equal) in humans than in chimpanzee and OWM. Interestingly, the trend of slow evolution in coding sequence is no less pronounced among brain-specific genes, vis-à-vis brain-expressed genes in general. The human brain may thus differ from those of our close relatives in two opposite directions: (i) faster evolution in gene expression, and (ii) a likely slowdown in the evolution of protein sequences. Possible explanations and hypotheses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal was}} to gain {{understanding}} of how 12 genes containing SNP previously related to embryo competence to become a blastocyst (BRINP 3, C 1 QB, HSPA 1 L, IRF 9, MON 1 B, PARM 1, PCCB, PMM 2, SLC 18 A 2, TBC 1 D 24, TTLL 3 and WBP 1) participate in embryonic development. Gene expression was evaluated in matured oocytes and embryos. BRINP 3 and C 1 QB were not detected at any stage. <b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> <b>genes,</b> transcript abundance declined as the embryo developed to the blastocyst stage. Exceptions were for PARM 1 and WBP 1, where steady-state mRNA increased at the 9 - 16 cell stage. The SNP in WBP 1 caused large differences in the predicted three-dimensional structure of the protein while the SNP in PARM 1 caused smaller changes. The mutation in WBP 1 causes an amino acid substitution located close to a P-P-X-Y motif involved in protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the observation that the reference allele varies between mammalian species indicates that the locus has not been conserved during mammalian evolution. Knockdown of mRNA for WBP 1 decreased the percent of putative zygotes becoming blastocysts and {{reduced the number of}} trophectoderm cells and immunoreactive CDX 2 in the resulting blastocysts. WBP 1 is an important gene for embryonic development in the cow. Further research to identify how the SNP in WBP 1 affects processes leading to differentiation of the embryo into TE and ICM lineages is warranted...|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} {{mitochondrial}} RNAs hybridizes {{specifically to the}} var 1 region on Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial DNA (Farrelly et al., J. Biol. Chem. 257 : 6581 - 6587, 1982). We constructed a fine-structure transcription map of this region by hybridizing DNA probes containing different portions of the var 1 region and some flanking sequences to mitochondrial RNAs isolated from var 1 -containing petites. We also report the nucleotide sequence of more than 1. 2 kilobases of DNA flanking the var 1 gene. Our primary findings are: (i) The family of RNAs we detect with homology to var 1 DNA is colinear with the var 1 gene. Their direction of transcription is olil to cap, as it is <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> mitochondrial <b>genes.</b> (ii) Extensive hybridization anomalies are present, most likely due to the high A-T (A-U) content of the hybridizing species and to the asymmetric distribution of their G-C residues. An important conclusion is that failure to detect transcripts from A-T-rich regions of the yeast mitochondrial genome by standard blot transfer hybridizations cannot be interpreted to mean that such sequences, which are commonly supposed to be spacer DNA, are noncoding or lack direct function in the expression of mitochondrial genes...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{pathogenic}} attack, {{plants are}} able to mount a defense response with the coordinated activation of a battery of defense-related genes. In this study we have characterized the mode of expression of the P 69 B and P 69 C genes from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), which encodes two closely related subtilisin-like proteases associated with the defense response. We have compared the mode of gene regulation in heterologous transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring promoter-β-glucuronidase (GUS) and promoter-luciferase (LUC) gene fusions for these two genes. These studies revealed that the P 69 B and P 69 C promoters are induced by salicylic acid as well as {{during the course of}} both a compatible and an incompatible interaction with Pseudomonas syringae. Furthermore, P 69 B and P 69 C expression takes place in both the local and the distal (noninoculated) leaves upon inoculation with bacteria but following different and unique tissue-specific patterns of expression that are also different to that described <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>other</b> classical PR <b>genes.</b> Also, we report that luciferin, the substrate for the reporter luciferase (LUC) gene, is able to activate expression of PR genes, and this may pose a problem when using this gene reporter system in studies related to plant defense...|$|R
