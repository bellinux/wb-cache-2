5|$|The {{swing bridge}} {{spanning}} the Esk divides {{the upper and}} lower harbours and joins the east and west sides of the town. Whitby developed as an important bridging point of the River Esk and in 1351 permission was granted for tolls to be taken on the bridge for its maintenance. In 1609 a survey for a new bridge was commissioned while in 1628 it was described as a drawbridge where men raised planks to let vessels pass and tolls were collected. The bridge posts were rebuilt in stone at a cost of £3,000 in 1766. This structure was replaced by a four-arched bridge between 1833 and 1835, one arch made of cast iron swivelled to allow vessels to pass. This bridge was replaced between 1908 and 1909 by the current <b>electric</b> <b>swing</b> bridge.|$|E

In this paper, we present four GaN based polar quantum {{structures}} grown on c-plane embedded in p-i-n diode architecture {{as a part}} of high-speed electroabsorption modulators for use in optical communication (free-space non-line-of-sight optical links) in the ultraviolet (UV) : the first modulator incorporates similar to 4 - 6 nm thick GaN/AlGaN quantum structures for operation in the deep-UV spectral region and the other three incorporate similar to 2 - 3 nm thick InGaN/GaN quantum structures tuned for operation in violet to near-UV spectral region. Here, we report on the design, epitaxial growth, fabrication, and characterization of these quantum electroabsorption modulators.

40|$|Here {{we report}} {{the design of}} a new {{external}} electric field-controlled release system using functional dipolar molecules as nanoimpellers. The dipolar molecule 4 -(3 -cyanophenyl) butylene, which can reorient in response to external electric fields with different frequencies because of its strong inherent dipole moment, was synthesized and grafted onto the inner Surfaces of mesopores. Under an alternating <b>electric</b> field, the <b>swinging</b> flexible molecular chains consequently push guest molecules out of the pore voids. This innovative approach to controlled release may provide important application opportunities in tumor treatment with a number of advantages in terms of local release with targetability, external remote control, and the nonelectrochemical nature of the process...|$|R

5000|$|By the 1970s, Burns' {{influence}} {{had spread}} to a younger generation of bluegrass and [...] "new-acoustic" [...] musicians, most notably New Grass Revival mandolinist Sam Bush. His participation in Norman Blake/Tut Taylor/Sam Bush/Butch Robins/Vassar Clements/David Holland/Jethro Burns, an independently released album produced by promoter Hank Deane, was reportedly at Bush's suggestion. During that same decade, Burns' acquaintance with bluegrass mandolinist David Grisman led to Burns' writing a number of music/humor columns in the Grisman-published journal Mandolin World News. Grisman also produced a 1978 duet album on Kaleidoscope Records, Back to Back, featuring Burns and Western <b>swing</b> <b>electric</b> mandolinist Tiny Moore.

40|$|A {{potential}} fatal {{problem for}} electrical power delivery through power lines in Northern countries is when snow or ice accumulates on electrical insulators. This {{could lead to}} snow or ice-induced outages and voltage collapse, causing huge economic loss. Further, large swing angles due to wind may cause short circuits. This paper presents a novel video surveillance system for detecting snow coverage on <b>electric</b> insulators and <b>swing</b> angles of insulators using videos from a remote outdoor 420 kV power transmission line. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, it is the first insulator snow surveillance system base on automatic image analysis techniques. We propose using hybrid techniques by combining histograms, boundaries and template cross-correlations for analyzing a broad range of scenarios caused by changing weather and lighting conditions. Experiments on videos captured during several month periods have shown promising and valuable estimation results. For image pixels related to snow on insulators, our system has yielded an average detection rate of 93 % for good quality images and 67. 6 % for poor quality images, and a corresponding average false alarm of 9 % and 18. 1 %...|$|R

60|$|In {{the same}} mail with your letter, arrived the {{enclosed}} from Orme the motor man. You will observe {{that he has}} an office. I will explain {{that this is a}} law office and I think it probably does him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man to have one with an active business attached. You see he is on the electric light lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if I want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me, to hire him on a good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same old eagerness, the same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will escape him? Now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities, going on week after week with this same man, during fifty entire years, and he has not yet learned, in the slightest degree, that there isn't any occasion to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always wait; and that whether it waits or flies, he certainly will never catch it. This immortal hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment, is the immortal feature of this character, for a play; and we will write that play. We should be fools else. That staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent, for it is slung on the paper telegraphically, all the small words left out. I am afraid something newer and bigger than the <b>electric</b> light is <b>swinging</b> across his orbit. Save this letter for an inspiration. I have got a hundred more.|$|R
