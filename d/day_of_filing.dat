50|$|BAPCPA also {{provided}} more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. The presumption of {{fraud in the}} use of credit cards was expanded.

The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>filing,</b> the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises. Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>filing</b> (§ 523(a)(2)(C)).|$|R

50|$|At {{the age of}} forty-two, Herrick {{was elected}} as a Republican to the Sixty-seventh Congress.

During his one-and-only term, Herrick scandalized his fellow legislators by soliciting marriage proposals from beauty queens, only to claim that he was gathering information for intended legislation banning beauty pageants. Herrick took a similar approach to his 1925 arrest for moonshining, claiming to be an undercover agent for the Internal Revenue Service. Herrick was also notable for his prowess as a barnstorming aviator, and for claiming to be Jesus Christ reborn (his given name was Immanuel).

The law gives plaintiffs ten days to either file such a claim or show that it would probably be unsuccessful.|$|R
