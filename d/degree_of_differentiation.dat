60|$|This {{seems to}} me a {{remarkable}} physiological fact. The pollen-grains of the two forms are undistinguishable under the microscope; the stigmas differ only in length, degree of divergence, and in the size, shade of colour, and approximation of their papillae, these latter differences being variable and apparently due merely to the degree of elongation of the stigma. Yet we plainly see that the two kinds of pollen and the two stigmas are widely dissimilar in their mutual reaction--the stigmas of each form being almost powerless on their own pollen, but causing, through some mysterious influence, apparently by simple contact (for I could detect no viscid secretion), the pollen-grains of the opposite form to protrude their tubes. It may be said that the two pollens and the two stigmas mutually recognise each other by some means. Taking fertility as the criterion of distinctness, it is no exaggeration to say that the pollen of the long-styled Linum grandiflorum (and conversely that of the other form) has been brought to a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation,</b> with respect to its action on the stigma of the same form, corresponding with that existing between the pollen and stigma of species belonging to distinct genera.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{endogenous}} formation of networks between manufacturers of differentiated goods and multi-product retailers who interact in a successive duopoly. Joint consent {{is needed to}} establish and/or maintain a costly link between a manufacturer and a retailer. We find that only three distribution networks are stable for particular values <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> and link costs: (i) the non-exclusive distribution & non-exclusive dealing network in which both retailers distribute both products is stable for intermediate <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> and small link costs; (ii) the exclusive distribution & exclusive dealing network in which each retailer distributes a different product is stable for low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> product differentiation; (iii) the mixed distribution network in which one retailer distributes both products while the other retailer sells only one is stable for high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> and large link costs.

60|$|So far {{a certain}} wild {{rationality}} seemed {{to light up}} the affair. I knew it was unusual, in my own country, for the Astronomer Royal {{to walk down the}} Strand with his coat plastered all over with the Solar System. Indeed, it was unusual for any English astronomical lecturer to advertise the subject of his lectures in this fashion. But though it would be unusual, it would not necessarily be unreasonable. In fact, I think it might add to the colour and variety of life, if specialists did adopt this sort of scientific heraldry. I should {{like to be able to}} recognise an entomologist at sight by the decorative spiders and cockroaches crawling all over his coat and waistcoat. I should like to see a conchologist in a simple costume of shells. An osteopath, I suppose, would be agreeably painted so as to resemble a skeleton, while a botanist would enliven the street with the appearance of a Jack-in-the-Green. So while I regarded the astronomical lecturer in the astronomical coat as a figure distinguishable, by a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation,</b> from the artless astronomers of my island home (enough their simple loveliness for me) I saw in him nothing illogical, but rather an imaginative extreme of logic.

6000|$|When two {{varieties}} which present well-marked {{differences are}} crossed, their descendants {{in the later}} generations differ greatly from one another in external characters; and {{this is due to}} the augmentation or obliteration of some of these characters, and to the reappearance of former ones through reversion; and so it will be, as we may feel almost sure, with any slight differences in the constitution of their sexual elements. Anyhow, my experiments indicate that crossing plants which have been long subjected to almost though not quite the same conditions, is the most powerful of all the means for retaining some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> in the sexual elements, as shown by the superiority in the later generations of the intercrossed over the self-fertilised seedlings. Nevertheless, the continued intercrossing of plants thus treated does tend to obliterate such differentiation, as may be inferred from the lessened benefit derived from intercrossing such plants, in comparison with that from a cross with a fresh stock. It seems probable, as I may add, that seeds have acquired their endless curious adaptations for wide dissemination, not only that the seedlings would thus be enabled to find new and fitting homes, but that the individuals which have been long subjected to the same conditions should occasionally intercross with a fresh stock.

60|$|We {{have seen}} in the fourth chapter that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> and {{specialisation}} of the parts in organic beings, when arrived at maturity, is the best standard, as yet suggested, of their degree of perfection or highness. We have also seen that, as the specialisation of parts is an advantage to each being, so natural selection will tend to render the organisation of each being more specialised and perfect, and in this sense higher; not but that it may leave many creatures with simple and unimproved structures fitted for simple conditions of life, and in some cases will even degrade or simplify the organisation, yet leaving such degraded beings better fitted for their new walks of life. In another and more general manner, new species become superior to their predecessors; for they have to beat in the struggle for life all the older forms, with which they come into close competition. We may therefore conclude that if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of the world could be put into competition with the existing inhabitants, the former would be beaten and exterminated by the latter, as would the secondary by the eocene, and the palaeozoic by the secondary forms. So that by this fundamental test of victory in the battle for life, {{as well as by the}} standard of the specialisation of organs, modern forms ought, on the theory of natural selection, to stand higher than ancient forms. Is this the case? A large majority of palaeontologists would answer in the affirmative; and it seems that this answer must be admitted as true, though difficult of proof.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{vertical}} restraints in a duopoly market when {{retailers have}} private information on demand uncertainty. If both manufacturers {{are able to}} charge their retailers franchise fees, they will delegate the decision to determine retail prices to their retailers. If both manufacturers are unable to charge their retailers franchise fees, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> {{plays an important role}} in equilibrium. If both products are more or less differentiated, both manufacturers will directly set the retail prices without delegation. If both products are extremely homogeneous, there will exist two equilibria; resale price maintenance (RPM) and delegation. From a social welfare standpoint, an efficient equilibrium depends on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> as well as on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> demand uncertainty. If the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> is high, it is efficient for regulators to let manufacturers to be able to employ RPM, irrespective of demand uncertainty. If the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> product <b>differentiation</b> is at the intermediate level, it is desirable that regulators allow a contract with a franchise fee. If both products are sufficiently homogeneous, it is efficient for regulators to prohibit vertical restraints.

60|$|If we {{now turn}} to the more {{immediate}} cause of self-sterility, we clearly see that in most cases it {{is determined by the}} conditions to which the plants have been subjected. Thus Eschscholtzia is completely self-sterile in the hot climate of Brazil, but is perfectly fertile there with the pollen of any other individual. The offspring of Brazilian plants became in England in a single generation partially self-fertile, and still more so in the second generation. Conversely, the offspring of English plants, after growing for two seasons in Brazil, became in the first generation quite self-sterile. Again, Abutilon darwinii, which is self-sterile in its native home of Brazil, became moderately self-fertile in a single generation in an English hothouse. Some other plants are self-sterile during {{the early part of the}} year, and later in the season become self-fertile. Passiflora alata lost its self-sterility when grafted on another species. With Reseda, however, in which some individuals of the same parentage are self-sterile and others are self-fertile, we are forced in our ignorance to speak of the cause as due to spontaneous variability; but we should remember that the progenitors of these plants, either on the male or female side, may have been exposed to somewhat different conditions. The power of the environment thus to affect so readily and in so peculiar a manner the reproductive organs, is a fact which has many important bearings; and I have therefore thought the foregoing details worth giving. For instance, the sterility of many animals and plants under changed conditions of life, such as confinement, evidently comes within the same general principle of the sexual system being easily affected by the environment. It has already been proved, that a cross between plants which have been self-fertilised or intercrossed during several generations, having been kept all the time under closely similar conditions, does not benefit the offspring; and on the other hand, that a cross between plants that have been subjected to different conditions benefits the offspring to an extraordinary degree. We may therefore conclude that some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>differentiation</b> in the sexual system is necessary for the full fertility of the parent-plants and for the full vigour of their offspring. It seems also probable that with those plants which are capable of complete self-fertilisation, the male and female elements and organs already differ to an extent sufficient to excite their mutual interaction; but that when such plants are taken to another country, and become in consequence self-sterile, their sexual elements and organs are so acted on as to be rendered too uniform for such interaction, like those of a self-fertilised plant long cultivated under the same conditions. Conversely, we may further infer that plants which are self-sterile in their native country, but become self-fertile under changed conditions, have their sexual elements so acted on, that they become sufficiently differentiated for mutual interaction.|$|E
