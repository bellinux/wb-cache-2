40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} occupational history and upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) cancer risk in the ARCAGE European case-control study. The study included 1, 851 patients with incident cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx or esophagus and 1, 949 controls. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for ever employment in 283 occupations and 172 industries, adjusting for smoking and alcohol. Men (1, 457 cases) and women (394 cases) were analyzed separately and we incorporated a semi-Bayes adjustment approach for multiple comparisons. Among men, we found increased risks for occupational categories previously reported {{to be associated with}} at least one type of UADT cancer, including painters (OR = 1. 74, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 3. 00), bricklayers (1. 58, 1. 05 - 2. 37), workers employed in the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>roofs</b> and frames (2. 62, 1. 08 - 6. 36), reinforced concreters (3. 46, 1. 11 - 10. 8), dockers (2. 91, 1. 05 - 8. 05) and workers employed in the construction of roads (3. 03, 1. 23 - 7. 46), general construction of buildings (1. 44, 1. 12 - 1. 85) and cargo handling (2. 60, 1. 17 - 5. 75). With the exception of the first three categories, risks both increased when restricting to long duration of employment and remained elevated after semi-Bayes adjustment. Increased risks were also found for loggers (3. 56, 1. 20 - 10. 5) and cattle and dairy farming (3. 60, 1. 15 - 11. 2). Among women, there was no clear evidence of increased risks of UADT cancer in association with occupations or industrial activities. This study provides evidence of an association between some occupational categories and UADT cancer risk among men. The most consistent findings, also supported by previous studies, were obtained for specific workers employed in the construction industry. © 2011 UICC...|$|E

50|$|The present {{renovation}} {{was begun}} in end of 2013. The ceremony took place from 14th till 15 November 2013, involved the removing of the deities {{from the main}} shrines to a temporary site (balaalayam) within the temple and {{was the beginning of}} the many rituals to prepare for the consecration ceremony. The process was divided into five stages. After procuring connection of all necessary services to the site, the first stage of the project, breaking the wall and floor tiles commenced. This was followed by the reinforced concrete work to the foundations, slabs, columns and so forth. Construction activities continued with the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> <b>roof</b> steel frames. Electrical and plumbing conduits. A team of artisans arrived from India and commenced work on the shrines. Another batch of additional artisans arrived from India to accelerate the pace of construction in order to meet the consecration ceremony deadline.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, bale {{buildings}} {{can have}} a structural frame of other materials, usually lumber or timber-frame, with bales simply serving as insulation and plaster substrate, ("infill" [...] or [...] "non-loadbearing" [...] technique), which is most often required in northern regions and/or in wet climates. In northern regions, the potential snow-loading can exceed {{the strength of the}} bale walls. In wet climates, the imperative for applying a vapor-permeable finish precludes the use of cement-based stucco. Additionally, the inclusion of a skeletal framework of wood or metal allows the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>roof</b> prior to raising the bales, which can protect the bale wall during construction, when it is the most vulnerable to water damage in all but the most dependably arid climates. A combination of framing and load-bearing techniques may also be employed, referred to as [...] "hybrid" [...] straw bale construction.|$|R

From its inner end an Indian trail, which as yet only one or two white men had ever trodden, led on to the still richer wilderness that stretched back to the Yukon.

She was busy inside it then, for Ingleby could hear the rattle of cooking utensils and listened appreciatively, for he was as hungry as usual, although dispirited. His limbs ached from a long day's strenuous toil, and the stain of the soil was on his threadbare jean. He and Leger had spent a good many weeks now upon a placer claim, and the result of their labours was a few grains of gold.|$|R
50|$|Construction of a pedestrianised {{shopping}} centre of around a hundred shops {{began in the}} early-to-mid-1960s. The {{shopping centre}} was opened by Patricia Phoenix, (who played Elsie Tanner in ITV's Coronation Street), Mary Rand (athlete) and Ted Ray (comedian). As with the most British net towns, modern art {{was included in the}} design: in the case of Yate, this was {{in the form of the}} Four Seasons sculpture, and a graceful and dramatic spire-shaped sculpture, which could be seen for miles, mounted high above the centre on the <b>roof</b> <b>of</b> one of the shops. This sculpture existed until the early 1990s when it was removed during the revamping of the centre, which included the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> glass <b>roofs</b> over the walkways. An extension to East Walk was constructed at the start of the 1980s, and this included the construction of a new Tesco store, with the old store in South Walk turned into a Tesco Home and Wear store. An extension to West Walk was constructed in the early 1990s.|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of achieving zero waste discharge on a dairy farm in south west Western Australia. The current best practices for dairy farm effluent treatment were assessed in a literature review and a water audit and a nutrient balance were conducted on a specific farm in Boyanup, W. A. with 500 cattle. The finding was 52 L/cow per milking of water were used, which {{is higher than the}} industry benchmark. Nutrients were leaking into groundwater table at six meters depth at low concentrations. Four different options were assessed in a techno-economic options assessment: i) no action to be taken; ii) installing a pond for effluent storage; iii) installing a tank for effluent storage, and iv) recycling effluent after primary treatment for dairy yard wash combined with construction <b>of</b> a <b>roof</b> on the yard for additional rainwater catchment and reduction of heat stress on cows. The paper concludes that a hybrid option incorporating effluent recycling for yard wash by installation of flood wash tanks, construction of a pond for storage during wet seasons, and the <b>erection</b> <b>of</b> a <b>roof</b> on the yard for additional rainwater catchment and reduction of heat stress on cows. This final recommendation was designed to achieve zero waste discharge and showed further benefits such as an increase in milk production and a reduction of labour. The installation cost for the proposed overall system was estimated at 170, 000 with a payback period of 6. 2 years...|$|R
