5|$|At the April 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, a film {{adaptation}} was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, {{directed by}} Luke Boyce and produced by Shatterglass Films, an independent film {{company based in}} Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed Revival since its debut, and {{had been thinking about}} adapting <b>it</b> <b>long</b> before he met the creators. A two-minute proof of concept teaser was shown at the expo.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made <b>it</b> <b>long</b> enough to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing {{to make him}} look younger, and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier to}} draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
5|$|On August 17, the North Koreans {{resumed their}} attack. A {{battalion}} of North Korean troops drove the ROK police out of T'ongyong {{but did not}} hold <b>it</b> <b>long.</b> UN naval forces heavily shelled T'ongyong as three companies of ROK Marines from Koje Island made an amphibious landing near the town. The ROK force then attacked the North Koreans and, supported by naval gun fire, drove them out. The North Koreans at T'ongyong lost about 350 men, the survivors withdrew to Chinju.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 18th century, with {{the lines between}} {{commercial}} and political dominance being increasingly blurred, a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal outposts. The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to {{a portion of the}} Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies. Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s. India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as <b>it</b> <b>long</b> had, but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials, and many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period. By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and effectively having been made an arm of British administration, the company began to more consciously enter non-economic arenas such as education, social reform, and culture.|$|E
5|$|There {{were more}} {{concerns}} about Clannad being similar to Air. When Nagisa's scenario was being written, {{there were some}} disputes concerning {{the length of her}} scenario, and thus putting too much focus on the main heroine. Some were concerned that having a single prominent character with a unique storyline would be too much like how Air was structured with the overall focus on Misuzu Kamio. Takahiro Baba, the company president of VisualArt's, is even noted as suggesting to minimize the differences between the other characters' scenarios, but this was ultimately ignored since Maeda thought the game's evaluation by players would not decrease on account of the scenarios being vastly different, and thought the end result was a good one. Maeda was concerned that the After Story arc, mainly a continuation of Nagisa's scenario, would eclipse the entire game's scenario, much like what happened with Air according to Maeda. In order to prevent the same thing happening in Clannad, Maeda focused on making {{the first half of the}} story, the School Life arc, just as enjoyable by making <b>it</b> <b>long</b> and heart-breaking. Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yūto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4,000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.|$|E

25|$|The Brompton Oratory, a {{place of}} Catholic worship, marks one of the {{transitions}} into Kensington, but Belgravia and Brompton have competing mapped neighbourhood status {{in the east and}} south of the neighbourhood, and as they have no eponymously named tube stations or historic parish boundaries, their limits are completely arbitrary and the triangular salient of Brompton, administratively in Kensington, as part of South Kensington, once coloured mid-wealth by Charles Booth, is now definitely blurred with 'Knightsbridge', into which <b>it</b> <b>long</b> projected.|$|E
25|$|A revamped Family Feud {{returned}} for a seventh season in September 1994 with Dawson {{in his role as}} host. The show expanded from thirty to sixty minutes, reinstated the Family Feud Challenge format, and did various other things to try to improve the ratings of the show such as build a more modern-looking set, feature families that had previously been champions on the original Feud, and have more themed weeks. Although Dawson did bring a brief ratings surge when he came back, the show could not sustain <b>it</b> <b>long</b> term and Feud came to a conclusion {{at the end of the}} 1994–95 season.|$|E
25|$|It is {{described}} in various novels that the Culture is extremely reluctant to go to war, though it may start to prepare for <b>it</b> <b>long</b> before its actual commencement. In the Idiran-Culture War (possibly {{one of the most}} hard-fought wars for the normally extremely superior Culture forces), various star systems, stellar regions and many orbital habitats were overrun by the Idirans before the Culture had converted enough of its forces to military footing. The Culture Minds had had enough foresight to evacuate almost all its affected citizens (apparently numbering in the many billions) in time before actual hostilities reached them. As shown in Player of Games, this is a standard Culture tactic, with its strong emphasis on protecting its citizens rather than sacrificing some of them for short-term goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make <b>it.</b> <b>Long,</b> flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very stretchy, short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E
25|$|Those {{born into}} a {{monolingual}} Dutch family in Brussels had always had {{a lower level of}} education than the average for Brussels. By contrast, 30% of the Flemings who had moved to Brussels from elsewhere had a university degree or other post-secondary education, and were highly qualified. For example, since 1970 in Belgium as a whole, there have been more students enrolled in Dutch language universities than French ones. To be called a Dutch-speaker no longer evokes images of lower-class laborers, as <b>it</b> <b>long</b> had. Bilingualism is increasingly a prerequisite for well-paying jobs, and what prestige the Dutch language currently has in Brussels is chiefly for economic reasons. It {{should be noted that the}} economic importance of Dutch in Brussels has little to do with the proportion of Brussels that is Dutch-speaking. Rather, it is primarily relations between businesses in Brussels and Flemish businesses, or more generally, with Dutch-speaking businesses as a whole that ensure the economic importance of Dutch in Brussels.|$|E

500|$|Jackson {{released}} her fourth album, Rhythm Nation 1814, in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to Control, Jackson chose {{to include a}} socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, [...] "I know an album or a song can't change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold <b>it</b> <b>long</b> {{enough for them to}} listen to the lyrics." [...] The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.|$|E
500|$|In ancient Greece, long male {{hair was}} a symbol of wealth and power, while a shaven head was {{appropriate}} for a slave. The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long, including Zeus, Achilles, Apollo, and Poseidon. Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle. Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off. [...] Also, in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle, they were known to cut the front short, but leave <b>it</b> <b>long</b> in the back, where it was more out of reach. A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept <b>it</b> <b>long,</b> and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies' reach. The ponytail method allowed warriors, who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches, to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice. Around the sixth century, however, the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles, {{with the exception of the}} Spartans. Women in the culture remained with the longer style, which for them showed freedom, health, and wealth, as well as good behavior. In men, it was considered a sign of false pride by this time.|$|E

Back when it was long, I used to wash and dry my hair every morning at home before going into work. That added an extra half-hour to my day".
