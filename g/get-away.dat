25|$|The Town of Canmore {{originally}} {{depended on}} the coal mines. In the 1980s, the Olympics revived the economy and set the grounds for a high-end bedroom and <b>get-away</b> community which would depend on construction and tourism income.|$|E
25|$|While {{still in}} the parking lot, Mătăsăreanu was shot twice in the right buttock and the left forearm, forcing him to abandon his duffel bag of money, enter the <b>get-away</b> vehicle, and start the engine. Phillips {{retrieved}} the HK-91 from the open trunk and continued firing upon officers, while walking alongside the sedan, using it for cover. As Phillips approached the passenger's side of the <b>get-away</b> vehicle, he {{was hit in the}} shoulder and his rifle was struck in the receiver and magazine by bullets fired by police. After firing a few more shots with one arm, Phillips discarded the HK-91, and retrieved the Norinco Type 56 before exiting the parking lot and retreating onto the street while Mătăsăreanu drove down the road.|$|E
25|$|Addison holds female {{clerk at}} 7-Eleven {{convenience}} store in Hudson at gunpoint while Bell-Rogers steals $280. During the investigation, his girlfriend Angela Swist and Teresia Shipley, another friend, turned themselves in to police after authorities issued warrants for their arrests. During {{an interview with}} police, Swist told officers that she drove Addison and Anthonie Rodgers to the 7-Eleven on October 11, where Addison and his accomplice robbed the store and fled. She also admitted {{that she was the}} driver of the <b>get-away</b> car.|$|E

60|$|Ben Price knew Jimmy's habits. He {{had learned}} them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick <b>get-aways,</b> no confederates, and {{a taste for}} good society--these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a {{successful}} dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up {{the trail of the}} elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.|$|R
50|$|Buxtehude {{enjoys a}} good {{reputation}} as a warm, visitor-friendly town preserving its cultural and regional heritage without denying the future. Besides the beautiful old part of town, the main church of Sankt Petri (St. Peter) and the Zwinger are great places to pay a visit to. The Altes Land adjacent to Buxtehude and the close Elbe river serve as great <b>get-aways</b> for a bicycle tour or a long hike. Buxtehude can as well {{be used as a}} hub for tours to the nearby cities of Hamburg and Bremen.|$|R
25|$|Partly {{because it}} {{may not always be}} the case that a {{wrongdoing}} trustee can be found, or remains solvent, tracing became an important step in restitutionary claims for breach of trust. Tracing means tracking the value of an asset that properly belongs to a trust fund, such as a car, shares, money, or profits made by a trustee through a conflict of interest. If those things are exchanged for other things (i.e. money or assets) then the value residing in the new thing can potentially be claimed by the beneficiaries. For example, in an early case, Taylor v Plumer a dishonest broker, Mr Walsh, was given £22,200 in a banker's draft and was meant to invest in Exchequer Bills (UK government bonds) for Sir Plumer. Instead he bought gold doubloons and was planning a <b>get-away</b> to the Caribbean until he was apprehended at Falmouth. Lord Ellenborough held that the property belonged to Sir Plumer, in whatever form it had become. It may also be that the value of the traced trust money has changed, and possibly risen considerably. In the leading case, Foskett v McKeown an investment manager wrongfully took £20,440 from his clients, paid the last two out of five installments on a life insurance policy, and committed suicide. The insurance company paid out £1,000,000, although under the policy's terms this would have been paid out anyway. The majority of the House of Lords held that clients could trace their money into the payout and claim a proportionate share (£400,000). Theoretically the case was controversial, as the House of Lords rejected that such a tracing claim was founded upon unjust enrichment, as opposed to being the vindication of a property right.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1990s, Crimea {{became more}} of a <b>get-away</b> {{destination}} than a [...] "health-improvement" [...] destination.

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{recreational}} attractions {{in the region}} as well. The Hockley Valley Resort is located on the 3rd Line of Mono. The Hockley Valley Resort has both a golf course for activities in the summer and a popular ski resort for winter <b>get-aways.</b> There are also cross country skiing trails at Monora Park. There is much debate between residents and non residents as to the correct way to pronounce the name Mono, the correct way is mow-no. The Indian name Mahnoo, means [...] "let it be so." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, Pauley donated {{a portion}} of the island to the University of Hawaii {{to be used as a}} marine {{research}} facility [...] From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Pauley family used the island for summer <b>get-aways</b> and hosted many notable guests. From the mid-80s to mid-90s Japanese real estate investor Katsuhiro Kawaguchi owned the island and permitted the University of Hawaii to use some of its areas for research. In 1995, the Edwin Pauley Foundation granted a gift of $9.6 million to the University of Hawaii Foundation to purchase the private half of the island and build new laboratories on it.|$|R
5000|$|Del Webb, a {{publicly}} traded company when Sun City Texas was originally conceived and through the first several years of homebuilding, was later sold to Pulte. Residency is restricted to persons over age 55, {{or in the case}} of couples, one of which must be 55 years of age (except in the instance of guardianship and marriage). Sun City Texas is made up predominately of single-family dwellings, but also has a small number of duplexes. For marketing purposes, near the main activity center there are a limited number of attached houses called Vacation <b>Get-Aways</b> (each complete with a golf cart), which are used for providing low-cost overnight accommodations for prospects to [...] "live the life" [...] of Sun City for a few days. Total build-out is approved by Georgetown for approximately 7,500 homes, which equals a total of approximately 14,000 residents.|$|R
2500|$|The cover depicts Rumsfeld {{during a}} <b>get-away</b> trip to Taos, which {{journalist}} Ben Smith has suggested conveys {{the notion of}} being [...] "detached from the Beltway". Rumsfeld begins the book by recounting his famous 1983 meeting with Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein. He recalls that Hussein said that the nation of France [...] "understood the Iraqi view". Rumsfeld writes, [...] "That particular remark came to my mind {{on more than one}} occasion and I never had cause to doubt it." [...] He states that Hussein came across as [...] "rather reasonable". However, he reports that Hussein repeated word for word a line Rumsfeld had used the day before in another meeting— leading Rumsfeld to conclude that he was bugged.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ratchet control}} {{button on the}} end of a fly-off {{handbrake}} is designed to work in the opposite way to what is normally accepted. If the lever is lifted or pulled back to the [...] "on" [...] position, on letting go it immediately releases unless the end button is pressed and held in place before letting go of the lever. Once set, the brake is released by lifting the handbrake lever (not pushing the button) in the setting direction (up or back). This mechanism was traditionally fitted to sports cars to facilitate a racing <b>get-away,</b> such as at traffic lights. It can also be used to help the back wheels to slide, without the worry of the ratchet leaving the brake on.|$|E
2500|$|The trip to Haiti, {{originally}} planned as a short <b>get-away,</b> inspired a second trip in May {{and laid the}} foundation for Kamys’ foray into microcinema and multimedia - culminating in the experimental documentary Stirring Water, its title derived from the Haitian proverb [...] "I stir water to make butter." [...] Despite a severe bout of dengue fever, contracted while shooting in Haiti, the effects of which debilitated Kamys for several months, Stirring Water was completed in late 2008. [...] It received its world premiere as a documentary finalist in March 2009 at the 11th annual Washington DC Independent Film Festival in a themed program created to explore the African Diaspora. [...] Shot in and around Port-au-Prince, Stirring Water employed elements of classic newsreel style documentation, silent era intertitling, and a soundscape of field recordings and original music.|$|E

Between 1947 and 1950, she worked under the pseudonym Carol Lane, Women's Travel Director, an advertising character she co-developed, based on her personal experience and for which Shell Oil was later granted a registered trademark. The role was later assumed by multiple women on behalf of Shell Oil Company. As Shell Oil Women's Travel Director, she toured the country speaking as a travel expert on a lecture circuit of women's groups, church groups and advertising clubs, as well as appearing on television and radio. Her areas of expertise included budgeting for weekend <b>get-aways</b> and entertain children on longer car trips. She also wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist penning Tips on Touring. In 1997, Ackerman became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization.

5000|$|Although still undiscovered by many {{travelers}} from larger countries, repeat {{tourists and}} an increasing amount of first time visitors make Ulcinj a hot spot for vacationers between the months of May and September. It is most famous for its sandy beaches, which are considered the most beautiful in Montenegro. The most valuable resource of the Ulcinj riviera is Velika plaža (Albanian: Plazha e Madhe, English: Long Beach), which is a 12 km long stretch of sandy beach and the longest beach on the Montenegrin coast. There is a small pebble beach called Ladies Beach which folk tradition holds to have qualities conducive to fertility. There is also a beach called Mala plaža (Albanian: Plazha e Vogël, English: Small Beach) which is much smaller in size, but {{is located in the}} centre of town and very popular with visitors. [...] "The Korzo", as it is called by locals, is a promenade which separates a street lined with coffee shops from Mala plaža. At night during the summer months, the Korzo is pedestrianised and families and young people gather. There are many more less known smaller beaches that serve as <b>get-aways</b> from the main tourist areas. Ulcinj has also a large number of religious buildings like mosques, tyrbes and churches, including: Pasha's Mosque, Sailors' Mosque and St. Nicholas' Church.|$|R
2500|$|The Hannibal Directive is an IDF order {{stating that}} abductions of Israeli {{soldiers}} must be prevented by all means, including shooting at or shelling a <b>get-away</b> car, thereby risking {{the lives of}} the captives. The Hannibal directive was invoked and this triggered an instant aerial surveillance and airstrikes inside Lebanon to limit Hezbollah's ability to move the soldiers it had seized. [...] "If we had found them, we would have hit them, even if it meant killing the soldiers," [...] a senior Israeli official said. Lt. Col. Ishai Efroni, deputy commander of the Baram Brigade, sent a Merkava Mark II tank, an armored personnel carrier and a helicopter in pursuit. Crossing into Lebanon, they headed down a dirt track lined with Lebanese border defenses. However, they veered onto a road near a known Hezbollah outpost along the border. The tank was destroyed by an IED with an estimated 200–300 kilograms of explosives, killing the crew of four. One soldier was killed and two were lightly wounded by mortar fire as they attempted to recover the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Sam Giancana {{joined the}} 42 Gang, a {{juvenile}} street crew answering to political boss Joseph Esposito. Giancana soon {{developed a reputation}} for being an excellent getaway driver, a high earner, and a vicious killer. After Esposito's murder, in which Giancana was allegedly involved, the 42 Gang was transformed into a de facto extension of the Chicago Outfit. [...] The Outfit was initially wary of the 42ers, thinking they were too wild. [...] However, Giancana's leadership qualities, {{the fact that he was}} an excellent [...] "wheel man" [...] with a <b>get-away</b> car, and his knack for making money on the street gained him the notice of Cosa Nostra higher-ups like Frank [...] "The Enforcer" [...] Nitti, Paul [...] "The Waiter" [...] Ricca, and Tony [...] "Joe Batters" [...] Accardo. He was arrested for the first time in 1925, for auto theft. He soon graduated to [...] "triggerman," [...] and by the age of 20 had been the prime subject in three murder investigations, but was never tried. In the late 1930s, Giancana became the first 42er to join the Outfit. From the early 1940s through the 1950s, he controlled most of the illegal gambling, illegal liquor distribution, and [...] numerous other political rackets in Louisiana through longtime friend H.A. (Hol) Killian. Killian controlled the mass majority of the liquor license issuance to those who sought one through his connections with longtime business associate Carlos Marcello from New Orleans. The trio's combined political influence reached all the way to the governor's mansion and to the White House. Killian was such close friends with Giancana that the latter considered Killian's three sons (David, Mike, and Ned) as his own.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Gravano's rise {{in status}} to consigliere, Gotti {{continued}} to use Gravano for the task of murder. In May 1988, Gravano and Robert Bisaccia, a New Jersey crime family soldier, murdered Francessco Oliverri for beating a Gambino family crew member to death. Bisaccia shot Oliverri to death while Gravano waited in a stolen <b>get-away</b> car. After Oliverri, John Gotti had finally got around to taking care of Wilfred [...] "Willie Boy" [...] Johnson. Johnson had been a childhood friend of Gotti's and a longtime crew member while Gotti was captain of the Bergin crew. However, at Gotti's RICO trial, Diane Giacalone, the head prosecutor, revealed that Johnson had been an informant for the FBI for years. Johnson refused to testify for the prosecution. In Underboss Gravano claims that Gotti met with Johnson during the trial and informed Johnson {{that as long as}} he never testified against Gotti, he and his family would not be harmed. Johnson would never be allowed to participate in mob matters again, however. Johnson asked Gotti to swear on his dead son, Frank Gotti, who had been killed in an accident years ago. Gotti swore. Now Gotti was having second thoughts. [...] "John discussed how it should go, using me to bounce off ideas about {{the best way to do}} it. That was my only involvement," [...] Gravano explained. Johnson was shot while walking to his car to go to work in front of his house in May 1988. In 1990, Gravano was involved in two murders, the first of which was Eddie Garofalo, a demolition contractor who made the mistake of running afoul of the Gambinos. On August 9, 1990, Garofalo was shot to death in front of his home as arranged by Gravano.|$|E
2500|$|Slim buys a {{house and}} changes her name to Erin Ann Shleeter. Although their future looks bright after a visit from Joe, Mitch's friend tracks them down, passing the {{information}} on to Mitch. Mitch comes to the area, and hides in Slim's house. As she is going about her morning routine, to her horror, Mitch suddenly appears from the shadows in her hallway, saying he wants Slim back, promising [...] "it will be different." [...] When she refuses, he attacks, waking Gracie, who runs to help her mother, and jerks on his hair. [...] Mitch flings Gracie to the floor, which creates a diversion, and allows an opportunity for Slim to retaliate with pepper spray. Snatching up Gracie, as Mitch rolls {{on the floor in}} pain, she is prepared for a fast <b>get-away,</b> having an escape plan. A car chase ensues between Slim and Robbie (Noah Wyle, revealed earlier as Mitch's [...] "wing man" [...] during the encounter at the diner years before) while Gracie screams in the background. Realizing she cannot live her life in fear, Slim goes into hiding in San Francisco, hires a woman who looks like her to keep her cover, and sends Gracie away to Hawaii with her best friend Ginny {{to get her out of}} harm's way. She prepares herself with a self-defense trainer (Bruce A. Young) who teaches her Krav Maga, since self-defense is not murder. During her training, he gives Slim the final lesson - if Mitch knocks her down, she is to hold on to his voice and awaken when he is about to attack or kick her. She returns to Los Angeles, breaks into Mitch's new home and waits for him there to return home from work, after hiding his guns and blocking the phone connections, so he cannot call the police. When he arrives, Slim makes her presence known once he realizes someone's there. She approaches him to begin fighting, but when he says he cannot hit her, she asks him why he could do it before when she was defenseless. She provokes him, and in the ensuing fight, Slim uses her new skills, beating Mitch until he becomes unconscious. After an opportunity to kill him with an object, she cannot bear to do it and throws the object away. She calls Ginny saying she cannot kill him, and while on the phone Mitch hits her from behind with a lamp. Slim puts into practice what she learned in her training and trips, beats and kicks him in the chest and sends him off a balcony to his death. She calls the police, who rule her actions as self-defense.|$|E
