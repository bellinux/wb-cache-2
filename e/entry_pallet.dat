50|$|The main {{advantage}} is that this enables both impulses to occur on or around the centre line, with disengaging friction in both directions. Because of this, the coaxial escapement should in theory perform effectively without lubrication.This mode of impulse is in theory superior to the lever escapement, which has engaging friction on the <b>entry</b> <b>pallet.</b> For long this was recognized as a disturbing influence on the isochronism of the balance.|$|E
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss lever type escapement, the lever is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor escapement. The lever is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape wheel. The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the <b>entry</b> <b>pallet,</b> while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method for the signature analysis of mechanical watch movements. Contrary {{to the existing}} method, it analyzes the time-frequency features of mechanical watch movement {{through a combination of}} reassigned scalogram and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). By mapping the signal into a 2 D domain of time and frequency, the reassigned scalogram reveals the frequency components of the shocks at different time. On the other hand, FEA gives the modal frequencies of the movements. By comparing the frequency components at different shocks to the modal frequencies of the movement, possible malfunctions of the movement can then be detected. A number of demonstration examples are included.

As the intensity of the shocks in the drop phase is the largest, the vibration of the escape wheel may cause vibration on the fourth wheel. The instantaneous sound frequencies correspond to the modal frequencies of the vibrating parts, including the balance wheel, the pallet fork, the escape wheel and the fourth wheel.
