40|$|International audienceNew {{applications}} of <b>expanded</b> <b>perlites</b> {{in the building}} industry as thermal and acoustical insulating material actually demand a better comprehension of the perlite expansion phenomenon. Smaller and mechanically more stable particles are demanded and therefore the classical industrial expansion process needs to be optimised. In this study the morphological and chemical aspects of the expansion process are examined by microscope observations and x-ray analyses. The comparison of the analyses and morphology of the raw, expanded and unexpanded material shows the chemical and structural differences of the unexpanded production sinks. It also shows the unisothermal character of the expansion process, which starts at the particle surface or at fractures in the grain. The industrial expansion process should take into account these facts {{to get a better}} yield of expanded particles...|$|R
40|$|Representative perlite bulk rock {{samples from}} two areas of Milos Island, Greece were {{collected}} {{and the expansion}} properties of their industrial product were investigated. Coarse crude perlite from Tsigrado exhibits better expansibility, which is assigned {{to the presence of}} coarser crystallites in its bulk parent rock. During thermal treatment, the finer crystallites of the coarse crude perlite from Trachilas are entrapped in the groundmass and lead to overheating, which inhibits expansion and eventually results in shrinkage. Geochemical modification of the <b>expanded</b> <b>perlites</b> relative to their crude precursors were investigated, using the isocon method. Volatilisation of crystalline water is the main factor controlling mass reduction of the <b>expanded</b> <b>perlites.</b> Other elements, during the adequate expansion of the Tsigrado perlite, can be classified into three categories. The elements that participate preferentially in crystals decrease in the expanded material at amounts higher than the total mass loss of the rock, due to their escape controlled mainly by the removal of the crystalline phases. The elements equally participating in crystals and the groundmass show losses equivalent to the total mass loss of the rocks, as they escaped in the crystalline phases and airborne particles from the groundmass during thermal treatment. Decrease of highly incompatible elements, which mostly participate in the groundmass, in the expanded products is less than the total mass loss, as they escaped mainly in the airborne particles. The inadequate expansion and burst of the Trachilas perlite did not allow for a similar categorisation, due to random and unpredictable escape of the elements. We propose the application of this method to an artificial system to predict unexpandable mineral phases in bulk perlite, as well as elements that are most likely to participate in the amorphous perlite phase, which cannot be determined from a regular industrial production line. This graphical method may also predict environmental pollution of the atmosphere from the release of volatile compounds and airborne particles during thermal treatment of perlite or other processes of mineral treatment...|$|R

40|$|Biofiltration is {{cost-effective}} for {{the treatment}} of gases containing low concentrations of volatile organic compounds (< 3 g m(- 3)). However, conventional biofilters, based on compost and bacterial activity, face problems with the elimination of hydrophobic compounds. Besides that, biofilter operational stability is often hampered by acidification and drying out of the filter bed. To overcome these problems, biofilters with fungi on inert packing material have been developed. Fungi are more resistant to acid and dry conditions than bacteria, and it is hypothesised that the aerial mycelia of fungi, which are in direct contact with the gas, can take up hydrophobic compounds faster than flat aqueous bacterial biofilm surfaces. Alpha-pinene was chosen as a model compound. It is an odorous compound emitted by the wood processing industry. In 21 biofilter columns four different packing materials were tested: <b>perlite,</b> <b>expanded</b> clay granules, polyurethane foam cubes and compost. The filters were inoculated with forest soil and ventilated with gas containing alpha-pinene. Start up took 1 - 2 months and removal efficiencies of more than 90 % were observed, but mostly ranged from 50 % to 90 % due to overloading. In the filters containing perlite, clay, polyurethane and compost volumetric removal capacities of, respectively, 24, 33, 38 and 24 g alpha-pinene m(- 3) filter bed h(- 1) were attained and the gas pressure drops in the 60 cm high filter beds measured at a superficial gas velocity of 35 m h(- 1) were 70, 550, 180 and 250 Pa. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} develop biofilters based on the action of fungi with higher elimination capacities for alpha-pinene as reported in literature for bacterial biofilters. The use of polyurethane foam cubes is preferred because of the low gas pressure drop in combination with a high volumetric elimination capacity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
