40|$|The {{following}} {{species have}} been reported from the Netherlands’ Antilles: Margarodes formicarum Guilding, collected in 1884 or 1885 by Prof. W. F. R. Suringar in Curaçao; specimens in the State Museum of Natural History at Leiden. Protortonia cacti (Linn.), collected in 1756 by Daniel Rolander in St. Eustatius, and described by Linnaeus (1758) and de Geer (1776). Protortonia crotonis n. sp. from Bonaire. Icerya purchasi Maskell from Curaçao. Orthezia praelonga Douglas, common in Curaçao and Aruba. O. insignis Browne is in our collection only represented from St. Eustatius. Coccus sp. (not C. agavis Towns. & Ckll.) from Agave in Curaçao and St. Martin. Suissetia oleae (Bern.) from Curaçao and St. Eustatius. Saissetia coffeae (Walker), syn. S. hemisphaerica (Targ. Tozz.) from Curaçao and Aruba. Ceroplastes caesalpiniae n. sp. from <b>dividivi</b> (Caesalpinia coriaria) in Curaçao. This Ceroplastes is already mentioned by VERSLUYS (1907) as a pest of <b>dividivi,</b> {{but it seems that}} the species has not yet been described. Ceroplastes magnicauda n. sp. from Curaçao; not identifiable from available literature. Pulvinaria urbicola Ckll. from Curaçao and St. Martin. Pulvinaria sp. from Aruba; resembles P. mammeae Maskell, but different. Coccus sp. from Thespesia populnea (Malvaceae) in Aruba; material too scanty for identification or description. Dysmicoccus brevipes (Ckll.) from Bonaire. Ferrisiana virgata (Ckll.) and Phenacoccus solani Ferris from Curaçao. Antonina graminis Maskell on the rootcollar of Fimbristylus spathacea (Cyperaceae) in Curaçao. Eriococcus curassavicus n. sp. is probably identical with or closely allied to E. tucurincae Laing from Colombia; all female and male stages of the Curaçao-species are described. Asterolecanium pustulans Ckll. from Curaçao. Conchaspis angraeci Ckll. has been collected in Curaçao by G. E. Bodkin. Aspidiotus destructor Sign, from Bonaire. Acutaspis scutiformis (Ckll.), Aonidiella orientalis (Newst.), and Lepidosaphes alba Ckll. frcm Aruba. Unaspis citri (Comstock), Lepidosaphes beckii (Newman), and L. gloverii (Packard) are common on Citrus in Curaçao. Diaspis echinocacti (Bouché) from Opuntia in Curaçao. Pseudaulacaspis peutagona (Targ. Tozz.) from Aruba and St. Eustatius. Hemiberlesia diffinis Newst. was found on dividi in Curaçao, Pinnaspis strachani (Cooley); label not legible, but certainly from the Dutch Antilles; this species is already reported by VAN HALL (1905) from Curaçao. The 4 new species, Eriococcus curassavicus, Protortonia crotonis, Ceroplastes caesalpiniae, and C. magnicauda are described above. An aphid from Bonaire was identified by Mr. D. Hille Ris Lambers as Aphis nerii Fonsc., and an aleyrodid from Curaçao by Miss Louise M. Russell as Aleurotrachelus trachoides (Back) ...|$|E

Further {{he found in}} Curacao and Surinam Mytilaspis citricola; its present name is Lepidosaphes beckii (Newman, 1869). Lepidosaphes gloverii (Packard, 1869) and Pinnaspis buxi (Bouche, 1851) are also mentioned. Chionaspis minor was found on cotton, Ricinus, and oleander, but not on Citrus. Chionaspis minor Maskell, 1884, often reported from tropical Amer-ica, is a misidentification of Pinnaspis strachani (Cooley, 1899), a polypha-gous insect, known from the West Indies, the Bahamas, Florida and Mexico. All the above mentioned insects are common in the West Indies. For microscopical details of these insects see Ferris ' Atlas, vol. I—IV (Pinnaspis strachani was erroneously described by Ferris as Pinnaspis temporaria n. sp.; see Ferris & Rao, 1947). Versluys (1907) mentions a Ceroplastes sp. from Curacao which is in-jurious to <b>dividivi</b> (Caesalpinia coriaria Willd.) It forms yellowish white rings of a waxy substance around the young twigs. Small animals, with a watery red body-fluid, were observed in this waxy substance, separated at a regular distance from each other. In the beginning of September young specimens were found which had already secreted a small quantity of wax. The inhabi-To the Netherlands ' Antilles belong the islands of Curacao, Aruba, and Bonaire, near the coast of Venezuela, further among the Lesser Antilles Saba, St. Eustatius, and half of St. Martin (the other half is French territory). As far as I know, only twice a note has been published on the scale insects of these islands. Dr. C. J. J. van Hall, who was appointed in 1903 to In-spector of Agriculture in the Dutch West Indies, published a short bulletin on scale insects damaging orange trees in 1905. Dr. H. J. Veth wrote a short article on Rhynchota in the "Encyclopaedic van Nederlandsch West-Indie"...|$|E
