40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we have {{investigated}} the accelerated ageing of seven different thin-film module types {{through the use of}} sequential damp heat (85 oC/ 85 % RH) or damp heat tests with additional stress factors such as applied voltage or ultraviolet light. The module types [a-Si, tandem a-Si/a-Si micro-morph a-Si/µ-Si, triple junction a-Si, CIS (x 2) and CdTe] were selected to cover a range of thin-film devices, materials and construction types. Sequential damp heat tests for cumulative exposure times of 250, 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 h have been achieved to <b>date,</b> with the <b>modules</b> subjected to visual inspection, electrical insulation measurements and electrical performance measurements (IV curves). A wide range of performance losses (Pmax), from practically zero to - 88 %, were evident for the different technologies. The damp heat tests with applied voltage provoked very fast (< 500 h) degradation of some modules, with the critical factor being the use of glass in the module construction rather than the semi-conductor type of thin-film technology. Initial exposure, up to 500 h, to a combined ultraviolet light and damp heat test has yet to provoke any significant damage. Sequential damp heat exposure tests can be used to induce accelerated aging on thin-film modules. However, {{it is not possible to}} equate loss of power to a number of years of outdoor exposure due to the lack of knowledge of the acceleration factors for each PV module type. JRC. DG.

40|$|Objective: Use {{of generic}} versus {{specific}} tools in psychological assessment is a controversial issue. Generic instruments {{can be used}} to measure QOL for numerous chronic illnesses; however, they may not be sensitive to particular aspects of the disease. Unfortunately, disease-specific measures cannot be used to compare results across diseases or conditions. The QLSI-C is an assessment tool that uses a modular approach developed to overcome these shortcomings. QLSI-C was devised as a generic scale to be integrated with disease specific modules. The {{purpose of this study is}} to report on reliability and validity of the QLSI-C generic scale and the cystic fibrosis (CF) -specific module. Methods: QLSI-C was administered to 20 children with CF and 20 healthy children (ages 8 - 12 years) in Belgium. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s coefficient. Validity of the QLSI-C was measured using the known-groups method, i. e., analysis of variance (ANOVA) to distinguish between healthy children and children with CF. To examine the validity of the QLSI-C, correlations were calculated between the generic scale and CF-specific module. Results: Internal consistency for the QLSI-C generic scale with the CF-specific module was good (=. 82). ANOVA results revealed a significant difference between CF and healthy children for the QOL score (p=. 005), with higher average scores (i. e., lower QoL) for CF children (M= 4. 35) than healthy children (M= 1. 25). Correlations between QoL scores on the generic scale and CF-specific module demonstrated medium effect size (r= 0. 47; p=. 04). Conclusions: To <b>date,</b> three specific <b>modules</b> are available for the QLSI-C: (1) cancer; (2) asthma; (3) cystic fibrosis. Originality of this tool is strengthened by use of e-Health technologies (i. e., iPad app for administering the QLSI-C). Satisfactory psychometric properties and state-of-the-art use of technology suggests that the QLSI-C has potential utility for use in clinical trials, research, and clinical practice.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} an {{automatic}} recognition system for CENPARMI off-line Arabic handwritten dates collected from Arabic Nationalities. This system consists of modules that segment and recognize an Arabic handwritten date image. First, in the segmentation module, the system explicitly segments a date image into {{a sequence of}} basic constituents or segments. As {{a part of this}} module, a special sub-module was developed to over-segment any constituent that is a candidate for a touching pair. The proposed touching pair segmentation submodule has been tested on three different datasets of handwritten numeral touching pairs: The CENPARMI Arabic [6], Urdu, and Dari [24] datasets. The final recognition rates of 92. 22 %, 90. 43 %, and 86. 10 % were achieved for Arabic, Urdu and Dari, respectively. Afterwards, the segments are preprocessed and sent to the classification module. In this stage, feature vectors are extracted and then recognized by an isolated numeral classifier. This recognition system has been tested in five different isolated numeral databases: The CENPARMI Arabic [6], Urdu, Dari [24], Farsi, and Pashto databases with overall recognition rates of 97. 29 % 97. 75 %, 97. 75 %, 97. 95 % and 98. 36 %, respectively. Finally, a <b>date</b> post processing <b>module</b> is developed to improve the recognition results. This post processing module is used in two different stages.

40|$|Early {{detection}} of software defects {{is very important}} to decrease the software cost and subsequently increase the software quality. Success of software industries not only depends on gaining knowledge about software defects, but largely reflects from the manner in which information about defect is collected and used. In software industries, individuals at different levels from customers to engineers apply diverse mechanisms to detect the allocation of defects to a particular class. Categorizing bugs based on their characteristics helps the Software Development team take appropriate actions to reduce similar defects that might get reported in future releases. Classification, if performed manually, will consume more time and effort. Human resource having expert testing skills & domain knowledge will be required for labeling the data. Therefore, the need of automatic classification of software defect is high. This work attempts to categorize defects by proposing an algorithm called Software Defect CLustering (SDCL). It aims at mining the existing online bug repositories like Eclipse, Bugzilla and JIRA for analyzing the defect description and its categorization. The proposed algorithm is designed by using text clustering and works with three major modules to find out the class to which the defect should be assigned. Software bug repositories hold software defect data with attributes like defect description, status, defect open and close <b>date.</b> Defect extraction <b>module</b> extracts the defect description from various bug repositories and converts it into unified format for further processing. Unnecessary and irrelevant texts are removed from defect data using data preprocessing module. Finally grouping of defect data into clusters of similar defect is done using clustering technique.

40|$|DoktorgradsavhandlingThermoelectric Generators (TEG) are a {{potential}} technology for waste heat recovery. At their hearts, thermoelectric materials convert a heat flux into electric current. By placing TEGs {{on the surface}} of a waste heat source, some of the heat can be converted into valuable electric energy. However, todays state-of-the art materials have low efficiencies, are limited to low temperature operation, contains toxic and rare elements and are in general not cost-effective for such applications. New thermoelectric materials are needed that can overcome these barriers. In this thesis, two classes of materials have been investigated; skutterudites and silicides. Both have relatively high efficiencies, can be used at high temperatures (400 - 500 °C) and contain cheaper and less toxic compounds than state-of-the-art materials. To move these materials from lab-scale testing into real-life applications, the focus is shifted from optimizing for thermoelectric efficiency to long-term stability. As these materials will be used at higher temperatures, different temperature activated processes leading to degradation of the materials needs to be accounted for and controlled, such as oxidation and interdiffusion. Adoption into industrial mass production requires simple and cheap synthesis methods that produces homogenous materials. Homogenous materials are very important for achieving stable thermoelectric and mechanical properties over time. Secondary phases can easily form during synthesis of skutterudites, and knowledge about the formation and annihilation of such phases during synthesis was therefore studied thoroughly as these can have unbeneficial effect on both thermoelectric properties and thermal durability. Understanding the mechanisms and kinetics governing skutterudite formation is of great importance for optimizing synthesis parameters leading to faster and more homogenous production of skutterudites. P-type skutterudites with composition Fi 0. 6 Co 2 Fe 2 Sb 12 (Fi = In, Ca, Ce and Yb) were synthesized to look at the effect of filler element and microstructure. Ce-filled sample was furthermore synthesized using four different methods to assess the effect of synthesis method on secondary phase formation and thermoelectric properties. A precursor method was found to not only be the fastest method, but also produce the most homogenous material with highest zT of 0. 7. An important contribution of this thesis is the results and discussion around peritectic formation and transformation in the skutterudite system. In addition to grain size, the diffusivity of the filler element in skutterudite was found to be the main factor governing transformation time into phase pure skutterudite. High temperature oxidation of skutterudites as a function of filler atoms and iron content were furthermore investigated. Residual secondary phases resulting from incomplete transformation into the phase pure skutterudite, such as FeSb 2 and CeSb 2, were found to have severe effects on the oxidation rate. High iron content was also found to lower the onset temperature of oxidation in accordance with previous studies. In addition, the effect of In as a filler element was found to form an intermediate InSb layer that actually caused a reduction in oxidation rate. Also the high temperature oxidation of Mg 2 (Si-Sn) was studied {{as a function of the}} Sn content. All these materials formed a passivating outer layer of MgO. Above a certain ignition temperature, the MgO layer broke down and the oxidation proceeded exponentially. An increasing Sn content was found to significantly lower the ignition temperature due to formation of liquid Sn below the MgO layer. Similarly, the Pilling-Bedworth ratio (ratio of volume of oxide to volume of underlying alloy) was found to affect the ignition temperature. In both these oxidation studies, the common theme is that variations in elemental composition affect the resistance towards oxidation significantly. Clearly, these materials need to be optimized not only in terms of thermoelectric performance, but also stability towards oxidation. First of all, oxidizing resistant materials can be employed in application without the need of protective environments such as coatings or encapsulations. Secondly, control of the oxidation mechanisms is import in a mass production process both to ease the production process and to avoid accumulation of oxides in the final material. An alternative to oxidation resistant materials is the application of coatings on the outer surfaces. Several commercially available coatings were tested on both skutterudite and silicide. An aluminum-based coating was found most promising and could protect both material classes from oxidation during thermal cycling up to temperatures of 500 - 550 °C. It is believed that further optimization of this type of coating has a good future for use in protection of thermoelectric materials at high temperatures. To assess how different thermally activated degradation process affect the performance of thermoelectric materials and modules, long term testing of both single functionalized legs and prototype modules were conducted. A new test method was developed, where several single legs were electrically characterized separately throughout thermal cycling. This made it possible to compare different types of coatings with uncoated material, thereby identify the effect of the degradation processes upon performance. Both diffusion of metal contact into thermoelectric leg, oxidation in from sides, and crack formation, were found to significantly affect the performance of the legs over time, by reducing open circuit voltage and increasing inner resistance. Finally, several silicide based modules were assembled and tested. The n-type and p-type material was Mg 2 (Si-Sn) and MnSi 1. 75 respectively. The highest power of 3 W was measured for one of these modules at hot side temperatures of 700 °C and an estimated efficiency of 5. 3 % – the highest efficiency recorded to <b>date</b> for <b>modules</b> made purely of silicides. However, long term testing of one of these modules revealed gradual reduction in performance. Post-characterization showed how particularly oxidation and interdiffusion between thermoelectric leg and metal contact played a major role in the decline in power output...|$|R
