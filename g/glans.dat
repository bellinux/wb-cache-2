5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the <b>glans</b> and covers the <b>glans</b> when the penis is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the penis as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the <b>glans,</b> and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the <b>glans.</b>|$|E
5|$|Type II (excision) is the {{complete}} or partial {{removal of the}} inner labia, with or without removal of the clitoral <b>glans</b> and outer labia. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral <b>glans</b> and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral <b>glans,</b> inner and outer labia. Excision in French can refer to any form of FGM.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the <b>glans</b> penis, the clitoral <b>glans</b> lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and is thus differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the <b>glans</b> and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the <b>glans</b> protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the <b>glans.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{a complex}} structure, containing external and internal components. It consists of the <b>glans</b> (including the frenulum of clitoris, which is a frenulum on the under-surface of the <b>glans</b> and is created by the two medial parts of the labia minora), the clitoral body (which is composed of two erectile bodies known as the corpora cavernosa), two clitoral crura, the clitoral hood (formed by the labia minora) and the vestibular or clitoral bulbs. The clitoral body is {{commonly referred to as}} the shaft (or internal shaft), while the length of the clitoris between the <b>glans</b> and the body may also be referred to as the shaft (or external shaft) because, like the shaft as a whole, it supports the <b>glans,</b> and its shape can be seen and felt through the clitoral hood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>glans</b> penis is rounded, short, {{and small}} and is superficially divided into {{left and right}} halves by a trough {{at the top and}} a ridge at the bottom. Most of the <b>glans</b> is covered with penile spines, except for an area near the tip.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Glan</b> is a {{river in}} southwestern Germany, right {{tributary}} of the Nahe River. It is approximately 68 km long. It rises in the Saarland, northwest of Homburg. It flows generally north, through Rhineland-Palatinate, and empties into the Nahe in Odernheim am <b>Glan,</b> near Bad Sobernheim. Other towns along the <b>Glan</b> are Altenglan, Glan-Münchweiler, Lauterecken and Meisenheim.|$|R
50|$|The Lauter is a {{tributary}} to the <b>Glan.</b> It flows about 33 km north-northwest from Kaiserslautern, through Hirschhorn, Wolfstein {{and on to}} Lauterecken {{where it}} meets the <b>Glan.</b>|$|R

5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its <b>glans</b> or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human penis (for its <b>glans</b> or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the <b>glans</b> or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral <b>glans,</b> or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|Highly innervated, the <b>glans</b> {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the <b>glans</b> is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the <b>glans</b> penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and <b>glans,</b> and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the <b>glans,</b> {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need for surgery including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Glan</b> Valley Railway (Glantalbahn) is a non-electrified line {{along the}} <b>Glan</b> river, in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It {{consists}} of the Glan-Münchweiler-Altenglan section, which was built {{as part of the}} Landstuhl-Kusel railway and sections that were built later for military reasons: Homburg-Glan-Münchweiler, Altenglan-Staudernheim and Odernheim-Bad Münster am Stein. The line had strategic importance, otherwise traffic was rather low, except on the <b>Glan</b> Munchweiler-Altenglan section.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glan</b> {{became a}} session drummer, {{playing on the}} first and second solo albums of Steppenwolf’s John Kay. In 1974, <b>Glan</b> began touring with Lou Reed, playing on two live albums and one studio album. In 1975 <b>Glan</b> joined Alice Cooper for the {{recording}} of his first solo album Welcome To My Nightmare and subsequent tour, and later appeared on the live album The Alice Cooper Show. <b>Glan</b> toured with Alice Cooper from 1975 to 1979 during the Madhouse Tour, supporting Cooper’s From the Inside album. He also appeared in the movie The Rose as the drummer of The Rose Band.|$|R
50|$|Rutsweiler am <b>Glan</b> {{is among}} the Middle <b>Glan</b> Valley’s oldest villages. Before and during Roman times, the area was settled by Celts. After the Romans withdrew, Frankish {{settlers}} came thrusting into the land.|$|R
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– <b>glans,</b> hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the <b>glans</b> and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, such as when in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} <b>glans</b> doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the <b>glans</b> from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the <b>glans</b> becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the female}} closely resembles that of the male; the clitoris is shaped and positioned like a penis, and is capable of erection. The female also possesses no external vagina (vaginal opening), as the labia are fused to form a pseudo-scrotum. The pseudo-penis is traversed to its tip by a central urogenital canal, through which the female urinates, copulates and gives birth. The pseudo-penis can be distinguished from the males' genitalia by its greater thickness and more rounded <b>glans.</b> In both males and females, {{the base of the}} <b>glans</b> is covered with penile spines. The formation of the pseudo-penis appears largely androgen independent, as the pseudo-penis appears in the female fetus before differentiation of the fetal ovary and adrenal gland. After parturition, the pseudo-penis is stretched, and loses many of its original aspects; it becomes a slack-walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips.|$|E
50|$|Two civil parishes: Llaneilian yn Rhos and Llansanffraid <b>Glan</b> Conway were {{administered}} {{as part of}} Conwy Rural District in the neighbouring county of Caernarfonshire. This area was sometimes called <b>Glan</b> Conway Rural District.|$|R

5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the <b>glans</b> penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are responsive to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|In clitoridectomy, the {{clitoris}} may {{be removed}} {{as part of}} a radical vulvectomy to treat cancer such as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia; however, modern treatments favor more conservative approaches, as invasive surgery can have psychosexual consequences. Clitoridectomy more often involves parts of the clitoris being partially or completely removed during FGM, which may be additionally known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). Removing the <b>glans</b> of the clitoris {{does not mean that the}} whole structure is lost, since the clitoris reaches deep into the genitals.|$|E
5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat (Mormopterus eleryi), {{previously}} {{known as}} the hairy-rostrum or hairy-nosed freetail bat, is a small insectivorous bat {{that is the only}} member of the molossid sub-genus Setirostris. The bristle-faced free-tailed bat differs from all other bats in the Family Molossidae by possessing unique dentition, a distinctive echolocation call, diagnostic genital and <b>glans</b> penis morphology and small body size. It is readily distinguished from other Mormopterus species by the presence of characteristic stout bristles on the muzzle and face.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the <b>glans</b> and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different {{versions of the same}} structure).|$|E
5|$|However, records {{do exist}} that refer to {{practices}} of nipple and genital piercing in various cultures {{prior to the}} 20th century. Kama Sutra, dated to the Gupta Empire of Ancient India, describes genital piercing to permit sexual enhancement by inserting pins and other objects into the foreskin of the penis. The Dayak tribesmen of Borneo passed a shard of bone through their <b>glans</b> for the opposite reason, to diminish their sexual activity. In the Talmud (Tractate Shabbat 64a), there may be mention of a genital piercing in the probition against the kumaz, which medieval French Talmudic commenter Rashi interpreted as a chastity piercing for women. Other interpreters have, however, suggested that the kumaz was rather a pendant shaped like a vulva or a girdle.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped <b>glans</b> penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
