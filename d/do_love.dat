500|$|Lee {{stated the}} song was {{inspired}} by and talked about her relationship with the band's fans, and the realization that following a music career [...] "is what I'm supposed to do".

[...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E

Margaret Eagar thought the child's eyes were the saddest she had ever seen. [...] "Looking at her I used to wonder what those wide grey-blue eyes saw, to bring such a look of sadness to the childish face," [...] she wrote. Eagar wondered if Elisabeth had a premonition of her own death because she often told her cousin Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia that [...] "I shall never see this again."

Pinfold refuses, declaring Angel to be a menace that must be exposed. Back in England, Mrs Pinfold convinces him that Angel had never left the country and the voices are imaginary. Pinfold hears Margaret faintly say,"I don't exist, but I <b>do</b> <b>love</b> you", before the voices disappear forever. Pinfold's doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral.

500|$|After her divorce, Victoria went to {{live with}} her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera. She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth, who spent six months of each year with each parent. Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a {{difficult}} time reconnecting with her daughter. Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa, crying, before one visit to her mother. Ernst assured the child that her mother loved her too. Elisabeth responded, [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you <b>do</b> <b>love</b> me." [...] Ernst remained silent and didn't correct the child's impression. Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge. The doctor advised the Tsar's family to notify the child's mother of her illness, but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram. Victoria received the final telegram notifying her of the child's death just as she was preparing to travel to Poland to be at her bedside. At Elisabeth's funeral, Victoria removed her Hessian Order, a medallion, and placed it on her daughter's coffin as a final gesture [...] "that she had made a final break with her old home." ...|$|E
500|$|Titanic {{suffered}} backlash {{in addition}} to its success. In 2003, the film topped a poll of [...] "Best Film Endings", and yet it also topped a poll by Film 2003 as [...] "the worst movie of all time". The British film magazine Empire reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings. In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film. Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. [...] "What really irks me...," [...] he said, [...] "are those who make nasty stabs at those who <b>do</b> <b>love</b> it." [...] Willcock stated, [...] "I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike Titanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy." ...|$|E
500|$|From late 1910 {{to early}} 1912, Cerna {{was at the}} University of Leipzig, where he {{attended}} courses held by the philosophers and psychologists Wilhelm Wundt, Eduard Spranger and Hans Volkelt. Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of [...] "decrepit" [...] Orthodox members of the Romanian Jewish community, adding: [...] "But I <b>do</b> <b>love</b> this decrepit exterior beyond measure..." [...] Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his PhD thesis of 1913, Die Gedankenlyrik (German for [...] "Contemplative Poetry"). According to Călinescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of [...] "natural ideas" [...] over reasoning, and concluded that [...] "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul." [...] Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding ("An idea is a damned thing {{when it comes to}} poetry"). Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the Romanian Academy's Vasile Adamachi Award. Some of his new poems were still being published by Convorbiri Literare in 1911.|$|E

500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show."

We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped us find the witches. In some ways, it feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Yeah, I never worried about that, to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People forget how truly dark and twisted those stories are. [...] talks about a witch burning alive in an oven, screaming and scratching." [...] Ulrich Zeidler's concept art for some of the witches was released on the Internet.|$|E

[...] "You shouldn't necessarily like Emma," [...] Beckinsale has {{said of her}} character. [...] "You <b>do</b> <b>love</b> her, but {{in the way the}} family of a teenage girl could be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her." [...] The programme was aired in autumn 1996, just months after Gwyneth Paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of the same story. Caryn James of The New York Times felt that while [...] "Ms.Beckinsale's Emma is plainer looking than Ms.Paltrow's," [...] she is [...] "altogether more believable and funnier." [...] Jonathan Brown of The Independent has described Beckinsale's interpretation as [...] "the most enduring modern performance" [...] as Emma. In 1997, Beckinsale appeared opposite Stuart Townsend in the comedy Shooting Fish, one of the most commercially successful British films of that year. [...] "I'd just had my wisdom teeth out," [...] Beckinsale later recalled of the initial audition. [...] "I was also on very strong painkillers, so it was not the most conventional of meetings." [...] Elley wrote of [...] "an incredibly laid-back performance" [...] while Thomas felt she [...] "just glows as an aristocrat facing disaster with considerable aplomb." [...] She narrated Austen's Emma for Hodder & Stoughton AudioBooks and Diana Hendry's The Proposal for BBC Radio 4.

In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse.
