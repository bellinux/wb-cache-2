The catenaccio system was invented by an Austrian coach named Karl Rappan. Rappan's original system was implemented with four fixed defenders playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a playmaker {{in the middle of the}} field who would the ball together with two midfield wings. Herrera would sometimes modify the formation by adding a fifth defenders, the sweeper or libero behind the two centre backs; the sweeper would act as the free man and deal with any attackers who penetrated the two centre backs' line.|$|E
