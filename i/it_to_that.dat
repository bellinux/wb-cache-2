25|$|The {{top three}} leagues in Europe {{are allowed to}} enter four teams into the Champions League. Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had {{proposed}} taking one place from the top three leagues and allocating <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting. In the same meeting, however, {{it was agreed that}} the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe.

25|$|One evening late in 1919, {{after moving}} to Michigan, Smith was baby-sitting (presumably for Roderick) while his wife {{attended}} a movie; he resumed work on The Skylark of Space, finishing it {{in the spring of}} 1920. He submitted it to many book publishers and magazines, spending more in postage than he would eventually receive for its publication. Bob Davis, editor of Argosy, sent an encouraging rejection letter in 1922, saying that he liked the novel personally, but that it was too far out for his readers. (According to , but no other source, Smith began work on the sequel, Skylark III, before the first book was accepted.) Finally, upon seeing the April 1927 issue of Amazing Stories, he submitted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> magazine; it was accepted, initially for $75, later raised to $125. It was published as a three-part serial in the August to October 1928 issues and it was such a success that managing editor Sloane requested a sequel before the second installment had been published.|$|E

Leaving Hong Kong, the Grants visited Canton, Shanghai, and Peking, China, where he criticized the autocratic {{attitude}} of Westerners living in China toward the Chinese, comparing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of former slave owners toward freedmen striving for independence. He declined {{to ask for}} an interview with the Guangxu Emperor, but did speak with the head of government, Prince Gong, and Li Hongzhang, a leading general. They discussed China's dispute with Japan over the Ryukyu Islands, and Grant agreed to serve as a mediator saying “any course short of national humiliation or national destruction is better than war.”. After crossing over to Japan on Richmond and meeting the Emperor Meiji, Grant, keeping his word, tried to convince Japan to make peace with the Chinese suggesting the formation of a joint commission to settle the disputed territory. Although the commission never materialized, Grant's on spot diplomacy diffused the situation. Grant became the first ex-president to engage in personal diplomacy abroad. Japan having the superior military, annexed the disputed islands a few weeks after Grant left the country.|$|E

500|$|Negative {{reaction}} to the game focused on its length and gameplay. 1UP.com and UGO both considered it short; Shawn Elliott of 1UP.com described it as [...] "a lickety-split run through postcard-pretty tide pools, up cliffs, and into a church turned Combine outpost". UGO's Nigel Grammer stated that Lost Coasts gameplay seemed to be secondary to the level's graphics. Lost Coasts gameplay disappointed Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot, who compared <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Half-Life 2 and considered them to be very similar, saying that it [...] "isn't going to set the world on fire".|$|E

Casamassina agreed that the [...] "Sonic Team {{has done a lot}} with [...] ", and praised the varying missions and levels' aesthetic contrast. However, he criticized the placement of obstacles. Fahey denounced levels' [...] "avoidable blind spots and leaps of faith", and found the number of stages and their re-use over multiple missions [...] "a little bit disconcerting".

Dick in 1956) to be synonymous. Halling also reexamined Frost's type specimen of B.salmonicolor, and considered the taxon better placed in Suillus because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and ring; he formally transferred <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> genus, resulting in the combination Suillus salmonicolor.
