40|$|A typical {{collection}} system may include many gravity mains connected by pump stations pushing flow into a complex network of pressurized conduits or forcemains (ASCE, 1982). The EPA standard SWMM 5 engine solves this complex case, {{but it can}} be very expensive and time consuming. In most forcemain networks, the solution time improves significantly by separating or “decoupling ” the gravity network from the force main network. Decoupling can improve computational speed three to five times. Larger networks have much larger increases in solution time speed for the decoupled network, up to twenty times faster. Results for the decoupled model may differ from the original model. In particular, wet-well levels in the gravity network influence the pump operations for the forcemain network. Ignoring the storage available in gravity conduits can lead to oversized pump designs, because the overall storage volume is much larger than the volume available in the wet-well alone. This chapter develops a rigorous dynamic conduit storage synthesizer approach that estimates the conduit volume available for storage and applies it to the wet-well <b>depth-area</b> <b>curve</b> to reduce the impact of decoupling the model on pumping simulations. We discuss the new method and apply it to a decoupled system with and without synthesized storage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Determining Depth-Area-Duration (DAD) curves in {{drainage}} basins {{is one of}} {{the applied}} researches in hydrology. DAD curves exhibit the depth and the area covered by the rainfall with a particular duration. DAD analysis is widely used in characterization of precipitation extremes for specification of so-called design storms. In this study the DAD curves for the Kurdistan province were prepared and investigated. To obtain the rainfall rate for different parts of the region for time durations of 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours, the daily rainfall data from the stations of the Ministry of Energy were studied first and the rainfall data for durations of one to four days were extracted afterward. 19 storms were then selected for the four time durations according to the rule of extensive rainfalls. The rainfall data from the interior meteorology stations and from some of the stations of the neighborhood provinces at the same occurrence time of the last storms were extracted and recorded according to their termination time. In order to determine the average of maximum rainfall depths for different durations for each storm, calculations were performed using isohyetal maps which were prepared by ‘Moving Average ’ method. The initial DAD curves were then prepared using those calculations. Since the maximum rainfall is needed, the initial DAD curves for each duration were combined to obtain a final DAD curve, which is basically the envelope <b>depth-area</b> <b>curve</b> for the corresponding duration. This procedure was performed for all four time durations and ultimately four final DAD curves, one per each time duration, were produced. Key words: Rainfall • Depth-Area-Duration curves • Isohyetal map • Kurdistan provinc...|$|E
40|$|A limnological {{and fish}} survey program was {{developed}} on 112 lakes and reservoirs of Argentina during the summers of 1984 to 1987. Bathymetric surveys with a SIMRAD Skipper 411 model echosounder and line and lead {{were conducted on}} more than 40 lakes. This report presents bathymetric maps for seventeen lakes and reservoirs situated in Patagonian Andes Region and Patagonian Plateau betweem 38 ° 53 'S and 45 ° 30 'S. The bathymetric maps for two reservoirs were made from topographic maps before impoundment. Hypsographic and <b>depth-area</b> <b>curves,</b> and some morphometric parameters are presented for twenty one Patagonian lakes. Mean depth ranged from 2. 0 to 111 m. The deepest lakes are situated in Patagonian Andes Region. Colhue Huapi Lake on Patagonian Plateau, is very shallow, having a mean depth of 2. 0 m and being 810 km. in surface area...|$|R
40|$|Depth-area relationships, such {{as those}} {{published}} by the National Weather Service in TP 40 and the NOAA Atlas 2, enable conversion of point rainfall depths to areal average depths for the same storm duration and recurrence interval. This problem of conversion is most germane to hydrologic analyses for moderate to large drainage basins, where point rainfall depths are not representative of the spatial distribution of a storm event. Historically, depth-area relationships have been developed {{on the basis of}} data from dense networks of recording gauges. However, with the ongoing accumulation of radar-rainfall records, radar-rainfall data represent an alternative to gauging data. This paper summarizes what {{is believed to be the}} first study made under the auspices of the National Weather Service (NWS) for evaluation of the potential of NEXRAD radar-rainfall data for development of geographically fixed depth-area relationships. Objectives were to evaluate the use of radar-rainfall data for development of depth-area relationships and to identify potential obstacles that might hinder use of such data. Data analyzed for this study are those recorded for the Arkansas-Red Basin River Forecast Center (ABRFC), and span the period of time from May 1993, to September 2000. Conclusions of this study are that data heterogeneities and shortness of data records are major factors limiting development of depth-area relationships on the basis of radar-rainfall data. Possible biases in radar estimates of extreme rainfall are also of concern. <b>Depth-area</b> <b>curves</b> developed for the ABRFC, presented herein, are reasonably consistent with those presented in NWS publications but should only be considered as preliminary...|$|R
