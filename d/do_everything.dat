When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
5|$|Skelton {{believed}} that his life's work {{was to make}} people laugh; {{he wanted to be}} known as a clown because he defined it as being able to <b>do</b> <b>everything.</b> He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.|$|E

5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> with his left hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can <b>do</b> <b>everything.</b> It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority {{and trying to keep}} it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> possible to improve their own lot.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Roswell {{also did}} theater. In 1986 she {{appeared}} in improvisatory shows directed by Paul Sills at Lamb's Theatre, in which the actors were given characters and situations by the audience members. In 1988 she {{had a role in}} Julia Sweeney's play Mea's Big Apology at Groundling Theatre in Los Angeles. She played Eunice, a cynical woman who works at a malpractice insurance company and is a colleague to the main character. The company people <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> they can to dismiss her because {{they do not want to}} pay her retirement benefits, which are about to take effect. Roswell reprised this role in a 1992 revival of the play, also at Groundling Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{began as}} an {{operation}} to free seven American hostages being held in Lebanon by Hezbollah, a paramilitary group with Iranian ties connected to the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution. It was planned that Israel would ship weapons to Iran, and then the United States would resupply Israel and receive the Israeli payment. The Iranian recipients promised to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> {{in their power to}} achieve the release of the hostages. Large modifications to the plan were devised by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the National Security Council in late 1985, in which a portion of the proceeds from the weapon sales was diverted to fund anti-Sandinista, or Contras, in Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|Themistocles now {{developed}} a second strategy. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians; furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. However, after the Tempe debacle, it was uncertain whether the Spartans {{would be willing to}} march out from the Peloponnesus again. To persuade the Spartans to defend Attica, Themistocles had to show them that the Athenians were willing to <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> necessary for the success of the alliance. In short, the entire Athenian fleet must be dispatched to Artemisium.|$|E
5|$|He them imprisons the Gandhara {{royal family}} in his prison. He gives them only one rice grain per {{prisoner}} and that too the left over food of the kaurava clan.The prisoners start {{fighting for the}} few rice grains thrown at them. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided. He says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep {{at least one of}} their princes alive. He chooses Shakuni to be alive. Shakuni takes an oath that he will <b>do</b> <b>everything</b> he can to destroy the entire Kaurava clan.The whole royal family except Shakuni dies in the prison. Shakuni makes magic dice from his father's spinal cord. The magic dice show exactly the number that he would want. Duryodhana takes pity on the lone prisoner, Shakuni after the rest of the Gandhara royal family dies in prison out of starvation. Shakuni joins the evil of coterie of Duryodhana, Karna and Dushyasana.|$|E

They <b>did</b> <b>everything</b> wrong that they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because <b>everything</b> that they <b>did</b> reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|R
