40|$|Flexible water hoses (or {{flexible}} hose connectors) have become commonplace {{in recent years}} and provide a low-cost and convenient alternative to rigid pipe. Unfortunately, inadequate designs, particularly with regard to the selection of materials and material parameters, have made some hoses prone to failure. Such failures are often initiated by incidental exposure to corrosive substances commonly found in homes (including chlorides in tap water) that attack and corrode the stainless steel metal braid. A failure of the braid then leads to a rupture of the water-carrying tube. We evaluate the design considerations pertinent to <b>flexible</b> <b>water</b> <b>hose</b> failures and consider a recent failure scenario that illustrates some key points...|$|E
