500|$|On December 13, newly signed Mets closer Francisco Rodríguez {{added his}} sentiments to the fray. [...] "Of course we're {{going to be}} the frontrunner. Of course we're {{going to be the}} team to beat", Rodriguez told reporters. [...] "I don't want there to be a controversy. I don't want the other team to take it personally, or take it in a bad way. But I'm a really {{competitive}} guy. I like to win. If they ask me, 'Oh, which ballclub <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the National League East?' It's going to be the Mets. Easy question." ...|$|E
500|$|Napravnik's {{success has}} come in a sport where only 10% of all jockeys are women, {{even though they have}} been {{licensed}} as jockeys in pari-mutuel races since 1969. She initially was uncomfortable finding herself viewed as a role model for girls, preferring to simply be noticed as a top jockey. She became aware that she could {{have a positive impact on}} others and that helped her be more comfortable with her prominence. [...] She still prefers to emphasize her riding prowess, and stated in 2014, [...] "If you show your work ethic and professionalism and obvious skill and ability, that is what <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> somebody over." ...|$|E
500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win,</b> but this year I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2004, Robertson {{said that}} God told him President Bush will be re-elected in a [...] "blowout" [...] in November. [...] "I think George Bush <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> in a walk", Robertson told viewers of his The 700 Club program. [...] "I really believe I'm {{hearing from the}} Lord it's {{going to be like}} a blowout {{election}} in 2004. It's shaping up that way." [...] Bush did in fact win re-election, but not in a landslide. The 2004 race between Bush and John Kerry was one of the closest large elections in history.|$|E
2500|$|Thune faced no Republican or Democratic {{opposition}} for his Senate seat in 2010 and won re-election with 100% of the vote. Scott Heidepriem, the South Dakota Senate Minority Leader and a Democratic {{candidate for}} Governor of South Dakota, said, [...] "We just concluded that John Thune {{is an extremely}} popular senator who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> another term in the Senate." [...] One political observer of South Dakota politics noted in 2010 that it was [...] "the {{first time in the}} state’s modern history in which a major party has failed to field a Senate candidate." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the last}} month of the {{campaign}} began, two polls showed that Labor had extended its lead over the Coalition and could even gain seats at the election. The Australian published Newspoll results that put Labor ahead on a two-party-preferred basis, 59% to 41%. The Sydney Morning Herald published ACNielsen results putting Labor ahead 57% to 43%. Three weeks later, polls indicated that Labor would be returned without losing any seats. On 16 March, Debnam took the unprecedented step of effectively conceding defeat, telling the press that [...] "the message is very clear: the Labor Party <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the election in a week." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nixon asked Anna Chennault {{to be his}} [...] "channel to Mr. Thieu" [...] {{in order}} to advise him to refuse {{participation}} in the talks. Thieu was promised a better deal under a Nixon administration. Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu {{had no intention of}} attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: [...] "I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [...] <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> And you tell your boss [...] to hold on a while longer." [...] In 1997, Chennault admitted that [...] "I was constantly in touch with Nixon and Mitchell." [...] The effort also involved Texas Senator John Tower and Kissinger, who traveled to Paris on behalf of the Nixon campaign. William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained [...] "no useful inside information" [...] from his trip to Paris, and [...] "almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion". While Kissinger may have [...] "hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation," [...] this sort of [...] "self-promotion....is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E
2500|$|The anime {{has also}} been commented on by Chris Shepard from ANN noting a well crafted plot and good action scenes. However, he also criticized that during the first episodes the fights never get quite {{interesting}} as it becomes a bit predictable that Kenshin <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> as the music of moments of victory is repeated many times. However, Mark A. Grey from the same site mentioned that all those negatives points disappear during the Kyoto Arc due to amazing fights and a great soundtrack. Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com had a similar opinion on the anime, and added that the characters' personalities' allowed the plot to develop into a good variety of interesting stories. She also liked the historical setting as it makes all the situations seem authentic. Lynzee Loveridge from Anime News Network highlighted as the most known series to use the Meiji period and saw the Kyoto Arc {{as one of the}} best ones. Although Them Anime's Carlos Ross also liked the action scenes and storyline, he added that the number of childish and violent scenes make the show a bit unbalanced, saying it is not recommended for younger children. Surat approved of the anime series, stating that while half of the first-season episodes consisted of filler, the situation [...] "clicks" [...] upon the introduction of Saitō Hajime and that he disagreed with people who disliked the television series compared to the OVAs. Surat said that while the Media Blasters anime dub is [...] "well-cast," [...] the English dub does not sound natural since the producers were too preoccupied with making the voice performances mimick the Japanese performances. Surat said that while he [...] "didn't mind" [...] the first filler arc with the Christianity sect, he could not stomach the final two filler arcs, and Japanese audiences disapproved of the final two filler arcs. Robin Brenner from Library Journal noted that despite its pacifist messages, Rurouni Kenshin was too violent, recommending it to older audiences.|$|E
