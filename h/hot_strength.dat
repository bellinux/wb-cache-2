40|$|The {{information}} about the quantitative effects of alloy elements on the <b>hot</b> <b>strength</b> of steels is scarce and contradictory. Its effects can change according to alloy content and specific conditions of the hot forming process, as they can activate different hardening or softening mechanisms. Three empirical approaches were initially adopted in this work to rank and model <b>hot</b> <b>strength</b> in steels in function of their chemical composition: activation energy of deformation Q, mean hot flow stress and parameters of the Hajduk equation. Both alloy elements effect and steel ranking regarding to <b>hot</b> <b>strength</b> varied according to the selected parameter. Besides that, no simple and precise model could be developed from these parameters. This fact {{led to the development}} of a neural network with this purpose; its input parameters were C, Mn, Si, Al, Cr, Cu, Nb, V, Ti and N contents, as well strain temperature, degree and strain rate. This new approach showed better precision than the former trials, making easy to forecast the <b>hot</b> <b>strength</b> behavior of new steel alloys. This solution proved to be simple and very efficient, minimizing the development time of a mathematical model for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- In the Refractories world {{three decades}} ago, {{very few people}} were acquainted to silica fume and its usage. After a few years, it {{was used as an}} {{additive}} to brick. When added to high Alumina brick, mullite was formed in the matrix of the brick on firing, giving the brick good volume stability, strength and chemical resistance. When used in basic brick, high <b>hot</b> <b>strengths</b> resulted, at least at 2700 oF, which was about the limit of what could be tested. At the time it was only logical that silica fume would be used in brick not castables. Brick were used for all critical applications, no one would have considered using castables.

The effect of the additions on modulus of rupture (75 deg- 2, 750 deg f), deformation under load (2, 750 deg f), and air-slag-metal resistance (3, 000 deg f) was studied.
