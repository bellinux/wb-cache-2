5|$|The 1990s saw an {{increasing}} interest in international cuisines. Sushi, in particular, has taken hold {{as a popular}} style <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> out and as an entrée for events. In restaurants, fusion cuisine, with the melding of classic cuisines such as French and Japanese with local ingredients has become widespread.

5|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} hammocks in the Everglades {{have been}} harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (Krugiodendron ferreum). The {{largest and most}} mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century. Seminoles made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of chickees numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee for cooking and another <b>for</b> <b>eating.</b> Dugout canoes, cookware, stills, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt.

5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the hymenium, is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested <b>for</b> <b>eating.</b>|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best <b>for</b> <b>eating,</b> though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E
40|$|Few {{measurement}} instruments <b>for</b> children's <b>eating</b> {{behaviors and}} beliefs have been specifically validated for African-American children. Validation within this population {{is important because}} of potential cultural and ethnic influences. Objectives were to evaluate established and newly developed or adapted dietary psychosocial measures {{in a sample of}} 303 preadolescent African-American girls and their caregivers. Acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥ 0. 70) was found for measures of girls’ self-efficacy <b>for</b> healthy <b>eating,</b> outcome expectancies <b>for</b> healthy <b>eating,</b> positive family support <b>for</b> healthy <b>eating</b> and household availability of low-fat food and fruit, juice and vegetables (FJV). Evidence for concurrent validity was found with significant associations between self-efficacy <b>for</b> healthy <b>eating</b> and lower intake of energy (r = − 0. 17) and fat grams (r = − 0. 16). Greater FJV availability was associated with greater FJV intake (r = 0. 14) and lower body mass index (BMI) in girls (r = − 0. 12). Positive family support <b>for</b> healthy <b>eating</b> was associated with higher BMI in girls (r = 0. 41). These results {{contribute to the development of}} scales to evaluate prevention interventions related to dietary intake in African-American children...|$|R

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> car tyres.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, feeding {{primarily on}} the short grasses which commonly grow on light, and alkaline soils that are found in savanna grasslands and on plains. The animal's broad mouth is adapted <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> large quantities of short grass and it feeds both {{during the day and}} night. When grass is scarce, it will also eat the foliage of shrubs and trees. Wildebeest commonly associate with plains zebras as the latter eat the upper, less nutritious grass canopy, exposing the lower, greener material which the wildebeest prefer. Whenever possible, the wildebeest likes to drink twice daily and due to its regular requirement for water, it usually inhabits moist grasslands and areas with available water sources. The blue wildebeest drinks 9 to 12 litres of water every one to two days. Despite this, it can also survive in the arid Kalahari desert, where it obtains sufficient water from melons and water-storing roots and tubers.|$|E
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and sea turtles (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult sea turtles {{have been found in}} up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for sea turtles where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E

5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears {{choose to}} eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E
5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species. In the Middle East, a growing appetite <b>for</b> <b>eating</b> frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{challenge}} the conclusion by Jansen et al., Int J Eat Disord 2011; 44 : 164 - 168, that the widely used Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) External Eating subscale (DEBQ-EX) lacks validity <b>for</b> external <b>eating,</b> because of limitations of that study. Method: In a seminaturalistic setting we measured participants' intake of crisps and M&Ms while they watched food commercials or neutral commercials spliced into a film. To avoid misclassification {{due to the}} use of median splits we used extreme scores on the DEBQ-ex (n = 60) in addition to the full range of scores (n = 125). Results: As was expected, high external eaters in the food commercial condition ate more crisps than did high external eaters in the neutral commercial condition, whereas low external eaters did not eat more crisps in one condition than in the other. No such moderator effect was found <b>for</b> emotional <b>eating.</b> No significant moderator effect was found <b>for</b> external <b>eating</b> in the original sample (n = 125) using the median-split procedure. Discussion: The DEBQ scale <b>for</b> external <b>eating</b> has validity and specificity <b>for</b> external <b>eating</b> provided that the participants have sufficiently extreme external eating scores and a natural setting is used...|$|R
