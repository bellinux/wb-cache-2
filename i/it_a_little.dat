5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But we decided to change <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to do is plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E

500|$|On July 17, 2012, a tweet {{from the}} Twitter account for Megadeth's mascot Vic Rattlehead implied that {{frontman}} Dave Mustaine had begun writing lyrics for a follow-up album to 2011's Thirteen.

25|$|When on the TV show Top Gear, {{presenter}} Jeremy Clarkson {{commented that}} Wold's car history of over 100 cars included a Morris Minor.

I can't give too much away about the songs, but it's definitely going to represent the album because the album is very multilayered. It doesn't represent 'Your Body' as a single tone. It has its ballads; and everything comes from a very sincere, deeprooted place whether it's having fun or being vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|One feminist {{viewpoint}} {{sees the}} bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant [...] "yanking and fiddling." [...] Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the abdominal muscles while {{many others have}} gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that [...] "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players. I'm sure the male spectators love it, but I find <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit offensive." ...|$|E

5000|$|McBride {{commented on}} the song to CMT Insider {{when she was on}} set filming the song's music video. [...] "I just heard it, and {{immediately}} I thought, 'What a beautiful love song.' I mean, doesn't everybody wish that somebody was going to sing this about them? And the song is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different for me. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit vulnerable ... basically saying, 'I can't believe I have you, and everybody else thinks you're amazing, but you're all mine.' I love the fact that <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different. <b>It's</b> something that songs have said forever -- 'I love you' -- but <b>it's</b> said in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit different way, and I thought that was really cool." ...|$|R
500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought."

You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} given in February 2015, Kane {{said that he}} was in a relationship with Katie Goodland, whom he has known since childhood.

500|$|The Wisteria Lane set, {{which is}} located on the Colonial Street backlot set at Universal Studios, {{underwent}} changes for the time jump. Production designer P. Erik Carlson explained, [...] " [...] had already created a fairly Utopian world, and we wanted to exaggerate and enhance <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more, mostly through the use of color. We didn’t want it to feel ridiculously futuristic or viewers would be jarred by the contrast." [...] Bree's garage was remodeled into a testing kitchen as result of the character's catering business. Additionally, all houses were repainted with bolder colors, with the exception of Gabrielle's home, in order to reflect the Solis' financial situation.|$|E

500|$|Alex Borstein voices Lois Griffin, Asian {{correspondent}} Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown and Lois' mother Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein {{was asked}} to provide a voice for the pilot while {{she was working on}} MADtv. She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork and said it was [...] "really sight unseen". At the time, Borstein performed in a stage show in Los Angeles, in which she played a redhead mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins. The voice was originally slower (and deeper for the original series), but when MacFarlane heard it, he replied [...] "Make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less fucking annoying ... and speed it up, or every episode will last four hours." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend.

Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit but I really want to show it off and show everyone how great she is."

500|$|In July 2013, at a {{screening}} of Broadway Idiot, Mayer reported that the film adaptation was still happening, but production had not been scheduled due to [...] "Hollywood bullshit".

Comparing it to the musical, Jones said, [...] "The {{idea is to get}} <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dirtier and a little nastier and translate it into visual terms. There's {{not going to be a}} lot of dialogue and it probably should be a little shorter, too. After that, it just takes its 'movie time' in getting done".
