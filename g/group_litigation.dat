5000|$|In October 2013 it {{was placed}} in the highest risk {{category}} by the Care Quality Commission. In December 2013 it was reported that the trust had paid out more than £23 million for negligence claims in maternity in five years. The CQC report said that while the trust was working hard to make improvements in many areas, it still provided [...] "unsafe care" [...] in A&E and [...] "needs to urgently focus" [...] on resolving these issues because [...] "The A&E departments are at times unsafe {{because of the lack of}} full-time consultants and middle-grade doctors." [...] It {{was placed in}} special measures on 18 December 2013. In December 2013 it was placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission. Inspectors returned to the Trust in March 2015 and highlighted areas of [...] "outstanding care" [...] and improvements in a number of areas, including leadership. The Trust remained in special measures with ongoing challenges around governance and performance. A further re-inspection is expected in early 2016. In March 2014 The Trust was forecasting a deficit of £38 million for 2013-4 and a similar figure for 2014-5. [...] In September 2014 the trust revealed a huge, previously unreported waiting list of more than 90,000 patients, 61,143 of which had been waiting past the national 18 week limit. [...] In February 2016 1,015 patients had been waiting more than a year for elective treatment - more than those waiting in the rest of England. Its performance against the national 4-hour standard for emergency care improved dramatically during 2015-16. While the Trust had been among the worst performers in the country at one point, it is now one of the best in London. It hosted a conference in 2015, giving other struggling trusts an insight into the work which had taken place to turn performance around. The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/5 winter. The Trust was one of five to benefit from a five-year, £12.5m programme announced by Jeremy Hunt in July 2015 to bring in Virginia Mason Medical Center to assist English using their clinical engagement and culture tools including the Patient Safety Alert System and electronic dashboard. Hunt said: “The achievements at Virginia Mason over the past decade are truly inspirational and I’m delighted they will now help NHS staff to learn the lessons that made their hospital one of the safest in the world - patients will see real benefits as a result.” [...] It is also one of eight new, national, vanguard sites which will help spearhead transformational change in urgent care across the country, and part of the development of a new Accountable Care Organisation for outer north east London. In June 2015 Leigh Day & Co co-ordinated <b>group</b> <b>litigation</b> involving 17 separate families based on the trust’s alleged “failure to take reasonable care to ensure that there was a safe system of healthcare provided at Hospital”. This included failure to provide sufficient numbers of suitably trained nursing staff and failure to supervise those staff and to ensure adequate records. It spent 10.6% of its total turnover on agency staff in 2014/5.|$|E

The <b>Litigation</b> <b>Group</b> has secured from government files information about health risks, safety issues, and financial problems, on behalf of other divisions within Public Citizen, other public interest organizations, reporters, and academics. Among material of significant public interest obtained through its efforts are approximately 2,000 pages of Lt. Col. Oliver North's notebooks (National Security Archive v. National Archives and Records Administration), the report relied on by the Attorney General to exclude Kurt Waldheim from the United States (Mapother v. Department of Justice), and all but one paragraph of the government’s secret brief filed before the Supreme Court in the “Pentagon Papers” case (Sims v. Department of Justice). [...] <b>Litigation</b> <b>Group</b> lawyers have also litigated issues surrounding preservation of and access to electronic records. In the case Armstrong v. Executive Office of the President, <b>Litigation</b> <b>Group</b> lawyers succeeded in establishing that electronic records generated by the White House {{and the rest of the}} Executive Branch are subject to federal open records laws. At the end of both the Reagan administration and the first Bush administration, the government had claimed that it was entitled to delete all of the electronic records created and stored by the White House during each president’s tenure. As a result of the litigation, in which the court agreed that FOIA required that executive branch e-mail be preserved, the government released more than 3,000 e-mail records from the White House and the National Security Council.|$|R
