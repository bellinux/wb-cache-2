40|$|We {{propose a}} series of simple models for the {{microstructure}} of a double auction market without intermediaries. We specialize to those markets, such interdealer broker markets, which are dominated by professional traders, who trade mainly through limit orders, watch markets closely, and move their limit order prices frequently. We model these markets {{as a set of}} buyers and a set of sellers diffusing in price space and interacting through an annihilation interaction. We seek to compute the purely statistical effects of the presence of large numbers of traders, as scaling laws on various measures of liquidity, and to this end we allow our model very few parameters. We find that the bid-offer spread scales as √(1 / <b>Deal</b> <b>Rate).</b> In addition we investigate the scaling of other intuitive relationships, such as the relation between fluctuations of the best bid/offer and the density of buyers/sellers. We then study this model and its scaling laws under the influence of random disturbances to trader drift, trader volatility, and entrance rate. We also study possible extensions to the model, such as the addition of market order traders, and an interaction that models momentum-type trading. Finally, we discuss how detailed simulations may be carried out to study scaling in all of these settings, and how the models may be tested inactual markets. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{structure}} and attributes of subprime mortgage-backed securitization deals originated between 1997 - 2007. Our unique data set allows us to map loan-level data for over 7 million subprime loans to the securitization deals into which the loans were sold. We document {{the relationship between the}} structure of the securitization deal and the attributes of the underlying mortgage collateral, including housing market conditions at the time of deal origination. We find evidence in support of the hypothesis that deals with higher levels of housing market diversification have a larger portion of the <b>deal</b> <b>rated</b> investment grade. Additionally, we find that deals comprised of loans concentrated in areas with high rates of home price appreciation have a larger portion of the <b>deal</b> <b>rated</b> investment grade. We believe these results highlight how the structure of securitization deals could impact the supply of credit being afforded the mortgage origination market. Deal structure matters because the economics of the structuring process create incentives for deal arrangers to purchase loans that will provide the cheapest funding for the deal...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to assess the {{influence}} of decisions on the monetary policy on return and volatility of the Ukrainian stock market (on {{the basis of the}} representative stock index PFTS) with consideration to the phase of the financial cycle. Daily opening prices for the period of 2000 - 2015 are used as the initial data, on the basis of which the return of the stock index in the trading day format is calculated. Using the news about the monetary policy, the «expected» component and the component of «unexpectedness» of the announcement information context are distinguished. The analysis of the reaction of the Ukrainian stock market to the macroeconomic news about the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve System and the European Central Bank with regard to the phases of upturns and downturns of the financial cycle has been carried out. The study allows to draw conclusions about the impact of announcements about the <b>dealing</b> <b>rate</b> on the return and volatility of the domestic stock market: first, in the Ukrainian stock market the return reacts much more strongly to the announcements of the Federal Reserve System than those of the European Central Bank; second, the impact of decisions of the Federal Reserve System, being in line with the logic of risk management, is more pronounced during the downturn phase of the financial cycle...|$|R

We perform a large scale formal investigation of the investment opportunity set in global acquisitions based on ownership type over the period of 1985 – 2012. Compared to private acquirers, government acquirers have a much reduced investment opportunity set. Government acquirers invest in fewer target nations and industries, settle for smaller stakes, invest in countries with lower quality legal institutions and in nations with which political relations are more positive and see a 50 % higher <b>deal</b> failure <b>rate.</b> ...|$|R

We have therefore formed a hypothesis that non-financial factors significantly improve the predictive power of rating with the aim to disperse doubts about usefulness of non-financial factors in credit rating assessments...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{contribution}} of credit ratings in the information set that bidders use to price targets. Using a sample that includes U.

M&A premiums paid are lower in <b>deals</b> involving <b>rated</b> as opposed to nonrated firms. Assuming that the presence of ratings mitigates the problem of information asymmetry and allows bidders to pay a fair price for a target, then the post-M&A performance of bidders of rated targets would be superior. Indeed, we find that the presence of ratings and bidders’ post-M&A operating performance are positively related...|$|R
