5|$|Though no coins {{denominated}} as thalers were officially issued {{within the}} Swiss Confederation, many coins measuring between 30 and 40millimeters <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name unofficially {{due to the}} similarity in size to German and Austrian thalers.|$|E
5|$|During the 43 {{nomination}} years, 67 people <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Life Achievement Award. Multiple winners {{have been}} awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000 {{it has become}} an unofficial tradition for two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though this}} {{campaign}} is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before. The women who defeated the Egyptians at Diros <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name of 'The Amazons of Diros'. This was the last invasion of Mani as Ibrahim abandoned any ideas of conquering it. On the April 26, 1827 the Turkish navy bombarded Oitylo with over 1,700 cannonballs hitting the town.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids of {{the species}} are known in nature and cultivation. In the Whipstick forest near Bendigo in Victoria, {{putative}} hybrids with Whirrakee wattle (Acacia williamsonii) have been identified; these resemble hakea wattle (Acacia hakeoides). Garden hybrids with Queensland silver wattle (Acacia podalyriifolia) raised in Europe <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> names Acacia x siebertiana and Acacia x deneufvillei.|$|E
5|$|Police {{determined}} {{that there were}} 32 clomethiazole pills in Moon's system. Six were digested, sufficient to cause his death; the other 26 were undigested when he died. Max Glatt, an authority on alcoholism, wrote in The Sunday Times that Moon should never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> drug. Moon was cremated on 13 September 1978 at Golders Green Crematorium in London, and his ashes were scattered in its Gardens of Remembrance.|$|E

5|$|Swimming is Australia's most {{prolific}} Olympic sport, having {{been responsible for}} 58 of Australia's 143 Olympic gold medals. In addition, {{a list of the}} top 100 Australian Olympians of all time, compiled by the Australian Olympic Committee, named 35 swimmers in the top 100, more than any other sport. Swimmers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> honour of carrying the Australian flag six times in twelve at the closing ceremony, which is traditionally reserved for the most successful athlete of the delegation.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been much earlier than 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
5|$|Tjibaou was {{involved}} in the establishment of the Écoles populaires kanak, which was taught in a local Kanak language and educated children in spiritual and practical knowledge, while including French and English language instruction. Since 2006, pre-school children <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to learn indigenous Kanak languages. While the Kanak languages have been taught in high schools across the Loyalty Islands and North Province, the language education has not been as common in the more European South Province. The establishment of the Kanak Language Academy (KLA) was a provision of the Nouméa Accord.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park. Since 2013 commercial dog-walkers have been required to apply for licences to walk dogs in the park and are allowed to walk only four dogs at a time. In September 2013 a cyclist was successfully prosecuted for speeding at 37mph in the park. In March 2015 a cycling club member was fined for speeding at 41mph and faced disciplinary action from his cycling club, which uses the park for training. In 2014 and 2015 two men were prosecuted for picking mushrooms in the park.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locomotives}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name Great Western. The {{first was}} an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive {{in the same}} class was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E

Cave two years later in 1999, Donald M. Grant nineteen years later in 2003, and Stephen King and Gahan Wilson, twenty-four and twenty-three years later in 2004.|$|E

25|$|A Chinese Buddhist {{account of}} the 6th century CE {{attributes}} its creation to the god Brahma, though Monier Monier-Williams, Sylvain Lévi and others thought it {{was more likely to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> name because it was moulded by the Brahmins.|$|E
25|$|The colours of the flag, {{although}} not {{specified by the}} Flags Act, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> same Pantone specifications as the national flag.
