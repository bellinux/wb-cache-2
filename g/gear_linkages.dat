40|$|Abstract. Twin-rotor {{piston engine}} is {{exceedingly}} compact, and several times more power dense than conventional IC engines. It {{is necessary to}} analyze the transmission characteristics of the special <b>geared</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism which {{is used for the}} power transmission equipment of the engine. Transmission angle is mainly adopted in order to obtain the transmission characteristics. Firstly, the force transmission behavior of one end of the output component is derived through the force analysis of the planet gear. Secondly, the torque transmission angle is proposed based on the multi-point force situation. Lastly, the torque transmission angle is depicted and analyzed in detail through the equivalent composite force graphical method. The result shows that the <b>geared</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism will not produce counteractive torque to the rotation direction and has no dead point...|$|R
50|$|No {{damage was}} done to the track or signalling, but No. 73096 blocked the line for some time. Shuttle {{services}} were quickly organised between Alresford and Ropley and between Alton and Medstead, until the line could be cleared. Parts of the steam locomotive's 'motion' (connecting rod, valve <b>gear</b> <b>linkages</b> etc.) on the driver's side {{had to be removed}} by MPD staff to allow the locomotive to be moved. As the 5MT was unable to move under its own power, a diesel locomotive was dispatched from Ropley engine shed to retrieve it. The Gala thereafter continued with a revised timetable.|$|E
5000|$|The Liana {{was best}} known for its {{appearances}} as the Reasonably Priced Car in Top Gears Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment. Celebrity guests would appear on the show every week to be interviewed and to set a lap time in a saloon model Suzuki Liana. The primary car, along with spare cars, were kept stock except for a roll cage and racing seats which were added as safety measures. In its three-year tenure on Top Gear, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; its tires and brakes were changed 100 times; and it required six new clutches, two new hubs, driveshafts, wishbones, struts and <b>gear</b> <b>linkages</b> and a replacement wing mirror. [...] The Liana was used from its first show until its replacement by a Chevrolet Lacetti in the shows spring 2006 season. Today, it enjoys a partial retirement, and is only brought back when the guest is a Formula 1 driver.|$|E

50|$|The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three {{modes of}} drive {{operation}} were automatic, local, and manual.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} design {{issues and}} a theoretical model of electrostatically driven axial-gap polysilicon wobble motors. The motor design benefits from large axial rotor-to-stator overlap and large gear ratios, and motor designs with rotor radii of 50 and 100 ¿m {{are capable of}} generating torques in the nanoNewtonmeter range at high electrostatic fields. Because of the large gear ratio, smaller angular steps and lower rotational speed are obtained, compared to radial-gap motor designs. Aspects like gear ratio, torque generation, excitation schemes and torque coverage, normal forces, friction, rotor kinetics, and dynamical behavior are addressed.

5000|$|Vauxhall {{offered the}} Monaro buyer a limited edition prior to {{discontinuation}} of the model: the VXR 500. A Harrop supercharger was installed onto the standard GM 6.0 LS2 engine by Vauxhall dealer Greens of Rainham {{in conjunction with}} tuning firm Wortec, increasing power to [...] and torque to 677 N·m (500 lbf·ft). In addition to this, a shorter <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> was added to enable quicker shifts. The resultant 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) was 4.8 seconds.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist {{grip on the}} handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for steering linkage shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the twist grip or <b>gear</b> <b>linkage.</b> [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|R
50|$|On Sunday, {{before a}} crowd of over 100,000, Rindt jumped into the lead at the start, while Hulme {{struggled}} with a bent <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> and lost places to Stewart and Hill. Andretti charged ahead from his thirteenth-place grid position, and, when Brabham slowed to avoid Hulme, Andretti bumped rear wheels with the Brabham, knocking the Lotus sideways. Andretti continued for three laps, but his suspension was bent, and he retired. At {{the end of the}} first lap, the order was Rindt, Stewart, Hill, Siffert, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Courage and Ickx.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a {{longitudinally}} mounted flat twin four-stroke engine with overhead valves. The compressor was located between {{the seat and}} gearbox {{and in the first}} version was driven by an additional open parallel shaft next to the magneto with a right-angle bevel <b>gear</b> <b>linkage.</b> Thus, the compressor shaft ran transversely to the direction of travel. The boost pressure was up to 2 bar depending on application. The tank was shortened compared to the series motorcycles {{to make room for the}} compressor. The single carburetor was located behind the compressor.|$|R

50|$|At Sweden, Henri Pescarolo {{drove the}} second chassis, with the brakes moved inboard, {{and he and}} Beltoise {{qualified}} 19th and 13th respectively. However, both retired, Pescarolo on lap one through fire and his teammate on lap three with an engine problem. At the 1974 Dutch Grand Prix, Beltoise tried both P201 chassis and raced the newer one. Pescarolo drove the second car in one practice session only and eventually raced a P160. The earlier P201 chassis was raced by François Migault who retired on lap 60 with <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> problems having qualified 25th, and last, on the grid. Beltoise qualified 16th and retired on lap 19, also with a gearbox problem.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced to {{the market}} in 2003, the Peugeot 206 GTi180 and 206 RC brought high {{performance}} to the product range. The range topping GTi180 {{was brought to the}} UK market, while the 206 RC was introduced to the rest of Europe. The new 'hot hatch' used the 2 litre EW10J4S engine, which produced [...] thanks to variable valve timing and modified inlet and exhaust manifolds. Other features on the 206 GTi180 and 206 RC include 17 inch alloy wheels, racing bucket front seats, a short shift <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> and altered gearbox ratios (1st & 2nd gears). The new car was capable of reaching 62 mi/h km/h in 7.4 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981 {{the range}} was updated and became 201, 301, and 401. A few early 401s {{were built in}} Atkinson's Walton-le-Dale plant but then all {{production}} was shifted to Oldham. The 201 originally came equipped with the 200's [...] International engine, although this was changed to a [...] Perkins motor following the termination of Seddon Atkinson's relationship with International. The 401 also received an improved interior, the changed grille, and a much improved <b>gear</b> <b>linkage.</b> The Motor Panels trucks had severe rust problems, forcing {{the introduction of a}} new anti-corrosion package in the mid-eighties. This period also marks the beginning of the recession which killed off many of the companies which had been buying Seddon Atkinson's trucks.|$|R
50|$|The theorem {{states for}} a given coupler-curve there exist three four-bar <b>{{linkages}},</b> three <b>geared</b> five-bar <b>linkages,</b> and more six-bar linkages which will generate the same path.

500|$|Jarier left Shadow {{before the}} start of the 1977 Formula One season, for ATS, and was {{replaced}} by Italian Renzo Zorzi. Zorzi was later rated by Jackie Oliver, part of the managerial team at Shadow, as [...] "the worst driver we [...] ever had". The new signing brought in sponsorship from Italy, easing Shadow's financial position. Pryce started the first race of the year in Argentina in ninth place and stayed with the leading group until a <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> failure on the 45th lap of the 52 lap race. Following a long pit stop to fix the fault, he was not classified. Pryce qualified 12th for the second round in Brazil, but on lap 34 retired from the race, while running in second place, as the result of an engine failure.|$|R
5000|$|For 1961, the Suzulight TL II was presented. A new {{pressed steel}} grille {{in place of}} the TL's simple mesh and chrome rubbing strips on the bumpers {{enhanced}} its look, and there was also a second windshield wiper. The engine received some improvements such as larger bearings and the <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> was change from a cable operated one to a more precise mechanical linkage. The price dropped to ¥360,000. Next year's TL III, introduced in October 1961, continued this trend, dropping down to ¥345,000 while offering a new, fully synchronized four-speed transmission. The TL III also received an updated dash and turn signals integrated into a new grille and taillights instead of on the B-pillar. The sheet metal was changed to accommodate new doorhandles, but the biggest difference was at the rear, where there was a horizontally split two-piece tailgate. The TL III was marketed as the [...] "Suzulight Van 360".|$|R
50|$|The 1999 R1 {{saw only}} minor changes, apart from paint and graphics. More {{improvements}} were a redesigned <b>gear</b> change <b>linkage</b> and the <b>gear</b> change shaft length being increased. Fuel tank reserve capacity was reduced from 5.5 to 4.0 litres (1.2 to 0.9 imp gal or 1.5 to 1.1 US gal), while the total {{fuel tank capacity}} was unchanged at 18 L.|$|R
50|$|The race - now {{bearing the}} BRDC International Trophy name - {{took place in}} heavy rain, {{allowing}} Cheever to demonstrate Pirelli's wet weather superiority in the well-tested Osella-BMW. He dominated until a multiple accident involving Stohr at the Woodcote chicane caused a race stoppage after two laps. After the restart Henton and Daly pushed the American hard until Henton suffered gear selection problems and Daly span. The latter recovered strongly after the rain stopped and the track dried out to take the lead, only to suffer <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> problems, allowing Cheever through to take victory on the last lap by only three-tenths of a second. Henton held on to take 3rd ahead of Rahal, with South (despite twice leaving the track at Woodcote) and Columbo completing the top six. The fancied March cars proved a disappointment - the 792 was overweight and generated too much grip, resulting in a machine with heavy handling. Surer failed to start the race after sliding off on the parade lap and being hit by team-mate Gabbiani.|$|R
50|$|A multi-clutch gearbox {{avoids the}} {{difficulties}} of shifting gear by avoiding the need to shift at all. It operates {{as a number of}} separate gearboxes, each one controlled by a separate clutch, interlocked to avoid multiple selection. Selecting a gear is a matter of selecting the appropriate clutch. An advantage of this type is that it's simple to arrange remote operation, as there is no <b>gear</b> shift <b>linkage</b> as such, merely duplication of a clutch linkage.|$|R
50|$|The ZSU-23-4 has an 1A7 SRP {{electro-mechanical}} fire solution calculator, weighing 180 kg, that occupies all of {{the space}} before the Commander. It contains 60 electric motors driving 110 axles over different potentiometers, shafts, rods, cams, <b>gears</b> and <b>linkages</b> to mechanically calculate ammunition flight time till impact, elevation lead angle, and azimuth lead angle using the target parameters received from the 1RL33 RPK-2 (gun dish) radar, and the correction angle received from the GAG (gyroscope) unit.|$|R
5000|$|The Morris Commercial J2 was a small, forward-control van (driver's cab {{on top of}} the engine) {{launched}} by Morris Commercial in 1956 and produced until 1967. It was offered with the familiar B-series petrol engine, initially in 1489 cc form, but this was subsequently enlarged to 1622 cc. A curious feature of the <b>gear</b> lever <b>linkage</b> was that the usual [...] "H-plane" [...] gear positions were reversed, i.e. 1st/2nd gears were at the right-hand-side and 3rd/4th to the left.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} avoid rather {{considerable}} <b>gearing</b> <b>linkages</b> the two-crystal spectro-meter (Compton and Allison, 1934) is often arranged so that the x-ray tube, one of the crystals and the detector remain fixed while the other crystal is rotated through a small angle to scan the spectral region under study. The limitation on the spectral region which can be scanned at one such setting is imposed {{by the size of}} the crystals and of the detector opening. As either the first or the second crystal is rotated the region of Bragg reflection moves across the crystal surface. As shown later on, this "walking " turns out to be considerably larger when the first of the two crystals is rotated. POINT SOURCE Figure 1. Rotation of second crystal.

50|$|On lap seven, Arnoux, who {{had been}} passed for the lead by Rosberg going into Surtees, pitted for new tyres, his Ferrari wearing its rubber {{extremely}} quickly despite cool ambient temperatures (Arnoux also had major tyre troubles in practice and was lucky not to damage the car after blowing a rear tyre at speed on the run to Clearways). By lap 23 and two further stops, his team had no further sets of tyres and {{he was forced to}} retire with camshaft trouble, although he had set the fastest lap of the race as consolation, though his lap of 1:17.826 in the flat bottomed Ferrari was 5.458 seconds shy of Didier Pironi's lap record of 1:12.368 set at the 1980 British Grand Prix in a ground effects Ligier-Ford. Watson retired with a bad driveline vibration, while Rebaque retired with tyre and suspension failure in a car he wasn't totally comfortable with. In commentary, Murray Walker claimed that Rebaque looked at sea in the powerful Brabham-BMW, despite his recent experience in racing cars at the ultra-fast Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other oval speedways in the American-based CART series. Serra's car broke its <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> also retired from the race.|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{independent}} and interacting factors affect seating comfort such as seat shape, stability, lumbar support and seat height. Although many subjective comfort studies have been conducted, few of them considered seating comfort from its subassembly level.

The operation torque and lift distance of this mechanism was investigated as 2 major comfort factors. Ten cushions {{with this kind of}} design in the market were compared and assessed...|$|R
500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Pryce {{graduated}} to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, joining the newly formed Token Racing team. The team was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 {{due to a lack}} of financial backing which had led to the end of the previous Rondel Racing outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties, and what David Tremayne described as [...] "evident promise". Pryce made his début for the team at the BRDC International Trophy, a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an airbox and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than James Hunt's Hesketh in pole position. The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> problem. Pryce's World Championship début came at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower than the fastest time set by Clay Regazzoni. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was already}} {{well known for}} {{dominating}} the BPR Global GT Series with customer teams, but the car that won was actually the initial GTR prototype. This was on loan to Lanzante Motorsport, and prepared by McLaren's Unit 12 and overseen by McLaren's Chief Engineer James Robinson to run it on behalf of Kokusai Kaihatsu Racing. Mario Andretti's Courage finished second, having been the sentimental favourite of many {{in the run-up to}} the race. However the reliability of the production-based McLaren helped it defeat the much faster Le Mans prototypes, although in an interview 20 years [...] later Graham Humphrys (former Spice technical director), who engineered the race winning car, attributed the win to the rain which fell on the circuit overnight, which eased the stress on the car's relatively fragile transmission, and which also saw a remarkable performance by Lehto, who was as much as 30 seconds a lap faster than his rivals at times. Humphrys also managed to identify the source of the gear selection problems which the Kokusai car and the other McLarens in the race suffered from, working out that the exposed <b>gear</b> <b>linkage</b> mechanism was filling with water and dirt from the wet conditions, and solved the problem by filling the affected area with WD-40 at every pit stop.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1962, the Caravelle {{received}} a new 956 cc engine {{that would be}} also used by the new Renault 8 from June. Although the new [...] "Sierra" [...] series five-bearing engine shared no components with the existing 845 cc Dauphine engine, it was conceptually very similar: the engine size was chosen in order to come in (slightly) below {{the top of the}} 5CV car tax band in France. It had a sealed cooling system as well as a new front suspension, new rear geometry, new steering, and a new <b>gear</b> <b>linkage.</b> Moving the radiator behind the engine also freed up an extra 12 cm of space behind the front seat. Maximum power output increased to [...] Four-speed transmission, already included in the price at no extra cost on some export markets, now came as part of the standard with the new engine even for French buyers, although bottom gear still made do without synchromesh. The upgraded cars, first presented at the 1962 Geneva Motor Show, now featured disc brakes on all four wheels: the Floride was the first French volume car to benefit from this enhancement which also reduced unsprung weight by approximately 6 kg. The Caravelle name also replaced the Floride name in all markets from 1962 onwards.|$|R
