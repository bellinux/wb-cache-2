5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real <b>historic</b> <b>moment</b> or location that fully captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|An {{understanding}} of the artistic personality of Gasparo Cairano has to be mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He {{can be referred to}} as a novice artist at the beginning, when the Lombard migrant, like many of his contemporaries, arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That <b>historic</b> <b>moment,</b> with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He quickly became the leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta.|$|E
5|$|Though the Baltimore Opera Company can {{be traced}} back to the 1924 {{founding}} of the Martinet Opera School, the direct antecedent of the Company was founded in 1950, with Rosa Ponselle, a well-known soprano, as artistic director. In the following decade the Company modernized, receiving new funding from, among other sources, the Ford Foundation, which led to professionalization and the hiring of a full-time production manager and the stabilization on a program consisting of three operas every season; this schedule has since been expanded to four performances. In 1976, the Company commissioned Inês de Castro for the American Bicentennial, composed by Thomas Pasatieri with a libretto by Bernard Stambler; the opera's debut was a great success and an <b>historic</b> <b>moment</b> for American opera.|$|E

25|$|Paine was not, on the whole, expressing {{original}} {{ideas in}} Common Sense, but rather employing rhetoric {{as a means}} to arouse resentment of the Crown.

Part of Paine's work was to render complex ideas intelligible to average readers of the day, with clear, concise writing unlike the formal, learned style favored by many of Paine's contemporaries. Scholars have put forward various explanations to account for its success, including the <b>historic</b> <b>moment,</b> Paine's easy-to-understand style, his democratic ethos, and his use of psychology and ideology.|$|E
