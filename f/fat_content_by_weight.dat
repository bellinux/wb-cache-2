40|$|An {{abundance}} of fat stored within the liver, or steatosis, {{is the beginning}} of a broad hepatological spectrum, usually referred to as fatty liver disease (FLD). For studies on FLD, quantitative hepatic fat ultrasonography would be an appealing study modality. Objective of this study was to develop a technique for quantifying hepatic <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>by</b> ultrasonography and validate this using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H- 1 MRS) as gold standard. Eighteen white volunteers (BMI range 21. 0 - 42. 9) were scanned by both ultrasonography and H- 1 MRS. Altered ultrasound characteristics, present in the case of FLD, were assessed using a specially developed software program. Various attenuation and textural based indices of FLD were extracted from ultrasound images. Using linear regression analysis, the predictive power of several models (consisting of both attenuation and textural based measures) on log 10 -transformed hepatic <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>by</b> H- 1 MRS were investigated. The best quantitative model was compared with a qualitative ultrasonography method, as used in clinical care. A model with four ultrasound characteristics could modestly predict the amount of liver fat (adjusted explained variance 43. 2 %, P = 0. 021). Expanding the model to seven ultrasound characteristics increased adjusted explained variance to 60 % (P = 0. 015), with r = 0. 789 (P < 0. 001). Comparing this quantitative model with qualitative ultrasonography revealed a significant advantage of the quantitative model in predicting hepatic <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> (P < 0. 001).

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) provides a noninvasive approach to assess body fat and lean tissue contents. Similar to DEXA analyses in other species, body fat measurements in mice show acceptable precision, but suffer from poor accuracy. Since fat and lean tissue each contain various components, these inaccuracies likely result from selection of inappropriate calibration standards. Analysis of solvents showed the PIXImus 2 DEXA gave results consistent with theoretical calculations.

Methods : A multicompartment {{model was}} used to simultaneously determine the kinetic parameters of triglycerides (TGs) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in VLDL 1 and VLDL 2 after a bolus of [2 H 3]leucine and [2 H 5]glycerol in ten men with type 2 diabetes and in 18 non-diabetic men. Liver <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> was determined <b>by</b> proton spectroscopy and intra-abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>by</b> MRI. Results : Univariate regression analysis showed that liver <b>fat</b> <b>content,</b> intra-abdominal <b>fat</b> volume, plasma glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) correlated with VLDL 1 TG and ApoB production. However, only liver fat and plasma glucose were significant in multiple regression models, emphasising the critical role of substrate fluxes and lipid availability in the liver as the driving force for overproduction of VLDL 1 in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Despite negative correlations with fasting TG levels, liver <b>fat</b> <b>content,</b> and VLDL 1 TG and ApoB pool sizes, adiponectin was not linked to VLDL 1 TG or ApoB production and thus was not a predictor of VLDL 1 production. However, adiponectin correlated negatively with the removal rates of VLDL 1 TG and ApoB. Conclusions/interpretation : We propose that the metabolic effect of insulin resistance, partly mediated by depressed plasma adiponectin levels, increases fatty acid flux from adipose tissue to the liver and induces the accumulation of fat in the liver. Elevated plasma glucose can further increase hepatic <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> through multiple pathways, resulting in overproduction of VLDL 1 particles and leading to the characteristic dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes...|$|R
