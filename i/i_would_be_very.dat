2500|$|In a 2002 {{column for}} the Mail on Sunday, Hitchens stated that he {{believed}} homosexuality to be morally wrong and that being homosexual meant you {{could not be a}} conservative, that it skewed one's political views on drugs and that it was an attack on marriage and family life. The article was written in reaction to prominent Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan coming out as gay. In a 2009 {{column for the}} Mail on Sunday, he stated [...] "If I never again had to read or write a word about homosexuals, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 September 2008, Zico {{revealed}} {{that he would be}} interested taking over the vacant managers position at Newcastle United following the resignation of Kevin Keegan. He is quoted saying [...] "The Newcastle job is one that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> interested in taking. It would be a privilege and an honour, I've always wanted to experience the Premier League as I believe I could enjoy much success coaching in England." [...] He also commented that he isn't bothered about the structure of the board at Newcastle United, [...] "I am used to working alongside technical directors so this isn't an issue for me. It's normal for me to work in those conditions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Glitter, in {{his first}} {{interview}} in more than eight years to BBC News in May 2006, denied any wrongdoing and claimed not to have knowingly had sex with anyone under 18. He also said [...] "I know the line [...] to cross". When asked {{what he thought of}} adults having sex with children, he said, [...] "It certainly is a crime ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> angry about that." [...] Christine Beddoe, director of End Child Prostitution, Pornography and Trafficking, criticised Glitter and said he was trying to [...] "minimise what he has done", and added, [...] "We must allow children to tell their story and not just have the words of Gadd." ...|$|E

25|$|I {{said nothing}} to my brothers. But I went {{immediately}} to the show and took my painting home in a taxi. It was really {{a turning point in}} my life, I can assure you. I saw that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>very</b> much interested in groups after that.|$|R
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} the Butcher family in May 1988 {{signified}} an {{end of an era}} for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts (Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson) vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over tenancy. Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane, played by Sophie Lawrence, Frank's teenage children came with Frank. Lawrence was 15 at the time, and she got the part in EastEnders straight after leaving stage school. Lawrence has commented, [...] "I always just thought that I would be a dancer and go into a West End musical and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very,</b> very happy. Then I got EastEnders when I was 15 and it kind of changed my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, {{the nuclear}} {{disaster}} in Japan {{is likely to}} have major effects on US energy policy, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Speaking on CNBC in March, Buffet said that the [...] "United States was poised to move ahead with nuclear plans here, but the events in Japan derailed that". [...] "Radiation terrifies people", Buffett told CNBC. [...] "It's unseen, there's no way to quantify sort of the limits of what might happen from it so I would say that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> surprised if there's any nuclear facilities built in the United States for a long time." [...] Moreover, Japan's government and TEPCO response to the Fukushima Daiichi incident has been criticized worldwide, and Gregory B. Jaczko, Chairman [...] of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, broke with ordinary protocols by overruling the Japanese with regard to the public exclusion zone. As a result of the harshly criticized Japanese handling of the crisis, there has been a scramble by the EU to reform nuclear policy. Some commentators expect that US will have greater influence on nuclear policy worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|However, whilst {{the cast}} and crew have ruled out the {{possibility}} of another series, many have hinted at the possibility of another future Christmas [...] "special". After the third series, James Corden stated: 'As far as [...] "specials" [...] are concerned, I think if we had an idea for a story with these characters then maybe, but I don't think that'll happen any time soon.' In January 2010, Larry Lamb predicted a future Christmas [...] "special", stating 'Clearly the audience loves it and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> surprised if it did not come back for a Christmas episode.' In September 2010, writer Ruth Jones also discussed the possibility of a future one-off [...] "special". She stated 'A lot of it is to do with logistics, because we haven't ruled out doing a [...] "special" [...] {{at some point in the}} future, but we're not doing one this Christmas.' Alison Steadman welcomed the suggestion, stating, 'A [...] "special" [...] would be great. I think another series... perhaps, the story's been told. But a [...] "special" [...] would be... I'd love that, I'd absolutely love it if that happened.' ...|$|E

"It {{seems very}} likely that what the boys are now doing will in the end come to {{much the same thing}} as {{changing}} a dollar and getting about ninety cents back for it, which naturally prevents me from feeling that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> making <b>very</b> much of a sacrifice in discontinuing the operation." ...|$|R

2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in October, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as Glóin. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "Richard {{is one of the most}} exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands." [...] McTavish was quoted on his casting, [...] "I think that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything comparable." [...] Following McTavish's casting, scheduling conflicts arose while he was working on , resulting in the game's storyline being modified so that McTavish could go to New Zealand to work on the film. On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, [...] "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli." [...] On the casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, [...] "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [...] on these movies." [...] Hadlow also plays Bert the Stone-troll. On his casting Callen stated, [...] "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. [...] Given that Óin is almost 200years old I can presume only that it was the age." [...] On being cast in the role, Hunter said, [...] "Being cast in The Hobbit is really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'" ...|$|E
