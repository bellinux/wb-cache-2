The model {{takes into account the}} <b>finite</b> <b>mass</b> of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 of the mass of Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E

2500|$|The {{practice}} of refusing infinite values for measurable quantities {{does not come}} from a priori or ideological motivations, but rather from more methodological and pragmatic motivations [...] One of the needs of any physical and scientific theory is to give usable formulas that correspond to or at least approximate reality. As an example, if any object of infinite gravitational mass were to exist, any usage of the formula to calculate the gravitational force would lead to an infinite result, which would be of no benefit since the result would be always the same regardless of the position and the mass of the other object. The formula would be useful neither to compute the force between two objects of <b>finite</b> <b>mass</b> nor to compute their motions. If an infinite mass object were to exist, any object of <b>finite</b> <b>mass</b> would be attracted with infinite force (and hence acceleration) by the infinite mass object, which is not what we can observe in reality. Sometimes infinite result of a physical quantity may mean that the theory being used to compute the result may be approaching the point where it fails. This may help to indicate the limitations of a theory.|$|E
2500|$|The Higgs {{mechanism}} {{is a process}} by which vector bosons can acquire rest mass without explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Initially, the mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, and the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the [...] "mass problem" [...] was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson (who had previously written papers on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity, and concluded in his 1963 paper on the Yang-Mills theory, that [...] "considering the superconducting analog... hese two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out... leaving <b>finite</b> <b>mass</b> bosons"), and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964, that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way {{in at least some}} non-relativistic cases, and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases.|$|E
2500|$|These {{approaches}} {{were quickly}} {{developed into a}} full relativistic model, independently and almost simultaneously, by three groups of physicists: by François Englert and Robert Brout in August 1964; by Peter Higgs in October 1964; and by Gerald Guralnik, Carl Hagen, and Tom Kibble (GHK) in November 1964. Higgs also wrote a short, but important, response published in September 1964 to an objection by Gilbert, which showed that if calculating within the radiation gauge, Goldstone's theorem and Gilbert's objection would become inapplicable. (Higgs later described Gilbert's objection as prompting his own paper.) Properties of the model were further considered by Guralnik in 1965, by Higgs in 1966, by Kibble in 1967, and further by GHK in 1967. The original three 1964 papers demonstrated that when a gauge theory is combined with an additional field that spontaneously breaks the symmetry, the gauge bosons may consistently acquire a <b>finite</b> <b>mass.</b> In 1967, Steven Weinberg [...] and Abdus Salam independently showed how a Higgs mechanism {{could be used to}} break the electroweak symmetry of Sheldon Glashow's unified model for the weak and electromagnetic interactions, (itself an extension of work by Schwinger), forming what became the Standard Model of particle physics.

INTRODUCTION In the limit of massless u, d, and s quarks, the QCD Lagrangian exhibits a global SU(3) L Θ SU(3) R symmetry which is assumed to be spontaneously broken to SU(3) V, thus giving rise to eight pseudoscalar Goldstone bosons which transform under SU(3) V as an octet.
