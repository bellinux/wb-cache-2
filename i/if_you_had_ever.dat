40|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> {{wanted to}} cut up a {{narrative}} and patch it back together in a new order; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> thought {{about the implications of}} singular linearity on literature and the thought process; or <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> wondered <b>if</b> the mind might favor a more associative, linkage based form of reading literature, then you may know of hypertext. Through a discussion of criticism ranging from post-structuralism to constructivism, I will argue that hypertext literature, specifically Michael Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s afternoon, a story and Shelley Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s Patchwork Girl, maps narratives like those the mind creates when forming and reading the text of one 2 ̆ 7 s reality and memory. ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{is nothing}} finer even in Shakespeare than that {{conception}} of the circle of rich men all pretending to rough it in the country, and the one really hungry man entering, sword in hand, and praising the city.

6000|$|... "Don't be silly, Adeline! Don't be romantic! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{been in love}} yourself, {{you would}} know that people outlive {{that as well as}} other things. Let's see how the drawing-room will do for the dance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{suppose the}} {{daughter}} hasn't waited for an opportunity. The mother had read that publisher's paragraph about your invalid, {{and wanted to}} know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard from her again. Women are personal in their literary interests." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, Pip," [...] replied Joe, [...] "as {{you and me}} {{were ever}} friends, and it were looked for'ard to betwixt us, as being calc'lated to lead to larks. Not but what, Pip, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> made {{objections}} to the business,--such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,--not but {{what they would have}} been attended to, don't you see?" ...|$|E

60|$|Well, {{gunpowder}} {{is strong}} sometimes: but not always. You may carry it in a flask, {{or in your}} hand, and then it is weak enough. It only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam. But steam is always strong. And {{if you look at}} a railway engine, still more <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen--which God forbid you should--a boiler explosion, you would agree with me, that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{remember}} that child's parents? No, you have grown so old, that I am always forgetting what a boy {{you ought to}} be; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen the tenderness of his father, and that sunbeam of a Meta, you would know all the more how we bless {{you for what you}} have spared them.

6000|$|SAID I, one night, when I had conquered myself, 'Mr. Granville,' - Mr. Granville Wharton {{his name}} was, - 'I doubt <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> yet {{so much as}} seen Miss Fareway.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You bear him no good will, madam," [...] said Holmes. [...] "Tell us {{then where}} we shall find him. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> aided him in evil, help us now and so atone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much better," [...] assented Fisher. [...] "It {{would be}} much better if you were English and very much better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> played fair. But what I've come to say can be said very shortly. I don't quite know how we stand with the law about that old Hawker story, but my chief object is to prevent England being entirely ruled by people like you.

6000|$|... "You think me {{foolish to}} call {{instruction}} a torment, {{but if you}} had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together, and how tired my poor mother {{is at the end of}} it, as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home, you would allow that 'to torment' and 'to instruct' might sometimes be used as synonymous words." ...|$|E
60|$|And now {{you will}} ask me, with more astonishment than ever, what {{possible}} use {{can there be}} in these destroying streams of fire? And certainly, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen a lava stream even when cool, and looked down, as I have done, at the great river of rough black blocks streaming away far and wide over the land, you would think it the most hideous and the most useless thing you ever saw. And yet, my dear child, there is One who told men to judge not according to the appearance, but to judge righteous judgment. He said that about matters spiritual and human: but it is quite as true about matters natural, which also are His work, and all obey His will.|$|E

6000|$|She laid by {{the brush}} and took up the duster; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> lived in Mrs. Poyser's household, you would know how the duster behaved in Dinah's hand--how it went into every small corner, and on every ledge {{in and out of}} sight--how it went again and again round every bar of the chairs, and every leg, and under and over {{everything}} that lay on the table, till it came to Adam's papers and rulers and the open desk near them. Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated, looking at them with a longing but timid eye. It was painful to see how much dust there was among them. As she was looking in this way, she heard Seth's step just outside the open door, towards which her back was turned, and said, raising her clear treble, [...] "Seth, is your brother wrathful when his papers are stirred?" ...|$|E

Wild folk are these here, gatherers of shell-fish and laver, and merciless to wrecked vessels, which they consider as their own by immemorial usage, or rather right divine. Significant, how an agricultural people is generally as cruel to wrecked seamen, as a fishing one is merciful. I could tell you twenty stories of the baysmen down there to the westward risking themselves like very heroes to save strangers' lives, and beating off the labouring folk who swarmed down for plunder from the inland hills.' ...|$|E

That's why I've got to have you with me in my dispensation. Male and female created He them in His image. I can swing all Leatherwood by myself, but Leatherwood's nothing. If I had you with me we could swing the world! Nancy, why don't you come to me?" [...] He flung his arms wide and bent his stalwart shape toward her. [...] "Leatherwood's nothing, I tell you. Why, you ought to see the towns Over-the-Mountains; you ought to see Philadelphia, where I came from the last thing. Everywhere the people are waiting for a sign, just as they've always been, and we would come with a sign--plenty of signs: the perfect Godhead, male and female, for the {{greatest}} sign of all. Why, I wonder there's a Christian woman living, with the slur that the idea of just one male God throws on women! Don't you know that the Egyptians and the Greeks and the Romans, and everybody but the Hebrews, had a married God, and that the Godhead was husband and wife? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> read anything at all you would know that." ...|$|E
60|$|It is no use {{to pretend}} that in {{little over a year}} I can have become {{accustomed}} to the eventlessness of life in Altruria. I go on for a good many days together and do not miss the exciting incidents you have in America, and then suddenly I am wolfishly hungry for the old sensations, just as now and then I want meat, though I know I should loathe the sight and smell of it if I came within reach of it. You would laugh, I dare say, at the Altrurian papers, and what they print for news. Most of the space is taken up with poetry, and character study in the form of fiction, and scientific inquiry of every kind. But now and then there is a report of the production of a new play in one of the capitals; or an account of an open-air pastoral in one of the communes; or the progress of some public work, like the extension of the National Colonnade; or the wonderful liberation of some section from malaria; or the story of some good man or woman's life, ended at the patriarchal age they reach here. They also print selected passages of capitalistic history, from the earliest to the latest times, showing how in war and pestilence and needless disaster the world outside Altruria remains essentially the same that it was at the beginning of civilization, with some slight changes through the changes of human nature for the better in its slow approaches to the Altrurian ideal. In noting these changes the writers get some sad amusement out {{of the fact that the}} capitalistic world believes human nature cannot be changed, though cannibalism and slavery and polygamy have all been extirpated in the so-called Christian countries, and these things were once human nature, which is always changing, while brute nature remains the same. Now and then they touch very guardedly on that slavery, worse than war, worse than any sin or shame conceivable to the Altrurians, in which uncounted myriads of women are held and bought and sold, and they have to note that in this the capitalistic world is without the hope of better things. You know what I mean, Dolly; every good woman knows the little she cannot help knowing; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> inquired into that horror, as I once felt obliged to do, you would think it the blackest horror of the state of things where it must always exist as long as there are riches and poverty. Now, when so many things in America seem bad dreams, I cannot take refuge in thinking that a bad dream; the reality was so deeply burnt into my brain by the words of some of the slaves; and when I think of it I want to grovel on the ground with my mouth in the dust. But I know this can only distress you, for you cannot get away from the fact as I have got away from it; that there it is in the next street, perhaps in the next house, and that any night when you leave your home with your husband, you may meet it at the first step from your door.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Epilepsy is {{generally}} perceived negatively as a lifelong, incurable disorder and is frequently {{thought of as}} a punishment for evil deeds. Having a person in the family with epilepsy is a stigma. This problem is not only happening in Indonesia, but also in communities around the world. 1 - 4 The aim of this survey was to investigate the awareness, understanding and attitude towards epilepsy in a population of Indonesian public. Methods: A face-to-face questionnaire interview survey was conducted by the author, 12 trained medical students and neurology residents at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital outpatient clinic from January ñ March 2004. The hospital was the regional referral hospital for West Java area. The words ëayaní or ësakalorí in Indonesian and Sundanese were used as substitutes for epilepsy if the respondent was not familiar with the word epilepsy. The list of questions asked were: 1. Are you an epilepsy patient? 2. Are there any of your family members suffering from epilepsy? 3. Have you ever heard the word ëepilepsyî? 4. Can you describe an epileptic seizure <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed one? 5. Do you think epilepsy is a contagious disease? 6. Do you think epilepsy is inherited? 7. Do you think epilepsy can be cured? 8. Should epilepsy patients take medication regularly, or only when seizures occur? 9. Do you think epilepsy patients can study as well as nonepilepsy ones? 10. Do you think epilepsy patient...|$|E
