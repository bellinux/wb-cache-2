500|$|The Milky Way is {{the galaxy}} that {{contains}} our Solar System.

The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin , from the Greek [...] ( [...] , [...] "milky circle"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610.

The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey.

Only 27% of the [...] area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993.

IGN complimented the Virtual Console version's gameplay, even though it was critical of Nintendo's decision to release an [...] "inferior" [...] NES port on the Virtual Console.

The Nintendo e-Reader version of Mario Bros. was slightly more well received by IGN, who praised the gameplay, but criticized it for lack of multiplayer and for not being worth the purchase because of the Super Mario Advance versions.|$|E
