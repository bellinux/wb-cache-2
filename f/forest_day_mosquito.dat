25|$|The Asian tiger {{mosquito}} particularly bites in forests during the day, so {{has been known}} as the <b>forest</b> <b>day</b> <b>mosquito.</b> Depending upon region and biotype, activity peaks differ, {{but for the most}} part, they rest during the morning and night hours. They search for their hosts inside and outside of human dwellings, but are particularly active outside. The size of the blood meal depends upon the size of the mosquito, but it is usually around 2 μl. Their bites are not necessarily painful, but they are more noticeable than those from other kinds of mosquitoes. Tiger mosquitoes generally tend to bite a human host more than once if they are able to.|$|E
40|$|The 3 Dimensional {{structure}} of a protein is an expedient for structure based drug design and identifying the conformational epitopes that are foremost for designing the vaccines. Chikungunya (CHIKV) is a heat sensitive RNA virus which causes a viral disease which is transmitted in humans by human-mosquito-human transmission. Disease mostly found in the tropic and subtropical countries mainly in South India and in few other Asian countries. The primary transmission agents of Chikungunya Virus are yellow fever mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) and <b>forest</b> <b>day</b> <b>mosquito</b> (_Aedes albopictus_). The <b>forest</b> <b>day</b> <b>mosquito</b> bites during day time and hence day time mosquito bite {{is the main reason}} for transmission. The main distinctive of the disease is a fever along with an arthritic type of pain in the joints. 3 D Structure of Chikungunya virus is not encountered in the PDB Databank. A Comparative modeling method was used for the prediction of the 3 D {{structure of}} Chikungunya virus. Modeled structure prvided substantial parameters under Ramachandran plot and stereochemical aspects of main chain and side chains through PROCHECK analysis. Finally the energy minimization protocols yielded a score of - 12063. 947 KJ/Mol and RMSD Value of 0. 29 oA. Structure Validation procedures proffer the use of present modeled structures for structure based drug design and other confirmative applications...|$|E
