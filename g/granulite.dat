The protoliths of mafic <b>granulites</b> were mostly cumulates (high Mg#, low SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3) of sub-alkaline magmas. The felsic <b>granulites</b> are metaigneous quartz-normative rocks and have relatively low concentration of Ba and Sr compared to the mafic types. The dykes consist of picritic basalts and two varieties of tholeiitic basalts, and in general show a complex mineralogy indicative of magma mixing. The picrites have primitive Mg#s, relatively high Nb, Zr, Sr, Ba and Ba/Y, with relatively low Nb/Zr and Nb/Y compared to the more evolved tholeiites. In terms of Sr-Nd isotope systematics the older (thol I) dykes are less contaminated compared to the younger ones (thol II). These characteristics are consistent with fractional crystallisation and mixing between evolved and primitive tholeiitic melts coupled with assimilation of lower crustal felsic <b>granulites.</b> Petrogenetic modelling indicates fairly high rates of contamination for mafic magmas with high abundances of both compatible and incompatible elements. Similar processes of lower crustal contamination may have resulted in production of two of the major Deccan Traps lava formations, the Poladpur and Mahabaleshwar Formations, which are geochemically analogous to the tholeiitic dykes...|$|R
40|$|Mafic <b>granulites</b> {{from the}} North China craton {{can be divided}} into two textural types, {{referred}} to as A- and B-types.

Most A-type mafic <b>granulites</b> preserve the prograde (M 1), peak (M 2) and post-peak near-isobaric cooling (M 3) assemblages, which are represented respectively by inclusions of hornblende + plagioclase + quartz, a peak mineralogy of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz + garnet, and overprinted by garnet + quartz sympletic coronas. These mineral assemblages and their P-T (pressure-temperature) estimates define anticlockwise P-T evolutionary paths. The B-type mafic <b>granulites</b> preserve the peak (M 1), post-peak near-isothermal decompression (M 2) and cooling (M 3) assemblages, which are represented by the peak assemblage of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + plagioclase + quartz + garnet ± hornblende, post-peak orthopyroxene + plagioclase ± clinopyroxene symplectites or coronas, and later hornblende + plagioclase + magnetite symplectites, respectively. These mineral assemblages and their P-T estimates define clockwise P-T paths. The anticlockwise P-T paths of the A-type mafic <b>granulites</b> in the eastern and western zones of the North China craton are consistent with a model of underplating and intrusion of mantle-derived magmas. In combination with lithological, structural and geochronological data, the eastern and western zones of the North China craton are considered to represent two continental blocks that developed through the interaction of mantle plumes with the lithosphere from the Palaeoarchaean to the Neoarchaean era. The B-type mafic <b>granulites</b> and associated rocks in the central zone represent a magmatic arc that was metamorphosed and deformed during amalgamation of the eastern and western continental blocks in the late Palaeoproterozoic era.

The slide-blocks preserve {{a record of the}} long-lived history of rifting which led to opening of the Jurassic Western Tethys Basin. 	The External Liguride ophiolites consist of (i) undepleted spinel-peridotites, partly re-equilibrated under plagioclase-facies conditions, which were interpreted as unroofed subcontinental mantle; (ii) rare gabbroic rocks (mainly troctolite to olivine-bearing gabbro) probably crystallised from N-MORB magmas; (iii) basalts with N- to T-MORB affinity covered by late Callovian-early Oxfordian radiolarian cherts. Both gabbroic rocks and basalts locally intrude the mantle peridotites and postdate their re-equilibration to plagioclase-facies conditions. 	The slide-blocks of lower continental crust are composed of gabbro-derived mafic <b>granulites</b> and felsic <b>granulites.</b> The latter include quartzo-feldspathic <b>granulites</b> and rare quartz-poor to quartz-free charnockitic rocks. In both mafic and felsic <b>granulites,</b> granulite-facies re-equilibration was followed by a retrograde metamorphic evolution to amphibolite-, greenschist- and subgreenschist-facies conditions. Retrogression is commonly accompanied by deformations progressively changing from plastic to brittle. 	The upper crustal rocks occurring as slide-blocks consist of Hercynian granitoids with orogenic affinity, mainly biotite-bearing granodiorites and peraluminous two-mica leucogranites. Locally, the granitoids intruded by basaltic dykes or capped by basaltic flows and radiolarian cherts. The granitoids underwent polyphase brittle deformations under subgreenschist-facies conditions which predated the basalt emplacement. 	The tectono-metamorphic evolution recorded by the slide-blocks of the External Liguride Units started in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian (about 290 Ma), with the emplacement at deep crustal levels of the gabbroic protoliths for the mafic <b>granulites.</b> The associated felsic <b>granulites</b> likely represent the remnants of the lower continental crust intruded by the gabbro-derived <b>granulites.</b> Mafic and felsic <b>granulites</b> subsequently underwent tectonic exhumation in Permo-Triassic times, as testified by the development of granulite- to amphibolite-facies ductile shear zones. The <b>granulites</b> were finally exhumed to shallow levels, probably in association with the subcontinental mantle, in late Triassic-middle Jurassic times. The latter period was most likely characterized by extensive brittle faulting at shallow crustal levels, thus giving rise to extensional allochtons formed by stretched slices of granitoids. The Western Tethys opening is finally testified by the basalt intrusion and effusion in the Late Jurassic, followed by deep-sea pelagic sedimentation. 	The External Liguride crustal stratigraphy can be regarded as a fossil example of the transitional realm at the continent-ocean boundary. This reconstruction fits well with the available data on the present-day continental margins derived from passive lithosphere stretching...|$|R

The THERMOCALC program yielded peak (M 2) P-T conditions of 13. 4 - 15. 5 kbar and 770 - 840 °C for the high-pressure <b>granulites</b> and 9 - 11 kbar and 820 - 870 °C for the medium-pressure <b>granulites,</b> based on the core compositions of garnet, matrix pyroxene and plagioclase. The P-T conditions of pyroxene + plagioclase symplectite and corona (M 3) were estimated at ~ 6 - 5 - 8. 0 kbar and 750 - 830 °C, and hornblende + plagioclase symplectile (M 4) at ~ 4. 5 - 6. 0 kbar and 680 - 790 °C.

An evaluation of the assemblages and textures and P–T estimates indicate a three-stage evolution of the sapphirine <b>granulites</b> and associated garnet–orthopyroxene granulites: (1) inclusion assemblages with sapphirine, spinel and quartz on the low-pressure prograde path (M 1 stage); (2) a peak UHT assemblage of porphyroblastic garnet–orthopyroxene (M 2 stage) and (3) a retrogression that resulted in orthopyroxene–cordierite intergrowths and biotite rims on Grt (M 3 stage). The sapphirine <b>granulites</b> and associated garnet–orthopyroxene <b>granulites</b> indicate that they grew during the prograde and retrograde stage. The thermo-barometric estimates from mineral compositions and the complimentary isochemical sections approached from bulk rock compositions allow tighter constraints to be placed on the P–T evolution of this sector of the EGB.

40|$|According to the {{observed}} mineral assemblages and calcu-lated PT conditions, exhumation of the Kutná Hora Crystalline Complex rocks occurred at different PT path comparing {{to that of}} the Moldanubian zone in Austria. In the Moldanubian zone, decompressional anatexis resulted in stabilization of LP mineral assemblages with sillimanite and spinel in migmatites and LP overprint of eclogites and HP <b>granulites.</b> In contrast, the Malín and Běstvina migmatites and felsic <b>granulites</b> are characterized by a PT path implying almost isobaric cooling. The presence of kyanite in leucosomes of migmatites suggests that anatexis occurred already during the high-pressure stage. The kyanite-bearing migmatites and HP felsic <b>granulites</b> of the Malín and Běstvina formations may represent well-preserved segment of extensively granulitized lower crust of the Variscan orogenic root, which was not affected by late LP overprint probably du...|$|R
