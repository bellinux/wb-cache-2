5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and {{spent a couple of}} hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves that he was an only child, and Treves <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|On 23 June, Quale {{stated that}} the inspectorate should never have {{approved}} the trains. He {{stated that the}} Sørland Line was extreme in Europe {{in the number of}} curves, and that this gave increased stress on the axles. The tests which were used to approve the trains had been done on the Dovre Line and with a Class 71 set equipped with tilting technology, a class which weighs less than Class 73. He further stated that NSB had controlled only part of the axle and that if proper tests had been made, the fatigue would have been discovered. NSB stated that they had tested the trains on a section of the Dovre Line they considered to be more curvy than the most curvy parts of the Sørland Line. There was also a misunderstanding in the approval, as NSB had said to DNV that the tests on the Dovre Line were not to be considered representative for the Sørland Line, while the inspectorate <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that DNV had approved the tests also for the Sørland Line. NSB stated that all tests would be done again before the trains were put back into service.|$|E
5|$|The detainees at Omarska had {{one meal}} a day. The food was usually spoiled {{and the process}} of getting the food, eating and {{returning}} the plate usually lasted around three minutes. Meals were often accompanied by beatings. The toilets were blocked and there was human waste everywhere. British journalist Ed Vulliamy testified that when he visited the camp, the detainees were in very poor physical condition. He witnessed them eating a bowl of soup and some bread and said that he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> they had not eaten in a long time; they appeared terrified. According to Vulliamy, the detainees drank water from a river that was polluted with industrial waste and many suffered from constipation or dysentery. No criminal report was ever filed against persons detained in the Omarska camp, nor were the detainees apprised of any concrete charges against them. Apparently, there was no legitimate reason justifying these people’s detention.|$|E

25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time I had wanted to meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E

25|$|Although the Inquisition was {{technically}} forbidden from permanently harming or drawing blood, {{this still}} allowed several methods of torture. The methods most used, and common in other secular and ecclesiastical tribunals, were garrucha, toca and the potro. The {{application of the}} garrucha, {{also known as the}} strappado, consisted of suspending the victim from the ceiling by the wrists, which are tied behind the back. Sometimes weights were tied to the ankles, with a series of lifts and drops, during which the arms and legs suffered violent pulls and were sometimes dislocated. The toca, also called interrogatorio mejorado del agua, consisted of introducing a cloth into the mouth of the victim, and forcing them to ingest water spilled from a jar so that they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of drowning. The potro, the rack, was the instrument of torture used most frequently.|$|E
25|$|Five months later, the two {{met again}} in Biarritz in a regular season match. A massive fistfight, in which almost all players were {{involved}} broke out after just 5 minutes, after a scrum went up and the first rows exploded. The referee handed two yellows and two reds to Stade's Arnaud Marchois and BO's Imanol Harinordoquy. The rest was extremely rough, full of scuffles and insults. Stade {{went on to win}} 14–7. As can be expected, everyone condemned the other camp after the match. Biarritz coach Patrice Lagisquet assured Paris had assaulted his players to destabilise them, while the Parisians acknowledged that the overtime loss in the Top 14 final had been hard to swallow, especially as they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Biarritz had overemphasised the physical side. Ever since, the matches between the two teams have been relatively quiet.|$|E
25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{would like}} to look at the 2 ̆ 2 {{emergence}} 2 ̆ 2 of legislation in two different senses. First, there is the historical emergence of legislation as a distinct fonn of legal writing. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that legislation is often seen as something modrn when it is ancient with legislative texts predating just about all other legal and non-legal texts. To work out how ancient the legislative tradition is, we have to decide what we treat as legislation. Second, there is the possibility of legislation emerging as a significant topic for law and literature studies. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that legislation is often seen as peripheral and ephemeral when it is now central and structural. I also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that legislation is seen as a barren area for law and literature studies when there are some interesting questions to ask about how legislative texts work and how they fail. I would be happy to be wrong in these impressions. It is encouraging to see a couple of sessions at this conference devoted to legislation...|$|R
25|$|Six of the Cázares men, Rodolfo Cázares Garza, Manuel Alberto Cázares Garza, Héctor Cázares Garza, Rodolfo Ignacio Cázares Solís, Rubén Luna Mendoza, and Rodolfo Garza Solís, {{were kept}} together. The women and children, {{along with one}} of the grandfathers, were kept in a {{separate}} vehicle throughout most of the first day. After leaving the house, the captors drove them around the city for several hours and switched them into different vehicles on busy streets in broad daylight. The kidnappers drove several of the vehicles they took from the family's homes. According to one family member, the kidnappers even stopped for gas and did not pay for the service. In their portable radio conversations while driving, the family heard them speaking about avoiding Los Zetas, the rival crime syndicate of the Gulf Cartel. That evening, the women were taken to a hostage safe house where at least twenty other men were drinking and smoking cannabis. The windows in this disclosed location were covered. A shootout broke out near the premises and the victims were transported to another location in another SUV (while in the vehicle, the family was blindfolded and placed next to a corpse). The Cázares <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that they kidnappers were looking where to hide their victims. The family believes that the kidnappers moved them around Matamoros for hours because they did not expect to find {{a lot of people in}} the houses where they carried out the abductions.|$|E

500|$|The Navy's Task Force 77 {{took its}} orders via 7th Fleet from CINCPAC, a Navy admiral based in Honolulu, through his subordinate, the Air Force {{commander}} of Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).

General William Momyer, commander of the Seventh, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that CINCPAC and PACAF wanted to keep the Thai-based aircraft out of his hands. [...] "By denying Momyer, they were really denying Westmoreland and keeping air operations against the DRV under their control." [...] To complicate matters, the U.S. ambassadors to Thailand (Graham Martin) and Laos (William H. Sullivan) exerted undue influence over operational and command arrangements.|$|E

500|$|In October 1956 Mikoyan {{was sent}} to the People's Republic of Hungary to gather {{information}} on the developing crisis caused by the revolution against the communist government there. Together with Mikhail Suslov, Mikoyan traveled to Budapest in an armored personnel carrier, in view of the shooting in the streets. He sent a telegram to Moscow reporting his impressions of the situation. [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Ernő Gerő especially, but the other comrades as well, are exaggerating the strength of the opponent and underestimating their own strength," [...] he and Suslov wrote. Mikoyan strongly opposed the decision by Khrushchev and the Politburo to use Soviet troops, believing it would destroy the Soviet Union's international reputation, instead arguing for the application of [...] "military intimidation" [...] and economic pressure. The crushing of the revolution by Soviet forces nearly led to Mikoyan's resignation.|$|E

The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane's initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown, were, [...] "it was as if there was a little dead person in ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd." [...] Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from Thunderbirds and gauging the response from colleagues: [...] "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did." [...] Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design, a result on which Terry Curtis remembers: ...|$|E

In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences.

500|$|Analysis of the Burgess Shale fossils {{has been}} {{important}} to {{the interpretation of the}} Precambrian and Cambrian fossil records, and thus to scientific {{understanding of the nature of}} early evolution. English geologist and palaeontologist William Buckland (1784–1856) realised that a dramatic change in the fossil record occurred around the start of the Cambrian period, [...] The earliest Cambrian trilobite fossils are about 530millionyears old, but were already both diverse and widespread, suggesting that the group had a long, hidden history. The earliest fossils widely accepted as echinoderms appeared at about the same time Because Darwin's contemporaries had insufficient information to establish relative dates of Cambrian rocks, they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that animals appeared instantaneously. Charles Darwin regarded the solitary existence of Cambrian trilobites and total absence of other intermediate fossils as the [...] "gravest" [...] problem to his theory of natural selection, and he devoted an entire chapter of The Origin of Species on the matter. He speculated that the phenomenon, now known as the Cambrian explosion, was a product of gaps in the sequence of fossil-bearing rocks and in contemporary knowledge of those rocks.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man".

[...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible.

Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would {{carry on a conversation}} with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
500|$|Tricky asked Mark Saunders to co-produce Maxinquaye {{after being}} {{impressed}} by his previous work with English rock band The Cure on their albums Mixed Up (1990) and Wish (1992). They recorded Maxinquaye {{in the first half}} of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in Kilburn; further recording later took place at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in Notting Hill. Island Records, 4th & B'Way's parent label, set up equipment in the home studio at Tricky's request, including an Akai S1000 sampler, an Atari 1040 computer with Logic software, an Alesis ADAT recorder, an AKG C3000 microphone, a Behringer Composer compressor, and a Mackie 1604 mixing desk. The recording sessions were somewhat chaotic, and Saunders, who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> he would only perform engineering duties, often found himself serving as a DJ and programmer. Tricky instructed him on what to sample, regardless of different tempos and pitches, and asked him to piece the results together, something Saunders achieved by pitch-shifting the respective samples until the combination sounded satisfactory. The samples they experimented with were taken from the many vinyl records that Saunders recalled were [...] "littered" [...] all over Tricky's floor. Influenced by dub music's production techniques, Tricky exhaustively altered borrowed sounds on his sampler, mixed tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and preserved sounds that otherwise would have been unwanted in the final mix, including glitches and crackles.|$|E
