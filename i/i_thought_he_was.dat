25|$|A {{great effort}} {{would have been}} needed by the England batsmen {{to put them in}} a {{position}} beyond defeat, and Milton and Bailey went to the wicket with a load on their shoulders. Benaud at once set a very aggressive field, especially to Bailey, where he fielded only three yards from the bat to Meckiff's bowling, a little deeper for Davidson. Bailey had a word with Benaud, no doubt asking him not to move when the bowler was running up to bowl. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so close that if Bailey had put his bat out to swing at a ball he would have hit him.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over.

500|$|Lee Larkins, {{who played}} for Purdue {{and was one of}} the top {{defensive}} backs in the Big Ten, said in 1976 that Bell was the best running back he ever played against. [...] As a senior, Larkins played against Gordon Bell, Archie Griffin, and Ricky Bell of USC. [...] Larkins said: [...] "Gordon Bell was the best of the three. [...] He was a super tough runner and a tough guy to make a solid tackle on.

500|$|While {{working at}} Rádio Nacional in 1939, he met Brazilian vocalist Adelaide Tostes, who {{is better known}} by her stage name Stella Maris, and the two married in 1940. Tostes responded to a 1994 press query about Caymmi's habit of frequenting bars with a short story: [...] "One night I went to look for him in a bar ... He was {{surrounded}} by women. I went in and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> involved with drugs, but it wasn't the case. He was with the tramps." [...] Despite such incidents, however, they remained together for 68 years, {{until his death in}} 2008. The couple had three children, Nana, Danilo, and Dori, all of whom followed their father into musical careers.|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Bert Berns, and just before he left for New York made a speech to his friends and ended with: [...] "One day you'll see my picture up on the wall and you'll all say 'I knew him'." [...] An acquaintance who witnessed the speech told the author: [...] "He knew he was different and that his music was good but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> such a nasty character; always rude and quite vulgar." [...] Morrison recorded the song [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] in New York with Berns, as well as the album Astral Weeks. He became much more popular with the album Moondance, and Rolling Stone commented he had [...] "the striking imagination of a consciousness that is visionary in the strongest sense of the word".

500|$|On 14 December 2002, Waddle, {{accompanied}} by Charles Gittins, traveled to Japan to apologize personally to the victims' families. [...] On 15 December, Waddle visited the Ehime Maru memorial at Uwajima Fisheries High School {{and placed a}} wreath of white lilies before {{a monument to the}} dead, bowed in silence and then read the victims' names aloud. [...] No local officials were present during Waddle's visit, citing statements from some victims' families that they did not want Waddle to visit. [...] Later that day, Waddle met with some of {{the families of the victims}} and with some of the survivors. [...] The next day, in Tokyo, Waddle met with Masumi Terata. [...] Speaking of her meeting with Waddle, Terata stated, [...] "I am first and foremost the family member of a victim and Mr. Waddle is first and foremost a victimizer.

500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one who is going to stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode." [...] She also praised Helms for [...] "prov once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical." ...|$|E
500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said.

I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E

500|$|Although by {{the early}} 1960s Levin was {{becoming}} a well-known name, his was not yet a well-known face. Meeting him in London the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis did not immediately recognise him: [...] "He looks about sixteen, and at first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> someone’s little boy brought along to see the fun – very Jewish, with wavy fairish hair, very intelligent and agreeable to talk to". In 1963 Levin was invited to appear regularly on BBC television's new weekly late-night satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was, where he delivered monologues to camera about his pet hates and conducted interviews, appearing as [...] "a tiny figure taking on assorted noisy giants in debate". The programme, which had a short but much-discussed run, was transmitted live; this added to its edginess and impact, but also made it prone to disruption. Levin was twice assaulted on air, once by the husband of an actress whose show Levin had reviewed severely, and once by a woman astrologer who squirted him with water.|$|E
500|$|On March 21, 2005, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, co-stars of The Ring Two (2005), {{were cast}} as Wendy Christensen and Kevin Fischer. Winstead, who had auditioned {{for the second}} Final Destination film, won the role because her {{portrayal}} of the character's emotion impressed Wong and Morgan. Wong {{said that he had}} originally intended for Wendy to be a [...] "perky blonde" [...] and reworked the character slightly after Winstead was cast; he believed the actors were right for their roles. On Winstead, he said that [...] " [...] a kind of soulfulness to her role as Wendy" [...] and her character [...] "is deeply affected by the accident, but she's strong, and fights to maintain control". On Merriman, he said that [...] "the moment [...] came in <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the right guy to play Kevin" [...] and described the character as [...] "the kind of guy you want to hang out with, your goofy best buddy, but also someone who could rise to the occasion and become a hero".|$|E
500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a terrific guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job.

500|$|As one of {{the founders}} of the {{cyberpunk}} genre, William Gibson has repeatedly been asked for his opinion on the subject of the mainstreaming of cyberpunk, which has often brought up the topic of Idol's album. In a 1994 interview, Gibson said that he did not approve of the way the term [...] "cyberpunk" [...] was being increasingly commercialised by popular culture, and that Idol had [...] "turned it into something very silly." [...] Gibson also said in another interview that to understand cyberpunk as a movement was [...] "something of a joke, as wonderfully demonstrated, not too long ago, by Billy Idol's Cyberpunk album." [...] Despite his negative comments, Gibson was bemused, rather than angered, by Idol's creation. Stating that he'd tried to withhold judgment before hearing the album, he eventually did and said [...] "...I just don't get what he's on about. I don't see the connection. [...] I had lunch with Billy years ago in Hollywood... and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a very likeable guy. He had a sense of humour about what he was doing that is not apparent in the product he puts out. If I run into him again, we can have a good laugh about what he's doing now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> kidding."
