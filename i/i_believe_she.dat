Topping continued to visit Hindley in prison, along with her solicitor Michael Fisher and her spiritual counsellor, the Reverend Peter Timms, {{who had been a}} prison governor before resigning to become a minister in the Methodist Church. She made a formal confession to police on 10 February 1987, admitting her involvement in all five murders, but news of her confession was not made public for more than a month. The tape recording of her statement was over 17hours long; Topping described it as a [...] "very well worked out performance in which, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>she</b> told me just as much as she wanted me to know, and no more". He also commented that he [...] "was {{struck by the fact that}} she was never there when the killings took place. She was in the car, over the brow of the hill, in the bathroom and even, in the case of the Evans murder, in the kitchen". Topping concluded that he felt he [...] "had witnessed a great performance rather than a genuine confession".|$|E
2500|$|I {{arrived at}} another {{cataract}} of 26 feet. ... below this fall {{at a little}} distance a beatifull little Island well timbered is situated about {{the middle of the}} river. in this Island on a Cottonwood tree an Eagle has placed her nest; a more inaccessible spot <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> could not have found; for neither man nor beast dare pass those gulphs which separate her little domain from the shores. the water is also broken in such manner as it descends over this pitch that the mist or sprey rises to a considerable hight. this fall is certainly much the greatest I ever behald except those two which I have mentioned below. it is incomparably a greater cataract and a more noble interesting object than the celibrated falls of Potomac or Soolkiln ...|$|E
2500|$|Her favored genre and {{personality}} in her music is pop ballad. Thu Minh covered many immortal English songs of popular singers like Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, or Whitney Houston. These {{have been so}} familiar to many Vietnamese who love international music since the late 1990s in Vietnam such that [...] "All by Myself", [...] "Saving All My Love for You", [...] "The Reason", [...] "Queen of the Night", [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now","Ave Maria" [...] in Schubert's version were performed successfully. Among many great international singers, Thu Minh is greatly influenced by Whitney Houston as Thu Minh's performing style, charisma and vocal technique are somewhat a mirror reflected by Whitney's in soul songs such as: [...] "I Will Always Love You", [...] "Saving All My Love for You", [...] "I Have Nothing" [...] or [...] "Queen of the Night". Sharing her thoughts on idol Houston, Thu Minh expressed her huge admiration for the strong, emotional voice of this departed Diva when the news of her death was reported: [...] "Indeed, Whitney owned an endowed rare vocal in the world: both rich, warm and high. Particularly with only Whitney Houston, she did not only {{have the ability to}} sing [...] for easy listening, but also could field the high and tough notes with quirky techniques, which demonstrated her gorgeous class. Whitney owned all the prosperous elements to become the worldwide diva. Her voice was internally powerful and fully energetic, sometimes melodious, sometimes warmly high and always rich, full of marvelous, powerful sounds. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>she</b> had a perfect structure of palate, larynx and vocal cords for music. I appreciate her splendid voice as a precious diamond." ...|$|E
