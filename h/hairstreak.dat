5|$|The green <b>hairstreak,</b> purple <b>hairstreak,</b> hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth may be seen, and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The green <b>hairstreak,</b> purple <b>hairstreak,</b> comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded yellow or Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E
5|$|The grasslands, heathland, {{meadows and}} mire support {{extensive}} populations of birds such as barn owls (Tyto alba) and nightjar, with butterflies including marbled white (Melanargia galathea), green <b>hairstreak</b> (Callophrys rubi) and the gatekeeper butterfly (Pyronia tithonus). The flora includes the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), corky fruited water dropwort (pimpinelloides), green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio), heather (Calluna vulgaris), lousewort (Pedicularis) and birds foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The hedgerows and woodlands {{are made up}} of ash, hazel (Corylus), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) which support populations of dormouse (Gliridae), common lizards, siskin, stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and the purple <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly (Neozephyrus quercus). The rivers and streams are home to kingfisher, otter and the Daubenton's bat.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Theclinae is a {{group of}} butterflies, including the <b>hairstreaks,</b> elfins and allies, in the family Lycaenidae. There are many tropical species {{as well as a number}} found in the Americas. Tropical <b>hairstreaks</b> often have iridescent blue coloration above, caused by reflected light from the structure of the wing scales rather than by pigment. <b>Hairstreaks</b> from North America are commonly brown above. Few Theclinae are migratory. Members of this group are described as 'thecline'.|$|R
50|$|All green <b>hairstreaks</b> appear very similar.|$|R

5|$|Several rare {{butterflies}} are {{indigenous to}} the area, including the nationally scarce pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), and white-letter <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium w-album). The {{large blue butterfly}} (Maculinea arion) became extinct in the hills in the late 1970s, since when a research project has been undertaken into its ecology and reintroduction. The white-clawed crayfish is also nationally rare and is a declining species with small populations in {{a tributary of the}} Mells River and the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter <b>hairstreak</b> (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) occur on the limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E
5|$|The various {{habitats}} provide {{homes to}} numerous species of insects. There are 700 moth species {{recorded in the}} nature reserve, again {{a quarter of the}} national total. At different spots across the site butterflies (including the green <b>hairstreak),</b> damselflies (like the large red), and dragonflies (such as the hairy dragonfly) can be observed. According to a 2005 report, the exceedingly rare thirteen-spotted ladybird (Hippodamia 13-punctata) was recently observed at the head, the first sighting in the UK since 1952.|$|E
50|$|Artopoetes is a genus of {{butterflies}} {{in the family}} Lycaenidae. It is a small east Asian genus of tailless <b>hairstreaks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{family is}} {{traditionally}} divided into the subfamilies {{of the blues}} (Polyommatinae), the coppers (Lycaeninae), the <b>hairstreaks</b> (Theclinae) and the harvesters (Miletinae).|$|R
50|$|The Old World (Asia and Europe) {{members of}} this genus are {{commonly}} known as green <b>hairstreaks,</b> while the North American ones are called elfins.|$|R
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal {{and do not}} hibernate. They are omnivores, {{and feed}} on other insects {{including}} caterpillars and spiders, as well as honey water. M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial <b>hairstreak</b> butterflies, even jumping while carrying them. Predators of the M. nigrocincta (and the Myrmecia genus as a whole) includes spiders, birds, lizards, mammals and other predatory invertebrates, including assassin bugs and Redbacks. The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity to effect pollination.|$|E
5|$|The south part of {{the woods}} {{is an area of}} former pasture {{woodland}} with old pollards, mainly oak and some small-leaved lime. To the north, the area comprises ancient woodland of old coppice with standards and contains a rich variety of trees. Rare trees include Bristol whitebeam (Sorbus bristoliensis) and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis). There are multiple species of Sorbus within the woods with at least nine native and four imported species, {{making it one of the}} most important sites in Britain for this tree. Birds which live in the woods include the raven (Corvus) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Many butterflies and moths can be seen in summer including the white-letter <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium w-album).|$|E
5|$|Other insects {{commonly}} found on great mullein feed exclusively on Verbascum species in general or V.thapsus in particular. They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used for biological control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray <b>hairstreak</b> (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E
5000|$|Theclinae - <b>hairstreaks</b> (usually tailed) and elfins (not tailed) (global) may be {{ranked as}} a tribe of Lycaeninae (Theclini) see the clade below right. Selected species ...|$|R
50|$|This {{site has}} a {{wildlife}} garden, woodland, meadows and lakes. Over 350 species of flowering {{plants have been}} recorded, and 30 butterflies including white admirals, green <b>hairstreaks,</b> marbled whites and grizzled skippers.|$|R
50|$|The site {{consists}} of areas of species-rich grassland and ash woodland. Bird's foot trefoil provides food for common blue butterflies, and other butterlies include purple <b>hairstreaks.</b> Nightingales {{nest in the}} trees and hedges.|$|R
5|$|The Albany Pine Bush {{is home to}} {{hundreds}} of species of Lepidoptera (moths), including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists. The most well-known species in the area is the Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov. The butterfly {{is now on the}} Endangered Species List. Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens, it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites. Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae â€“ the wild blue lupine, which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat. Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper (Atrytonopsis hianna), Henry's elfin (Incisalia henrici), frosted elfin (Incisalia irus), and Edward's <b>hairstreak</b> (Satyrium edwardsii). The inland barrens buck moth (Hemileuca maia) is a state-listed special concern animal; and other rare moths include the broad-lined catopyrrha (Catopyrrha coloraria), several noctuid moths (Apharetra purpurea, Chaetaglaea cerata, Chytonix sensilis, Macrochilo bivittata, and Zanclognatha martha), bird dropping moth (Cerma cora), and a geometrid moth (Itame). The Albarufan dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct.|$|E
25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; ramsons (Allium ursinum), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple <b>hairstreak,</b> white-letter <b>hairstreak</b> and speckled wood butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and stag beetles. Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E
25|$|The {{cracks and}} crevices in the wattle's bark are home for many insects and invertebrates. The rare Tasmanian <b>hairstreak</b> {{butterfly}} lays her eggs in these cracks, which hatch to produce caterpillar larva attended by ants (Iridomyrmex sp.) that feed off the sweet exudates from the larva.|$|E
5000|$|Fifteen {{species of}} {{butterfly}} {{have been recorded}} in this wood, including brimstones, speckled woods and purple <b>hairstreaks.</b> There are many wild cherry trees, and twenty-two seasonal ponds, which have scarce and protected great crested newts.|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the site}} is semi-deciduous {{woodland}} which has woodpeckers and muntjac deer, and butterflies including white-letter and purple <b>hairstreaks.</b> In grassland areas there are the rare adder's-tongue fern and the locally scarce four-spot orb weaver spider.|$|R
50|$|Around 90 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} as breeding on the reserve, and six species of bat, including the pipistrelle and brown long-eared bat. Butterfly species include purple <b>hairstreaks,</b> commas and peacocks. Dragonflies include golden ringed, common hawker and four spotted chaser.|$|R
25|$|Bird {{species that}} {{reside in the}} oak woods include blue tit, common chaffinch, goldcrest, European robin, and wren. Mammals include badger, fox, pine marten, red deer, sika deer, and red squirrel. Insects include many species of the {{parasitic}} gall wasp and the purple <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.|$|E
25|$|Other notable insects {{include two}} other moths, {{northern}} drab, Orthosia opima, and dingy shell, Euchoeca nebulata, and a butterfly, the green <b>hairstreak,</b> Callophrys rubi. Another butterfly, the small pearl-bordered fritillary, Boloria selene, {{used to be}} common at Waldridge Fell but within County Durham is now confined to only four locations, all on heathland at around 300metres above sea level.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife. Insects {{found here}} that are scarce in the UK include the {{bleached}} pug (Eupithecia expallidata) and alder kitten (Furcula bicuspis) moths, {{as well as the}} soldier beetle species Malthius frontalis. Locally scarce insects include the green <b>hairstreak</b> butterfly (Callophrys rubi) and the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca). The site provides a habitat for butterflies, with common species including the comma, gatekeeper, red admiral, speckled wood and tortoiseshell.|$|E
50|$|The former Stow St Mary Halt {{railway station}} has marshes, a pond and scrub, {{together}} with adjoining pasture {{which is also}} part of the reserve. Butterflies include purple and white-letter <b>hairstreaks,</b> and there are flowers such as common fleabane and wild carrot.|$|R
50|$|This {{traditional}} {{hay meadow}} has over 100 plant species, including lady's bedstraw, green winged orchids and cuckooflowers. It also has {{many species of}} butterfly, such as orange tip and rare black and brown <b>hairstreaks.</b> other wildlife includes brown hares, kestrels and moths.|$|R
5000|$|A {{butterfly}} hunter {{writing for}} Orion magazine describes:...hairstreaks - [...] "hair" [...] for the tiny tails many kinds trail from their hindwings, [...] "streak" [...] for their stripes, or perhaps derived from their zippy flight. Many <b>hairstreaks</b> make their appearance early, then are seen no more...Goldy-green {{with a white}} stripe below, it blends perfectly with its larval host...I found the plant, and the butterfly, in its type locality (= place of original collection and description) - the Sandia Mountains, outside Albuquerque. What very different worlds: the beargrass mounts, the huge nearby casino, the city beyond. <b>Hairstreaks,</b> with their specific botanical needs and moist-spring ways, may {{be some of the}} first butterflies to feel the warming and drying, and to abandon historical ranges. But the Sandia is still there for now.|$|R
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green <b>hairstreak,</b> brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as water shrew, field voles, and harvest mice are present. Adders, slowworms and common lizards can also be found on the common.|$|E
500|$|Iridomyrmex ants share {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} many caterpillars, aphids and coccids. Workers protect these caterpillars and will sometimes {{take them to}} their feeding chambers inside the nest. [...] In the genus Jalmenus, workers attend to the butterflies Jalmenus clementi (turquoise <b>hairstreak),</b> Jalmenus daemeli (emerald <b>hairstreak),</b> Jalmenus eichhorni (northern <b>hairstreak),</b> Jalmenus icilius (amethyst <b>hairstreak),</b> Jalmenus inous (varied <b>hairstreak)</b> and Jalmenus lithochroa (Waterhouse's <b>hairstreak).</b> In the genus Ogyris, attendants include Ogyris amaryllis (satin azure), Ogyris olane (olane azure) and Ogyris oroetes (silky azure). Additional species workers attend include Anthene lycaenoides (pale ciliate blue), Candalides heathi (rayed blue), Candalides margarita (trident pencil-blue), Deudorix diovis (bright cornelian), Euchrysops cnejus (gram blue), Lampides boeticus (pea blue), Leptotes plinius (plumbago blue), Lucia limbaria (chequered copper), Nesolycaena caesia (Kimberly spotted opal), Neolucia agricola (fringed heath-blue) and Theclinesthes serpentata (saltbush blue). I. bicknelli is an effective pollinator of Microtis parviflora, and one study suggests the pollen is not harmed by contact of these ants.|$|E
500|$|Many insects have {{filamentous}} [...] "tails" [...] at {{the ends}} of their wings and patterns of markings on the wings themselves. These combine to create a [...] "false head". This misdirects predators such as birds and jumping spiders (Salticidae). Spectacular examples occur in the <b>hairstreak</b> butterflies; when perching on a twig or flower, they commonly do so upside down and shift their rear wings repeatedly, causing antenna-like movements of the [...] "tails" [...] on their wings. Studies of rear-wing damage support the hypothesis that this strategy is effective in deflecting attacks from the insect's head.|$|E
50|$|The {{spread out}} {{population}} of this milkweed proposes a problem, mainly pollination, but Curtiss's milkweed has specialized flowers that only allow certain insects - that seek out this plant - to pollinate it. These insects include skipper butterflies and <b>hairstreaks,</b> which {{were found in}} abundance on the flowers of Asclepias curtissii.|$|R
50|$|The two {{pale blue}} subelliptic eggs per clutch measure some 23-31.5 mm long by about 17-22 mm wide and weigh about 5 grams each. They look unusual for this genus {{as they have}} a circle of blackish-brown <b>hairstreaks</b> and dots around the blunt end. They are laid in a bulky cup nest 2-4 m high in a tree.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} a dump for motor {{vehicles}} until 1976, when it was acquired by Wycombe Council. The Chiltern Society took over the management in 2013. It is steeply sloping chalk grassland with a diverse range of species, including birds such bullfinches, blackcaps and garden warblers, are butterflies such as dingy, grizzled skippers and green <b>hairstreaks.</b>|$|R
