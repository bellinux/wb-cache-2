To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the HS technique, the power spectral density (PSD) is used for comparison. To implement PSD, the mean values of ten local bands are used as <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> whose half bandwidth is set as 2  Hz. Eight of ten center frequencies of the local bands are calculated using Eq. (1) with k =  1 and β =  1, 2, …, 8. The other two center frequencies are computed using f^'_e 1 with k =  1 and f^'_e 2 with k =  2. In addition, a variant of the HS technique is employed for comparison, in which the center characteristic frequencies in the synthesized local spectra rather than the mean values are utilized as <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> and is denoted by CHS. The frequency components in Eq. (9) with m =  1, 2, …, 8, and the two center frequencies of the synthesized local spectra derived from Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively, are used as <b>fault</b> <b>indicators</b> of the CHS method. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) based <b>fault</b> <b>indicators</b> [13] will be used for comparison. Since this work focuses on the analysis of the current signal based <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> only the current signal related <b>fault</b> <b>indicators</b> provided in Ref. [13] will be used for comparison. The HHT is applied to current signal analysis to generate <b>fault</b> <b>indicators.</b> The mean values of four local bands centered at f^'_e 1 with k =  1, 2, and f^'_e 2 with k =  2, 3, and averaged Hilbert marginal spectrum in local bands centered at f^'_e 1 with k =  1, and f^'_e 2 with k =  2, in the first two intrinsic mode functions (IMF), and averaged instantaneous amplitudes of the first two IMFs are used as <b>fault</b> <b>indicators.</b> The half bandwidth of these local bands in HHT is set as 2  Hz.|$|R

A single instrument called a [...] "hipot tester" [...] {{is often used to}} perform this test. It applies the necessary voltages to a device and monitors leakage current. The current can trip a <b>fault</b> <b>indicator.</b> The tester has output overload protection. The test voltage may be either direct current or alternating current at power frequency or other frequency, like resonant frequency (30 to 300 Hz determined by load) or VLF (0.01 Hz to 0.1 Hz), when convenient. The maximum voltage is given in the test standard for the particular product. The application rate may also be adjusted to manage leakage currents resulting from inherent capacitive effects of the test object. The duration of the test may be up to 60 seconds or more. The applied voltage, rate of application and test duration depend on the specification requirements of the equipment. Different test standards apply for consumer electronics, military electrical devices, high voltage cables, switchgear and other apparatus.|$|E

The asymptotic value of the proposed <b>fault</b> <b>indicator</b> is independent of the functional observer parameters and also the convergence rate of the <b>fault</b> <b>indicator</b> can be altered by choosing appropriate functional observer parameters. The advantage of using this new method is that the observed system is not necessarily needed to be observable; therefore, the proposed fault detection technique is also applicable for systems where state observers cannot be designed; moreover, the functional observer fault detection scheme is always of reduced order in comparison to a state observer based scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of high-performance static converters and advanced control techniques {{has led to}} a widespread diffusion of asynchronous drive systems in industrial plants. One of the strong points of the induction machines is their reliability; however, an unexpected failure may still result in a considerable economic loss. This fact has stimulated a prolific research activity concerning the continuous monitoring of the wear status of induction machines. The knowledge of their condition allows implementing condition-based maintenance techniques, which have proven to be very effective in critical processes. In previous papers, the authors have focused their attention on the detection of broken rotor bars in inverter-fed induction machines. Two indexes have been defined: Both of them are simple methods to estimate the same <b>fault</b> <b>indicator,</b> namely, the ratio between the amplitude of the power oscillation and the average power draw of the drive system. However, this <b>fault</b> <b>indicator</b> exhibits a noticeable dependence on the mechanical load {{as well as on the}} speed loop parameters. In this paper, a deep investigation about these dependences is provided. The study suggests introducing a new <b>fault</b> <b>indicator</b> which is much less sensitive with respect to the torque developed by the motor. Furthermore, the analysis allows predicting how the speed loop affects the fault detection techniques. The results of the study and the effectiveness of the new <b>fault</b> <b>indicator</b> have been first verified by means of numerical simulations and then validated through an experimental activity...|$|E

The ANFIS is trained and integrated in a high-order particle filter to describe the fault propagation process; the high-order particle filter uses real-time data to update the current state estimates so as to improve the prediction accuracy.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using Air Break Switches, Drift down Lift Off switches, (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented feeder scheme. But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> Non GSM <b>fault</b> <b>indicators</b> and Load break switch to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> Non GSM type <b>fault</b> <b>indicators</b> were identified. So 10 number of GSM type <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> 20 number of Non GSM type <b>fault</b> <b>indicators,</b> 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible. Also the significant improvement of reliability could be observed...|$|R
