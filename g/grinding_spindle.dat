40|$|In diamond {{grinding}} cutting forces {{affect the}} quality of the machined surface. We can estimate a wear rate of the diamond wheel by the magnitude of the forces and promptly resort to the restoration of its cutting properties. To solve this problem it is necessary to define a relationship between grinding wheel wear and cutting forces. There was no this dependence found in the sources of literature. The forces acting on a single worn diamond grain are considered to find the relationship between wheel wear and cutting forces. The main forces acting on the diamond grain are such as a reaction force of machining material, a frictional force over a worn place of the grain, and a total pressure on the contact surface of the grain and machining material. According to calculation results, in grinding the cutting forces are proportional to the hardness of machining material, and depend on the grain wear, {{as well as on the}} process operation conditions. The paper presents a technique for calculating the number of cutting (active) grains per unit surface of diamond wheel to determine a total cutting force in grinding. The number of cutting grains depends on the properties of diamond wheel and on the operation conditions of grinding process. During grinding a total cutting force is calculated through the single grain cutting force, the number of cutting grains per unit surface of the grinding wheel and the contact area between the wheel and the work piece. Theoretical calculation of the forces is based on the condition that protrusions of all cutting grains are identical and all grains have a maximum wear, i. e. maximum worn place of grain. Calculations based on proposed theoretical formulas are compared with the calculations from the empirical formulas given in the literature. Varying the operation conditions of grinding makes the comparison. Convergence of results in the range of 5 - 20 % is regarded as acceptable. On the BMSTU base flat diamond grinding of tungsten carbide (Т 15 К 6) work pieces was experimentally made. Experiments were carried out on the universal flat-grinding machine 3 G 71 M using a diamond grinding wheel 6 А 2 250 х 20 х 4 х 29 х 76 АС 6 160 / 125 А 1 100 % М 1 - 01  according to GOST 16170 - 91. When using this equipment, cutting operation conditions, namely grinding speed and longitudinal table feed were 35 m/s and 3 - 12 m/min, respectively. The work piece was clamped in a vise. Vise was set on the universal attachment. Device was installed on a three-component dynamometer brands Kistler 9257 B to measure cutting forces. Grinding was carried out under the following operation conditions: traverse Strav= 3 m/min, depth of cutting t = 20 μm. Grinding used a water-based cooling emulsion. Wheel speed was 35 m/s. The dynamometer was tuned to the frequency of signal equal to 250 Hz. After processing the experimental and calculated data were compared using the theoretical formulas. The maximum difference between them was 17 %. Owing to the presented model it is possible to obtain data on the diamond tool wear during cutting through a change of the tangential component of the cutting force. With the definite maximum wear of diamond wheel it is possible to calculate a threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force. When the threshold value of the tangential component of the cutting force is reached, a diamond wheel must be subjected to dressing. On-time wheel dressing allows us to avoid reducing quality of the machined surface. Control of forces in the cutting zone is difficult to organize; the procedure can be performed by power control of the <b>grinding</b> <b>spindle</b> through the current control. </p...|$|E

Dressing is a vital stage in the grinding process to ensure a consistent wheel topography and performance. However, the effects of roller dressing on functional performance of vitreous {{grinding wheels}} {{as well as its}} influence on different abrasive grit morphologies have not been fully characterised. This paper studies the influence of dressing parameters on the topography, morphology and characteristics of the surface of different vitrified abrasive wheels in order to better understand the process and therefore optimise the preparation of grinding wheels for industrial machining. Alumina grinding wheels with conventional and engineered grit shapes were dressed at two different infeed rates over a range of seven different speed ratios (from − 0. 8 to + 1).

40|$|Mechanical {{components}} such as {{gears and}} bearings operate with the working surfaces in intimate {{contact with a}} mating part. The performance of such components will {{be influenced by the}} quality of the working surface. In general, a smoother surface will perform better than a rougher surface since the lubrication conditions are improved. For example, surfaces with a special near-mirror quality finish of low roughness performed better than ground surfaces when tested using a block-on-ring arrangement. Bearings with near-mirror quality have been tested and analyzed; lower running torques were measured and improved fatigue life was anticipated. Experiments have been done to evaluate the performance of gears with improved, low roughness surface finishing. The measured performance improvements include an increased scuffing (scoring) load capacity by a factor of 1. 6, a 30 -percent reduction of gear tooth running friction, and longer fatigue lives by a factor of about four. One can also anticipate that near-mirror quality surface finishing could improve the performance of other mechanical components such as mechanical seals and heavily loaded journal bearings. Given these demonstrated benefits, capable and economical methods for the production of mechanical components with near-mirror quality surfaces are desired. One could propose the production of near-mirror quality surfaces by several methods such as abrasive polishing, chemical assisted polishing, or grinding.

The parameter variations used in this study were the variable of pin diameter (1. 5 mm, 2. 0 mm, and 2. 5 mm), a variable of plunge speed (2 mm/min, 4 mm/min, 6 mm/min), and the variable of dwell time (2 seconds, 4 seconds, 6 seconds). Where the variation of these parameters will affect to the mechanical properties of welds (as response) was the shear strength. Response Surface Methods (RSM) was used to analyze µFSSW parameters with the shear strength of welds. From the result of experiment and analysis, it is shown that the important welding parameters in high speed µFSSW process are pin diameter and plunge speed...|$|R
40|$|A lagrangian {{formulation}} {{is presented}} {{for the total}} dynamic stiffness and damping matrices of a rigid rotor carrying noncentral rigid disk and supported on angular contact ball bearings (ACBBs). The bearing dynamic stiffness/damping marix is derived {{in terms of the}} bearing motions (displacements/rotations) and then the principal of virtual work is used to transfer it from the bearing location to the rotor mass center to obtain the total dynamic stiffness/damping matrix. The bearing analyses take into account the bearing nonlinearities, cage rotation and bearing axial preload. The coefficients of these time-dependent matrices are presented analytically. The equations of motion of a rigid rotor-ACBBs assembly are derived using Lagrange's equation. The proposed analyses on deriving the bearing stiffness matrix are verified against existing bearing analyses of SKF researchers that, in turn, were verified using both SKF softwares/experiments and we obtained typical agreements. The presented total stiffness matrix is applied to a typical <b>grinding</b> machine <b>spindle</b> studied experimentally by other researchers and excellent agreements are obtained between our analytical eigenvalues and the experimental ones. The effect of using the total full stiffness matrix versus using the total diagonal stiffness matrix on the natural frequencies and dynamic response of the rigid rotor-bearings system is studied. It is found that using the diagonal matrix affects natural frequencies values (except the axial frequency) and response amplitudes and pattern and causes important vibration tones to be missig from the response spectrum. Therefore it is recommended to use the full total stiffness matrix and not the diagonal matrix in the design/vibration analysis of these rotating machines. For a machine spindle-ACBBs assembly under mass unbalnce and a horizontal force at the spindle cutting nose when the bearing time-varying stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is considered) is used, the peak-to-valley variation in time domain of the stiffness matrix elements becomes significant compared to its counterpart when the bearing standard stiffness matrix (bearing cage rotation is neglected) is used. The vibration spectrum of the time-varying matrix case is marked by tones at bearing outer ring ball passing frequency, rotating unbalnce frequency and combination compared to spectrum of the standard stiffness matrix case which is marked by only the rotating unbalnce frequency. Therfore, it is highly recomended to model bearing stiffness matrix to be a time-dependent...|$|R
