500|$|As a full-grown bear, Binky weighed 1,200 pounds. He was an {{aggressive}} bear; in 1980, he bit off a zoo employee's finger. His keeper commented in 1983, [...] "Binky is stubborn [...] independent, {{and he likes}} to play games. When he's really feeling obstinate, he walks halfway into his den and sits down. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can't close it. He's a very smart bear." ...|$|E
500|$|Fazekas said that, [...] "Whitney is used {{to people}} {{treating}} her {{with a certain amount}} of deference, because she’s a famous actress, and she’s met her match in Peggy." [...] She added that in the series, [...] "You see the makings of a villain, but she doesn't start off evil. She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend. And like many friends and family, you end up , but he’s always there ... <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can do what I say I can do, especially in the science world. So he’s really the only one who gets me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> trust him. I couldn't {{cause him}} the great pain of asking him questions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but not yet--not so soon. He {{must think}} I'm very gloomy, and I {{want to be}} always bright and cheerful with him. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> why <b>I</b> wouldn't let him come in; <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to have}} a cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} him nothing. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>I</b> {{do not wish to}} go. <b>He</b> cannot but <b>know</b> that. But <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that <b>I</b> mean to go if you require it." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR PETER. Ah {{there needs}} no art to {{discover}} their merits--however he shall have his way--but pray does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am married! ...|$|R
60|$|Trice. But I {{wonder how}} the devil durst {{come into our}} ward, when <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> {{have been at the}} duties of--my family--this evening.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> shan't give anything--with this {{disappointment}} about Fred, and Parliament {{going to}} be dissolved, and machine-breaking everywhere, and an election coming on--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maype he vos hurt, or sick," [...] {{said the}} German baker, bending down. [...] "I vos know der cop on dis beat and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> vos no footpad." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{been in the}} house, I {{could well}} believe him, but if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> would, <b>I</b> think have raised his terms.|$|R
60|$|I answered, I {{would say}} nothing to that, but that I desired {{he would go}} {{anywhere}} but to Paris, because there <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> must not go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I am not. But <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had to {{walk all}} this way home, and he could take up Margaret, who has only half the distance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe it}} was. The {{theory in the}} office was that he didn't think much of them; but <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can write shorthand, and put things into shape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucius says it's their {{business}} to lead out--and <b>he</b> <b>knows.</b> <b>I</b> don't mind your lunching these dubs every day {{if you want}} to, but I keep clear of 'em. I tell you those!" ...|$|E
6000|$|KING. [...] "'The Gout {{likes to}} take up his {{quarters}} with me; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am a Prince, and thinks I shall feed him well. But I feed him ill; I live very meagrely.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> loved him, {{and that}} therefore-- But, mamma, {{do not think}} of that. I will never be his wife,--never, in {{opposition}} to his family." ...|$|R
60|$|His cordiality {{was proof}} that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had {{no wish to}} speak to him. He was not a man with whom it was worth while wasting politeness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Intimately. A more notorious villain never dealt a card. At Venice, at Brussels, at Spa, at Vienna--the gaols {{of every}} one of which places <b>he</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the man, my lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{as pretty}} well {{everybody}} else has. The {{trouble is that}} Bau-Oti can't give latitude or longitude. Says they sailed {{a long way from}} the Gilberts--that's all <b>he</b> <b>knows.</b> <b>I</b> wonder what became of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me! When <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> detest the man. No matter, I've got on {{the color}} he hates, so he won't annoy me, and Mrs. Snowdon can amuse herself with him. The general has come, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't suppose <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> {{have such}} a thing," [...] she replied. [...] "He has a master-key himself to all the safes, which he used. This is one the {{housekeeper}} gave {{me as soon as}} I arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why does he {{go after}} me?" [...] Haney asked, irritably. [...] "I'm out of it. 'Tis like the fool tenderfoot. Don't <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{had nothing to}} do with his bust-up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, isn't it pretty? But I {{must not}} let my old servant see it, lest he should tell my father, who'd be very angry if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had taken it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucy, dearest," [...] she said, [...] "what {{has become}} of Rupert? Does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am dying? If so, {{why does he}} not come and see me, for the last time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He might. And {{he might}} eat you too, Ned, {{if he had}} salt enough with you. He talks big because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> have no money; and he pretends he won't strip for less than fifty pounds a side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To what purpose? He cannot lend {{me such a}} sum, {{and would}} not if he could, for <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am {{otherwise}} drowned in debt; and he would only give me scraps of misanthropy and quaint ends of Latin." ...|$|E
6000|$|They laughed, and Theodora then {{spoke with}} deep feeling. 'It does {{surprise}} me, Arthur, {{but it is}} the more pleasure. He has known me all my life, and sees there is less humbug in me than in other women. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> have a heart.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sellyer {{directed}} {{one of his}} shrewd {{glances at}} me. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to buy the book, and perhaps, like lesser people, he had his off moments of confidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} young lady, forcing him down upon a stool, [...] "sit ye there and attend my {{sovereign}} good pleasure. I have {{life and death}} over you, and I will not scruple to abuse my power. Look to yourself; y' 'ave cruelly mauled my arm. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> not <b>I</b> was a maid, quoth <b>he!</b> Had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> <b>I</b> was a maid, he had ta'en his belt to me, forsooth!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be an awfully shrewd man," [...] he thought, meaning Parsons. [...] "I wonder what he would say if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had taken the job merely as a blind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, laying {{his hand}} on my shoulder, and {{speaking}} with the sudden seriousness that comes so readily to shallow natures, he said, [...] "God has heard my prayer, old friend. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> am weak. He has sent down an angel out of Heaven to help me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should think}} I had!' was the hot answer. 'He lifts my camels and scuttles {{back into your}} territory, where <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> can't follow him for the life; and when I {{try to get a}} bit of my own back, he whines to you. He's a cad--an utter cad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{tears came}} to Douglass's eyes. [...] "Good old Jim! <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> need comfort this morning. He's prejudiced in my favor--everybody will see that; {{and yet there}} is truth in what he says. I will go to him and ask for work, for I must get back to earning a weekly wage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder whether}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{was a school}} teacher," [...] Agatha remarked. [...] "If <b>he</b> did <b>know,</b> it complicates the thing, because {{teachers}} are not often rich. Besides, how did he learn which was my room?" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> where <b>he</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where <b>he</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> where <b>he</b> is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the old feller; {{the one in}} {{the cart}} there. <b>I</b> think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was runnin' away, though he didn't say {{anything}} about it; but he looked just as if he did." ...|$|R
