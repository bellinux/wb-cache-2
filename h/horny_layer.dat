In hot environments, the skin's <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> can expand due to sweat retention, blocking the ducts of eccrine sweat glands. The glands, still stimulated by high temperatures, continues to secrete. Sweat builds {{up in the}} duct, causing enough pressure to rupture the duct where it meets the epidermis. Sweat also escapes the duct to adjacent tissues (a process called milaria). Hypohydrosis then follows milaria (postmiliarial hypohydrosis).|$|E

So far, successful conversion of esterified vitamin E to free vitamin E (tocopherol) has been mainly delineated from observed biological effects. Quantitative evidence in human skin is poor. In vitro and in vivo studies on human and animal skin have proved ambiguous. Formulation-based effects may have added to this controversy. In the present study, comparable amounts of vitamin E acetate (i) in oil (Mygliol- 812 N), (ii) surfactant-solubilized in water, (iii) encapsulated in liposomes, or (iv) encapsulated in Nanotopes TM were applied to human skin mounted in modified Franz-perfusion chambers that permit emulation of both open or occlusive conditions.

In {{order to understand the}} pattern and expression schedule of each individual precursor protein during the differentiation and formation of cornified cell envelope, the expression of precursor proteins in developing human fetal skins from the first to the third trimester were examined by immunohistochemical studies. Involucrin was found in the periderm and intermediate layer from 14 wk estimated gestational age, while loricrin and small proline-rich protein 1 were found in the periderm from 16 wk estimated gestational age. Filaggrin and trichohyalin that are absent in the adult cornified cell envelope were found in the granular and <b>horny</b> <b>layers</b> from 24 wk estimated gestational age.

The distal portion of each tooth is compressed {{from side to side}} and is somewhat pear shaped in cross section. The palate shows two distinct regions that are covered in minute foramina. These areas probably had a horny covering in life. The broad groove running along the tooth row on the dentary was probably also covered by a <b>horny</b> <b>layer.</b> It is possible that these regions allowed for occlusion where the upper teeth met the groove lateral to the lower teeth and the lower teeth met one of the regions of the palatine. This is still under scrutiny as the palatine region is short in comparison to the lower tooth row and the second horn covered area on the palatine does not oppose any structure in the lower jaw. Because the palatine region is shortened, effective occlusion for shearing would only be possible when the lower jaw was in a retracted position.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to describe, at the cellular level, the structural effects resulting from topical application of a hand-cream onto normal skin and to investigate the potential repair mechanisms induced by the emollient on altered tissue. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to compare the architectures of the <b>horny</b> <b>layers</b> from: 1) ex-vivo cultured human skin; 2) skin treated by topical application of a hand-cream emulsion; 3) explants exposed to sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS); 4) SLS-treated explants that underwent subsequent topical application of the emollient emulsion. These TEM assessments allowed identifying the structural changes occurring in the stratum corneum of skin explants exposed to SLS and/or treated with an emollient. Results strongly suggest that both, SLS-induced damage and emollient-driven repair process take place in the stratum corneum, at the cellular level. One can envisage that the observed restructuring effects after topical application of the skin-care product are likely to ameliorate or restore the barrier function of the stratum corneum.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sequence}} of events affecting skin morphogenesis occurring after a single exposure to UVB was investigated on a model of human skin reconstructedin vitro. The biologically efficient dose (BED) able to induce the early UVB-DNA damages such as pyrimidine dimers, sunburn cells, and apoptotic keratinocytes was determined as 50 mJ/cm 2. The subsequent changes induced {{during a period of}} 14 days following irradiation were analyzed. Up to Day 3, an epidermal disorganization led to a parakeratotic epidermis characterized by nucleated <b>horny</b> <b>layers,</b> as well as the down regulation of major markers of keratinocyte differentiation such as keratin 10, loricrin, filaggrin, and the keratinocyte transglutaminase (type I). On the contrary, the expression of involucrin and spr 1 seemed to be unaffected, indicating distinct responses to UVB of proteins involved in keratinocyte differentiation. A progressive regeneration of normal epidermal morphogenesis begins from Day 4 leading to the normalization of keratinocyte differentiation at Day 10 to 14. In parallel, epidermal proliferation was increased. Taken together, these findings show that in skin reconstructedin vitro,UVB exposure leads to major epidermal developmental changes characterized by (i) an early apoptotic process, (ii) a subsequent down-regulation of specific keratinocyte differentiation markers, and (iii) the recovery of both the early and delayed effects resulting in normal epidermal morphogenesis...|$|R

The end product has been examined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of thin sections, light microscopy, and lipid analysis using thin-layer chromatography. Light microscopic observation of hematoxylin-eosin stained, paraffin embedded cross-sections of the cell culture revealed a strong resemblance to its intact human counterpart, especially {{with respect to the}} morphologic organization in basal, spinous, granular, and <b>horny</b> <b>layers.</b> Freeze-fracture electron microscopy and TEM of thin sections generally confirmed the observed resemblances and additionally suggested the presence of lamellar bodies in the stratum granulosum, and of lamellar (lipid) structures between the corneocytes. However, some imperfections were also observed, including some anomalous lipid structures in the intercellular space. Lipid analyses in conjunction with essential fatty acid enrichment studies suggested that the structural anomalies observed in the cultured system may be caused by a lack of linoleyl-ceramides resulting from “immobilization” of linoleyl moieties in the form of triglycerides and phospholipids. In its present form, the air-exposed cell culture already looks very promising as a model for studies of, e. g., skin differentiation disorders such as psoriasis or ichthyosis, studies of the percutaneous penetration and intra(epi) dermal bio-transformation of drugs, and skin toxicity screenings.

40|$|Synopsis [...] Dandruff and nondandruff {{subjects}} {{were compared with}} regard {{to a number of}} variables. Histologically, the major differences between the dandruff and nondandruff speci-mens were in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer.</b> Normally, the scalp <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> consists of 25 - 35 fully kera-tinized, closely coherent cells arranged in an orderly pattern. In dandruff, the intact <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> usually has fewer than 10 cells, parakeratotic cells are common, and the pattern is dis-ordered. Unlike the nondandruff <b>horny</b> <b>layer,</b> crevices occur deep within the dandruff stra-tum corncure, resulting in "cracking up " into large flakes. The permeability of the dan-druff <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> is increased. This reflects not only the reduced number of coherent cells which can function as a barrier, but increased porosity derived from the "cracking up " of the <b>horny</b> <b>layer.</b> The composition of the microflora is the same in dandruff as in nondandruff, consisting principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium aches and Pityrosporon species. However, there is a great numerical increase in the aerobic and fungal flora of dan-druff, roughly proportional to the quantity of scaling. Certain antibacterial and antifungal agents effected a great decrease in the microflora without eliminating dandruff. Various methods of studying epiderxnal kinetics indicate that the epidermal turnover time is de-creased in dandruff, i. e., epidermopoiesis is accelerated. It is proposed that dandruff represents a basic change in the rate regulating mechanisms of cornification. Accelerated epidermopoiesis leads to imperfect keratinization and faulty "cracking up " of the <b>horny</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Defensins {{are small}} {{cationic}} proteins that directly kill {{a broad spectrum}} of microbes. In the epidermis, 3 types of human beta-defensins (HBD), HBD 1 - 3, have been well characterized so far. HBD 1 and HBD 2 show antimicrobial activity predominantly against Gram-negative bacteria, while HDB 3 kills both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. An increase of resistant bacteria against conventional antibiotics requests to develop a new strategy for anti-infection therapies, and antimicrobial gene therapy using defensin genes can be one of potential choices in the near future. In this study we first examined the localization of HBD 3 in the normal skin. Immunohistochemical staining found HBD 3 in granular and <b>horny</b> <b>layers,</b> and further immnoelectron microscopy detected HBD 3 in the lamellar bodies and the intercellular space. Next, we introduced the HBD 3 gene to cultured HaCaT cells to generate a keratinocyte cell line stably expressing HBD 3. The transduced cells produced detectable HBD 3, which showed strong antimicrobial activity in bacterial colony-forming unit analysis. Furthermore, we then grafted those HBD 3 -engineered HaCaT cells to skin defect of the nude athymic rats, and then applied bacteria onto the HaCaT-cell stratified epidermis. The number of recovering bacteria in the skin with the HBD 3 gene was significantly lower than that in control skin.

The long term purpose of this research line would be to investigate FLG expression in canine atopic skin. Formalin fixed, paraffin-emebedded sections were used in a ABC immunohistochemical technique. A monoclonal antibody against human FLG (Acrist Antibodies, Germany) was used as primary antibody. The results were very consistent in all species. FLG was detected clearly in the granular layer of the epidermis and in the outer root sheath of the hair follicles. In the chicken, all suprabasal layers were positive for FLG.

To determine the expression pattern in normal chicken skin, the reactivity from a broad range of commercially available monoclonal antibodies were studied using a immunohistochemical method. In preliminary examinations the application of 12 monoclonal antibodies to normal skin sections from four 5 -week-old meat-type chickens was assessed. The panel of monoclonal antibodies were employed as primary antibodies using a biotin-steptavidin (B-SA) detection system on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The avian epidermis only reacted positively with four antibodies: AE 1, AE 3, LP 34 and LL 002. In the main examination which followed the four positive antibodies were tested in skin samples obtained from 24 layer-type and 24 meat-type chickens in six different age groups (18 th embryonic day, 1 st day after hatching, 5 th, 11 th, 15 th and 22 weeks after hatching). Within these age groups, a selection of six skin regions (pars pectoralis of apterium ventrale, pars pectoralis of pteryla ventralis and pars cruralis of pteryla membri pelvici, metatarsus, crista carnosa and pulvinus metatarsalis) were examined and compared. As a result, the antibodies AE 1 and AE 3 stained the basal cell layer and the suprabasal cell layers in the epidermis and the inner sheath cells of feather. LP 34 antibody marked the epidermis in suprabasal cell layers from scutate and reticulate scales and in inner sheath cells of feather. The antibody LL 002 stained only cells from stratum corneum formation. The exclusive reactions in <b>horny</b> <b>layers</b> are the reason for the assumption that LL 002 is more non-specific than other positive antibodies. In separate age groups, only AE 1 was marked specificly. An influence of skin region only was found with LP 34. The results of positive antibodies suggested the prevalence of certain cytokeratins in chicken epidermis.

In young adults, stratum cor-neum transit time was approximately 20 days, whereas in older adults this was lengthened by more than 10 days. Because the number of <b>horny</b> cell <b>layers</b> does not change with age, these data indicate that the in-creased stratum corneum transit time was a reflection of diminished epidermal cell proliferation. Addi-tional analysis indicated that the decline in epidermal cell renewal may not occur at a constant rate through-out the adult lifespan but, instead, remains relatively constant in the younger years and then begins to drop dramatically after age 50. This suggests that a linear-spline model rather than a simple linear model may be more appropriate for analyzing these results.

40|$|The {{integument}} of Reptiles {{is different}} {{with respect to}} that of other Vertebrates because it is composed of scales, which are horny thickenings of the epidermis with shape, extension and different overlapping degrees in many groups of Reptiles depending on the habitat and adaptation (Lillywhite and Maderson, 1982; Price, 1982; Irish et al., 1988). The protein component of this peculiar epithelium consists mainly of alpha-keratins and keratin-associated beta-proteins (KabetaPs), formerly indicated as beta-keratins, so called because the presence of beta-pleated sheets and filamentous aggregation. The alpha-keratins or cytokeratins are present in all Vertebrates and they are fibrous structural proteins belonging to the intermediate filaments family. They form the framework and therefore determine the shape of keratinocytes and are responsible for the resilience in epithelia against mechanical forces and tensile strength. They have a molecular weight of 40 - 70 kDa and contain a conserved central alpha-helical structure for the assembly of the filaments and of globular variable N- and C- regions (Steinert and Freedberg, 1991; Fuchs and Weber, 1994). The KAbetaPs proteins are exclusive of epidermis and skin appendages of Reptiles and Birds and they are responsible for the formation of a thick and hard stratum corneum as they are associated with alpha-keratins in the pre-horny layers and progressively mask and replace them in the outermost <b>horny</b> <b>layers</b> of the epidermis. Beta-proteins are little extensible, non-pliable proteins. The characteristic rigidity is most likely due to their cysteine content that allows the formation of intra- and inter-molecular crosslinks (disulfide bridges) which confer compactness and resistance. The mechanism of aggregation of beta-proteins is not known in detail but the prediction models indicate that a 34 amino acid long central part of the molecule, including the highly homologous core-box presents a beta-sheet conformation (Fraser and Parry, 1996, 2011). Strong intermolecular bonds formed between these regions in numerous beta-protein monomers are believed to be responsible for the possible formation of polymers and of filaments. Monomer beta-proteins have low molecular weight (10 - 25 kDa), and a low solubility likely due to a high amount of glycine, and a basic isoelectric point (Werlang and Brandelli, 2005). The present work is focused on the study of the role played by some types of keratins and beta-associated proteins in influencing the process of epidermal cornification in some species of turtles and lizards. The research has been divided into three main lines. In the first line two species of freshwater turtles were considered (A. spinifera, also known as soft-shelled turtle, and P. nelsonii, hard-shelled turtle) in order to examine the role of cytokeratins and keratin-associated beta-proteins in the process of differentiation and hardnening of the epidermis. In particular, since A. spinifera does not possess a scaled integument, it was hypothesized that the soft consistency of its epidermis was due to absence of KAbetaPs or that these proteins were missing of the core-box region. Through the construction of a cDNA library from the soft-shelled turtle carapace exctracted-mRNA some sequences encoding alpha-keratins and beta-proteins were isolated and further characterized. Subsequent bioinformatic analyzes have shown the presence of a well conserved core-box region in all identified KAbetaPs. Even though these analyzes have refuted the initial assumptions, it remains still unclear why these proteins are not able to aggregate and form the classic dense corneous material present in the beta-layer of the other reptiles. The comparison by absolute Real-Time PCR of alpha-keratins and beta-proteins expression in A. spinifera with their orthologous genes in the hard-shelled turtle P. nelsonii, has shown a higher expression of all genes in the soft-shelled turtle than in hard-shelled turtle. These results are most likely due not only to the quantity and variety of keratins and associated proteins in the two species, but also to a different structure and dynamics of epidermis renewal: a faster cell turnover that occurs by continues exfoliation in A. spinifera versus a greater accumulation ability over time of specific proteins due to a periodic wearing that takes place once a year in P. nelsonii. Since the regenerating lizard tail is a good experimental model to study the formation and differentiation of the <b>horny</b> <b>layers</b> in reptilian epidermis, the second line of research has been addressed to the comparative study of the expression of some cytokeratins (type I, acid, and type II, basic) and some particular beta-proteins, using absolute Real Time PCR, in normal and regenerating tail of the American green lizard Anolis carolinensis. The results obtained have showed that transcripts encoding these proteins are mainly expressed in the regenerating than in normal tail. This is likely due to the high rate of cell differentiation present in regenerating scales. Interestingly, each transcript has a peculiar difference of expression between normal and regenerating tail. These results are indicative of a different transcription regulation. Finally, the third line of research has been focused on the initial attempt to study the gene promoter that triggers the rapid synthesis of beta-proteins during the renewal cycle that determines shedding. This has been done by analyzing by bioinformatic analysis the promoter region in all 40 KAbetaPs isolated from the A. carolinensis genome (Dalla Valle et al., 2010) in order to identify possible patterns of transcription factors binding site. The study has identified some general factors normally present and some others frequently occurring, including specific factors. Futher experimental analysis is need to identify the transcription factors that regulate the tissue-specific gene expression of these proteins. ...|$|R
40|$|Ultrastructural {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out {{on the development of}} keratinocytes of mural embryos and fetuses from 9 to 20 days in utero, and using electron micrographs obtained by the study, changes of areas of cells and nuclei and of nucleo-cellular ratios of the basal and intermediate cells in the epidermis were quantitatively analysed with image analyser computer system (Luzex- 500). It was revealed ultrastructurally that tonofibrils firstly appeared in the cytoplasm of the basal and intermediate cells at 15 days in utero, granular cells at 16 days and <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> at 20 days with the regression of periderm, and revealed quantitatively that areas of nuclei as well as cells of both basal and intermediate cells parallelly showed the first peak at 11 days in utero, the lowest value at 15 days, and the second peak at 19 days. From the above, it was suggested that quantitative changes seen from 11 to 15 days in utero may be intimately related with the development of tonofibrils in the cytoplasm and of granular cells, and the changes at 19 days with the changes of the periderm into the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> and with the maturation of <b>horny</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} immunological responses in psoriatic lesions, immunofluorescent findings have been compared in early psoriatic lesions and fully developed plaque lesions. IgG and IgA were detected as the main antibodies in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> by immunohistology. The IgA {{at the site of}} leukocyte accumulation in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> seemed to be associated with secretory component (S-component) and joining chain. Regarding complement, the alternate pathway might be related to the immune reaction as the initial response, because deposits of C 3, properdin and glycine rich β-glycoprotein were found more frequently than C 1 q-deposit in the both lesions. In the dermis S-component was also detected at the dermal papillae adjacent to the dermoepidermal (D-E) junction of the lesions and no deposit of S-component was observed in uninvolved skin of psoriatic patients. This, however, is not a specific pattern in psoriatic lesions since deposits of S-component were found at the dermal papillae and D-E junction in other dermatoses. These findings might suggest that the immunological response was initiated by secretory IgA in <b>horny</b> <b>layer,</b> which was composed of dimeric IgA and S-component at the D-E junction and which passed easily through the epidermal cells...|$|E

Analyses were carried out before and alter removal of ethanol-extractable materials. In normal guinea pigs. TCSA was detectable in the entire epidermis and dermis between 5 min and 7 days or longer after topical application. It was recognized in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> even after 21 days. Fluorescence of TCSA in sections disappeared completely after ethanol extract ion, unless the application sites were irradiated with long-wave UV. When the sites to which TCSA had been applied were irradiated, only TCSA in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> was not extractable with ethanol. Compared with TCSA. TBS did not easily penetrate the skin and revealed granular fluorescence in the <b>horny</b> <b>layer</b> which disappeared after ethanol extraction. Long-wave UV irradiation transformed the fluorescence into a hand-like appearance which was not ethanol-extractable. The fluorescence of MBS was detected even after extraction. In vitro irradiated TCSA and TBS were washed out of application sites with ethanol...|$|E
40|$|The janus kinases (JAK) and signal {{transducers}} and activators of {{the transcription}} (STAT) pathway {{have been shown}} to be activated by a number of cytokines or growth factors and to play significant roles in the differentiation of various cell types. In the present study, we investigated the distribution of the JAK–STAT pathway using immunohistochemistry in the human epidermis. Each element of the pathway showed abundant and differential expression in the epidermis. The differential distribution of the elements was most strikingly observed in the horny keratinised cell and granular layers of the epidermis. JAK 2, JAK 3, STAT 1 and STAT 5 were expressed in high amounts, and JAK 1, TYK 2, STAT 2, STAT 3, STAT 4 and STAT 6 to a much lesser extent in the <b>horny</b> cell <b>layer.</b> JAK 3, TYK 2, STAT 2, STAT 3, STAT 4 and STAT 6 were more abundantly expressed in the granular layer than the lower layers of the epidermis. JAK 1, STAT 1 and STAT 5 were expressed at almost the same levels in the various layers of the epidermis. These results show that elements of the JAK–STAT pathway are abundantly and differentially expressed in the epidermis. It is suggested that each element of the pathway may play a role at a distinct stage of keratinocyte differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays an {{important}} role in normal and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF receptors (VEGFRs, including VEGFR- 1, VEGFR- 2, and VEGFR- 3) and neuropilins (NRPs, including NRP- 1 and NRP- 2) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are typically considered to be specific for endothelial cells. Here we showed expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on cultured epidermal keratinocytes at both mRNA and protein levels. We further localized these receptors by immunofluorescence (IF) staining in the epidermis of surgical skin specimens. We found positive staining for VEGFRs and NRPs in all layers of the epidermis except for the stratum corneum. VEGFR- 1 and VEGFR- 2 are primarily expressed on the cytoplasmic membrane of basal cells and the adjacent spinosum keratinocytes. All layers of the epidermis except for the <b>horny</b> cell <b>layer</b> demonstrated a uniform pattern of VEGFR- 3, NRP- 1, and NRP- 2. Sections staining for NRP- 1 and NRP- 2 also showed diffuse intense fluorescence and were localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm of keratinocytes. In another panel of experiments, keratinocytes were treated with different concentrations of VEGF, with or without VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody in culture. VEGF enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes, and these effects were partially inhibited by pretreatment with VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody. Adhesion of keratinocytes to type IV collagen–coated culture plates was decreased by VEGF treatment, but this reduction could be completely reversed by pretreatment with VEGFR- 2 neutralizing antibody. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of VEGFRs and NRPs on keratinocytes may constitute important regulators for its activity and may possibly be responsible for the autocrine signaling in the epidermis...|$|R
