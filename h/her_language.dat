5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of unconsciousness and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about <b>her</b> <b>language</b> in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
25|$|In her journal, Butler {{wrote that}} she had gotten Genie to stop attacking herself when angry and had taught Genie to instead express her anger through words or by hitting objects. Butler also claimed that, shortly after moving in with her, Genie had become noticeably more talkative and {{that she had}} made {{substantial}} progress with <b>her</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. In an early August letter to Jay Shurley, she wrote that the man she was dating had also noticed and commented on the improvement in <b>her</b> <b>language.</b> Genie's incontinence gradually improved until, by the end of her stay, it had almost entirely gone away.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on these}} results, Bellugi and Klima {{believed}} that Genie had been developing {{as a typical}} right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her. They attributed the imbalance between Genie's hemispheres {{to the fact that}} Genie's sensory input as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile, stimulating functions which are predominantly controlled in the right hemisphere of a right-handed person, and although this input had been extremely minimal it was sufficient to cause their lateralization to the right hemisphere. They therefore believed that because Genie had no linguistic input during her childhood, it underwent no specialization whatsoever and as a result <b>her</b> <b>language</b> functions never lateralized to it. Since Genie accurately distinguished speech sounds with her right hemisphere, they thought <b>her</b> <b>language</b> functions had lateralized there instead.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on these}} results the {{concluded}} that Genie's brain had completed lateralization and that, because Genie had received no stimulation in <b>her</b> <b>language</b> center {{when she was}} a child, it had atrophied and <b>her</b> <b>language</b> functions had instead lateralized to her right hemisphere. Her results on their non-language tests suggested to them that her hemispheric dominance was not simply reversed. They believed that Genie had been developing as a normal right-handed person until the time her father began isolating her, and attributed the extreme imbalance between Genie's left and right hemispheres to the fact that Genie's sensory stimulation as a child was almost exclusively visual and tactile. Previous observations of right-hemisphere language acquisition in adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients consistently showed that both populations were much better at learning vocabulary, although they were able to learn some basic grammar. Linguists noted these subjects had an advantage over Genie because, unlike her, their right hemispheres had already acquired at least a small amount of basic language.|$|E

25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used <b>her</b> <b>language</b> to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, {{and when she did}} talk it was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky differentiates competence, {{which is}} an {{idealized}} capacity, from performance being the production of actual utterances. According to him, competence is the ideal speaker-hearer's knowledge of his or <b>her</b> <b>language</b> {{and it is the}} 'mental reality' which is responsible for all those aspects of language use which can be characterized as 'linguistic'. Chomsky argues that only under an idealized situation whereby the speaker-hearer is unaffected by grammatically irrelevant conditions such as memory limitations and distractions will performance be a direct reflection of competence. A sample of natural speech consisting of numerous false starts and other deviations will not provide such data. Therefore, he claims that a fundamental distinction has to be made between the competence and performance.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss began thorough, active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided that her linguistic abilities were sufficient to yield usable results. Linguists designed their tests to measure both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology. They also continued to observe her in everyday conversations to gauge what pragmatics of language she acquired. The research team considered <b>her</b> <b>language</b> acquisition to be {{a substantial part of}} their larger goal of helping her to integrate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could learn on her own, {{out of a sense of}} obligation they sometimes stepped in to assist her.|$|E
50|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the protagonist Manjula Nayak who is an unsuccessful writer in Kannada and finds success with her novel written in English.

25|$|Despite Genie's {{increased}} willingness {{and ability}} to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less than most people in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance {{to that of a}} person who had not been socialized. The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with conversation to her lack of socialization during childhood instead of <b>her</b> <b>language</b> constraints.|$|E
25|$|Am√©lie Gex (1835‚Äì1883) {{wrote in}} her native patois as well as French. She was a passionate {{advocate}} for <b>her</b> <b>language.</b> Her literary efforts encompassed lyrical themes, work, love, tragic loss, nature, the passing of time, religion, and politics, and are {{considered by many to}} be the most significant contributions to the literature. Among her works are: Reclans de Savou√© ("Echos from Savoy", 1879), Lo cent ditons de Pierre d'Emo ("One Hundred Sayings by Pierre du Bon-Sens", 1879), Poesies ("Poems", 1880), Vieilles gens et vieilles choses: Histoires de ma rue et de mon village ("Old people and old things: Stories from my street and from my village", 1889), Fables (1898), and Contio de la Bova ("Tales from the Cowshed").|$|E
25|$|Genie's {{language}} acquisition also refined existing hypotheses and {{gave rise to}} additional hypotheses about what parts of language the right hemisphere could acquire after the critical period. Throughout {{the course of her}} linguistic development <b>her</b> <b>language</b> had remained largely congruous with adult split-brain and left hemispherectomy patients. By contrast, in both previous and subsequent studies, people with the same conditions who began acquiring language in their right hemispheres prior {{to the end of the}} critical period had developed normal vocabulary and grammar. This further convinced the scientists that Genie's {{language acquisition}} was abnormal because she had started after the critical period, and therefore was processing language in the right hemisphere of her brain.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put <b>her</b> <b>language</b> {{below the}} two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During {{the next month}} her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words than she would spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{scientists}} who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence {{that she had been}} mentally retarded from birth and that this rendered it impossible to be completely certain about the utility of studying <b>her</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of sleep spindles, which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation. However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born mentally retarded. Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.|$|E
25|$|As Genie {{learned more}} {{language}} she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, {{and began to}} apply <b>her</b> <b>language</b> to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting {{of a series of}} short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered she seemed to be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought was a sort of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.|$|E

25|$|Testing of Genie's {{language}} occurred {{until the}} end of 1977, but in mid-1975, when she was 18 years old, authorities placed her in a foster care setting which subjected her to extreme physical and emotional abuse, causing her to become afraid to speak and to rapidly begin losing her newly acquired language skills. After removal from this location in April 1977 she moved through several more placements, some of which were highly abusive, causing further regression of <b>her</b> <b>language</b> skills. In early January 1978 Genie's mother suddenly decided to prevent any further testing and scientific observations of Genie, and the very little available information on her ability to communicate since that time is exclusively from personal observations or secondary accounts of them. Nonetheless, linguists have continued analyzing Genie's language long after this time. Since the case study on Genie ended, there has been some controversy and debate among linguists about how much grammar she had acquired and for how long she had been learning new aspects of language.|$|E
25|$|Outside {{analysis}} from Peter Jones, a linguistics professor at Sheffield Hallam University, argued that Curtiss' earlier accounts of Genie's speech, {{up to and}} including her dissertation, were more accurate than those from after 1977. He argued that in these later analyses Curtiss did not provide sufficient evidence for many of her later conclusions, saying that she neither examined the utterances she cited in significant detail nor presented them in a manner conducive to doing so, and in a few instances asserted that Curtiss' data outright contradicted her conclusions. Jones wrote that, despite the tone of Curtiss' later works and interviews, he found nothing either suggesting reevaluation of her earlier arguments or disavowal of any of her earlier conclusions. In addition, he wrote that Curtiss did not release enough information about Genie's speech from after mid-1975 to determine exactly what, if any, grammatical abilities she had lost, and that the complete lack of data from any time after early January 1978 rendered it impossible {{to determine the extent to}} which <b>her</b> <b>language</b> had regressed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the grant}} {{meetings}} in May 1971 {{some of the}} scientists, including Jay Shurley and David Elkind, voiced concern that the prevailing methods of research pursued scientific study {{at the expense of}} Genie's well-being and could cause love and attention to be contingent on <b>her</b> <b>language</b> acquisition. Shurley said that there was strong disagreement during the initial grant meetings and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and bitter, especially noting that the later meetings excluded {{many of the people who}} had worked most closely with Genie. After May 1971 Elkind declined to participate in the study further, despite having personally known both the Riglers for several years, and in an interview years later he cited a desire not to be involved in a case which, in his view, prioritized scientific research over Genie's care. While Shurley acknowledged that the scientists at the center of the case were in a completely unprecedented situation, he also decided to minimize his involvement over these concerns and felt that by the conclusion of the study all of the scientists, including himself, had been guilty to varying degrees of using Genie as an object and putting themselves and their goals ahead of her and her mother's best interests.|$|E
