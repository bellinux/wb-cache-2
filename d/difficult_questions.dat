5|$|Critical {{responses}} to the film were mixed. Some reviewers thought it little more than pretentious titillation, while others praised the performances and direction and congratulated Lewis for raising some <b>difficult</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> {{involving}} {{the right to life}} is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded the right to life under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of {{lifeline}}s to aid them with <b>difficult</b> <b>questions.</b> They can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E

5|$|One {{approach}} is to acknowledge that induction cannot achieve certainty, but observing more instances of a general statement can at least make the general statement more probable. So the chicken would be right to conclude from all those mornings that it is likely the farmer will come with food again the next morning, even if it cannot be certain. However, there remain <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> about what precise probability any given evidence justifies putting on the general statement. One way out of these particular difficulties is to declare that all beliefs about scientific theories are subjective, or personal, and correct reasoning is merely about how evidence should change one's subjective beliefs over time.|$|E
25|$|Though {{complaints}} were {{made about the}} 2007 PSLE Papers being out of syllabus and too challenging, this continued in the 2008 PSLE Paper. The <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> in the papers were intended to filter the average and below average students, as explained by the Ministry of Education.|$|E
25|$|Some of Plato's famous {{works are}} Phaedo, the Crito, and, as noted earlier, the Meno. Within {{these works are}} found a {{comprehensive}} philosophy that addresses epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, theology, and logic. As noted, most of the writing {{is in the form}} of dialogues and arguments to pursue answers to <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> and concepts. Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.|$|E

25|$|One {{can perform}} two {{standard}} operations with numbers: add and multiply. Prime numbers are “atoms” {{with respect to}} multiplication: all positive non-zero numbers are products of them. Various famous problems in mathematics ask very <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> about relations between prime numbers and the second operation of addition. These problems include the abc conjecture which in concentrated form expresses certain generic fundamental features of problems of the so called Diophantine geometry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} series, a mystery man arrives asking for Janey – Susan finally discovers the {{identity}} of Kenzo's father. Roger and Abi's marriage announcement gives Susan the idea to renew her marriage vows despite protests from Ben. A death in the dentist's chair is not very good for business, but Ben discovers it's not good for his private life either. Michael succeeds in placing the whole family on The Weakest Link, but Anne Robinson raises more <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> than might have been expected.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{students}} have an absolute score, each student's absolute score are compared with other students to yield an aggregate score, and {{the students}} are ranked according to that basis. This allows the examination to accommodate for overly easy or overly <b>difficult</b> <b>questions.</b> Contrary to popular belief, the PSLE aggregate score has no ceiling of 300. In 2007, for example, the highest aggregate score for the PSLE was 294 and the lowest aggregate score was 87. The lowest score for 2011's PSLE was 43 but the highest score was 283.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the Youth Council of Serbia before the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bajatović was a {{founding}} {{member of the}} Socialist Party of Serbia in 1990. During the period of Slobodan Milošević's rule, he was known for maintaining good relations with the independent, anti-Milošević media and for being able to express his party's views on <b>difficult</b> <b>questions.</b> In the late 1990s, he served on the executive of the Socialist Party's provincial committee in Vojvodina and was a spokesperson for the party's city council group in Novi Sad. In June 1999, in the midst of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, he announced a humanitarian aid package organized by the party destined for Priština.|$|E
25|$|Cases {{became so}} {{complicated}} that a special assize, the Assize of Utrum {{was established in}} the middle of the 12th century. Jurisdiction would normally lie in the Ecclesiastic Courts. The Assize of Utrum, especially as defined in the Constitutions of Clarendon, 1164, gave the Crown a chance to clarify <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> of ownership and duty in a non-religious, secular court. Often, ownership was of less importance than in determining who had rights to grain, knight service, marriage penalties and the like. These duties were defined in the manner in which the land had been granted, and by whom in the feudal chain. Frequently land would be donated to a church organization and re-let to the grantor to avoid feudal services to the great lord.|$|E
25|$|Roe v. Wade {{reached the}} Supreme Court on appeal in 1970. The justices delayed taking action on Roe and a closely related case, Doe v. Bolton, {{until they had}} decided Younger v. Harris (because they felt the appeals raised <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> on {{judicial}} jurisdiction) and United States v. Vuitch (in which they considered the constitutionality of a District of Columbia statute that criminalized abortion except where the mother's life or health was endangered). In Vuitch, the Court narrowly upheld the statute, though in doing so, it treated abortion as a medical procedure and stated that physicians must be given room to determine what constitutes a danger to (physical or mental) health. The day after they announced their decision in Vuitch, they voted to hear both Roe and Doe.|$|E

25|$|Owing to his {{prominence}} as an adjudicator of Jewish law, Rabbi Feinstein {{was asked}} the most <b>difficult</b> <b>questions,</b> {{in which he}} issued a number of innovative and controversial decisions. Soon after arriving in the United States, he established a reputation for handling business and labor disputes. For instance, he wrote about strikes, seniority, and fair competition. Later, he served as the chief Halakhic authority for the Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists, indicative of his expertise in Jewish medical ethics. In the medical arena, he opposed the early, unsuccessful heart transplants, although it is orally reported that in his later years, he allowed a person to receive a heart transplant (after the medical technique of preventing rejection was improved). On such matters, he often consulted with various scientific experts, including his son-in-law Rabbi Dr. Moshe David Tendler, who {{is a professor of}} biology and serves as a rosh yeshiva at Yeshiva University.|$|E
25|$|The {{limitations}} {{based on}} consanguinity derive from {{a policy of}} practical eugenics and reflect the increased possibility that such marriages will produce children {{with a genetic defect}} due to the limitations on their combined gene pool. The limitations based on affinity, by contrast, are predominantly legal and social in origin. The rules relating to affinity reflect the need to minimise the prospects of familial jealousies and dysfunction by preventing the intermarriage of people already related by marriage. <b>Difficult</b> <b>questions</b> arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law. There will be no problem if they relocate and establish a matrimonial home in a state that allows their marriage. But any attempt to evade such laws by going through a ceremony in a state that permits the marriage and then returning to the original state (which will usually be their state of domicile, nationality or habitual residence) will fail, and may even expose the couple to the risk of prosecution for incest or an equivalent offense.|$|E

40|$|Introduction How we {{know each}} other [...] how we {{perceive}} and construct the identity of our fellow humans [...] is a <b>difficult</b> <b>question,</b> entangled in the subjectivity of our social perceptions and the many and often opaque motivations of those whom we are attempting to comprehend. It is a <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> in the real world, where signals as subtle as the slightest raise of an eyebrow can indicate, to those astute enough to notice, a wealth of information about one's allegiances and beliefs [...] and where we exist amidst a cacophonous abundance of such signals. It is an even more <b>difficult</b> <b>question</b> in the virtual world, where the medium has nearly silenced the cacophony, leaving us to seek scarce hints of identity amidst the typed messages and static, stilted homepages. This chapter will address the problem of teleidentity: how do we [...] or do we [...] "know" another person whom we have encountered in a mediated environment? The epistemological ramifications of this question are several. O...|$|R
500|$|The hard–easy {{effect is}} a {{cognitive}} bias that manifests itself as a tendency to overestimate the probability of one's success at a task perceived as hard, and to underestimate the likelihood of one's success at a task perceived as easy. The hard-easy effect takes place, for example, when individuals exhibit a degree of underconfidence in answering relatively easy questions and a degree of overconfidence in answering relatively <b>difficult</b> <b>questions.</b> [...] "Hard tasks tend to produce overconfidence but worse-than-average perceptions," [...] reported Katherine A. Burson, Richard P. Larrick, and Jack B. Soll in a 2005 study, [...] "whereas easy tasks tend to produce underconfidence and better-than-average effects." ...|$|E

Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote that We Are X was, [...] "fascinating and assured documentary", but also mentioned what he thought was an unfair R-rating saying: [...] "We Are X is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for — what?

500|$|At {{the end of}} his monologue, Colbert {{introduced}} what he {{characterized as}} an [...] "audition" [...] video to become the new White House Press Secretary—Scott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of <b>difficult</b> <b>questions</b> from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked [...] "eject", [...] "Gannon" [...] (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and [...] "volume", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist David Gregory. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas [...] "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, [...] "Hey, why did we invade Iraq?" [...] The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming [...] "No!" [...] at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006.|$|E
