The antimicrobial activity of saturated fatty acids and <b>fatty</b> <b>amines</b> was determined by oxygen meters with multi-channels and disposable oxygen electrode sensors (DOX- 96). Lauric acid, the most effective among the saturated fatty acids, showed antimicrobial activity at 400 μg/ml against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and MRSA. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <b>fatty</b> <b>amines</b> depended on each hydrophobic chain length.

30|$|Iron oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{are among}} the most widely used and characterized magnetic nanoparticles. However, metal alloys such as superparamagnetic iron-platinum particles (SIPPs), which have better magnetic properties, are receiving increased attention. Scalable techniques to routinely synthesize SIPPs in bulk need further study. Here, we focus on the role played by the <b>fatty</b> <b>amine</b> ligand {{in the formation of the}} bimetallic FePt nanocrystal. More specifically, we compare the effect of varying lengths of <b>fatty</b> <b>amine</b> ligands on the shape, structure, uniformity, composition, and magnetic properties of the SIPPs. We synthesized SIPPs by employing a ‘green’ thermal decomposition reaction using <b>fatty</b> <b>amine</b> ligands containing 12 to 18 carbons in length. Greater <b>fatty</b> <b>amine</b> chain length increased the polydispersity, particle concentration, iron concentration, and the stability of the SIPPs. Additionally, longer reflux times increased the diameter of the particles, but decreased the iron concentration, suggesting that shorter reaction times are preferable. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the SIPPs indicates that the ligands are successfully bound to the FePt cores through the amine group. Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry measurements suggest that all of the SIPPs were superparamagnetic at room temperature and that SIPPs synthesized using tetradecylamine had the highest saturation magnetization. Our findings indicate that the octadecylamine ligand, which is currently used for the routine synthesis of SIPPs, may not be optimal. Overall, we found that using tetradecylamine and a 30 -min reflux reaction resulted in optimal particles with the highest degree of monodispersity, iron content, stability, and saturation magnetization.|$|E

The solvent of the reaction is octadecene (ODE) or tetracosane (TCA). A fourth component of the reaction is the use of fatty amines and fatty acids as ligands. Fatty amines, in the form of octadecylamine (ODA), are carbon- 18 single chain fatty amines that play a critical role in the stabilization of the nanocrystal in the early stages of synthesis [10].

The sodium salt of sulfosuccinic acid monoester, oxyethylenated nonylphenol and ethoxylated derivatives of lauryl alcohol, fatty alcohol and <b>fatty</b> <b>amine</b> were used as surfactants.
