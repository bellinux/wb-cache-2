The identified AR model {{can be adapted to}} various flow velocities in the wind tunnel test. Due to the lack of discrete gust input measurement, a second-order polynomial function is used to approximate the gust input amplitude by flow velocity. Afterwards, with the identified online aeroelastic model, the modified generalized predictive control (GPC) theory is applied to alleviate wing tip acceleration induced by sinusoidal gust. Finally, the alleviation effects of gust response at different flow velocities are estimated based on the comparison of simulated closed-loop acceleration with experimental open-loop one. The comparison indicates that, after gust response alleviation, the wing tip acceleration can be reduced up to 20 % at the tested velocities ranging from 12 [*]m/s to 24 [*]m/s.

Converter failures are linked to power module thermal loading but studies often neglect turbine dynamics, control {{and the impact of}} wind speed sampling rate on lifetime estimation.

These synthetic wind conditions include constant and square wave profiles representing stable and gusty wind conditions. Responses to square wave wind speeds showed that the lower the <b>gust</b> <b>frequency,</b> the higher ∆Tj becomes, demonstrating that low turbulence sites have greater thermal variation in the converter. In contrast, wind speed variations with frequencies greater than 0. 25 Hz deliver only small increases in ∆Tj.

To fulfill their potential, MAVs should be capable to maintain stable flight under different and even the most severe flight conditions.

In this paper we numerically study the aerodynamic performance of a flapping airfoil in various gusty conditions by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. An algebraic moving grid technique is used to handle the dynamic airfoil motion.

The nearly zero-energy building demand makes uncontrolled leakage paths even more undesired and creates {{the need for further}} investigation of their behavior under unsteady wind conditions. The present numerical study examines the role of wind gustiness on instantaneous infiltration rates of a low-rise building. For this purpose, two levels of <b>gust</b> <b>frequency</b> Ω have been simulated, expressed as a sinusoidal factor in the wind profile formula. In parallel, a ratio α is employed to represent seven different cases of external leakages distribution, while five scenarios of compartmentalization and internal leakages shows the impact of the latter on the dynamics of building air exchange rates. The results indicate that higher wind gustiness results in higher ACH, marking out gusts as a potential critical factor under unsteady climate conditions. The infiltration rates shown in relation to the leakage distribution ratio α provide arguments for the importance of the detailed detection of external leakages while the comparison of the different internal-volume-scenario highlights the key-role of internal leakages control towards a drastic reduction of infiltration rates...|$|E
