40|$|The FP 6 RAPHAEL Integrated Project on V/HTR {{technology}} {{concluded in}} April 2010 after 5 years of successful performance. 35 partners from 10 Member States, an overall budget above 18 MEUR and about 170 key deliverables are some important {{figures of the}} project. RAPHAEL provides results in seven V/HTR technology areas: core physics, fuel, fuel cycle back end, materials, components, safety and system integration covering the major systems and components of a V/HTR. Major highlights include design, fabrication and testing of innovative helium components, improved fuel fabrication and fuel and materials irradiations, and safety testing and PIE of irradiated fuel. In the area of coupled reactor physics and core thermo fluid dynamics, benchmarks have been performed on core safety experiments on the AVR and HTR 10 high temperature test reactors, and on the HFR EU 1 bis fuel burn-up experiment. The fuel cycle back-end activities cover characterisation of V/HTR-specific waste, disposal behaviour and conditioning & spent fuel performance modelling. The materials activities comprise vessel and high-temperature materials, the latter work in collaboration with EXTREMAT, and graphite irradiation and characterisation. Safety and licensing assessments of a V/HTR, and the system integration aspects with respect to plant reference data and R&D results complete the comprehensive scope of RAPHAEL. Selected results will be made available as Euratom input for exchange within the GIF VHTR projects in negotiated procedures. Two advisory groups (safety-SAG and industrial users-IUAG) accompanied the project and provided valuable input regarding adjustment of concept specifications. The recommendations of the Industrial Users Advisory Group, including major endusers, are used as input to EUROPAIRS, an FP 7 support action aiming at integrating end-users into the R&D process towards a demonstrator for cogeneration. To address the key issue of knowledge transfer, RAPHAEL conducted three <b>Eurocourses,</b> with support of the IAEA, to transmit V/HTR physics and technology to young engineers and students. Furthermore, RAPHAEL was regularly present in conferences and has issued numerous technical publications. RAPHAEL executed intensive international collaboration mainly {{in the areas of}} materials and fuel, in particular with Korea, and in safety. In addition, its representation and contribution was often requested in collaboration initiatives of Euratom with Russia and China, and in workshops organized by IAEA. JRC. DDG.

40|$|AbstractProposals {{to improve}} implementation, {{monitoring}} and evaluation of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening programmes have been developed in a European project involving scientists and professionals experienced in cancer registration (<b>EUROCOURSE).</b> They call for a clear and more active role for cancer registries through better interfaces with cancer screening programmes and adapting data contents of cancer registries for evaluation purposes. Cancer registries are recognised as essential for adequate evaluation of cancer screening programmes, {{but they are not}} involved in screening evaluation in several European countries. This is a key barrier to improving the effectiveness of programmes across Europe. The variation in Europe in the implementation of cancer screening offers a unique opportunity to learn from best practices in collaboration between cancer registries and screening programmes. Population-based cancer registries have experience and tools in collecting and analysing relevant data, e. g. for diagnostic and therapeutic determinants of mortality. In order to accelerate improvements in cancer control we argue that cancer registries should take co-responsibility in promoting effective screening evaluation in Europe. Additional investments are vital to further development of infrastructures and activities for screening evaluation and monitoring in the national settings and also at the pan-European level. The <b>EUROCOURSE</b> project also aimed to harmonise implementation of the European quality assurance guidelines for cancer screening programmes across Europe through standardising routine data collection and analysis, and definitions for key performance indicators for screening registers. Data linkage between cancer and screening registers and other repositories of demographic data and cause of death and where available clinical registers is key to implementing the European screening standards and thereby reducing the burden of disease through early detection. Greater engagement of cancer registries in this collaborative effort is also essential to develop adequate evaluation of innovations in cancer prevention and care...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{registries}} {{must provide}} complete and reliable incidence {{information with the}} shortest possible delay for use in studies such as comparability, clustering, cancer in the elderly and adequacy of cancer surveillance. Methods of varying complexity are available to registries for monitoring completeness and timeliness. We wished to know which methods are currently in use among cancer registries, and to compare {{the results of our}} findings to those of a survey carried out in 2006. METHODS: In the framework of the <b>EUROCOURSE</b> project, and to prepare cancer registries for participation in the ERA-net scheme, we launched a survey on the methods used to assess completeness, and also on the timeliness and methods of dissemination of results by registries. We sent the questionnaire to all general registries (GCRs) and specialised registries (SCRs) active in Europe and within the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR). RESULTS: With a response rate of 66...|$|E
30|$|We {{assessed}} {{the detection of}} all breast carcinomas diagnosed in Finland in the period 2000 – 2010 (n[*]=[*] 48 040) by linking information on breast carcinomas and on screening invitations and findings at an individual level. To assess relationships between breast cancer detection and breast cancer death, we also linked the incident breast carcinoma cases with deaths from breast cancer in 2000 – 2010. The linkage was done using a unique personal identifier (social security number) as a key. Within this linkage procedure, we divided breast carcinomas into three categories: carcinomas detected {{before or after the}} screening age (before the first and after the last invitation to screening) and carcinomas detected at the screening age. The categorization was based on novel recommendations on the categories of detection, developed in an expert work group in a cancer-registry-driven <b>Eurocourse</b> project (EUROCOURSE: EUROpe against Cancer 2014). A similar assessment has earlier been reported for cervical carcinomas in Finland (Lönnberg et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|EUROCHIP (European Cancer Health Indicators Project) {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} inequalities in the cancer burden, care and survival by the indicators “stage at diagnosis,” “cancer treatment delay” and “compliance with cancer guidelines” {{as the most}} important indicators. Our study aims at providing insight in whether cancer registries collect well-defined variables to determine these indicators in a comparative way. Eighty-six general European population-based cancer registries (PBCR) from 32 countries responded to the questionnaire, which was developed by EUROCHIP in collaboration with ENCR (European Network of Cancer Registries) and <b>EUROCOURSE.</b> Only 15 % of all the PBCR in EU had all three indicators available. The indicator “stage at diagnosis” was gathered for at least one cancer site by 81 % (using TNM in 39 %). Variables for the indicator “cancer treatment delay” were collected by 37 %. Availability of type of treatment (30 %), surgery date (36 %), starting date of radiotherapy (26 %) and starting date of chemotherapy (23 %) resulted in 15 % of the PBCRs to be able to gather the indicator “compliance to guidelines”. Lack of data source access and qualified staff were the major reasons for not collecting all the variables. In conclusion, based on self-reporting, a few of the participating PBCRs had data available which could be used for clinical audits, evaluation of cancer care projects, survival and for monitoring national cancer control strategies. Extra efforts should be made to improve this very efficient tool to compare cancer burden and the effects of the national cancer plans over Europe and to learn from each othe...|$|E
40|$|Population-based cancer {{registries}} (CRs) in Europe {{have played}} a supportive, sometimes guiding, role in describing geographic variation of cancer epidemics and comparisons of oncological practice and preventive interventions since the 1950 s {{for all types of}} cancer, separate and simultaneously. This paper deals with historical and longitudinal developments of the roughly 160 CRs and their programme owners (POs) that emerged since 1927 and accelerating since the late 70 s especially in southern and continental Europe. About 40 million newly diagnosed patients were recorded since the 1950 s {{out of a total of}} 100 million of whom almost 20 million are still alive and about 10 % annually dying from cancer. The perception of unity in diversity and suboptimal comparability in performance and governance of CRs was confirmed in the <b>EUROCOURSE</b> (EUROpe against cancer: Optimisation of the Use of Registries for Scientific Excellence in research) European Research Area (ERA) -net coordination FP 7 project of the European Commission (EU) which explored best practices, bottlenecks and future challenges of CRs. Regional oncologic and public health changes but also academic embedding of CRs varied considerably, although Anno 2012 optimal cancer surveillance indeed demanded intensive collaboration with professional and institutional stakeholders in two major areas (public health and clinical research) and five minor overlapping cancer research domains: aetiologic research, mass screening evaluation, quality of care, translational prognostics and survivorship. Each of these domains address specific study questions, mixes of disciplines, methodologies, additional data-sources and funding mechanisms. POs tended to become more and more public health institutes, Health ministries, but also comprehensive cancer centres and cancer societies through more and more funding at project or programme basis. POs were not easy to pin down because of their multiple, sometimes competitive (funding) obligations and increasing complexity of cancer surveillance. But they also rather seemed to need guiding principles for Governance of ‘their’ CR(s) as well as to appreciate value of collaborative research in Europe and shield CRs against unreasonable data protection in case of linkages. Despite access to specialised care related shortcomings, especially of survival cohort studies, European databases for studies of incidence and survival (such as ACCIS and EUREG on the one hand and EUROCARE and RARECARE on the other hand) have proved to be powerful means for comparative national or regional cancer surveillance. Pooling of comparable data will exhibit much instructive variation in time and place. If POs of CRs would consider multinational European studies of risk and prognosis of cancer more to serve their own regional or national interest, then progress in this field will accelerate and lead to more consistent funding from the EU. The current 20 million cancer survivors and their care providers are likely to appreciate more feedback. Conclusion Most CRs remain uniquely able to report on progress against cancer by studies of variation in incidence (in time and place), detection and survival, referral and treatment patterns and their (side) effects in unselected patients, the latter especially in the (very) elderly. Programming and profiling its multiple and diverse clinical and prevention research is likely to promote involvement of public health and clinical stakeholders with a population-based research interest, increasingly patient groups and licensed ‘buyers’ of oncologic services.
