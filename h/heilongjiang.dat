5|$|The <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon or hand-gun is {{a bronze}} hand cannon {{manufactured}} {{no later than}} 1288 and is possibly the world's oldest confirmed surviving firearm. It weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds) and is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) long. The <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon was excavated during the 1970s in Banlachengzi, a village in Acheng District, <b>Heilongjiang</b> province, China. It was found alongside other bronze artifacts made {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin Dynasty (12th–13th century). The hand cannon was probably used in battles fought nearby Banlachengzi in 1287 and 1288. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led a group of soldiers equipped with hand cannons into a military camp in 1288, as part of an anti-rebellion campaign for the Yuan dynasty. The cannon currently resides at the <b>Heilongjiang</b> Provincial Museum in Harbin, China.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika inhabits mountainous {{areas in}} western Mongolia {{bordering}} the Gobi Desert, eastern Kazakhstan, southern Russia (Tuva, Irkutsk, Altai, and Krasnoyarsk) and China (northern Xinjiang and <b>Heilongjiang).</b> It is found on mountain ranges {{such as the}} Altai, Khangai, and Sayan, and is also distributed from the east and south of Lake Baikal eastward to the Amur River drainage. An isolated alpine pika population occurs at the northwest Ningxia-Hexi Zoulang-Gansu border, on the Helan Mountains. O. a. cinereofusca is found in <b>Heilongjiang</b> and Russia, while O. a. nitida is found in northern Xinjiang, Russia, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.|$|E
5|$|A. altissima is {{native to}} {{northern}} and central China, Taiwan and northern Korea. In Taiwan it is present as var. takanai. In China it {{is native to}} every province except Gansu, <b>Heilongjiang,</b> Hainan, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his death}} in 926, Abaoji greatly {{expanded}} the areas that the Khitans controlled. At its height, the Liao dynasty encompassed modern-day Mongolia, parts of Kazakhstan and the Russian Far East, and the Chinese provinces of Hebei, <b>Heilongjiang,</b> Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Liaoning, and Shanxi.|$|E
5|$|At its height, the Liao dynasty {{controlled}} {{what is now}} Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, <b>Heilongjiang,</b> and Inner Mongolia provinces in China, as well as northern {{portions of}} the Korean peninsula, portions of the Russian Far East, {{and much of the}} country of Mongolia. The peak population is estimated at 750,000 Khitans and two to three million ethnic Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Instead, more {{abundant}} remains from Asia have provided more data. Initial remains were not promising; a partial fragmentary ischium from <b>Heilongjiang,</b> China, that Riabinin named S. kryschtofovici. Much better remains were soon recovered, though, but from Mongolia's early Maastrichtian-age Nemegt Formation. The 1946–1949 Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions recovered the large skeleton that became S. angustirostris {{as described by}} Anatoly Rozhdestvensky. Other skeletons {{from a variety of}} growth stages have also been discovered, and S. angustirostris is now the most abundant Asian hadrosaurid.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon is 34 centimeters (13.4 inches) {{long without}} a handle and weighs 3.55kg (7.83 pounds). The {{diameter}} of the interior {{at the end of}} the barrel is 2.6cm (1.0 inches). The barrel is the lengthiest part of the hand cannon and is 6.9 inches long. There is no inscription on the hand cannon.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon is {{also often}} {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the oldest firearm since it was unearthed near the area where the History of Yuan reports a battle took place involving hand cannon. According to the History of Yuan, in 1288, a Jurchen commander by the name of Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannon into battle against the rebel prince Nayan.|$|E
5|$|The archaeologists {{discovered}} several bronze {{objects that}} were excavated {{with the hand}} cannon. The excavated objects were a bronze vase, a bronze mirror, and a bronze cooking pan. All the bronze artifacts were manufactured {{in the style of}} the Jurchen Jin dynasty. The Jin dynasty collapsed after the Mongols besieged and captured Caizhou in 1234, which suggests that the <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand-gun can reasonably be dated to the 13th century at the latest.|$|E
5|$|The dating of the <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand-gun {{is based}} on battles in 1287 and 1288 that were fought near {{the site where the}} archaeologists {{discovered}} the hand-gun. The battles were part of Mongol prince Nayan's rebellion in Manchuria against Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Yuan dynasty. An account of the 1287 and 1288 battles is documented in the History of Yuan, which references the use of hand cannons.|$|E
5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known {{depiction of}} a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through recourse to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in <b>Heilongjiang</b> noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E
5|$|Goni {{maintained}} much of {{its strength}} while traversing the East China Sea, as low wind shear allowed convection to persist around the eyewall. Goni made landfall on southwestern Japan near Uki, Kumamoto, at 19:00UTC on August19, and shortly thereafter it struck Arao. The convection diminished while interacting with Japan's mountainous terrain, leaving the storm's center exposed once it entered the much cooler Sea of Japan. Around 12:00UTC on August25, Goni transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants turned northward and moved ashore near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East on August26. Former Typhoon Goni turned westward and entered northeastern China {{in the province of}} <b>Heilongjiang.</b> The storm stalled over northeastern China for several days, before dissipating on August30.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, concentrated in cool-temperate to subtropical regions. It {{is common in}} Europe—from northern Scandinavia, south to the extremities of Greece and Italy—and North America, where its southern range extends {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is well known from the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there. The European distribution extends north to Scandinavia and south to southern Italy and Morocco. In China, the mushroom can be found from the northeastern <b>Heilongjiang</b> Province to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau and Tibet. It has been recorded growing under Pinus and Tsuga in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, {{as well as in the}} Indian forests of Arunachal Pradesh. In West Asia, the species has been reported from the northwest forests of Iran.|$|E

25|$|One {{candidate}} is the <b>Heilongjiang</b> hand cannon, discovered in 1970, and {{named after the}} province of its discovery, <b>Heilongjiang,</b> in northeastern China. It is small and light like the Xanadu gun, weighing only 3.5 kilograms, 34cm (Needham says 35cm), and a bore of approximately 2.5cm. Based on contextual evidence, historians believe it was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan.|$|E
25|$|Li Hai-ching Subjugation (October 1932): A {{group of}} 3,000 insurgents {{attempted}} {{to attack the}} south <b>Heilongjiang</b> province before a joint Manchukuoan-Japanese force launched a counterattack. It then retreated into the Jehol province.|$|E

25|$|The rural {{population}} of the Northeast is heavily concentrated in the warmer {{southern part of the}} area, where very warm to hot summer weather permits crops such as maize and millet to be grown with high yields. Soybeans and flax are also very important, as are wheat and barley. The region possesses large flocks of sheep, and pigs are abundant in the more densely settled southern part. The northern half of <b>Heilongjiang</b> is so cold and poorly drained that agriculture is almost impossible; however, the Amur River provides very rich fishing prospects, and sheep are even more abundant than in southern <b>Heilongjiang.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, a Siberian tiger {{attacked}} {{and killed a}} tour bus driver at a breeding park in the northern province of <b>Heilongjiang,</b> China. Park officials reported that the bus driver violated safety guidelines by leaving the vehicle {{to check on the}} condition of the bus.|$|E

25|$|Ai's {{father was}} the Chinese poet Ai Qing, who was denounced during the Anti-Rightist Movement. In 1958, the family {{was sent to a}} labour camp in Beidahuang, <b>Heilongjiang,</b> when Ai was one year old. They were {{subsequently}} exiled to Shihezi, Xinjiang in 1961, where they lived for 16 years. Upon Mao Zedong's death {{and the end of the}} Cultural Revolution, the family returned to Beijing in 1976.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} than 1,900 rivers in <b>Heilongjiang,</b> {{including}} the Songhua River, Heilong River and Wusuli River, creating a convenient system of waterway transportation. Harbin harbor is one of eight inland ports in China and the largest of its type in Northeast China. Available from mid-April {{until the beginning of}} November, passenger ships sail from Harbin up the Songhua River to Qiqihar, or downstream to Jiamusi, Tongjiang, and Khabarovsk in Russia.|$|E
25|$|In China, unusually low {{temperatures}} {{in summer and}} fall devastated rice production in Yunnan, resulting in widespread famine. Fort Shuangcheng, now in <b>Heilongjiang,</b> reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise mixed precipitation was reported in various locations in Jiangxi and Anhui, located at around 30°N. In Taiwan, which has a tropical climate, snow was reported in Hsinchu and Miaoli, and frost was reported in Changhua.|$|E
25|$|Harbin has {{the largest}} economy in <b>Heilongjiang</b> province. In 2013, Harbin's GDP totaled RMB501.08 billion, an {{increase}} of 8.9 percent over the previous year. The proportion of the three industries to the aggregate of GDP was 11.1:36.1:52.8 in 2012. The total value for imports and exports {{by the end of}} 2012 was USD 5,330 million. In 2012, the working population reached 3.147 million. In 2015 Harbin had a GDP of RMB 575.12 billion.|$|E

On {{the night of}} August 24, 2010, the Embraer E-190-100 LR operating the route crashed on approach to Yichun Lindu with 91 passengers and 5 crew members on board. This was the first hull-loss and the first accident with fatalities involving an Embraer E-190.|$|E
25|$|This dispute {{involves}} {{a section of}} the former land border near the Granitnaya River, which borders part of <b>Heilongjiang</b> Province and Ussuriysky District (now Ussuriysk urban district) of Primorsky Krai. The original Convention of Peking (Beijing) states this section of the border lies along the Granitnaya, but the origin of the river de facto lay inside Russian territory. With the 1991 agreement, Russia transferred 9km² (3.5mi²) to China so that now the Sino-Russian border runs along {{the entire length of the}} river.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{problems}} such as floods, drought, and erosion pose serious threats to farming {{in many parts of}} the country. The wholesale destruction of forests gave way to an energetic reforestation program that proved inadequate, and forest resources are still fairly meagre. The principal forests are found in the Qin Mountains and the central mountains and on the Sichuan–Yunnan plateau. Because they are inaccessible, the Qinling forests are not worked extensively, and much of the country's timber comes from <b>Heilongjiang,</b> Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan.|$|E
