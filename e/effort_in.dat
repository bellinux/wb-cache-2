40|$|In many contests, {{players can}} {{influence}} the outcome through <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> multiple activities, several {{of which can be}} chosen before others. In this paper, we develop a model of dynamic multiactivity contests. Players simultaneously choose <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> long-run activities, observe each other's <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> these activities, and then simultaneously choose <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> short-run activities. A player's long-run and short-run efforts complement each other in determining the player's probability of winning. We compare the outcomes of this two-stage model to those of the corresponding model in which players do not observe each other's first-stage efforts before the second stage and thus effectively choose <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> all activities simultaneously. Interestingly, effort expenditures are always lower in the sequential multi-activity contest than in the simultaneous multi-activity contest. The implications of this result for the organization of military, litigation, innovation, academic, and sporting contests are highlighted. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} fulfillment of safety needs of the students’ activity unit {{in the area of}} full body contact sports in Yogyakarta State University. This research study is aimed at investigating the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> {{the fulfillment of}} safety needs conducted by the students’ activity unit of full body contact sports in order to prevent accidents which can end in injury, physical defect, or even death during the training sessions. This is a descriptive research study involving the safety needs as the only variable. The population involved in this research was the students of Yogyakarta State University who were the members of the students’ activity unit in the area of full body contact sports. The researcher took 100 samples out of 465 members using proportionate stratified random sampling. The instrument to collect the data was in the form of questionnaires. The researcher analyzed the data using the descriptive quantitative method with percentage. The results of this study show that the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs conducted by the students’ activity unit in the area of full body contact sports in Yogyakarta State University were generally good (66 %). In details, it can be described that: (1) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs from the inside of the students’ activity unit were good (64 %), (2) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs from the inside of the students’ activity unit were good (71 %), (3) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the health of the students’ activity unit were poor (40 %), (4) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the equipment of the students’ activity unit were good (67 %), (5) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the foods were good (70 %), (6) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the training processes were good (79 %), (7) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of tools and facilities were fair (52 %), (8) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the regulation were good (75 %), (9) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the coaches were very good (86 %), and (10) the <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling the safety needs in terms of the weather were good (71 %) ...|$|R

5|$|Afforestation {{projects}} have been undertaken to prevent groundwater pollution, secure drinking water, sequester CO2, increase biodiversity, create an attractive countryside, provide easy access to nature and offer outdoor activities to the public. In 2000 the first project, the New Forests of Aarhus, was completed which aimed to double the forest cover in the municipality and in 2009 another phase was announced to double forest cover once more before the year 2030. The afforestation plans were realised as a local project in collaboration with private landowners, under a larger national agenda. Other projects to expand natural habitats include a rewilding <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> Geding-Kasted Bog and continuous monitoring of the four Natura 2000 areas in the municipality.|$|E
