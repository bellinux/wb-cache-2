5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault. The tomb contained a single male skeleton, which lacked a skull and its thighbones. The dynastic founder of Tikal, Yax Ehb' Xook, {{has been linked to}} this tomb, which lies <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the North Acropolis. The deceased had probably died in battle with his body being mutilated by his enemies before being recovered and interred by his followers. The bones were wrapped carefully in textiles to form an upright bundle. The missing head was replaced by a small greenstone mask with shell-inlaid teeth and eyes and bearing a three-pointed royal headband. This head wears an emblem of rulership on its forehead and is a rare Preclassic lowland Maya portrait of a king. Among the contents of the tomb were a stingray spine, a spondylus shell and twenty-six ceramic vessels.|$|E
5|$|Burial 85 {{dates to}} the 1st century AD, in the Late Preclassic, and was {{enclosed}} by a platform, with a primitive corbel vault.

Bradshaw helped Austin in the latter's feud against the nWo, teaming up with him against them and had a brief feud with Scott Hall where he faced Hall at Backlash in a losing effort due to interference by X-Pac. Following Austin's walkout on the WWE, Bradshaw joined the hardcore division and won the WWE Hardcore Championship seventeen times, with his first title win coming over Steven Richards. He renamed the title the Texas Hardcore Championship.

A Golani soldier interviewed about his operations inside Gaza said they often could not distinguish between civilians and Hamas fighters because some Hamas operatives dressed in plainclothes and the night vision goggles made everything look green. An IDF spokesperson said that Hamas [...] "deploys in residential areas, creating rocket launch sites, command and control centers, and other positions <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> urban areas. By doing so, Hamas chooses the battleground where the IDF is forced to operate." [...] The highest-ranking U.S. military officer, Army General Martin Dempsey, {{the chairman of the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that [...] "Israel went to extraordinary lengths to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties". Later in his speech he said, [...] "the Pentagon three months ago sent a 'lessons-learned team' of senior officers and non-commissioned officers to work with the IDF to see what could be learned from the Gaza operation, to include the measures they took to prevent civilian casualties and what they did with tunneling." [...] Col. Richard Kemp told The Observer [...] "IDF has taken greater steps than any other army in the history of warfare to minimise harm to civilians in a combat zone" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{constant}} watchfulness {{of black}} ducks {{is perhaps the}} most remarkable thing about them. When feeding at night in some lonely marsh, or hidden away by day <b>deep</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> the swamps, they never for a moment seem to lay aside their alertness, nor trust to their hiding places alone for protection. Even when lying fast asleep among the grasses with heads tucked under their wings, there is a nervous vigilance in their very attitudes which suggests a sense of danger. Generally one has to content himself with studying them through a glass; but once I had a very good opportunity of watching them close at hand, of outwitting them, as it were, at their own game of hide-and-seek. It was in a grassy little pond, shut in by high hills, on the open moors of Nantucket. The pond {{was in the middle of}} a plain, perhaps a hundred yards from the nearest hill. No tree or rock or bush offered any concealment to an enemy; the ducks could sleep there as sure of detecting the approach of danger as if on the open ocean.|$|E
