50|$|A {{programme}} {{of replacing}} <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> with coach screws was then started, with problem areas receiving attention as required. Not only did this improve {{the security of}} the rails onto the sleepers resulting in a better ride quality, but also provided an obvious safety improvement too. By 2000, approximately 1/3rd of the <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> from Woody Bay through to Eleanor’s had been replaced.|$|R

2500|$|A <b>dog</b> <b>spike</b> is {{functionally}} {{equivalent to}} a cut spike and is also square in horizontal section and of similar dimensions but has a pointed penetrating head, and the rail (or [...] "plate holding") head has two lugs on either side (which aid spike removal) giving {{the impression of a}} dog's head.|$|R
50|$|From the {{evidence}} available, the rail was secured using <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> to wooden sleepers {{of a small}} but long profile, although none survive to this day so {{it is difficult to}} say exactly. The Society still possesses three original 1945 metal sleepers, and a small quantity of 14lb rail, with one pair of fishplates.|$|R
50|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Queensland’s railways, freight traffic {{steadily}} declined {{to the point that the}} Winton Branch became uneconomical to maintain. Last patronised in the mid 1990s, the branch closed in 2008. In 2012 it was reported that some 8,500 tonnes of track, 320,000 sleepers and 1.3 million <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> were removed and resold or recycled.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the rubble}} mound {{there are still}} several posts in situ that {{probably}} relate to the railway bin ore bin site.

50|$|This cartoon's plot {{follows the}} same formula as Tree For Two, except {{that this time}} it's a Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde parody {{as opposed to an}} escaped black panther.

He accidentally ingests Dr. Jekyll's formula (thinking it's soda pop), causing him to become a monster cat that terrorizes Spike the Bulldog and Chester to call him a coward.|$|R
5000|$|Yet another reading interprets [...] "dog" [...] in its {{mechanical}} sense ("any {{of various}} usually simple mechanical devices for holding, gripping, or fastening that {{consist of a}} <b>spike,</b> <b>bar,</b> or hook"). The [...] "dogs" [...] are [...] "let slip" [...] - referring to the act of releasing. Thus, the [...] "dogs of war" [...] are the political and societal restraints against war that operate during times of peace.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, a {{programme}} of rerailing {{the original}} railway began. In that year, 12 km of [...] track and <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> were replaced with [...] track and pandrol clips. The replacement programme continued until its completion in 1977. Hamersley Iron also arranged for test installation of concrete sleepers at various locations from November 1973. The tests were successful, and in 1980 work commenced on the re-sleepering {{of the original}} railway with concrete sleepers, a task completed in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Schulz loved {{drawing and}} {{sometimes}} drew his family <b>dog,</b> <b>Spike,</b> who ate unusual things, such as pins and tacks. In 1937, Schulz drew {{a picture of}} Spike {{and sent it to}} Ripley's Believe It or Not!; his drawing appeared in Robert Ripley's syndicated panel, captioned, [...] "A hunting dog that eats pins, tacks, and razor blades is owned by C. F. Schulz, St. Paul, Minn." [...] and [...] "Drawn by 'Sparky'" [...] (C.F. was his father, Carl Fred Schulz).|$|R

Tom uses his instrument as a pogo stick to hop over to the window, stopping halfway to taunt Spike along the way.|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{serviced}} by the rail link from Almaden {{and there is}} limited evidence of the line between Einasleigh railway station and the mine itself. This {{is due to a}} combination of events: removal of the rail track, the construction of an airstrip at some stage west of the mine, frequent grass fires and souveniring of the sleepers. However, a trail of <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> once used to secure the line is discernible along part of the east west access that presently passes the isolated multitubular boiler.|$|R
50|$|Susie's {{parents and}} elder {{siblings}} also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu's father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named Lulu. Didi's parents, Jewish immigrants named Boris and Minka, also appear numerous times {{and serve as}} important characters and are often seen bickering. Rugrats also has animal characters, including the Pickles family <b>dog,</b> <b>Spike,</b> who has played important roles in some episodes, and Angelica's pet cat Fluffy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{track for}} the Hamersley railway was [...] rails manufactured in Japan, laid on sleepers of Jarrah and Wandoo timber from Western Australia with <b>dog</b> <b>spike</b> fastenings and ballasted with 15.2 cm of crushed stone. For {{most of the}} construction period, track was laid {{at a rate of}} 2.4 km per day. On 23 June 1966, the first ore train ran from Tom Price to the coast, and on 1 July 1966 the line was officially opened by the then Minister for Industrial Development, Charles Court.|$|R
50|$|The Spider, {{also known}} as the Iron Spider, was a torture device similar to the Breast Ripper. The Iron Spider would have been {{attached}} to the wall, and the woman's breasts were fixed onto the claws of the tool. The victim was then pulled away from the wall, tearing off her breasts. Another variant of this included <b>spiked</b> <b>bars</b> affixed slightly away from the wall. The victim would have been pulled along the bars until her breasts were ripped off.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} scene, Jerry and <b>dog</b> <b>Spike</b> are {{watching}} TV (which is showing the battered exterminator cats with Butch cat opening {{his mouth and}} catching all his fallen teeth with his right hand) and eating popcorn, leading to Spike eating the whole popcorn and making Jerry ring the gong, but instead of a man, there is Tom, who arrives to bring more popcorn to Jerry and Spike and to kiss Spike's feet. The short {{draws to a close}} with a happy Jerry diving in the popcorn and munching it happily.|$|R
50|$|The {{extensions}} {{saw another}} progression onto using a slightly larger type of softwood sleeper with the 20lb rail (in 30ft lengths). Initially <b>dog</b> <b>spikes</b> {{were used for}} the Eleanor’s extension. A trial of using new coach screws and plates to fix the rails to the sleepers was undertaken in September 1988 at Woody Bay, attempting to solve issues with gauge creep and rail joint movement. The trial proved the benefits of this system, with the Haste Hill extension laid entirely with coach screws on pre assembled track panels.|$|R

5|$|Various {{types of}} {{ammunition}} {{could be used}} for different purposes: plain spherical shot of stone or iron smashed hulls, <b>spiked</b> <b>bar</b> shot and shot linked with chains would tear sails or damage rigging, and canister shot packed with sharp flints produced a devastating shotgun effect. Trials made with replicas of culverins and port pieces showed that they could penetrate wood the same thickness of the Mary Rose's hull planking, indicating a stand-off range of at least 90m (295ft). The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.|$|R

Both inspiratory and expiratory neurons were present with inspira-tory units being grouped more rostrally. The predominant inspiratory neuron firing pattern was “late ” inspiratory, al-though eight “early ” types were located. All expiratory firing patterns were the late expiratory variety.
