25|$|In late 1779 {{he decided}} to move to London and see if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> as a poet, or, if that failed, as a doctor. He moved to London in April 1780, where he had little success, {{and by the end of}} May he had been forced to pawn some of his possessions, {{including}} his surgical instruments. He composed a number of works but was refused publication. He wrote several letters seeking patronage, but these were also refused. In June Crabbe witnessed instances of mob violence during the Gordon Riots, and recorded them in his journal.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial County coroner {{determined}} Tanner's time {{of death}} to be sometime between late September 4 and early September 5, but the legal date of death was recorded as September 8, 2008. Tanner's body was found near Clapp Spring with empty water bottles. Tanner had reportedly intended to refill his bottles at the spring before {{heading back to the}} provisions at his campsite, but the spring was unexpectedly dry, and Tanner text messaged a friend informing him of this. However, Evan felt <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> back to camp if he traveled during the later hours of the evening, refusing offers at that time to send help. Friends were told that if they had not heard from Evan by the next morning and could not reach him by 8am, they then needed to contact Search and Rescue.|$|E
25|$|As a batsman Jupp {{struck the}} happy medium between {{enterprise}} and caution. He watched the ball {{so well that}} when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better worth watching. He possessed {{a wide variety of}} strokes, and can drive or out with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s spun the ball as much as he did and, with a wicket to help him, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> turn to a pronounced degree. One of the secrets of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point.|$|E

500|$|He {{conducted}} {{dozens of}} experiments with the cloudbuster, calling his research [...] "Cosmic Orgone Engineering." [...] During a drought in 1953, two farmers in Maine {{offered to pay}} him if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> rain to save their blueberry crop. Reich used the cloudbuster {{on the morning of}} 6 July, and according to Bangor's Daily News– based on an account from an anonymous eyewitness who was probably Peter Reich– rain began to fall that evening. The crop survived, the farmers declared themselves satisfied, and Reich received his fee.|$|E
500|$|The {{search for}} a new guitarist and drummer began with {{advertisements}} placed in copies of Melody Maker. The invitation was spotted by drummer Phil Collins, formerly of Flaming Youth who already knew Stratton-Smith. He recalled, [...] "My only knowledge of Genesis was through seeing the ads for their gigs. It seemed like they were constantly working. ... I thought 'At least I'm going to be working if I get the gig'." [...] Roger Taylor, subsequently of Queen, turned down an invitation to audition. Collins went to the audition at Gabriel's parents' house in Chobham, Surrey with his Flaming Youth band mate, guitarist Ronnie Caryl. As they arrived early, Collins took a swim in the pool and heard what the other drummers were playing. [...] "They put on 'Trespass', and my initial impression of a very soft and round music, not edgy, with vocal harmonies and I came away thinking Crosby, Stills and Nash". Gabriel and Rutherford noticed the confident way Collins approached and sat at his drum kit and knew he would be the right replacement. Banks said, [...] "It was a combination of things. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> swing a little bit ... he could also tell good jokes and make us laugh ... And he could sing, which was an advantage because Mike and I were not very good at back-up vocals". In August 1970, Collins became the new drummer for Genesis. Caryl's audition was unsuccessful; Rutherford thought he was not the player the group were looking for.|$|E

He did it again – he just pulled that one out. An individual like that: one day he could probably blow it, but the other four days <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it.</b> It was just unfortunate he made it against us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1915, {{southern}} California was experiencing a devastating drought that had drained area reservoirs to record low levels over more than three consecutive years, causing massive agricultural and ranching losses. Residents of San Diego County were so desperate that the city of San Diego hired a man called Charles Hatfield, known as [...] "the Rainmaker". The city promised Hatfield $10,000 if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> rain significantly {{by the end of}} the year. Hatfield's venture was apparently a success, but it is not known what actually caused the massive floods that tore through the county beginning December 9, the day after he started his ill-fated scheme.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Mingus {{had known}} Eric from {{growing up in}} Los Angeles, and Dolphy joined his band shortly after {{arriving}} in New York. He took part in Mingus' big band recording Pre-Bird, and is featured on [...] "Bemoanable Lady". Later he joined Mingus' working band which also included Dannie Richmond and Ted Curson. They worked at the Showplace during 1960 and recorded two early albums together, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus and Mingus at Antibes (the latter adding Booker Ervin on all tracks except [...] "What Love?" [...] and Bud Powell for [...] "I'll Remember April"). Dolphy, Mingus said, [...] "was a complete musician. He could fit anywhere. He was a fine lead alto in a big band. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> in a classical group. And, of course, he was entirely his own man when he soloed.... He had mastered jazz. And he had mastered all the instruments he played. In fact, he knew more than {{was supposed to be}} possible to do on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "By sunset on March 9 {{thousands}} of men, women, children started to gather outside {{the walls of}} the Summer Palace." [...] On March 10, 1959, the crowd surrounded the summer palace in response to a rumor that the Chinese communists were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama at a cultural performance in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) camp. The people were determined not to allow the Dalai Lama to leave Norbulingka palace. Some members of the crowd directed aggression at Tibetan officials that were thought to be Chinese collaborators. Tenpa Soepa, who was staying at a house on the night of March 10th near Norbulingka said, [...] "When I arrived at the gate I found Kalon Sampho lying on the ground unconscious." [...] Sampho, [...] "...had arrived at Norbulinka [...] in a car with his Chinese bodyguard. They got out of their car and when the crowd saw the Chinese guard they began throwing stones." [...] "Phakpalha Khenchung ...had been killed by the protestors. He was a government official, and it was rumored that he had a very close relationship with the Chinese." [...] PLA General Tan considered the Dalai Lama to be in danger and offered him refuge if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the Chinese camp. He declined the offer. A week into the fighting, the general ordered two mortar rounds shot toward the palace. At that point, the Dalai Lama decided {{the time had come to}} slip out over the mountains, with a very small party, arriving a few days later at the Indian border. He was granted asylum by the Nehru government with the stipulation that he would not engage in politics on Indian soil. Meanwhile, Enlai dissolved the Tibetan government and appointed the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region to take its place. In 1959, Tenpa Soepa and other prisoners of war near Toema in Amdo said, [...] "Along the road we could see why our guards were so jumpy. We saw many burnt-out guardposts and even some tanks that were destroyed by Tibetan guerillas. This was Amdo, where the guerrilla war had gone on for years." ...|$|E
