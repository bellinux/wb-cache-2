5|$|After graduating, Jones got a {{scholarship}} to attend Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, where one of his brothers played football. He stayed there for a year before joining the U.S. Navy as American involvement in World War II <b>intensified.</b> <b>The</b> Navy transferred him to a V-12 training program at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he played as a halfback and a safety in 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the war, Himmler <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> {{activity}} of the SS within Germany and in Nazi occupied Europe. An increasing numbers of Jews and German citizens deemed politically suspect or social outsiders were arrested. As the Nazi regime became more oppressive, the concentration camp system grew in size and lethal operation, and grew in scope as the economic ambitions of the SS intensified.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E

5|$|In January 1937 Heydrich {{directed}} the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing {{public opinion and}} report back their findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler's proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna stressing the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the Anschluss on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Levski's death <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> {{crisis in}} the Bulgarian revolutionary {{movement}} and most IRO committees soon disintegrated. Nevertheless, five years after his hanging, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 secured the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule {{in the wake of}} the April Uprising of 1876. The Treaty of San Stefano of 3 March 1878 established the Bulgarian state as an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria under de jure Ottoman suzerainty.|$|E

50|$|The {{group of}} {{powerful}} human portraits that established Peryer's {{reputation in the}} second half of the nineteen-seventies were often melodramas in which he romanticised the subject (himself, Erika, Christine Mathieson and others) through devices many artists have used in the same deliberate way - a dark and grainy technique to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> mystery; the choice of a haunted, confrontational or tragic expression to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> seriousness; and the incorporation of objects, sometimes extraneous (a rooster, a fish), often clothing, to <b>intensify</b> <b>the</b> narrative.... A comparison of his early photographs with the most recent shows how Peryer has altered his position on the making of images. Six Foot Lake, Campbell Island can only be described as understated compared with the orchestrated drama of the early portraits.|$|R
5|$|Sigismund III {{subsequently}} {{rejected the}} compromise solution and demanded the tsar's throne for himself, {{which would mean}} complete subjugation of Russia, and as such {{was rejected by the}} bulk of the Russian society. Sigismund's refusal and demands only <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> chaos, as the Swedes proposed their own candidate and took over Veliki Novgorod. The result of this situation and of the ruthless Commonwealth occupation in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia was the 1611 popular Russian anti-Polish uprising, heavy fighting in Moscow and a siege of the Polish garrison occupying the Kremlin.|$|E

As inflation <b>intensified,</b> <b>the</b> $200000 bearer cheque was also introduced on 1 August 2007, followed by the joint introduction of the $250000, $500000, and $750000 denominations on 20 December 2007. The $200000 bearer cheque had its date of lapse extended twice up to 31 December 2008.|$|E

As the war <b>intensified,</b> <b>the</b> Dalforce volunteers were given only three to four days of training {{and sent to the}} war front with elementary weapons. Lacking uniforms, the volunteers improvised by wearing a red triangle on their blue shirts to avoid being mistaken for Japanese by the Australians.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king <b>intensified.</b> <b>The</b> Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some of the demands required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E

5|$|Before Hurricane Patricia arrived, the Government of Mexico issued {{multiple}} {{watches and}} warnings for coastal communities. A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00UTC on October21, encompassing areas of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia <b>intensified,</b> <b>the</b> government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoacán; {{a tropical storm}} warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October23. Once the storm moved inland {{and the threat of}} damaging winds diminished, these warnings were gradually discontinued on October24.|$|E
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|Fairbanks {{received}} {{word of the}} attack on Pearl Harbor via civilian shortwave radio operators who passed the news to the U.S. Army base. More than 200 civil defense volunteers immediately signed up for work that included orchestrating a town blackout, blocking town airfields, and making emergency plans to evacuate the town {{in the event of an}} attack. In June 1942, the invasion of the Aleutian Islands and the bombing of Dutch Harbor <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> war's effect on Fairbanks. Ladd Field's cold-weather testing detachment was disbanded as its soldiers were used to bolster Alaska defenses at other locations.|$|E

5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> debates, and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Over the summer, Stephen <b>intensified</b> <b>the</b> long-running {{siege of}} Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford {{appeared}} imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to the annoyance of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E
5|$|As B Company moved forward, {{their left}} flank was engaged by a machine-gun {{from a small}} party of Viet Cong to their front, while sniper fire <b>intensified.</b> <b>The</b> Australians {{continued}} to advance with co-ordinated fire and movement, but were now receiving fire from three directions. Ten minutes after stepping off, B Company crossed the front of A Company, forcing them to cease their covering fire. Without support, the Australians were now assaulting a well dug-in and largely unseen Viet Cong force that was disposed in a wide arc. Penetrating the position, the Australian flanks were increasingly exposed to fire, while the dense undergrowth obscured the Viet Cong pits and reduced visibility {{to just a few}} metres. Both the lead Australian platoons were soon enveloped, as fire swept across the front of B Company from the Viet Cong engaging them with heavy machine-guns, claymore mines and light mortars. Meanwhile, Viet Cong snipers continued to engage the Australians from the rear, who unsuccessfully attempted to regain the initiative with small arms fire and grenades. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties.|$|E
