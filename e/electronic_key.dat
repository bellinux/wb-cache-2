40|$|A new {{architecture}} of the inverter used in the convertion of electric energy generated by renewable energy sources is studied in this paper. The distinctive features of this inverter is the special block which compensates pulsing of the current with double frequency, characteristic for these inverters. The switching of <b>electronic</b> <b>keys</b> is realized using the method TCM In this block, like in the inverter, which assures the switching at the voltages near to zero (ZVC). The proposed algorithm of controlling the <b>electronic</b> <b>keys</b> permits to increase the work frequency up to hundreds of kHz. <b>Electronic</b> <b>keys</b> operate at variable frequency, which changes during the work cycle both slowly and by jump. The assurance of admissible heat regime is performed using forced cooling air flux and by convection. The increase of releasing process of the heat is assured by original construction of radiators which forms the turbulent mode of cooling air flux. These changes of the {{architecture of}} the inverter have allowed the minimization of mass, sizes and price indicators.

50|$|The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Key</b> Management System (EKMS) is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) key management, COMSEC {{material}} distribution, {{and logistics}} support system. The National Security Agency (NSA) established the EKMS program to supply <b>electronic</b> <b>key</b> to COMSEC devices in securely and timely manner, {{and to provide}} COMSEC managers with an automated system capable of ordering, generation, production, distribution, storage, security accounting, and access control.|$|E

The ‘iambic’ function (alternating dits and dahs similar to a sequence of iambs in poetry) are created with an <b>electronic</b> <b>keyer</b> by squeezing the paddles together; for that reason, iambic keys are also called squeeze keys.|$|R
5000|$|Digi-Key is {{a privately}} held global {{electronics}} distributor based in Thief River Falls. The company started in 1972 with Dr. Ronald A.

5000|$|The CF {{talks to}} other EKMS {{elements}} {{through a variety}} of media, communication devices, and networks, either through direct distance dialing using STU-III (data mode) or dedicated link access using KG-84s. During the transition to full <b>electronic</b> <b>key,</b> the 3.5-inch floppy disk and 9-track magnetic tape are also supported. A common user interface, the TCP/IP-based message service, is the primary method of communication with the CF. The message service permits EKMS elements to store EKMS messages that include <b>electronic</b> <b>key</b> for later retrieval by another EKMS element.|$|E
50|$|Under CMCS, each service {{maintained}} a central office of record (COR) that performed basic key and COMSEC management functions, such as key ordering, distribution, inventory control, etc. Under EKMS, each service operates its own {{key management system}} using EKMS Tier 1 software that supports physical and <b>electronic</b> <b>key</b> distribution, traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>key</b> generation, management of material distribution, ordering, and other related accounting and COR functions.

50|$|The <b>Electronic</b> <b>Key</b> Management System (EKMS) {{system is}} a United States National Security Agency led program {{responsible}} for Communications Security (COMSEC) key management, accounting, and distribution.

Additionally, EKMS performs account registration, privilege management, ordering, distribution, and accounting to direct the management and distribution of physical COMSEC material for the services. The common EKMS components and standards facilitate interoperability and commonality among the armed services and civilian agencies.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} security, general {{access control}} includes authorization, authentication, access approval, and audit. A more narrow definition of access control would cover only access approval, whereby the system {{makes a decision}} to grant or reject an access request from an already authenticated subject, {{based on what the}} subject is authorized to access. Authentication and access control are often combined into a single operation, so that access is approved based on successful authentication, or based on an anonymous access token. Authentication methods and tokens include passwords, biometric scans, physical <b>keys,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>keys</b> and devices, hidden paths, social barriers, and monitoring by humans and automated systems.|$|R
50|$|Like the bug, the <b>electronic</b> <b>keyer</b> {{operates}} sideways. When {{pressed to}} one side the electronics generate a series of dahs and when pressed the other way, a series of dits. Most electronic keyers include a dit memory function which frees the operator from the need to perfectly time his transitions in the sequence dah-dit-dah. With dit memory, if the operator's keying action is about one dit ahead of the actual transmission, the keyer's output for each letter will be machine-perfect. An iambic keyer sports dual paddles, one for dit and one for dah; pressing {{both at the same}} time produces an alternating dit-dah-dit-dah sequence. Electronic keyers allow very high speed transmission of code.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} features of the Z9 is the gull wing door, though unusually conventional doors are also fitted into the gull wings, allowing the doors to function in both ways.

Examples are [...] "Safers", transparent secure boxes that completely enclose the article to be protected, Spiders that wrap around packaging and Electronic Merchandise Security Systems that allow phones and tablets to be used securely in the store before purchase. All of these require specific detachers or <b>electronic</b> <b>keys</b> at the Point Of Sale. They have the advantage of being reusable and being a strong visual deterrent to potential theft.|$|R

30|$|The width between {{obstacles}} must, furthermore, not {{be greater}} than 1.26 meters (Forman et al. 2009). If some vehicles are {{to have access to}} the buffer zone, access control is necessary. <b>Electronic</b> <b>keys</b> are a relatively easy and inexpensive way to manage such access control, but unmanned gates are vulnerable to tailgating (sneaking a car in behind a legitimate user) and keys may go astray and are susceptible to hacking. For this reason, a guarded gate is probably more secure. However, such a gate must have protection that can withstand an accelerating vehicle, and turning space for vehicles denied access (a rejection line). The guards must also be protected to minimize the possibility that they will be threatened or forced to open the gate.|$|R
