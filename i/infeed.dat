Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active <b>infeed</b> converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid.

Process management of internal grinding is carried out for a given cycle which simultaneously involves two controlling regime parameters: radial and axial <b>infeeds</b> actively changing in the process of grinding while the other operating parameters are constant during the entire grinding cycle. The developed model allows calculating the changes of the cutting force depending on variable values of <b>infeeds.</b> Fluctuation of <b>infeeds</b> values in each opening section is caused not only by the control program but also the kinematics of the internal grinding process. It should also be noted that the model of the cutting force provided in this article considers kinematics, peculiarities of the internal grinding and connects the cutting force with the processing regimes (radial and axial <b>infeeds,</b> number of billet and wheel revolutions) and main technological factors (physical mechanical properties of grinding metal, geometric parameters of a contact zone of the billet and the wheel, wheel characteristic, degree of blunting, etc.) ...|$|R

The key point of this integration is the at characteristic of the DC voltage of the CCC-HVDC, which provides the condition for the VSC to connect to the CCC DC link via a current regulator. The advantages of the proposed combined <b>infeeding</b> system are the requirement of only one DC line, and better dynamic responses.

2500|$|Thread {{grinding}} {{is done on}} {{a grinding}} machine using specially dressed grinding wheels matching {{the shape of the}} threads. The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type <b>infeed</b> thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type <b>infeed</b> thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the full thread depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding. The blanks are hopper-fed to the grinding wheels, where the thread is fully formed. Common centerless thread grinding production rates are 60 to 70 pieces per minute for a [...] long set screw.|$|E

An example of this is that every piece of equipment (in a lumber manufacturing plant) from the green trimmer to the <b>infeed</b> system at the planer mill is the [...] "drying system".
