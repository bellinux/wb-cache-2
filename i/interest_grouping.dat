40|$|Building on <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> {{and congressional}} {{committee}} literature, the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory is created to explicate {{the role of}} <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in congressional committee hearings. This theory applies {{not only to the}} influence <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> have in congressional hearings, but also to the access given to {{them to be able to}} participate. The theory maintains that <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> are necessary to legislators in this capacity since they provide valuable information relating to politics, elections and policy. Resource rich <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> with visibility as experts in a policy area are expected to be given more access and influence particularly to committees that are more balanced in terms of partisanship, ideology and leadership experience. Two statistical models test the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory, one looks at the access granted to <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> to participate in congressional hearings and the other at the influence wielded by the testimony they give in those hearings. A unique data set is developed for each model. The access dataset consists of attempts by <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> to testify before House committees during the 105 th, 106 th, 107 th and 108 th sessions of Congress, and consists of data compiled from the Lobbying Disclosure database. A unique dataset of coded congressional hearing testimony submitted by <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> from six committees and their subcommittees during the 103 rd, 106 th and 108 th Congress was created for the influence model. The research results indicate partial support for the <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> impact theory. <b>Interest</b> <b>group</b> resources increase the likelihood of an <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> access. However, any advantages those resources are in gaining access to congressional hearings, they do not influence the likelihood of the committee adopting the recommendations given in testimony. What do matter are characteristics relating to the committee such as ideology, partisanship and the experience of the chairs. <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> do attempt make real recommendations in hearing testimony although they see little success in influencing bill markups...|$|R

40|$|Framing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in public policy. <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> strategically highlight some aspects of a policy proposal while downplaying others in order to steer the policy debate in a favorable direction. Despite the importance of framing, we still know relatively little about the framing strategies of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> due to methodological difficulties that have prevented scholars from systematically studying <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> framing across a large number of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and multiple policy debates. This article therefore provides an overview of three novel research methods that allow researchers to systematically measure <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> frames. More specifically, this article introduces a word-based quantitative text analysis technique, a manual, computer-assisted content analysis approach and face-to-face interviews designed to systematically identify <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> frames.
