40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Horticulture, Washington State UniversitySuppressing {{weeds and}} {{enhancing}} desirable plant establishment are important when installing or maintaining landscapes. Two woodchip mulches of different particle sizes and origin were applied at different depths to assess these two criteria in transplanted Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus) in a historically weedy field. Arborist chips and chips {{made from recycled}} wood were used, in both coarse (1. 09 - 7. 62 cm) and fine (≤ 1. 09 cm) particle sizes, at depths of 10, 20, or 30 cm. Weed biomass was significantly affected by mulch depth; the average annual weed biomass collected was 59. 4 g/m 2 from non-mulched plots, and 10. 9, 2. 6, and 0. 5 g/m 2 from plots with 10, 20, and 30 cm of mulch, respectively. For two growing seasons, plant health was visually rated on a 1 - 5 scale (with 5 being the most healthy), and data were collected on plant height and trunk caliper. Douglas fir trees were significantly affected by particle size in both arborist and recycled wood chips, with increased health ratings, caliper, and height in the coarser chip mulch. Mean Douglas fir health ranged between 3. 4 − 3. 5 in coarse chips compared to 2. 4 − 2. 8 in <b>fine</b> <b>chips.</b> Mean Douglas fir caliper ranged between 8. 0 − 8. 2 mm in coarse chips and 4. 2 − 6. 5 mm in <b>fine</b> <b>chips.</b> Mean Douglas fir height increased in coarse chips by 19. 8 cm from year 1 to year 2, but only 4. 3 cm in <b>fine</b> <b>chips.</b> Snowberry was not significantly affected by either mulch treatment; given its aggressive spreading nature, this is not surprising. Ideally, wood chip mulches should be coarse (at least 1 cm) and deep (at least 20 cm) to both suppress weeds and enhance establishment of woody landscape plants.

40|$|Abstract. A simple {{processing}} method for splitting pipes in the axial direction using {{a cutting tool}} was investigated. The special tool developed {{in this study was}} pressed into the pipes in the axial direction, and the pipes were split very smoothly without any lubricant. This cutting method did not form <b>fine</b> <b>chips,</b> did not produce a significant heat effect on the inner wall surface. The splitting experiment was carried out with pipes constructed of aluminum and stainless steel. The outer diameters of the pipes were approximately 50 mm, and the thicknesses of the wall varied from 1 to 3 mm. The aluminum pipes were split very smooth by the tool, and curled strip-shaped chips were created by the splitting. On the other hand, the stainless pipes were greatly deformed, making them difficult to cut. Therefore, it was necessary to prevent deformation of the pipe by attaching an outer tool. The outer tool made it possible to cut stainless steel pipes...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{different}} types of fines to adsorb colloidal extractives and whether this adsorption is influenced by pH and the addition of NaCl, have been measured. In order to produce the different <b>fines,</b> <b>chips</b> from Norway spruce were refined in a pilot refiner. This was executed four successive times, producing different types of fines. Most of the fines were removed from the pulp by washing before further refining. The fines were washed and centrifuged before the adsorption measurements. A colloidal dispersion of extractives was produced by extracting TMP with acetone, and rapidly mixing this extract with water. After the acetone had been removed, the colloidal dispersion was added to the fines and the adsorption isotherms were measured. Below pH 5 there was clear adsorption of the colloids to the fines, which was not seen between pH 5 and 8. The adsorption at pH 3 was strongly influenced by the addition of NaCl. A rough estimation of the specific surface of the fines indicated that the different fines had similar abilities to adsorb the colloidal wood resin per square meter...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} in storing wood chips freshly harvested from short rotation plantations, which result in quality losses {{as well as}} in dry matter and energy losses. The factors influencing the degradation of raw material are examined in this paper with special focus on fungal development. An excessive growth of fungi is connected to dry matter losses and also to an increased health risk during raw material handling. The following factors were measured during 6 months storage of poplar wood chips depending on particle size: box temperature, moisture content, pH-value, appearance of fungi in the storage and the concentration of fungal particles in the air. The results show a close connection between particle size, temperature and attack of fungi. During the storage mesophilic and termophilic species of the genera Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Mucor and Penicillium appeared. The concentration of fungal particles is the highest for <b>fine</b> <b>chips</b> and decreases in bigger particles.

It takes in water and its carbonates are usually <b>fine</b> <b>chips</b> of sea shell and corel. It is readily available {{and is one of the}} cheapest forms of aggregate on earth. It is made up of freshwater and small amounts of salt water. Its contact with salt-water mud can increase the loss of mud filtrates especially that of the WBM. The sands consist of irregular shape and were sieved with sieve shaker into a constant size diameter of 1.0  mm. The sieved sands were washed, cleaned, weighed, dried in an oven and stored in different plastic bags of 200  g. The density of the sands measured was 2.52  g/cm 3, which was determined using the standard (ASTM D 4253 - 00 2006) testing method. The preparation of the sand samples started with cleaning it with tap water to ensure that no mud or other particles stuck around it, and the total sieved sands was 8  kg. The sand particles as seen from close view are mostly coarse and spherical. As one of the factors, shape and size of cuttings have moderate effect on cuttings transport.|$|R

50|$|Aluminium, zinc, zirconium, and thorium promote {{precipitation}} hardening: manganese improves corrosion resistance; and tin improves castability. Aluminium is {{the most}} common alloying element. The numerals correspond to the rounded-off percentage of the two main alloy elements, proceeding alphabetically as compositions become standard. Temper designation is much the same {{as in the case of}} aluminium. Using -F, -O, -H1, -T4, -T5, and -T6.Sand permanent-mold, and die casting are all well developed for magnesium alloys, die casting being the most popular. Although magnesium is about twice as expensive as aluminium, its hot-chamber die-casting process is easier, more economical, and 40% to 50% faster than cold-chamber process required for aluminium. Forming behavior is poor at room temperature, but most conventional processes can be performed when the material is heated to temperatures of 450 - 700 F. As these temperatures are easily attained and generally do not require a protective atmosphere, many formed and drawn magnesium products are manufactured. The machinability of magnesium alloys is the best of any commercial metal, and in many applications, the savings in machining costs more than compensate for the increased cost of the material. It is necessary, however, to keep the tools sharp and to provide ample space for the chips. Magnesium alloys can be spot-welded nearly as easily as aluminium, but scratch brushing or chemical cleaning is necessary before the weld is formed. Fusion welding is carried out most easily by processes using an inert shielding atmosphere of argon or helium gas. Considerable misinformation exists regarding the fire hazard in processing magnesium alloys. It is true that magnesium alloys are highly combustible when in a finely divided form, such as powder or <b>fine</b> <b>chips,</b> and this hazard should never be ignored. Above 800 F, a non-combustible, oxygen-free atmosphere is required to suppress burning. Casting operations often require additional precautions because of the reactivity of magnesium with sand and water in sheet, bar, extruded or cast form; however, magnesium alloys present no real fire hazard.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} {{attraction of}} magnesium alloys lies in their extraordinarily good machining properties, in which respect they are superior even to screwing brass. The power required in cutting them is small, and extremely high speeds (5000 ft per min in some cases) may be used. The best cutting tools have special shapes, but the tools for machining other metals can be used, although somewhat lower efficiency results. When magnesium is cut at high speed, the tools should be sharp {{and should be}} cutting at all times. Dull, dragging tools operating at high speed may generate enough heat to ignite <b>fine</b> <b>chips.</b> Since chips and dust from grinding can therefore be a fire hazard, grinding {{should be done with}} a coolant, or with a device to concentrate the dust under water. The magnesium grinder should not be used also for ferrous metals, since a spark might ignite the accumulated dust. If a magnesium fire should start, it can be smothered with cast-iron turnings or dry sand, or with other materials prepared especially for the purpose. Water or liquid extinguishers should never be used, because they tend to scatter the fire. Actually, it is much more difficult to ignite magnesium chips and dust than is usually supposed, and for that reason they do not present great machining difficulties. The special techniques that must be used in fabricating magnesium (working, casting, and joining) add considerably to the manufacturing cost. In selecting between aluminium and magnesium or a given part, the base cost of the metal may not give much advantage to either, but usually the manufacturing operations make magnesium more expensive. [...] There is, perhaps, no group of alloys where extrusion is more important than it is to these, since the comparatively coarse-grained structure of the cast material makes most of them too susceptible to cracking to work by other means until sufficient deformation has been imparted to refine the grain. Therefore, except for one or two soft alloys, machining is invariably a preliminary step before other shaping processes.|$|R

In contrast to other works we show patterned growth of multi walled CNTs on substrates with pre-structured bond pads including a complete metallization system for electrical characterization. Furthermore, we succeeded achieving a reliable flip chip connection between CNT-covered contact pads and metal pads at temperatures lower than 200 degrees C. Our goal is a reversible electrical and mechanical chip assembly with CNT bumps. For bonding experiments and electrical characterization a test structure with a damascene metallization including a layer stack of TiN/Cu/TiN was prepared. For CNT growth a thin nickel catalyst layer was selectively deposited with sputtering and a lift-off technique on the contact pads. The CNTs were grown by thermal CVD with ethylene as carbon source. CNT growth parameters like catalyst thickness, gas composition, growth time and temperature were optimized to get dense CNT growth. The metal bumps of the counter chip consist of electroless deposited Ni.

Three protected environments were used: greenhouse with transparent low density polyethylene plastic; black shading screen nursery and thermal reflector screen nursery; and six substrates: soil, Plantmax®, <b>fine</b> coconut fiber, <b>chips</b> coconut fiber, vermiculite and organic compound. The experiment was analyzed in a completely randomized design using a split-plot scheme with ten replications. There was interaction between environment and substrate on the growth of "jatobazeiro do cerrado" seedlings. At the greenhouse is indicated the use of the Plantmax® and at the nurseries screen is recommended the vermiculite. The Plantmax® promoted uniform seedling growth in all environments, especially in greenhouse. The substrate with 100 % organic compound is not indicated for the formation of "jatobazeiro do cerrado" seedling. The Dickson Quality Index is a good standard pattern for seedling quality...|$|R
40|$|AuSn is {{a special}} purpose {{interconnect}} material with advantages concerning its high temperature resistance, used for fluxless soldering for optoelectronic and RF devices {{as well as in}} <b>fine</b> pitch flip <b>chip</b> technology. Finite element (FE) analyses were conducted on assemblies with AuSn interconnects. Stress analyses require data on the materials stress-strain behavior, however, in case of AuSn solder joints material characteristics are not easily available. In the paper investigations on material characterization concerning the elastic and plastic behaviour as well as the fatigue properties of electroplated Au and AuSn are reported. It is shown that properties of these materials depend strongly on their composition and their microstructure, the latter being fundamentally affected by processing. By application of thermal lap shear tests the low cycle fatigue behavior of AuSn joints is studied. The results show that inter-phase cracking is the dominant fatigue failure mechanism, which is only indirectly linked to plastic straining calculated under homogeneity assumption. Computational analyses concerning the reliability of AuSn flip chip joints for GaAs pixel detectors are finally reported in the paper...|$|R
