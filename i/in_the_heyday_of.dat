5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen {{understood}} that:a {{private industry}} code, strictly enforced, {{is more effective}} than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … {{there is no question that}} American cinema today is far freer than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate comparative exchange rates with modern currency because the range of products produced by economies of centuries gone by were different from today, which makes purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations very difficult; however, some historians and economists have estimated that in the 5th century BC a drachma had a rough value of 25 U.S. dollars (in the year 1990 – equivalent to 46.50 USD in 2015), whereas classical historians regularly say that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> ancient Greece (the fifth and fourth centuries) the daily wage for a skilled worker or a hoplite was one drachma, and for a heliast (juror) half a drachma since 425BC.|$|E
25|$|Amsterdam {{was granted}} city rights in either 1300 or 1306. From the 14th century on, Amsterdam flourished, largely from {{trade with the}} Hanseatic League. In 1345, an alleged Eucharistic miracle in the Kalverstraat {{rendered}} the city an important place of pilgrimage until {{the adoption of the}} Protestant faith. The Miracle devotion went underground but was kept alive. In the 19th century, especially after the jubilee of 1845, the devotion was revitalized and became an important national point of reference for Dutch Catholics. The Stille Omgang—a silent walk or procession in civil attire—is the expression of the pilgrimage within the Protestant Netherlands since the late 19th century. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> the Silent Walk, up to 90,000 pilgrims came to Amsterdam.

25|$|Carnot {{published}} his book <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> steam engines. His theory explained why steam engines using superheated steam were better {{because of the}} higher temperature of the consequent hot reservoir. Carnot's theories and efforts did not immediately help improve the efficiency of steam engines; his theories only helped to explain why one existing practice was superior to others. It was only {{towards the end of}} the nineteenth century that Carnot's ideas, namely that a heat engine can be made more efficient if the temperature of its hot reservoir is increased, were put into practice. Carnot's book did, however, eventually have a real impact on the design of practical engines. Rudolf Diesel, for example, used Carnot's theories to design the diesel engine, in which the temperature of the hot reservoir is much higher than that of a steam engine, resulting in an engine which is more efficient.|$|E

This brought much inefficiency in Japanese banking and resulted in lower performance. Such management practices changed substantially after the mid- 1990 s. Shinsei Bank is a typical case that demonstrates the drastic change from employee-oriented to shareholder-oriented management. After US investors acquired a failed bank, they pursued short-term profits in order to maximize shareholders 2 ̆ 7 interests.

500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{also helped}} popularize {{political}} subject matter in hip hop music, as it epitomized the resurgence in black consciousness among African-American youths {{at the turn}} of the 1990s, amid a turbulent social and political zeitgeist during the Bush administration and South African apartheid. Black consciousness became the prevailing subject matter of many hip hop acts, exemplified by X-Clan's cultural nationalism on their debut album To the East, Blackwards, the revolutionary, Black Panther-minded The Devil Made Me Do It by Paris, and the Five Percenter religious nationalism of Poor Righteous Teachers' debut Holy Intellect. Christgau wrote in 1990 that Public Enemy had become not only [...] "the most innovative popular musicians in America if not the world" [...] but also [...] "the most politically ambitious. Not even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>heyday</b> <b>of</b> [...] Clash has any group come so close to the elusive and perhaps ridiculous '60s rock ideal of raising political consciousness with music."
