5|$|A {{few of the}} {{closely related}} mites also infest humans, some causing intense itching by their bites and others by {{burrowing}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Species that normally infest other animals such as rodents may infest humans if their normal hosts are eliminated. Three species of mite are a threat to honey bees and one of these, Varroa destructor, has become the largest single problem faced by beekeepers worldwide. Mites cause several forms of allergic diseases, including hay fever, asthma and eczema, and they aggravate atopic dermatitis. Mites are also significant crop pests, although predatory mites {{may be useful in}} controlling some of these.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} small pieces of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> of the mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
2500|$|To make pommes de terre gratinées, or [...] "potatoes with cheese", {{according}} to the recipe of Marcel Boulestin, large floury potatoes are baked in the oven, then halved and the flesh scooped from <b>the</b> <b>skins.</b> <b>The</b> flesh is then mashed together with butter, cream, grated cheese and seasoning(s). The mix is then scooped back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skins,</b> arranged in a baking dish, sprinkled with grated cheese and browned in the oven or under the grill. This preparation is also called twice-baked potatoes.|$|R
2500|$|Skin {{testing is}} also known as [...] "puncture testing" [...] and [...] "prick testing" [...] due to the series of tiny {{punctures}} or pricks made <b>into</b> <b>the</b> patient's <b>skin.</b> Small amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (e.g., pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract) are introduced to sites on <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> Sometimes, <b>the</b> allergens are injected [...] "intradermally" [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> patient's <b>skin,</b> with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.|$|R

5|$|Hemorrhagic {{smallpox}} is {{a severe}} form that {{is accompanied by}} extensive bleeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults. In hemorrhagic smallpox the skin does not blister, but remains smooth. Instead, bleeding occurs under the skin, making it look charred and black, hence this form of the disease {{is also known as}} black pox.|$|E
5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern {{that they might be}} absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

5|$|Zinc oxide {{can be used}} in ointments, creams, and lotions {{to protect}} against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by {{ultraviolet}} light (see sunscreen). It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB absorber that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is completely photostable. When used as an ingredient in sunscreen, zinc oxide blocks both UVA (320–400nm) and UVB (280–320nm) rays of ultraviolet light. Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen, titanium dioxide, are considered to be nonirritating, nonallergenic, and non-comedogenic. Zinc from zinc oxide is, however, slightly absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin,</b> fixing a copper plate onto the statue's big toe, {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E

40|$|P-selectin {{glycoprotein}} ligand 1 (PSGL- 1) is a sialomucin expressed on leukocytes that mediates neutrophil {{rolling on}} the vascular endothelium. Here, {{the role of}} PSGL- 1 in mediating lymphocyte migration was studied using mice lacking PSGL- 1. In a contact hypersensitivity model, the infiltration of CD 4 � T lymphocytes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>skin</b> was reduced in PSGL- 1 –deficient mice. In vitro–generated T helper (Th) 1 cells from PSGL- 1 –deficient mice did not bind to P-selectin and migrated less efficiently <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>skin</b> than wild-type Th 1 cells. To assess the role of PSGL- 1 in P- or E-selectin–mediated migration of Th 1 cells, the cells were injected into E- or P-selectin–deficient mice. PSGL- 1 –deficient Th 1 cells did not migrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>skin</b> of E-selectin–deficient mice, indicating that PSGL- 1 on Th 1 cells is the sole ligand for P-selectin in vivo. In contrast, PSGL- 1 –deficient Th 1 cells migrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>skin</b> of P-selectin–deficient mice, although less efficiently than wild-type Th 1 cells. This E-selectin–mediated migration of PSGL- 1 –deficient or wild-type Th 1 cells was not altered by injecting a blocking antibody to L-selectin. These data provide evidence that PSGL- 1 on Th 1 cells functions {{as one of the}} E-selectin ligands in vivo.

25|$|B. burgdorferi is {{injected}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> by {{the bite of}} an infected Ixodes tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response {{at the site of}} the bite. This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|Inoculation {{originated}} as {{a method}} {{for the prevention of}} smallpox by deliberate introduction of material from smallpox pustules <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> This generally produced a less severe infection than naturally-acquired smallpox, but still induced immunity to it.

Rubbing pumice powder <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flesh side of parchment {{while it was still}} wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and pastes of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run.

25|$|Wound {{botulism}} {{results from}} the contamination of a wound with the bacteria, which then secrete the toxin into the bloodstream.

The helium in the heliox diffuses <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E

25|$|Guided by the palps, the chelicerae cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin</b> {{with their}} {{horizontal}} cutting action. These rip and tear at the epidermal layers {{and a small}} pool of blood is formed. The hypostome is inserted and this provides the initial attachment strength. In the case of Ixodes holocyclus the hypostome is inserted very deep into the dermis. The palps remain spread apart on the surface. The process by which Ixodid and Argasid ticks feed is termed telmophagy (= pool feeding). (This contrasts {{with the process of}} solenophagy, used by mosquitos, in which feeding is direct from a small venule.) The resultant pool expands {{as a result of the}} anticoagulants released from the salivary glands. In some Ixodid ticks a cementum is secreted into the wound within 5–30 minutes of cutting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>skin.</b> This material hardens quickly into a latex-like covering around the mouthparts but excluding the palps that remain flattened out on the skin surface.
