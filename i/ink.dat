5|$|The <b>ink</b> sac of an octopus {{is located}} under the {{digestive}} gland. A gland {{attached to the}} sac produces the <b>ink,</b> and the sac stores it. The sac is {{close enough to the}} funnel for the octopus to shoot out the <b>ink</b> with a water jet. Before it leaves the funnel, the <b>ink</b> passes through glands which mix it with mucus, creating a thick, dark blob which allows the animal to escape from a predator. The main pigment in the <b>ink</b> is melanin, which gives it its black colour. Cirrate octopuses lack the <b>ink</b> sac.|$|E
5|$|In April, Moore insulted the TNA World Tag Team Champion Matt Morgan, {{provoking}} a {{rivalry between}} the two. The following week Morgan cost Moore his {{shot at the}} TNA X Division Championship, and later attacked his tag team partner with Jesse Neal. Moore aided Neal, prompting the pair to form a tag team known as <b>Ink</b> Inc.. At Sacrifice <b>Ink</b> Inc. failed {{in their attempt to}} win the TNA World Tag Team Championship from The Band (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall), when Neal's trainer Brother Ray interfered in the match and attacked Neal. The following month, on the June 17 episode of Impact!, <b>Ink</b> Inc. defeated The Band (Kevin Nash and Eric Young) to advance to the finals of a tournament for the vacant TNA World Tag Team Championship. In the final, <b>Ink</b> Inc. was defeated by Beer Money, Inc. when Brother Ray attacked Neal backstage prior to the match. On the October 28 episode of Impact!, <b>Ink</b> Inc. received a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship against The Motor City Machine Guns in a three-way match, which also included Generation Me (Max and Jeremy Buck), but failed to win the championship. On December 5 at the Final Resolution pay-per-view, <b>Ink</b> Inc. lost to Beer Money, Inc. in a number one contender's match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship. <b>Ink</b> Inc. received a match for Beer Money's TNA World Tag Team Championship at Victory Road in March 2011, but were unsuccessful. After the match Moore turned heel by refusing to shake hands with the champions and instead spat beer in Storm's face. On April 17 at Lockdown, <b>Ink</b> Inc. defeated The British Invasion (Douglas Williams and Magnus), Crimson and Scott Steiner and Eric Young and Orlando Jordan in a four team steel cage match to become the number one contenders to the TNA World Tag Team Championship. The following month at Sacrifice, <b>Ink</b> Inc. was defeated by Mexican America (Anarquia and Hernandez). During the match, Neal suffered a neck injury, which sidelined him for the next four months.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} been seen by a {{predator}} they commonly try to escape, {{but they can also}} use distraction with an <b>ink</b> cloud ejected from the <b>ink</b> sac.

The black <b>ink</b> used was based on carbon, and the red <b>ink</b> on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Moore {{returned}} to singles competition and on July 10 at Destination X, Moore participated {{in his first}} Ultimate X match, for {{a shot at the}} X Division Championship, but was defeated by Alex Shelley in the match, which also included Amazing Red and Robbie E. <b>Ink</b> Inc. returned on the September 22 episode of Impact Wrestling, attacking Mexican America, now the TNA World Tag Team Champions, at a tattoo parlour. On the October 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, Toxxin aligned herself with <b>Ink</b> Inc. by saving them from Mexican America. On October 16, during the Bound for Glory pre-show, <b>Ink</b> Inc. unsuccessfully challenged Mexican America for the TNA World Tag Team Championship and at Turning Point the following month, they again failed to win the championship in a six-person tag team match, which also included Toxxin and Mexican America's Sarita. In December, Neal parted ways with TNA, effectively dissolving <b>Ink</b> Inc.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Most halftoning {{techniques}} allow screen dots to overlap. They rely on {{the assumption}} that the <b>inks</b> are transparent, i. e. the <b>inks</b> do not scatter a significant portion of the light back to the air. However, many special effect <b>inks</b> such as metallic <b>inks,</b> iridescent <b>inks</b> or pigmented <b>inks</b> are not transparent. In order to create halftone images, halftone dots formed by such <b>inks</b> should be juxtaposed, i. e. printed side by side. We propose an efficient juxtaposed color halftoning technique for placing any desired number of colorant layers side by side without overlapping. The method uses a monochrome library of screen elements made of discrete lines having rational thicknesses. Discrete line juxtaposed color halftoning is performed efficiently by multiple accesses to the screen element library. Index Terms—Color halftoning, discrete lines, juxtapose...|$|R
50|$|The <b>inks</b> used {{in digital}} {{printing}} on glass mimic the CMYK color model and {{are made of}} ceramic frit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development of <b>inks</b> is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in replication of the <b>inks</b> results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of <b>inks.</b> The <b>inks</b> can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without {{the risk of the}} new panels not matching the colors of the existing panels. The <b>inks</b> are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application of the <b>inks</b> required innovations both in science and technology.|$|R

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common <b>ink</b> cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known <b>ink</b> cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E

40|$|We present Fluid <b>Inking,</b> a {{generally}} applicable approach to augmenting the fluid medium of free-form <b>inking</b> with gestural commands. Our approach {{is characterized by}} four design criteria, including: 1) pen-based hardware impartiality: all interactions can be performed with a button-free stylus, the minimal input hardware requirement for <b>inking,</b> and the least common denominator device for pen-based systems ranging from PDAs to whiteboards; 2) performability: gestures use short sequences of simple and familiar <b>inking</b> interactions that require minimal targeting; 3) extensibility: gestures are a regular pattern of optional shortcuts for commands in an arbitrarily scalable menu system; and 4) discoverability: gesture shortcuts (analogous to modifier keys) are displayed in the interactive menu and are suggested with dynamic feedback during <b>inking.</b> This paper presents the Fluid <b>Inking</b> techniques in the unified context of a prototype notetaking application and emphasizes how postfix terminal punctuation and prefix flicks can disambiguate gestures from regular <b>inking.</b> We also discuss how user feedback influenced the Fluid <b>Inking</b> design...|$|R
