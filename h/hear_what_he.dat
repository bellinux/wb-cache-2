5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with construction workers {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). They claim that the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. These recent meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams {{then returned to the}} plant. Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry to the plant. As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The construction workers, however, <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into the first of the enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E
25|$|He {{always got}} my {{attention}} {{when he stood}} up and took the microphone. He would stop every Member in their tracks to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say, and there are very few Members that have served in this body that can claim the respect that {{both sides of the aisle}} had for the gentleman from California.|$|E
25|$|While his {{writings}} were directed largely to a literate class, it was nonetheless his assumption {{that they would}} be read aloud, as was common during the Middle Ages. He is ever conscious of propriety, and speaks carefully, both because of his elevated rank, and in case women or children should <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has written. His works reflect his character, ambitions, and beliefs, so that in many ways they are a mirror of his time and circumstances.|$|E

25|$|West's {{friend and}} fellow artist Tammy Wynette stated that she had put aside visiting her in the hospital, saying that she planned {{to allow her to}} heal first, {{something}} she admitted to later regretting. In his autobiography, Kenny Rogers, who maintained a close friendship with West, stated that he did pay a visit her in hospital a few times prior to her death. On his last visit (the day of West's death), Rogers recalled that although he was told it was unlikely that West could hear him, he still spoke to her for a considerable amount of time in the hope she could <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying.|$|E
25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say.|$|E
500|$|Coward's {{distinctive}} clipped diction {{arose from}} his childhood: {{his mother was}} deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking {{to make it easier}} for her to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp. His nickname, [...] "The Master", [...] "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as [...] "The Master", he replied, [...] "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." [...] He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: [...] "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous." [...] When a Time interviewer apologised, [...] "I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [...] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, [...] "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Sidney {{described}} Thau as [...] "a {{very quiet}} man, a gentle man." [...] He {{would be brought}} in to calm down the performers when they got upset. He said, [...] "Benny spoke very quietly. You could almost never quite <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> said. But he would talk to this one and that one and {{had the ability to}} calm things down.|$|E
2500|$|On his {{birthday}} in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron {{is transferred to}} the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is saying and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile, and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she [...] "really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, {{and the reason that}} was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, and he kind of needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thoreau neither {{rejected}} civilization nor fully embraced wilderness. Instead {{he sought}} a middle ground, the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture. His philosophy required {{that he be}} a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in North America. He decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs {{to be close to}} those who needed to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to tell them. The wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest, and he preferred [...] "partially cultivated country." [...] His idea of being [...] "far in the recesses of the wilderness" [...] of Maine was to [...] "travel the logger's path and the Indian trail", but he also hiked on pristine land. In the essay [...] "Henry David Thoreau, Philosopher" [...] Roderick Nash wrote, [...] "Thoreau left Concord in 1846 for the first of three trips to northern Maine. His expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine, primeval America. But contact with real wilderness in Maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in Concord. Instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds, Thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was a little hard to <b>hear</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying. [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, {{it was going to be}} necessary to kill people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they were a threat to Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|E

He was institutionalized for two months after his diagnosis. He often mentioned that his demons were named [...] "Heartbreaker", [...] "Nervewrecker", and [...] "Meansucker". He called his psychotic episodes [...] "hell rides", and alternatively, he declared rock and roll to be [...] "the joy ride music".|$|R

60|$|On further inquiry, we ascertained {{that the}} scout, after <b>hearing</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought enough of their arrangements, had {{travelled}} some distance beyond the encampment, {{in order to}} make sure that there were no other bands connected with the one he had left, and it was while thus engaged that he stumbled on the child, which seemed to be in a dying condition.|$|R
