5|$|On June 26, 2009, the House of Representatives {{approved}} the American Clean Energy and Security Act 219 to 212, mandating <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> exclude ILUC for a 5-year period, {{vis a vis}} RFS2. During this period, more research is to be conducted to develop more reliable models and methodologies for estimating ILUC, and Congress will review this issue before allowing <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> rule on this matter. The bill failed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. Chitosan derived from chitin induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases and insects including cyst nematodes, both are approved as biopesticides by the <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E

50|$|However, in March 2003, the DOE {{reversed}} {{its position}} {{and announced that}} SSFL would not be cleaned up <b>to</b> <b>EPA</b> standards. While the DOE simultaneously claimed compliance with the 1995 joint policy agreement, the new plan included a cleanup of only 1% of the contaminated soil, {{and the release of}} SSFL for unrestricted residential use in as little as ten years. The <b>EPA</b> responded <b>to</b> this announcement by claiming that the DOE was not subject <b>to</b> <b>EPA</b> regulation due <b>to</b> the fact that the DOE existed as a separate entity under the executive branch of the federal government, and refused take steps to force DOE adherence to the 1995 agreement.|$|R
5|$|Starting in June 2006, {{petroleum}} refiners {{were required}} by the <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> begin producing ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel, which has 97% less sulfur than the previous low sulfur diesel fuel. When fuel containing sulfur is burned, sulfur dioxide is produced, a main component of acid rain. ULSD, together with new air pollution control technologies required in trucks (starting with model year 2007), will reduce harmful emissions by 90%.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of tons of toxic debris containing more than 2,500 contaminants, including known carcinogens, were spread across Lower Manhattan due to the collapse of the Twin Towers. Exposure to the toxins in the debris is alleged to have contributed to fatal or debilitating illnesses among people who were at ground zero. The Bush administration ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (<b>EPA)</b> <b>to</b> issue reassuring statements regarding air quality {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, citing national security, but the EPA did not determine that air quality had returned to pre-September 11 levels until June 2002.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{approved}} a plan first introduced in 1992 by California's state government. The {{plan called for}} major cleanup of the lower river {{in order to protect}} salmon from phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. It also expressed concern over high water temperatures, algal blooms, and low oxygen levels, although certain fish have adapted to some of these issues. Environmental groups, more than six government agencies, Native American tribes in the basin, and others have worked with the <b>EPA</b> <b>to</b> reduce pollution levels in the Klamath.|$|E
