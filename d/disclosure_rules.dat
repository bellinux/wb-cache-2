40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} an optimal auction in which the seller can determine the allocation and the <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> of the mechanism. Thus, {{in contrast to the}} standard analysis of a optimal auctions, the seller can explicitly design the disclosure of the information received by each bidder as his private information. We show that the optimal <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> is a sequential <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule,</b> implemented in an ascending price auction. In the optimal disclosure mechanism, each losing bidder learns his true valuation, but the winning bidder only learns that his valuation is sufficiently high to win the auction. We show that in the optimal auction, the posterior incentive and participation constraints of all the bidders are satisfied. In the special case in which the bidders have no private information initially, the seller can extract the entire surplus...|$|R
40|$|This Note {{advocates for}} the reform of the federal initial <b>disclosure</b> of {{documents}} <b>rule.</b> Plausible pleadings, mandated by Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, provide sufficient foundation to support increased use of initial disclosures {{as a means to}} reduce the costs of civil discovery. The Massachusetts Superior Court Business Litigation Session’s Discovery Pilot Project pioneered a reform initial <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule.</b> The Discovery Pilot Project’s initial <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> differs from the initial disclosure requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in that it (i) requires actual document production and (ii) is intended as a principal document discovery tool. The federal initial <b>disclosure</b> of documents <b>rule</b> should be amended to include an actual production requirement, but the use of initial disclosures as a principal discovery tool is still too ambitious to warrant national replication...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a single-item, independent private value auction environment with two bidders: a leader, who knows his valuation, and a follower, who privately chooses {{how much to}} learn about his valuation. We show that, under some conditions, an ex-post efficient revenue-maximizing auction—which solicits bids sequentially—partially discloses the leader's bid to the follower, to influence his learning. The <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> that emerges is novel; it may reveal to the follower only a pair of bids to which the leader's actual bid belongs. The identified <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule,</b> relative to the first-best, induces the follower to learn less when the leader's valuation is low and more when the leader's valuation is high...|$|R
25|$|In July 2011 Soros {{announced}} that he had returned funds from outside investors' money (valued at $1billion) and instead invested funds from his $24.5billion family fortune, due to changes in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules,</b> which he felt would compromise his duties of confidentiality to his investors. The fund had at that time averaged over 20% per year compound returns.|$|E
500|$|The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) {{was also}} {{reported}} to have identified issues with inadequate disclosure of information to potential investors, poor performance of the investments, and high management fees for agricultural MIS schemes. In 2003, the commission commented that it [...] "has deployed a disproportionate percentage of its resources to the regulation of this sector, which represents {{only a minority of}} funds under management". In 2010 it commenced revision of <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules,</b> prompted by [...] "recent turmoil in the agribusiness scheme sector".|$|E
500|$|The games' {{organizing}} committee came under scrutiny {{for the high}} compensation and bonus packages its executive team has been awarded. Under Ontario's Salary <b>Disclosure</b> <b>rules,</b> any provincial employee receiving over [...] in compensation will have their salary publicly disclosed. In 2012, {{it was revealed that}} former CEO Ian Troop made , with several other senior staff making between [...] and [...] Additionally, in 2013 it was revealed that as part of his compensation package, Troop would be eligible for a [...] bonus {{at the end of his}} contract, if the games had finished successfully. Other executives are eligible for bonuses of up to 100% of their salaries upon completion of their contract. In 2015, it was revealed that Troop's replacement, Saad Rafi, would receive a bonus of 100% of his [...] salary upon completion of his contract.|$|E
25|$|In such {{situations}} the lawyer has the discretion, {{but not the}} obligation, to disclose information designed to prevent the planned action.

40|$|We {{consider}} auctions where bidders have external {{incentives and}} focus on the case where their valuations in the auction are positively correlated with their productivity which matters in a second stage job market. We study how this affects bidding behavior and wages in the job market and proceed to test the model’s implication in an experiment where treatments differ according to which bids are disclosed. Our results broadly confirm the theoretical prediction that bidders tend to overbid, and their bidding behavior and wages are influenced by the <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule.</b> The data also suggests that the dispersion in worker wages is affected by the <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule,</b> suggesting the importance of reputational bidding.

50|$|A central {{result of}} CSV {{approach}} {{is that it is}} generally optimal to commit to a partial, state-contingent <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule.</b> Robert M. Townsend (1979) has shown that under few strong assumptions the optimal financing mechanism is a standard debt contract {{for which there is no}} disclosure of the debtor's performance as long as debt as honored, but there is full disclosure (verification) in case of default.|$|R
2500|$|SEC is {{specifically}} authorized to issue [...] "point-of-sale disclosure" [...] rules when retail investors purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules</b> in 2004 and 2005; These proposed rules generated opposition {{because they were}} perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions, were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and could allow the customer to request disclosures specific {{to the amount of}} their investment. In determining the <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules,</b> the Act authorizes the SEC to do [...] "investor testing" [...] and rely on experts to study financial literacy among retail investors.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, it was {{discovered}} that Ensign had used the secret hold rule to prevent a bill requiring senators to file fund-raising reports electronically from being voted on. He required that they first vote on his amendment to strengthen <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules.</b> (The [...] "secret hold" [...] is a parliamentary procedure within the Standing Rules of the Senate that allows one or more Senators to prevent a motion from reaching a vote on the Senate floor.) Ensign insisted that, before a vote on the disclosure bill could be held, the committee would first vote on an amendment that [...] "would force groups petitioning the Senate Ethics Committee to disclose the identity of donors giving more than $5,000", which watchdog groups charged was intended to prevent passage of the bill.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 2016, the Washington State Gambling Commission (where Valve is headquartered) {{ordered the}} company to [...] "immediately stop {{allowing}} the transfer" [...] of skins for [...] "gambling activities through the company’s Steam Platform", giving the company until October 14 to submit notice of compliance or otherwise face legal repercussions which may include criminal charges. The commission had previously contacted Valve in February over issues with the practice, specifically focused on issues relating {{to the use of}} the Steam API that enabled the third-party websites. Valve's reply re-asserted it was not involved with these gambling sites and did nothing wrong under state law, further asserting that most of the Steam service features used by the gambling sites are primarily designed to be used to facilitate legal and acceptable practices for other users, and thus cannot directly shut down these services without impacting the bulk of other Steam accounts using the services legally. Valve continued that they have and will continue, in an offer of cooperation with the State, to identify those Steam accounts being used for gambling sites and shut them down due to violation of their end-user license agreement terms. The Federal Trade Commission is evaluating whether some of the CS:GO players that have promoted these gambling sites have violated appropriate <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules,</b> however, the Commission has not issued a formal statement of their investigation yet.|$|E

40|$|A {{principal}} acquires {{information about}} a shock and then discloses it to an agent. After the disclosure, the principal and agent each decide whether to take costly preparatory actions that yield benefits only when the shock strikes. The principal maximizes his expected payoff by controlling {{the quality of his}} information, and the <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule.</b> We show that even when the acquisition of perfect information is costless, the principal may optimally acquire imperfect information when his own action eliminates the agent's incentive to take action against the risk. ...|$|R

He starts with the general economical theory of contracts and represents the asymmetric of information as the most common market failure. Further, he analyses the effects of asymmetric information in contracting and suggests a <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> as a general solution for the problem. His final finding is that the general rule must be supplemented with an exception {{in the case of}} productive deliberately acquired information...|$|R
2500|$|Yet {{it would}} be a mistake to {{conclude}} that Ivar was nothing but a crook. Reality was more nuanced. For one thing <b>disclosure</b> <b>rules</b> in his days were much less stringent. Many corporations refused to reveal details for fear competitors would gain an advantage. (At least that was the claim often made.) [...] Some firms did not even publish quarterly results. Ivar, too, was very secretive and not only with investors. When he was on the verge of hiring somebody he usually asked: [...] "Can he keep a secret?" [...] He was also very fond of quoting his motto for success: [...] "Silence, more silence, and still more silence." [...] Also one cannot fault him for the speculative fever in the 1920s. Without the hunger for ever larger profits many of Ivar's schemes would not have been possible. Incidentally this facilitated a transfer of capital from the USA to Europe where it was, often desperately, needed. He sold shares in the USA worth 250 million dollars (equivalent to c. 3.75 billion today) and transferred almost all of it to his holding company in Liechtenstein, Continental Investment Corporation. Shareholders of International Match had given him authority to do this so there was nothing wrong with it. There was also a tax advantage because of the advantageous deal he had negotiated with Liechtenstein. But Ivar did it above all to have the flexibility to manipulate balance sheets and financial statements so they would look more attractive to investors as well as helping him – to some extent - pay the high dividends of Swedish Match and Kreuger & Toll. He got the nickname [...] "Saviour of Europe" [...] by lending about $400 million (equivalent to c. $6 billion today) to rebuild their shattered economies after World War I. He invented new financial instruments to help him raise funds and, of course, make him money. Indeed, many consider Ivar to be the father of modern financial schemes. Oscar Rydbeck, his Swedish banker, said Ivar was the third richest man in the world. He, however, claimed [...] "money as such means nothing to me". Ivar was also a successful speculator for much of his life making lots of money until shortly before the end. Trying to support the collapsing share prices of many of his companies (including ways which were—if not illegal—questionable, e.g. using straw men for share transactions. In the case of his acquisition of Diamond Match shares it was clearly illegal because of anti-trust laws.) ...|$|E

40|$|The European Commission {{proposed}} in its action plan “Modernisation of company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union – {{a plan to}} move forward” of the year 2003 a mandatory disclosure of institutional investors’ voting behavior {{with regard to their}} portfolio companies as a medium-term measure. This proposal was evidently inspired by SEC <b>rules</b> mandating voting <b>disclosure</b> of investment companies and investment advisers adopted in the same year. However, the realization of the Commission’s proposal is far from certain. It has not only met strong opposition by commentators when it was presented to the public in 2003. The Commission itself recently launched a consultation process to reassess the necessity and desirability of the medium- and long-term proposals of its action plan thereby indicating that it will take the principle of subsidiarity of EC law much more seriously than in the past. At the same time, the British government gets ready to adopt a <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> at the national level. This paper examines the U. S. debate on and experience with institutional investors’ mandatory voting disclosure. With the aid of the insights and arguments thereby gathered the paper argues that there was and still is a case for a mandatory voting <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule</b> at EC level...|$|R
40|$|In this comment, {{we explain}} our {{objections}} to the SEC’s current formulation of the Pay Ratio <b>Disclosure</b> <b>Rule</b> on each of three grounds: 1) the erroneous estimation of CEO pay; 2) the unclear specification of the “median” worker; and 3) the risk of normalizing a pay ratio that is far too high. Then we present the latest data on the remuneration of the 500 highest-paid CEOs in the United States, demonstrating {{the way in which}} the SEC’s measure of CEO pay that enters into the CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio tends to systematically underestimate actual executive pay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{consider}} a single-item, independent private value auction environment with two bidders: the leader, who knows his valuation, and the follower, who exerts {{an effort that}} affects the probability distribution of his valuation, which he then learns. We provide sufficient conditions under which an ex-post efficient revenue-maximizing auction solicits bids sequentially and partially discloses the leader’s bid to the follower, thereby influencing the follower’s effort. This <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule,</b> which is novel, is non-monotone and prescribes sometimes revealing only a pair to which the leader’s bid belongs and sometimes revealing the bid itself. The induced effort distortion relative to the first-best is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We study {{disclosure}} {{of information about the}} multidimensional state of the world when uninformed receivers' actions affect the sender's utility. Given a <b>disclosure</b> <b>rule,</b> the receivers form an expectation about the state following each message. Under the assumption that the senderfs expected utility is written as the expected value of a quadratic function of those conditional expectations, we identify conditions under which full and no disclosure is optimal for the sender and show that a linear transformation of the state is optimal if it is normally distributed. We apply our theory to advertising, political campaigning, and monetary policy. ...|$|R

50|$|As for print media, their {{obligations}} {{in terms of}} media ownership transparency are covered by the new Media Law entered into force in 2013.

We conclude that not all multiservice consultants are conflicted while not all specialist consultants are guardians of shareholder value.
