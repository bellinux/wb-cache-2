Support rollers are not necessary because of the taut and relatively light chain. In off-road driving, the driver must be careful to keep the chain tension constant.

50|$|Like many of Sheffield’s water courses, the Shire Brook’s {{water power}} was {{harnessed}} for turning water wheels for industry before {{the coming of}} steam and electricity. During the 19th century there were <b>five</b> <b>wheels</b> operating in the valley producing power to sharpen scythes and sickles. Several of the small mill ponds that once fed the water wheels still exist along {{the course of the}} river. The Upper and Lower Sickle wheels were in the Normanton Spring area, about 1.5 km from the Brook’s source. Further downstream were Carr Forge and Rainbow Forge while the Cliff Wheel was located just under 1 km from the Brooks confluence with the River Rother. Notable owners and users of these wheels were the Staniforth family that ran the Thomas Staniforth & Co sickleworks in Hackenthorpe. The dam at Rainbow Forge no longer holds water and its embankments and stonework are difficult to find amongst the undergrowth. Carr Forge Dam is the best preserved area of water in the valley although its wheel and cottages have now vanished. The site of the Lower Sickle Wheel (also known as Nether Wheel) was excavated in 1988 revealing the foundations of the mill buildings and the pits which held the grinding wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Standard tires in {{all three}} years were Michelin-X (225-15) steel-belted radials with a narrow white {{sidewall}} design.First optional in 1975, and remaining so {{through the end of}} the 1979 model year, were Goodyear's LR78-15" [...] Custom Polysteel radials, in a Lincoln-exclusive [...] "Dual-Wide Band White Sidewall" [...] design (a wider white stripe about one-half-inch past wheel rim diameter, followed by a second, narrow, quarter-inch white stripe, about a quarter-inch outside of the wider inside stripe). This tended to create a more formal, luxurious appearance that only accentuated Mark V's exaggerated long-hood, short-deck, low-roofline styling.Back inside the trunk, in Lincoln's attempt to eke out a small increase in the amount of available trunk space, was a new-for-1977, inflatable spare tire option (a pressurized canister of tire propellant was included) which would replace the standard conventional, full-size spare, This was available for all three years of the Mark V's run. Regardless of any exterior wheel option selected, the standard, conventional spare tire would be of either Michelin or Goodyear brand (matching the vehicle's four exterior tires), but would be mounted on a standard, 15-inch conventional steel wheel. Hardcore aficionados would go to their dealer's parts department and order an extra turbine style or forged aluminum wheel, and have the dealer remount their spare tire, so that now all <b>five</b> <b>wheels</b> matched one another. This practice of spare tire wheel-matching was standard on Mark IV, but fell off the roster beginning in 1977.|$|E
5000|$|Besides clockwork, hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and {{mechanical}} compass vehicles, {{there were other}} impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.Furthermore, the oldest surviving rotating book case dates to the Song period (12th century), found at the Longxing Monastery of Zhengding, Hebei province.

The superconducting magnet for CMS has been designed to reach a 4 T field in a free bore of 6 m diameter and 12. 5 m length with a stored energy of 2. 6 GJ at full current.

The distinctive feature of the cold mass is the four-layer winding, made from a reinforced and stabilized NbTi conductor. The design and construction was carried out by CMS participating institutes through technical and contractual endeavors.

This paper presents a methodology for characterizing fuel use and emissions rates of {{construction equipment}} {{in order to better}} estimate air pollution emission rates. The research is based on real-world data collected ftom the equipment as it performed construction activities in tlre fleld. This study examined <b>five</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders by estimating the weighted-average fuel use and emissions rates via an engine load modal analysis. For each wheel loader, the engine load data was classified into 10 modes, ranging from the minimum to the maximum engine load, and an average fuel use and emissions rates were determined for each mode. The overall weighted-average fuel use rate was determined by multiplying the modal average fuel use and emissions rates by the percentage of time spent in that particular engine mode and then summing the results for each of the 10 modes. Monte Carlo simulation was used to model the distributions of the weighted-average fuel use rate for each wheel loader by randomly selecting values (within specified ranges) for the percentage of time spent in each engine mode and the modal average fuel use rate. The resutts indicate that there is inter-vehicle variability in the weighted-average fuel use rates of the <b>five</b> <b>wheel</b> loaders. A sensitivity analysis was also performed in order to determine which variables have the greatest impact on thg wqighted-averagg fuel use and emissions rates...|$|R
