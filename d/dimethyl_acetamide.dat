The optimum equilibration time was 15 min and the optimum thawing temperature was 40 Co Key words: Duck, semen, diluent, cryoprotectant, equilibration time, thawing temperatur...|$|E
40|$|Polyimides were {{synthesized}} from bicylic dianhydrides and diamines. The bicyclic monomers {{used were}} bicyclo[2. 2. 2]oct- 7 -ene- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetracarboxylic dianhydride, 1, 4, 7, 8 -tetrabromobicyclo[2. 2. 2]oct- 7 -ene- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetracarboxylic dianhydride and 1, 4, 7, 8 -tetrachlorobicyclo [2. 2. 2]oct- 7 -ene- 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetracarboxylic dianhydride. The diamines used were benzidine, 4, 4 ’-diaminodiphenyl ether, 4, 4 ’-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) dianiline and 4, 4 ’-(1, 4 -phenylenedioxy) dianiline. Each dianhydride was polycondensed {{with each of}} the diamines in N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) at elevated temperatures. The polymers were characterized by means of IR and 13 C NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, solubility and thermal analysis such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA studies indicate that the polymers were all stable to above 320 °C. Most of the polymers were found to be soluble in highly polar, high boiling point solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP), <b>dimethyl</b> <b>acetamide</b> (DMAc) as well as concentrated sulfuric acid. Selected comparative solubility studies with wholly aromatic analogues of the bicyclic polyimide indicate that the bicyclic polymers show better solubility. Thermal studies of the behavior of the bicyclic components of the polyimides were carried out by the use of low molecular weight imide dimers. The results obtained indicate that the bicyclic ring system undergoes a thermal retro Diels-Alder reaction thus separating into two fragments...|$|E
40|$|New {{class of}} {{inorganic-organic}} hybrid micro-composites were {{prepared by the}} introduction of different proportions of colloidal silica particles into the polyamide matrix. Poly(phenyleneterephthalamide) was prepared by reacting a mixture of m- and p-phenylenediamines with terephthaloyl chloride in <b>dimethyl</b> <b>acetamide.</b> Colloidal silica particles were obtained separately through sol-gel process by controlling the hydrolysis and condensation steps using tetraethoxysilane, ethanol, fuming HCl and water. Various proportions of the resulting sol were mixed with the polymer solution. 1 % aminophenyltrimethoxysilane was added as a coupling agent in each case. Films were cast by evaporating the solvent and these films up to 5 % wt. silica were yellow, tough and transparent, whereas the films with 7. 5 % wt. silica or more were off-white in color and opaque. Mechanical properties of these films were analyzed. The values of tensile strength, maximum strain at rupture, initial modulus and toughness were initially found to increase and then decrease with further addition of silica. The maximum tensile stress was observed with 5 % wt. silica (204 MPa) and tensile modulus was found in the range of 2. 70 to 3. 74 GPa at 25 °C. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was carried out on the samples and the tanä data showed an increase in Tg with increase in silica contents. The storage modulus was found to be in the range of 9. 55 to 10. 25 GPa at 100 °C...|$|E
