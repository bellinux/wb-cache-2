5|$|Various {{calculations}} {{show that}} hassium {{should be the}} heaviest known group 8 element, consistent with the periodic law. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier <b>homologue</b> of osmium, with a few deviations arising from relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin systems {{are designed to}} be bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A <b>homologue</b> of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of tweetio {{derivatives}} of various 2C drugs have been synthesised and tested, including the 2-ethoxy <b>homologues</b> 2CD-2EtO, 2CB-2EtO, 2CI-2EtO, 2CT-2EtO, 2CT2-2EtO, 2CT4-2EtO and 2CT7-2EtO, the 5-ethoxy <b>homologues</b> 2CD-5EtO, 2CE-5EtO, 2CB-5EtO, 2CT-5EtO and 2CT2-5EtO, and the 2,5-diethoxy <b>homologues</b> 2CD-diEtO, 2CB-diEtO and 2CT2-diEtO. In general the 2-ethoxy <b>homologues</b> were all several times less potent and somewhat shorter acting than the parent compounds, while the 2,5-diethoxy <b>homologues</b> were far less potent and qualitatively milder even at high doses. The 5-ethoxy <b>homologues</b> however were of a similar potency to the parent compounds and much longer-lasting, with both 2CE-5EtO and 2CT2-5EtO lasting 24 hours or more. At small doses, the 5-ethoxy <b>homologues</b> are reputed to produce weaker psychedelic effects, but with increased nootropic action, which might potentially make them useful as study aids.|$|R
50|$|<b>Homologues</b> of SgaT, {{like other}} PTS protein <b>homologues,</b> have been {{identified}} in a large number of evolutionarily divergent bacteria, but not in archaea or eukaryotes. Bacteria that encode SgaT <b>homologues</b> include numerous Gram-negative proteobacteria, as well as many low and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria.

In the latter case ATP hydrolysis again energizes transport. ARC3 <b>homologues</b> transport the same anions as ArsA/AB <b>homologues,</b> though ArsB <b>homologues</b> are members of the IT Superfamily and <b>homologues</b> of the ARC3 family are within the BART Superfamily suggesting they may not be evolutionarily related.|$|R
5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier <b>homologue</b> of ytterbium. The Russian scientists proposed the name joliotium (Jo) for the new element after Irène Joliot-Curie, who had recently died, creating an element naming controversy {{that would not be}} resolved for several decades, which each group using its own proposed names.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, dubnium is located in group 5 as the third member of the 6d series of transition metals. Limited investigation of dubnium chemistry has demonstrated that dubnium behaves as a typical group 5 element and the heavier <b>homologue</b> to tantalum; however, some deviations from periodic trends occur due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a d-block transactinide element.

5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter <b>homologue,</b> gallium, but lower than its heavier <b>homologue,</b> thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier <b>homologue</b> of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter <b>homologue</b> platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
40|$|The ArsA ATPase of E. coli {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in arsenic detoxification. Published evidence implicates ArsA in the energization of As(III) efflux via the formation of an oxyanion-translocating complex with ArsB.

By aligning ArsA <b>homologues,</b> constructing phylogenetic trees, examining ArsA encoding operons, and estimating the probable coevolution of these <b>homologues</b> with putative transporters and auxiliary proteins unrelated to ArsB, we provide evidence for new functions for ArsA <b>homologues.</b> They may play roles in carbon starvation, gas vesicle biogenesis, and arsenic resistance.

30|$|In general, higher {{chlorinated}} <b>homologues</b> {{are more}} stable and, therefore, longer lasting and persistent in soils [5]. Oxidative biodegradation in soils is executed mainly by microorganisms and some fungi favoring humid, organic and pH-neutral soils. The less chlorine {{is bound to}} the benzene rings the more rapid degradation follows. Degradation of higher chlorinated <b>homologues</b> seems to occur favourably under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, the abundance of higher chlorinated <b>homologues</b> outnumbers that of the lower chlorinated <b>homologues.</b> This matches quite well with research done on atmospheric samples carried out by Castro-Jiménez et al. [6].|$|R

Erwinia herbicola'''' and Pseudomonas aeruginosa'''' {{are known to have}} <b>homologues</b> for cyclohexadienyl dehydratase. Of the plants with ADT <b>homologues,</b> both Arabidopsis thaliana and Petunia hybrida are known to have paralogues for the gene (six and three, respectively).|$|R
5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass <b>homologue</b> of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter <b>homologue</b> hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block element and {{the second of the}} fourth-row transition elements. It {{is a member of the}} 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier <b>homologue</b> to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K is a {{fat-soluble vitamin}} {{involved}} in blood coagulation and bone metabolism. The detection and monitoring of vitamin K <b>homologues</b> in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients is a challenging problem {{due to the}} smaller concentrations of vitamin K {{and the presence of}} several interfering medications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a new highly sensitive and selective chemiluminescence (CL) method designated to quantify vitamin K <b>homologues</b> in plasma of RA patients including phylloquinone (PK, vitamin K(1)), menaquinone- 4 (MK- 4, vitamin K(2)) and menaquinone- 7 (MK- 7, vitamin K(2)). The method was based on the unique photochemical properties of vitamin K <b>homologues</b> that were exploited for selective luminol CL reaction. The correlation coefficients of 0. 998 or more were obtained in the concentration ranges of 0. 1 - 100 ng mL(- 1) vitamin K <b>homologues.</b> The detection limits were 0. 03 - 0. 1 ng mL(- 1) in human plasma for vitamin K <b>homologues.</b> The developed HPLC-CL system was successfully applied for selective determination of vitamin K <b>homologues</b> in plasma of RA patients.
