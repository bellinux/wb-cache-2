5000|$|Raako Manik and {{his family}} owns <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> Private Limited, a company based in the Republic of Maldives {{primarily}} involved in island reclamation and harbor development works. The government of Maldives have awarded numerous projects to Manik without a bidding process. Such projects included Thilafushi Corporation Limited (TCL) awarding a US$21 million (Rf269.8 million) reclamation project to <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> on September 30, 2010 to reclaim 130 hectares from Thilafushi lagoon and Emboodhoo reclamation projects.This Project was awarded {{to him as a}} favour to his anti Maumoonism Philosophy. <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> claimed that Thilafushi reclamation project was won by competitively bidding with the Netherlands' Boskalis International and Maldives Transport and Contracting Company (MTCC) Yet, both the MTCC and Netherlandâ€™s Boskalis International denied claims by Thilafushi Corporation Limited (TCL) and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> that both the companies submitted proposals for the Thilafushi reclamation project. [...] This resulted in the Maldivian Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) ordering TCL to halt the project being carried out by <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> Maldives, to reclaim 130 hectares from Thilafushi lagoon and to re-invite bids due to lack of a fair and equitable bidding process. Yet the reclamation is ongoing despite ACC request to halt the process. Further, the Maldives Environment Protection Agency slammed <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load</b> Maldives for starting to reclaim Thilafushi lagoon on February 4, 2011, without the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) license. This has also been ignored by <b>Heavy</b> <b>Load.</b>|$|R

The more advanced Planet design was better suited to <b>heavy</b> <b>loads,</b> and Rocket became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used to haul coal until 1844.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were shipped from Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry <b>heavy</b> <b>loads.</b> The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|Powered winches {{were used}} on cargo ships {{to speed the}} {{handling}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>loads.</b> One winch was operated {{at each of the}} ship's five cargo holds. During loading operations, the winches were worked hard, requiring steady maintenance to remain operable. Winch brakesa safety feature provided for stopping the load from falling if the winch's main power was lostwere not often used by a skilled winch operator, as the load could be more quickly maneuvered using various power settings than by application of the brakes. Disused brakes sometimes seized up and stopped working. The winches on the SS E. A. Bryan were steam-powered and showed signs of wear, even though the ship was only five months old.|$|E

5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which {{was better than}} the systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam than any other model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Bridge Gross Weight Formula, {{also known}} as Bridge Formula B or the Federal Bridge Formula, is a {{mathematical}} formula in use in the United States by truck drivers and Department of Transportation (DOT) officials to determine the appropriate maximum gross weight for a commercial motor vehicle (CMV) based on axle number and spacing. The formula is part of federal weight and size regulations regarding interstate commercial traffic (intrastate traffic is subject to state limits). The formula is necessary to prevent heavy vehicles from damaging roads and bridges. CMVs are most often tractor-trailers or buses, but the formula is of most interest to truck drivers due to the <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> their vehicles often carry.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E

These studies show that CSMA/CD performs well under light network load but not well at <b>heavy</b> <b>load.</b> To improve the performance of CSMA/CD under <b>heavy</b> <b>load,</b> a new concept called network partitioning is presented. Network partitioning allows the network to be partitioned into segments when under <b>heavy</b> <b>load.</b> Partition stations then act as bridges between the segments. The impact of network partitioning on network performance was tested using a simulation model of an Ethernet local area network (an implementation of the CSMA/CD medium access control).

5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to cross it. Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E
5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & Froude with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
5|$|As the {{men were}} {{equipped}} for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet {{was replaced by a}} woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergen rucksack to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces' camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength and agility, particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull <b>heavy</b> <b>loads,</b> {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E
5|$|The baggage camel {{should be}} robust and heavy. Studies have {{recommended}} the camel should have either a small {{or a large}} head with a narrow aquiline nose, prominent eyes and large lips. The neck should be medium to long so the head is held high. The chest should be deep and the hump should be well-developed with sufficient space behind it to accommodate the saddle. The hindlegs should be heavy, muscular and sturdy. The dromedary can be trained to carry baggage {{from the age of}} five years, but must not be given <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> before the age of six. The hawia is a typical baggage saddle from Sudan. The methods of training the baggage camels are similar to those for riding camels.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and not forced to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>loads</b> {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E
