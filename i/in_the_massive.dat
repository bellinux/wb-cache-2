5|$|As the Doctor and {{geologist}} Nasreen Chaudhry arrive by TARDIS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> Silurian underground civilisation, {{they are}} captured {{and taken to}} the Silurian doctor, Malohkeh. The Silurians' hostility is increased when the Doctor recalls his previous meeting with a similar race of reptilian humanoids which were destroyed by humans, {{a reference to the}} Third Doctor in Doctor Who and the Silurians. Meanwhile, Amy and Mo escape from Malokeh's experimentation and Mo discovers his son, Elliot, sedated in a chamber and under observation. When Malokeh realises the Doctor is not human, the leader of the Silurian warrior caste, Restac, insists both the Doctor and Nasreen be executed and escorts them to a Silurian court; though Amy and Mo interrupt the trial with stolen weapons, they too are captured. Eldane, Restac's superior, is called in by Malohkeh and demands a halt to the hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Engine supply {{problems}} {{complicated the}} construction of the aircraft. Production of the ATsN superchargers could not be organized in any systematic way and only the first four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Factory No. 124 shut down its Pe-8 production line at the beginning of 1940 while alternative engines were evaluated. Somewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> Soviet chain of command, {{the decision was made to}} proceed without the superchargers. The unavailability of the Klimov M-100 engine of the ATsN-2 installation required a design change, although this modification allowed a commander and radio operator to be carried in its place. Then, to compound the problem further, the production of AM-34FRNV engines ended in the second half of 1939. Only two or four Pe-8s were equipped with them. Eighteen of the aircraft produced by the end of 1940 were fitted with AM-35A engines.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{downloadable}} content packs were released. The Multiplayer Havoc Pack {{launched on}} the game's release date of August 21, 2012, and contains five characters {{for use in}} multiplayer: Perceptor, Ultra Magnus, Blast Off, Wheeljack, and Zeta Prime. It also unlocks the associated customization pieces related to these characters. The Dinobots, excluding Sludge, make up the DLC Dinobot Destructor Pack, released on September 11. The Insecticons, G1 Optimus, Megatron, Hound, and G2 Bruticus were released as DLC for single and multiplayer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Massive</b> Fury Pack on September 25. Players can also purchase specific customization pieces for their multiplayer characters via microtransactions, allowing players to access content they would otherwise have to play to unlock.|$|E
5|$|One {{specific}} failure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> {{operation was}} the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, {{a lack of}} transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of transport aircraft meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E
5|$|The current theatre {{opened on}} 28 April 1897. Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his {{tremendous}} {{success at the}} Haymarket Theatre, and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction {{until his death in}} 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive,</b> central, square French-style dome. This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years. The theatre opened with a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker's The Seats of the Mighty. Adaptations of novels by Dickens, Tolstoy, and others formed {{a significant part of the}} repertoire, along with classical works from Molière and Shakespeare. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of J. M. Synge's The Tinker's Wedding on 11 November 1909 and George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with Tree as Henry Higgins and Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza, in 1914. Tree's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects, often including live animals and real grass. These remained both popular and profitable, but in his last decade, Tree's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded, and many of his plays received bad reviews. Tree defended himself from critical censure, demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death.|$|E

25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E
25|$|Calculations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>massive</b> {{sector that}} are done without zero modes will usually yield the correct answer. The neglect of zero modes merely worsens the convergence. One {{exception}} {{is that of}} cubic scalar theories, where the spectrum extends to minus infinity. A DLCQ calculation without zero modes will require careful extrapolation to detect this infinity, whereas a calculation that includes zero modes yields the correct result immediately. The zero modes are avoided if one uses antiperiodic boundary conditions.|$|E

Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods, and the affected district lay in ruins for decades.|$|E
