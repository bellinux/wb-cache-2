5|$|Although a 12th-century monastic chronicler at Worcester called Leofric Edward's {{chancellor}}, {{this is not}} correct, as Edward had no chancellor at this time. Historians {{are divided}} {{on whether or not}} Edward <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> an official that could be called a chancellor, but they are agreed that Leofric did not hold such an office.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war against Mexico in May 1845 and especially after the claim by the US of southwest lands under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, US military incursions into Yavapai territory greatly increased. After gold was discovered in California in 1849, more White emigrants passed through Yavapai territory than <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> before. Despite the thousands of emigrants passing through their territory, the Yavapai avoided contact with Whites.|$|E

5|$|Players not {{returning}} from the previous season included: Horse Bishop, Cecil Beck, Speedy Walker, Tom Fuller, Charlie Tucker, and Bill Middlekauff. Practice was opened on September 3. A wealth of talented players from Florida high schools was expected. After spending just two weeks with the team, while many players were engaged in other sports, Bachman declared his backfield material as the finest he <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek {{to have been an}} unrequited love of then-teenage Adolf Hitler. Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to {{speculation}} in this context. However, there is no evidence apart from Kubizek that Hitler <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> such an attachment.|$|E

5|$|The 1906 Vanderbilt {{team had}} one of the best seasons in the school's history, outscoring opponents 278–16. Innis Brown rated the 1906 team as the best the South <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> Vanderbilt won all of its home games, {{finishing}} the season on a 22-game home win streak. Their only loss came on the road to western power Michigan, 10–4; the game had been tied until the closing minutes.|$|E
5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans-Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led {{to the construction of}} many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent Burlington Station.|$|E

Cecil Duffee and Billy Dabbs scored on runs of 19 and 16-yards in the first quarter; Duffee scored on a 34-yard {{reception}} from Tris Mock in the second quarter; Stephenson scored on an eight-yard run in the third quarter; and Charley Spier scored on a 40-yard interception return in the fourth quarter. The only Alabama points of the contest came in the fourth quarter, down 35–0 when John Wade threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Barton Greer. Although not included as part of Alabama's all-time record, {{this is the only}} loss Alabama <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> against Howard.|$|E

5|$|Nobel laureates {{receive a}} diploma {{directly}} {{from the hands of}} the King of Sweden, {{or in the case of}} the peace prize, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureates that receive them.

None of the Nobel Peace Prize laureates has <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> a citation on their diplomas.|$|E

Two episodes were watched by nearly a million Canadian viewers and helped the season garner an average audience of 600,000, making it the most-viewed domestic drama in Canada. In the US, one episode from the season was watched by over half-a-million viewers, the highest audience figure The N had <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> Only three awards were won for the season, from a total of nine nominations.|$|E
5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still believe those with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> seizures.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{military}} and government conducted many interrogations, asking if women had <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> {{sexual relations with}} another woman and essentially equating even a one-time experience to a criminal identity, thereby severely delineating heterosexuals from homosexuals. In 1952 homosexuality was listed as a pathological emotional disturbance in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The view that homosexuality was a curable sickness was widely believed in the medical community, general population, and among many lesbians themselves.|$|E
5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. The {{landscape}} is littered with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|When Lisa {{succeeds in}} making {{friends with a}} group of local children, Bart becomes jealous and plots revenge against Lisa. He decides to teach Lisa a lesson by showing her friends her yearbook, {{revealing}} that she is a nerd. Lisa is furious at Bart, thinking that his disclosure has turned her friends away. Eventually, at a carnival, Bart realises how depressed Lisa has become, and how he cost her the only friends she has <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> However, when Lisa returns to the beach house from the carnival she finds her friends in the act of decorating the Simpsons' car with sea shells in her honor, and they explain that they like her for who she is. To make up with Lisa, Bart has them sign her yearbook.|$|E

5|$|William Shatner plays Captain James T. Kirk; Shatner {{felt that}} though dramatic, the script made Kirk look too prejudiced. Kirk's second-in-command, the Vulcan Spock, is portrayed by Leonard Nimoy. DeForest Kelley plays Leonard McCoy, the {{chief medical officer}} of the Enterprise; Kelley's {{appearance}} as the doctor in The Undiscovered Country was to be his last screen role. With Leonard Nimoy the film's executive producer, the 71-year-old Kelley was paid US$1million for the role, assuring a comfortable retirement for the veteran actor. Kelley and Shatner shot their prison scenes {{over the course of}} six to eight nights; the two actors {{got to know each other}} better than they <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b>|$|E
5|$|After pushing Max away, Donna finally invites him to {{the club}} to see her perform. When he arrives she {{performs}} a set, speaking about how she is pregnant and planning to have an abortion. Max leaves, but {{on the day of}} Donna's abortion, he arrives at her home with flowers and asks if he can accompany her to her procedure. While at the clinic he tells her he supports her, and that when he said {{that he wanted to be}} a grandfather, he meant sometime far in the future. The two agree that this is one of the nicest Valentine's Days they have <b>ever</b> <b>had.</b> After the abortion, Max takes Donna to his home where he makes her tea, and then they watch Gone with the Wind together.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{teaching}} music at Hull House, Smith {{served as the}} choral director. She also composed songs and arranged music specifically for her students to perform. She initiated an annual Christmas concert which also included a dramatic presentation and was eagerly anticipated by the neighborhood for its holiday pageantry. Under her direction of the music school, the Hull House Boy's Band developed, which included immigrant boys from the neighborhood who would later become noted jazz performers. Jazz pianist Art Hodes recalled {{that one of the}} first jam sessions he <b>ever</b> <b>had</b> occurred when a young clarinetist named Benny Goodman joined the Boy's Band.
