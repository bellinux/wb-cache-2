500|$|In a January 1996 murder case, the {{defendant}} counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, {{claimed that the}} pair listened to [...] "Israel's Son", from Frogstomp, which contributed {{to the murder of}} Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics [...] "'Hate is what <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> you/I {{want you to know that}} I want you dead'" [...] which were [...] "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to [...] "steal money and belongings and run off to California." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote [...] "the King {{has lost}} another little child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond." [...] Shortly afterward, King George said [...] "There {{will be no}} Heaven for me if Octavius is not there." [...] The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was {{completing}} {{the finishing touches on}} a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius' sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius' death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day [...] "increases the chasm <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> want of that beloved object [...]" [...] In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, 2006, Robert Sorich, formally, {{director}} of the Mayor's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and, informally, Daley's patronage chief, and Timothy McCarthy, Sorich's aide, were each convicted on two counts of mail fraud connected to rigging blue-collar city jobs and promotions. Sorich's best friend, former Streets and Sanitation official Patrick Slattery was convicted of one count of mail fraud. A former Streets and Sanitation managing deputy commissioner {{was found guilty of}} lying to federal agents about political hiring. Sorich, McCarthy and Slattery lived in the Bridgeport neighborhood in 11th Ward, the Daley family's home neighborhood and ward. [...] "I've never known them to be anything but hard working, and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> them at this difficult time," [...] Daley said. [...] "It is fair criticism to say I should have exercised greater oversight to ensure that every worker the city hired, regardless of who recommended them, was qualified and that proper procedures were always followed," [...] Daley admitted a few days later. Weeks later, David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant whose clients included Daley, defended patronage in an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1792 Sophia and {{her sister}} Mary were being {{included}} in more family activities, and at age fourteen, Sophia debuted at court on her father's birthday, 4 June 1792. According to biographer Christopher Hibbert, in her young adulthood Sophia was a [...] "delightful though moody girl, pretty, delicate and passionate." [...] As within her childhood, Sophia was devoted to her father, though she occasionally found him exasperating. She wrote that [...] "the dear King is all kindness to me, and I cannot say how grateful <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] Prior to 1788, King George had told his daughters {{that he would take}} them to Hanover and find them suitable husbands despite misgivings he had, which stemmed from his sisters' own unhappy marriages. He remarked, [...] "I cannot deny that I have never wished to see any of them marry: I am happy in their company, and do not in the least want a separation." [...] However, the King suffered his first bout of madness that year, when Sophia was aged eleven. Sophia remarked of her father's behaviour, [...] "He is all affection and kindness to me, but sometimes an over kindness, if you can understand that, which greatly alarms me." [...] Further lapses into insanity occurred in 1801 and 1804, thus forestalling talk of marriage for his daughters. The question of matrimony was rarely raised; Queen Charlotte feared the subject, something which had always discomforted the King, would push him back into insanity. Furthermore, the queen, strained from her husband's illness, wanted the princesses to remain close to her.|$|E

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire {{we have in our}} game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you he is the best baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You don't. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid.

2500|$|Other singles {{which helped}} the <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>For</b> You album to go {{platinum}} included [...] "This is My Night" [...] and the ballad [...] "Through the Fire", {{the latter of}} which was also very successful on the adult contemporary chart. Khan was featured in Steve Winwood's 1986 number one hit, [...] "Higher Love". That same year, a duet was planned with Robert Palmer for the song [...] "Addicted To Love". However, her manager declined to allow the duet to be released, citing the desire to not have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time; she was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album's liner notes, and the song became an international hit. Khan followed up her successful <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>For</b> You album with 1986's Destiny and 1988's CK. Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a remix album, , which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result, she performed regularly in the United Kingdom, where she maintained a strong fan base.|$|E
2500|$|Following each scenario, {{people were}} {{presented}} with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was [...] "he/she accepts you." [...] The other option was [...] "he/she rejects you." [...] People {{were asked to rate}} the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> him or her, then my partner will accept me." [...] People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>for</b> him or her, then my attachment will reject me." [...] Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas.

Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, but I was so shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high."

[...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television.
