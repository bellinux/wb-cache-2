50|$|Many jurisdictions {{exercise}} {{an equitable}} doctrine known as <b>dependent</b> <b>relative</b> <b>revocation</b> ("DRR"). Under this doctrine, courts may disregard a revocation {{that was based}} on a mistake of law {{on the part of the}} testator as to the effect of the revocation. For example, if a testator mistakenly believes that an earlier will can be revived by the revocation of a later will, the court will ignore the later revocation if the later will comes closer to fulfilling the testator's intent than not having a will at all. The doctrine also applies when a testator executes a second, or new will and revokes their old will under the (mistaken) belief that the new will would be valid. However, if for some reason the new will is not valid, a court may apply the doctrine to reinstate and probate the old will, if the court holds that the testator would prefer the old will to intestate succession.|$|E

40|$|Aims and objectives. Uncover {{how women}} self-manage their own chronic illness while {{taking care of}} a <b>dependent</b> <b>relative.</b> Background. International {{policies}} place special emphasis in promoting interventions addressed to control, prevent and care for people with chronic health conditions. Self-management is a crucial part of this care. Caregivers are more prone to have chronic illness than non-caregivers. They are confronted with dilemmas about taking care of themselves while taking care of their <b>dependent</b> <b>relative</b> and the rest of their families. Caregivers articulate strategies to enable them to focus their energy on caring. Design. Qualitative study using constructivist grounded theory. Methods. Thirty-nine women caregivers with a chronic illness participated in the study. Twenty-three semi-structured interviews and two focus groups were carried out between April 2010 –December 2011. Data were analysed using grounded theory procedures. Findings. Self-management helps women caregivers with a chronic illness to balance the demands of their own illness and those of the <b>dependent</b> <b>relative.</b> They self-manage their illness by self-regulating the treatment, by regulating their strength and by controlling their emotions. Conclusions. Women caregivers integrate effectively and creatively the management of their chronic illnesses within the complexities of family care. This renders their health needs invisible and reaffirms them as capable caregivers. Relevance to clinical practice. Identifying self-management strategies of women caregivers allow health professionals to acknowledge and reinforce effective self-care measures and to deter those that are ineffective and lessen their quality of life.

40|$|AbstractGas {{condensate}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} different fluids in reservoir simulation due to retrograde condensation in case of pressure reduction. In this kind of fluids, two phenomena named negative inertia and positive coupling, become significant in the high velocity zone around the wellbore. In this study, a modified black oil simulator is developed that take into account the velocity <b>dependent</b> <b>relative</b> permeability. Against the industrial simulator that assumes linear variation of transmissibilities by pressure, modified black oil nonlinear equations are solved directly without linearization. The developed code is validated by ECLIPSE simulator. The behavior of two real gas condensate fluids, a lean and a rich one, are compared with each other. For each fluid, simulations of PVT experiments are carried out to calculate black oil property applying Coats approach for gas condensate fluids. For both fluids, the proposed models for gas condensate velocity <b>dependent</b> <b>relative</b> permeability show different influence of velocity on relative permeability in the same conditions. Moreover, it is observed that higher flow rate of gas production leads to more condensate production during constant rate well testing...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Extended working {{lives and}} life expectancies mean that {{increasing}} numbers of workers in Europe, especially older workers, are now providing care for <b>dependent</b> <b>relatives</b> while they are in employment. Although many actors are involved in providing care – the state, family, companies and social partners – it is still {{for the most part}} delivered by unpaid family members. Given the range of institutional policy frameworks with vested interests in the area of reconciling work and care, it is difficult to arrive at a coordinated strategy. Families often tend to organise care themselves, delegating care to family members who have the least opportunity costs. But with increasing employment participation at an older age, carers are nowadays more likely to be still engaged in paid work. This report highlights the issue of people of working age combining employment with providing care to <b>dependent</b> <b>relatives,</b> either children or older persons. It analyses the situation of working carers, how they manage to combine work and care and what measures are available to support them in their responsibilities beyond their professional activity. The study examines developments in national labour legislation, collective agreements and company initiatives. It is based on responses to a questionnaire completed by Eurofound’s network of European correspondents in all 28 EU Member States...|$|R
5000|$|DRR may {{be applied}} to restore a gift erroneously struck from a will if {{the intent of the}} {{testator}} was to enlarge that gift, but will not apply to restore such a gift if the intent of the testator was to revoke the gift in favor of another person. For example, suppose Tom has a will that bequeaths $5,000 to his secretary, Alice Johnson. If Tom crosses out that clause and writes [...] "$7,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] in the margin, but does not sign or date the writing in the margin, most states would find that Tom had revoked the earlier provision, but had not effectively amended his will to add the second; however, under DRR the revocation would be undone because Tom was acting under the mistaken belief that he could increase the gift to $7,000 by writing that in the margin. Therefore, Alice will get 5,000 dollars. However, the doctrine of <b>relative</b> <b>revocation</b> will not apply if the interlineation decreases the amount of the gift from the original provision (e.g., [...] "$5,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] is crossed out and replaced with [...] "$3,000 to Alice Johnson" [...] without Testator's signature or the date in the margin; DRR does not apply and Alice Johnson will take nothing).|$|R

40|$|Whether an {{individual}} can or cannot participate in the Czech public health insurance system depends on several characteristics, {{one of which is}} whether he/she has permanent residence status in the Czech Republic, and a second whether he/she is employed. This means that those without permanent residence status, including self-employed migrants from third countries, their <b>dependent</b> <b>relatives,</b> and the <b>dependent</b> <b>relatives</b> of third country employees in the Czech Republic, cannot participate in the public health insurance system. Some argue that such migrants {{should be included in the}} system, since commercial health insurance is disadvantageous and the contributions they would pay into the public health insurance system would increase the public health insurance agencies’ income. We estimate the value of the contributions to public health insurance that would be paid by third country self-employed and non-working immigrants, if they were insured based on data from 2011 to 2013, and compare this to the assumed costs of their medical care. To calculate the contributions for self-employed migrants we use data on the distribution of the tax base for self-employed persons from personal income tax returns. Our estimation results in an overall negative balance of 22 million CZK on the data for 2012 and 2013. In the current system this deficit would be covered by the state, which would pay contributions to the system for certain (state insured) persons amounting to 97 million CZK; overall therefore the inclusion of these immigrants would result in a positive balance of 75 million CZK...|$|R
