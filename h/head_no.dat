5|$|One of ten {{species of}} the genus Lambertia within the family Proteaceae, Lambertia formosa {{is the only one}} found in eastern Australia as the others are all {{restricted}} to southwest Western Australia. Common names include mountain devil and honey flower, the former from the fruit's resemblance to a devil's <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> subspecies are recognised, although plants {{in the southern part of}} its range from Bargo River to Braidwood have longer leaves.|$|E

25|$|The {{ichthyosaur}} pelvis {{is typically}} rather reduced. The three pelvic bones: the ilium, the ischium, and the pubic bone, are not fused and {{often do not}} even touch each other. Also, {{the left and right}} pelvic sides do not longer touch; only basal forms still have sacral ribs connecting the ilia to the vertebral column. The hip joint is not closed on the inside. The pubic bone typically does not connect to the ischium behind it; the space in between is by some workers identified as the fenestra thyreoidea; other researchers deny that the term is applicable given the general loose structure of the pelvis. Some later species have a connected pubic bone and ischium, but in this case, the femoral <b>head</b> <b>no</b> longer articulates with the hip joint. Triassic species have plate-like pubic bones and ischia; in later species these elements become elongated with a narrow shaft and can form a single rod.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} victim was 45-year-old Laquetta Gunther, who {{was found in}} an alley on December 26, 2005. She {{had been shot in}} the back of the head. DNA was {{recovered}} from the scene. The second victim was 34-year-old Julie Green, found January 14, 2006. She had also been shot in the back of the <b>head.</b> <b>No</b> DNA was recovered, but tire tracks were found. The tires were for a 2003 Taurus or Sable and in fact the exact tires were later found. Just over a month later, on February 24, 2006 police found the body of Iwana Patton, 35, on a dirt road. She had been shot, but not in the back of the head, and possibly had struggled with her killer. DNA was recovered, along with a shell casing that allowed police to identify the make and model of pistol used. (.40-caliber Smith & Wesson Sigma Series VE.) Ballistics from recovered bullets and recovered DNA matched. Authorities received an anonymous telephone call describing the location of Patton's body, but the caller was eventually identified and questioned, and is not a suspect in the killings. All three women are believed to have worked as sex workers in the Daytona Beach area. Police believe the victims voluntarily accompanied their killer, possibly in a vehicle, and were subsequently murdered and dumped in the same area of Daytona Beach. The killer did not attempt to conceal the bodies.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study that explores how head tracking and stereo affect user performance when rotating 3 D virtual objects using isomorphic and non-isomorphic rotation techniques. Our experiment compares isomorphic with non-isomorphic rotation utilizing four different display modes (<b>no</b> <b>head</b> tracking/no stereo, <b>head</b> tracking/no stereo, <b>no</b> <b>head</b> tracking/stereo, and head tracking/stereo) and two different angular error thresholds for task completion. Our {{results indicate that}} rotation error is significantly reduced when subjects perform the task using non-isomorphic 3 D rotation with head tracking/stereo than with <b>no</b> <b>head</b> tracking/no stereo. In addition, subjects performed the rotation task with significantly less error with <b>head</b> tracking/stereo and <b>no</b> <b>head</b> tracking/stereo than with <b>no</b> <b>head</b> tracking/no stereo, regardless of rotation technique. Subjects also highly rated the importance of stereo and non-isomorphic amplification in the 3 D rotation task. Keywords: evaluation non-isomorphic 3 D rotation, stereo, head tracking...|$|R

2500|$|The rural {{municipality}} of Indian <b>Head</b> <b>No.</b> 156 contained amongst its communities Fort Qu'Appelle and South Qu'Appelle {{in the late}} 19th century and early 20th century. [...] One of the early problems was spring flooding from the neighboring Qu'Appelle river when it overflowed its banks washing out bridges. [...] 21 dams {{were built in the}} pioneering days to help with the yearly flooding. [...] The steel bridge built over the Qu'Appelle river at Blackwood Crossing eased problems of communication and commerce immensely. The Qu'Appelle River Dam and the Gardiner Dam formed Lake Diefenbaker. [...] The Qu'Appele River Dam is the origin of the Qu'Appelle River from whence it flows east to the confluence with the Assiniboine River in the province of Manitoba.|$|E
