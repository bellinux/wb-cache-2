25|$|The Clergy of the Church of England {{database}} (CCEd) <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> Samuel Fisher's ordination as priest at Eccleshall by Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Lichfield, on 18 December 1630. The five years, 1630-5, between Fisher's ordination and {{his appointment}} as rector at Upton Magna, are largely unaccounted for. Rigg's {{account in the}} Dictionary of National Biography implies that he worked at St Bride's Church in London before coming to Shropshire: this is almost certainly untrue, as he {{is known to have}} worked there in the 1650s. Fisher's ordination by Thomas Morton seems to connect him from the outset of his career with the West Midlands and his preaching at Shrewsbury in 1633 shows that he was moderately known as a preacher in the region before his presentation to the rectory. However, it is not known how or where, or even if, he had an ecclesiastical living during this period.|$|E

25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in a {{military}} aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated in the Iran-Contra affair, refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E

25|$|Lancashire County Cricket Club <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>record</b> <b>of</b> strong {{finances}} {{which has}} been attributed to several factors including its diverse facilities and having the largest membership in the country. The Old Trafford Lodge is a hotel {{which is part of the}} ground and the ground has been used for conference facilities and has staged music concerts. Another source of income is opening the ground's car park during Manchester United F.C.'s home matches. Between 2004 and 2006, the club made record profits, each year getting progressively better and in 2006 recorded a profit of £747,370. While in 2009 more than half of the 18 counties were in profit, 15 in 2010 experienced financial losses, Lancashire included. The total losses of the 18 counties amounted to over £9million. Lancashire suffered losses of £2.1million for 2010, primarily because of the club's investment in rebuilding Old Trafford, particularly the construction of The Point. The absence of Test cricket and legal action related to the ground's redevelopment also contributed to the financial loss.|$|E
