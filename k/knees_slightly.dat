25|$|Standing {{with legs}} {{slightly}} apart and <b>knees</b> <b>slightly</b> bent, the dancer then bends their left elbow {{to enable them}} to place their left hand behind their head. They then outstretch their right arm inline with their right shoulder, hand flat in a vertical position. The dancer then rotates around the waist in a 180 degree sweep, pulling back three times as you move your arm to the left, and then in one motion swing right arm back to the right. The move is then repeated. The dancer may then swap arms and reverse the move.|$|E
2500|$|By the 19th century, it was {{estimated}} that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%. Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to marry into money in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the [...] "Golden Lotus", being about three Chinese inches long (around [...] in Western measurement). This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the <b>knees</b> <b>slightly</b> and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.|$|E

500|$|During his career, Getzein's drew acclaim for his curveball. [...] Getzein's {{version of}} the pitch was {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "pretzel curve." [...] Sporting Life described Getzein's unusual delivery as follows: [...] "In delivering his 'pretzels' 'Getz' faces third base with one foot in either corner of {{the lower end of the}} box. [...] Bending the left <b>knee</b> <b>slightly,</b> he draws his right arm well back. [...] Then, straightening up quickly, he slides the left foot forward with a characteristic little skip, and, bringing his arm around with a swift overhand swing, drives the ball in at a lively pace." ...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{component}} is the {{positioning of the}} feet in a boxing stance, with the non-shooting side foot ahead of the shooting side foot. A person shooting right-handed will have the right foot angled out to approximately forty-five degrees {{to the side and}} to the rear at shoulder length. Most of the shooter's weight will be on the forward foot, with the forward <b>knee</b> <b>slightly</b> bent and the rear leg nearly straight. The shooter's upper torso should be leaning forward at the hips, aiming the shoulders towards the forward foot. The rear foot will help catch the force of recoil, as well as allow for rapid changes in position. The majority of the shooter's weight should be on the forward foot. Both of the shooter's <b>knees</b> should be <b>slightly</b> bent and the shooter should be bending forward at the waist as if preparing to be pushed backward.|$|R

He made a step nearer--saw the long barrel moving unsteadily {{at the end of her}} extended arm. He thought: This is my time [...] . He bent his <b>knees</b> <b>slightly,</b> throwing his body forward, and took off with a long bound for a tearing rush.|$|E

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 372 – 376 The {{analysis}} of cosmic rays fluxes {{as a function}} of energy reveals a <b>knee</b> <b>slightly</b> below 1016 eV and an ankle close to 1019 eV. Their physical origins remain up to now quite enigmatic; in particular, no elementary process is known which occurs at energies close to 1016 eV. We propose a phenomenological approach along the lines of nonextensive statistical mechanics, a formalism which contains Boltzmann–Gibbs statistical mechanics as a particular case. The knee then appears as a crossover between two fractal-like thermal regimes, the crossover being caused by process occurring at energies ten million times lower than that of the knee, in the region of the quark hadron transition (≃ 109 eV).

50|$|When a {{woman came}} to him with an injured pelvis and retroverted uterus from a fall off of a horse, he placed her in a knee-chest {{position}} and inserted his finger into the vagina; this triggered a full distention of the vagina with air, allowing Sims to see the vagina clearly. The distention inspired him to investigate fistula treatment further. Soon after he developed a precursor to the modern speculum out of a pewter spoon and strategically placed mirrors. From 1845 to 1849 Sims started doing experiments on slave women and these experiments were the basis for modern vaginal surgery. The Sims' vaginal speculum aided in vaginal examination and surgery. The rectal examination position, in which the patient {{is on the left}} side with the right knee flexed against the abdomen and the left <b>knee</b> <b>slightly</b> flexed, is also named after him.|$|R
50|$|The Weaver stance {{consists}} of two components. The first is gripping the pistol with two hands so that the slight forward pressure on {{the grip of the}} hand that drew the pistol is opposed by a rearward pressure on the grip of the second hand. This action aids in controlling the recoil of the pistol to stabilize the pistol for subsequent shots.The second component, and most commonly known, is the positioning of the feet in a walking stance, with the off-side foot ahead of the strong-side foot. A right-handed person will have the right foot angled out to the side and further to the rear. Most of the weight will be on the left foot, with the <b>knee</b> <b>slightly</b> bent. The shoulders will be leaned forward over the left toe. The right foot behind will help catch the force of recoil, as well as allow for rapid changes in position.A left-handed person will have the right foot forward.|$|R

50|$|Just {{prior to}} the swing phase, the athlete should land on the {{supporting}} leg with the <b>knee</b> <b>slightly</b> flexed so as to absorb some of the impact and thereby stabilize the body for more effective motion of the kicking leg. The best position of the supporting leg {{has been found to}} be 5 to 10 cm to the side of the ball (left of the ball for a right-footed kicker, right of the ball for a left-footed kicker). Skilled athletes have a tendency toward a closer ball-to-support leg side position. For forward to back positioning, there is variability based on the desired action of the ball. Placing the support leg further behind the ball will produce a greater upward direction whereas placing the support leg closer to the ball will produce greater forward propulsion. Ball flight trajectory is dictated by the supporting foot’s position. The support foot should be positioned so as to be parallel to the intended direction of the ball. Other important body positioning to be aware of is to bend the upper body slightly forward over the ball.|$|R
