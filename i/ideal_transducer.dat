5000|$|Electromagnetic Acoustic Transducer (EMAT) is a {{transducer}} for non-contact sound {{generation and}} reception using electromagnetic mechanisms. EMAT is an ultrasonic nondestructive testing (NDT) method {{which does not}} require contact or couplant, because the sound is directly generated within the material adjacent to the transducer. Due to this couplant-free feature, EMAT is particularly useful for automated inspection, and hot, cold, clean, or dry environments. EMAT is an <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> to generate Shear Horizontal (SH) bulk wave mode, Surface Wave, Lamb waves {{and all sorts of}} other guided-wave modes in metallic and/or ferromagnetic materials. As an emerging ultrasonic testing (UT) technique, EMAT can be used for thickness measurement, flaw detection, and material property characterization. After decades of research and development, EMAT has found its applications in many industries such as primary metal manufacturing and processing, automotive, railroad, pipeline, boiler and pressure vessel industries.|$|E

Direct all-optical measurements revealed the sample’s dichroic character with insufficient details because of scattering and diffraction interference. On the other hand, photoacoustic measurements resulted to be a possible alternative investigation, since they directly deal with absorbed power and allow to get clear evidences of the differential selection for the two opposite polarization states. Multilevel numerical simulations confirmed the experimental results, proving once again the reliability of photoacoustic technique and the versatility of this class of dichroic artificial materials...|$|E

Here, we report highly sensitive epinephrine sensors based on OECTs prepared on glass substrates by a solution process. The device performance is optimized by immobilizing Nafion and carbon-based nanomaterials, including carbon nanotubes, graphene and graphene oxide, on the gate electrodes of OECTs. The detection limit of the sensors is down to 0. 1 nM, which can cover the concentration level of epinephrine in medical detections.

Being durable, stable and insensitive to external perturbations, they are particularly interesting for the long-term health assessment of civil and geotechnical structures. Many different fibre optic sensor technologies exist and offer a wide range of performances and suitability for different applications. The most widely used sensing techniques include point sensors (Fibre Bragg Gratings and Fabry-Perot interferometers), long-gauge sensors (SOFO) and distributed sensors (Raman and Brillouin scattering sensors). These sensing technologies are now widely used in routine application for health monitoring of structures such as bridges, buildings, monuments, tunnels, dams, dykes, pipelines, landslides and many others.

40|$|We use a {{piezoelectric}} quartz tuning fork to calibrate {{the displacement of}} ceramic piezoelectric scanners which are widely employed in scanning probe microscopy. We measure the static piezoelectric response of a quartz tuning fork and find it to be highly linear, non-hysteretic and with negligible creep. These performance characteristics, close to those of an <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer,</b> make quartz transducers superior to ceramic piezoelectric actuators. Furthermore, quartz actuators {{in the form of}} a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate the three axis displacement of a ceramic piezoelectric scanner. Although this calibration technique is a non-traceable method, it can be more versatile than using calibration grids because it enables to characterize the linear and non-linear response of a piezoelectric scanner in a broad range of displacements, spanning from a fraction of a nanometer to hundreds of nanometers. In addition, the creep and the speed dependent piezoelectric response of ceramic scanners can be studied in detail. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|We wish {{to develop}} {{a model for the}} pitch-catch {{response}} of real transducers which is both accurate and efficient. Wen and Breazeale [1, 2] have shown that the fields of a uniformly active, planar disk transducer can be modelled by a small number of coaxial Gaussian beams (eg, 10 or 15). Margetan, Thompson and Gray [3] have similarly modelled the fields of a uniformly active, planar disk transducer in terms of Hermite Gaussian beams, and further picked the radius of the <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> to match the main lobe of experimental data collected with a very small receiver,to approximate a point probe. Here we use the expansion of Wen and Breazeale and reciprocity to model the pitch-catch response of two transducers facing each other and having parallel axes, {{as a function of the}} displacement vector between the two transducers. Further, we fit this pitch-catch model directly to experimental pitch-catch data by choosing the parameters of the Gaussian beams, without assuming that the transducers are uniformly active, planar disks. Finally we show that the model developed by fitting over one set of displacements accurately describes the experiments over a disjoint set...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} a {{three years}} scientific research investigation {{on the design}} and fabrication of porous silicon based optical devices for applications {{in the field of}} biochemical sensing. Porous silicon is an <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> material due to its sponge-like morphology, characterized by a specific surface area up to 500 m 2 cm- 3, which assures an effective interaction with gas and liquid substances. Moreover, porous silicon is a low cost material, completely compatible with standard microelectronic processes. In this work, different porous silicon structures such as Fabry-Perot interferometer, Bragg mirror, optical microcavity, Thue-Morse sequences and optical waveguide have been realized and characterized as optical transducers for the monitoring of chemical and biological interactions. The selectivity, reversibility and sensitivity of these devices as optical sensors have been discussed. The porous silicon surface has been modified in order to gain chemical stability, proper wettability, and specific features such as biomolecules immobilization. Standard chemical functionalizations, but also an innovative pure biological passivation method based on selfassembled biofilms of the Hydrophobins proteins, have been successfully experimented. Some standard micromachining techniques, such as HF wet etching and anodic bonding, have been optimized to integrate the porous silicon sensing element into a Lab-on-Chip prototype. The integrated devices have been characterized as fast sensors of chemical compounds and response times shorter than 100 ms have been demonstrated. The Direct-Laser-Writing of the porous silicon surface, as alternative process to the photolithographic patterning in the device miniaturization has been also exploited. Finally, a bottom-up approach in microoptics has been developed by using the silica shells of some marine Diatoms, microalgae which show impressive morphological and physical analogies with porous silicon...|$|E
40|$|From {{many points}} of view, fiber optic sensors are the <b>ideal</b> <b>transducers</b> for civil {{structural}} monitoring. Being durable, stable and insensitive to external perturbations, they are particularly interesting {{for the long-term}} health assessment of civil structures. Long-gauge interferometric SOFO sensors have been in use for the last 10 yeas for the monitoring of civil, geotechnical, oil & gas and other structures. The sensors are based on an all-fiber Michelson interferometer with one arm mechanically coupled to the structure and one used as reference. The original demodulation system is based on low-coherence interferometry and features excellent long-term stability and precision, but is not suitable for dynamic measurements. In order to allow {{the use of the}} same sensors for the measurement of dynamic events, a new demodulator was developed. It is based on the coherent demodulation of a coherence-collapsed laser source and is able to demodulate 8 SOFO sensors at frequencies of up to 1 kHz with resolutions of 0. 01 microns. This system is particularly adapted for the analysis of dynamic structural deformations produced traffic, wind, seismic and impacts. The use of long-gauge sensors allows a direct measurement of the dynamic strains and the calculation of modal strains and curvatures.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{types of}} sensors and {{transducers}} have a nonlinear response. <b>Ideal</b> <b>transducers</b> {{are designed to}} be linear. But since in practice there are several factors which introduce non-linearity in a system. Due to such nonlinearities, transducer’s usable range gets restricted and also accuracy of measurement is severely affected. Similar effect is observed in different types of transducers. The nonlinearity present is usually time-varying and unpredictable as it depends on many uncertain factors. Nonlinearity also creeps in due to change in environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. In addition ageing of the transducers also introduces nonlinearity. This particular paper concentrates a review on the compensation of difficulties faced due to the non-linear response characteristics of different types of sensors like resistive (thermocouple), capacitive (capacitive pressure sensor),inductive(LVDT) and humidity transducers. In this review, we identified many algorithms and ANN models like Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN), Radial Basis Function based ANN, Multi Layer Perceptron and Back Propagation Network to enhance the linearity performance of resistive, capacitive and inductive transducers. On comparison of different ANN models for non-linearity correction in different types of transducers, we identified FLANN model is used as a useful alternative to the MLP, BPN and the radial basis function (RBF) -based ANN. It has the advantage of lower computational complexity than the MLP, BPN and RBF structures and is, hence, easily implementable. Throughout the paper, we described the effects produced by each kind of nonlinearity...|$|R

40|$|Myocardial {{opacification}} after {{intravenous injection}} of an echo-contrast agent {{is a major}} end point in contrast echocardiography, {{but it has not}} yet been obtained in human beings. We propose transesophageal contrast echocardiography as a clinical tool for the study of myocardial perfusion in human beings. Sonicated albumin microbubbles are bright ultrasound reflectors that cross the pulmonary vasculature after intravenous injection and show physiologic transit times through tissues. Transesophageal echocardiography uses <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> frequency and acoustic window for in vivo detection of sonicated albumin microbubbles. We have studied 11 patients receiving peripheral vein bolus injection of sonicated albumin microbubbles during transesophageal echocardiography at baseline and during dipyridamole infusion. Images were recorded on videotape and digitized off-line. Quantitative measurements were made on 11 normally perfused myocardial segments by tracing a region of interest of greater than 100 pixels on frozen end-systolic frames, at baseline, and during dipyridamole infusion. Transpulmonary passage with full left ventricular cavity opacification was obtained in all injections. In 8 of 22 injections there was also transient left ventricular cavity attenuation. In all patients there was a marked opacification of the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic root. At baseline, mean signal intensity in the myocardium increased from 80 +/- 37 to 117 +/- 49 IU (p < 0. 05) and during dipyridamole infusion increased from 84 +/- 28 to 146 +/- 36 IU (p < 0. 001). The analysis of background-subtracted data showed that mean pixel intensity increased from baseline to dipyridamole contrast injection (from 37 +/- 15 to 62 +/- 19 IU; p < 0. 01). The opacification of normally perfused left ventricular myocardium is feasible during transesophageal echocardiography because there is a significant increase in signal intensity versus background intensity. During dipyridamole infusion there is a further increase in signal intensity that probably reflects pharmacologically induced increase in myocardial blood flow...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{summaries}} {{three years}} {{of research on the}} development of innovative porous silica based devices for biosensing and drug delivery purposes. Porous silicon (PSi), is one of most exploited nanostructured material in biomedicine. Due to its optical and electrical properties, high specific surface area, tailorable morphology and surface chemistry, PSi is an <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> material for the realization of high sensitive and selective biosensors. In this work, different porous silica structures have been explored for the development of label-free oligonucleotide-biosensor realized by in situ synthesis of bioprobe on porous platform. Different functionalization strategies have been also explored in order to make PSi surface more chemically stable. The realization of label-free aptamer-PSi sensor, with great stability, fast response time, high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of human α-thrombin, has been successfully demonstrated. Diatomite, an emerging natural porous silica material of sedimentary origin, with similar physiochemical properties of man-made porous silicon, has been also exploited as potential platform for biomedical applications. Its non-toxicity, biocompatibility, high specific surface area, tailorable surface chemistry, as well as thermal and chemical stability make diatomite a viable cheap surrogate to synthetic porous silica for realization of nano-based drug delivery system. In this thesis work the potentialities of diatomite nanoparticles (DNPs) as safe nanovectors for drug delivery in cancer cells have been successfully demonstrated. Since the silica surface of diatomite is covered by silanol groups, it can be easily modified with functional reactive groups for the conjugation of biomolecules (e. g., DNA, antibodies, enzymes) in order to realize advanced healthcare devices. Different approaches of functionalization based on covalent bond for preparation of bioengineered diatomite NPs for therapeutic molecules transport into cancer cells were developed. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies endorsed this cheap, natural and biocompatible nanomaterial for drug delivery applications...|$|E
40|$|Facing {{the climate}} change the use of {{renewable}} energies gains in importance. Especially the wind energy branch grows very fast. Bigger and more powerful wind mills will be built in the next decades {{and the safety of}} the mills will play a major role. Wind turbines are treated as buildings and therefore have to be inspected at regular intervals. Especially the turbine blades are highly stressed during operation and a blade breakdown can cause a big economic damage. The turbine blades consist of glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) and sandwich areas containing wood or plastic foam. The blades are manufactured as two halves and glued together afterwards. Typical damages are delaminations within the GFRP or the sandwich and missing adhesive or deficient bond at the bonding surfaces. The regular inspections of wind turbine blades are done manually by experts and are limited to visual appraisals and simple tapping tests. To improve the safety of wind turbine blades nondestructive testing techniques using acoustic waves are being developed. To detect delaminations within the laminates of the turbine blade a local resonance spectroscopy is used. A small hammer is used to tap onto the blade and the excited sound is recorded using a microphone. A structural change within the material is displayed in a change of the frequency content. Furthermore the exciting signal is recorded and gives additional information about the structural health of the wind turbine blade. To detect missing or kissing bond areas from the outside of the blade the impulse-echotechnique is used. An ultrasonic pulse is sent into the material and is reflected at flaws or material boundaries. This pulse has to be strong because the GFRP are highly damping. It is difficult to see through several centimeters of GFRP and the choice of the <b>ideal</b> <b>transducer</b> is very important. To inspect bonding areas from outside the blade will be a great advance in wind turbine safety...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSurface {{acoustic}} waves (SAW) {{have been}} studied for more than 50 years and are mainly used as frequency filters. Using appropriate design considerations, these devices are sensitive to external conditions including temperature, pressure, strain or chemical/biological mass loading: hence, SAW sensors are implemented and provide unique characteristics [1]. Amongst the original characteristics, the linear behavior of the piezoelectric substrates provides interrogation ranges hardly achieved with silicon-based radiofrequency devices, extreme working temperatures and simple manufacturing conditions with a single cleanroom process step: hence, SAW <b>transducers</b> provide <b>ideal</b> <b>transducers</b> for passive sensors interrogated through a radiofrequency wireless link. This work {{is devoted to the}} development of a wireless interrogation system able to operate under high temperature environments (650 to 900 °C for the sensors). As wireless passive SAW-based sensors are considered here, the sensor reading allows the interrogation unit (so-called reader) to be far enough (some meters) to avoid facing such temperature conditions. However, the reader must be able to operate at temperatures in the 100 - 150 °C range, beyond the usual industrial grade integrated circuit characteristics. Therefore, the capability of the reader to operate under such conditions and hence to meet the above specifications is considered. The sensor and the interrogation unit are here both submitted to “high” temperature environments, with different meaning whether passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors or reader including CMOS and radio-frequency (RF) components are considered. We qualify the maximum operating temperature of our reader designed using commercial off the shelf (COTS) components with standard temperature requirements. The reader is tested from room temperature up to failure, which is met around 140 °C. The cause of the failure is due to a communication chip (RS 232 -USB converter) : the whole interrogation unit is thus expected to reach even higher temperatures without significant performance losses...|$|R

Materials and MethodsIn order to find the output of electromagnetic force and to predict the frequency-amplitude characteristics, a finite element middle ear biomechanical model was used to derive the optimal magnetic force of the actuator in this study. First, the electromagnetic transducer was created using computer-aided design. The air gap between the magnet and planar coil, input current and vibration force were calculated using finite element analysis simulation. ResultsThe simulated results showed that the electromagnetic forces under 0. 2 mm air gap were about 2 – 6 dyne depending on the layers of the planar coils under the input current of 20 – 60 μA. By increasing the layers of the planar coil, the electromagnetic forces can be increased. ConclusionThis designed actuator could be used as transducers in middle ear implants...|$|R
40|$|In the {{ultrasonic}} community {{there is}} a growing use of models to simulate inspection processes [1, 2]. One necessary input to such models is knowledge of the transducer’s radiation pattern. The radiation pattern of a commercial transducer often approximates that of an <b>ideal,</b> focused, piston <b>transducer</b> with appropriately chosen parameters (element dimensions and focal lengths), and these“ideal probe” parameters often serve as model inputs. In this paper we demonstrate beam mapping methods for determining these parameters. For probes with circularly symmetric beam cross-sections, an axial scan of the beam suffices. For more general probes, C-scan data are acquired to map out the beam cross section at several different waterpaths. In each case, the transducer parameters are determined by adjusting their values to minimize the discrepancy between the measured and model amplitudes. A technique for handling misaligned data is also described. Measured and fitted fields are compared for a variety of transducers (spherically, cylindrically, and bi-cylindrically focused) including one with a presumably damaged element.

The material has been widely studied for use in high frequency transducers, multi-layered capacitors, and ferroelectric random access memory. Copper foils are an inexpensive, flexible substrate with a low resistivity which makes them <b>ideal</b> for many <b>transducer</b> and capacitor applications. PZT thin films on copper foils were produced by RF sputtering and crystallized under reducing conditions. Causes and prevention of a cuprous oxide interlayer are discussed. The film structure was characterized by XRD, SEM, and AFM. The permittivity was low, but remanent polarization increased to as high as ~ 40 μC/cm² as film thickness and crystallization temperature increased. Residual stresses were measured by x-ray diffraction using the sin²ψ method. The relative permittivity of the PZT/Cu films was measured {{as a function of}} applied AC electric field. By performing a Rayleigh analysis on this data one can determine the relative contributions of the intrinsic, reversible, and irreversible components to the permittivity. The residual stress could be correlated to the reversible part of the permittivity. The first order reversal curves (FORCs), which characterize the ferroelectric switching, give indications of the defect state of the film. Cantilever energy harvesters were fabricated. Large electrodes were able to be evaporated onto the films after oxidizing pinholes and cracks on a hot plate. Devices were tested on a shaker table at < 100 Hz. A dynamic model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam equations was used to predict power output of the fabricated devices. The observed output was comparable to model predictions. Resonant frequency calculations were in line with observed first and second resonances at ~ 17 Hz and ~ 35 Hz which were also close to those predicted by the dynamic model...|$|R
