The empirical results, based on vector error correction modelling (VECM), show that trade liberalisation has both long run and contemporaneous effects on total exports, manufacturing exports, and textiles and readymade garment exports supply. Besides, domestic price, export price, anti-export bias reduction, the degree of openness and production capacity all have either unidirectional or bi-directional causality between them. ...|$|E

This paper presents an indicator for now- and forecasting exports, which is based on survey data that captures foreign economic performance.

The paper shows that the indicator based on foreign PMIs is strongly correlated with <b>exports</b> (<b>total</b> as well as goods exports). In an out-of-sample forecast comparison we employ standard ARDL models as well as MIDAS models to forecast different definitions of exports.

As manufacturing is an important pillar of the Swiss economy and is highly export intensive, improving export forecasts is also beneficial for forecasting Swiss GDP...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess Madagascar''s {{competitiveness}} in recent years, using both price and nonprice indicators and an exchange rate assessment of the currency. We estimate the distance between the equilibrium and the actual real exchange rates using three methods: the macroeconomic balance approach, the external sustainability approach, and the reduced-form equilibrium real exchange rate approach. These methods suggest that in the medium term the real exchange rate is only slightly overvalued. We also carry out a comparative analysis of nonprice indicators and find that Madagascar performs less favorably than its competitors on structural competitiveness.

40|$|More {{and more}} American {{multinational}} corporations (MNCs) are outsourcing {{the production and}} assembly of their products to foreign companies. When they do so, they derive the largest share of their revenue from the intellectual property embedded in core technological innovation and brand names. However, conventional trade statistics are compiled based {{on the value of}} goods crossing national borders, as declared to customs. Generally, the value added associated with intellectual property rights and embedded in physical goods is not recorded as either export or import of any country. Hence, current trade statistics greatly underestimate US exports and substantially exaggerate its trade deficit. In this paper, we use the case of Apple, the largest American consumer products company, to illustrate the failure of conventional trade statistics to report actual US export capacity in the age of global value chains. According to our analysis of this case, if the value added of Apple intellectual property sold to foreign consumers were counted as part of US <b>exports,</b> <b>total</b> US exports would increase by 3. 7 %, and its trade deficit would decrease by 7. 5 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess the trade performance of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries as a regional trade arrangement and estimate the trade potential of the GCC with countries or groups of countries with which a preferential trade agreement is signed or still in negotiation. The study uses disaggregated data and estimate gravity equations for total <b>exports,</b> <b>total</b> agri-food exports and seven agri-food commodities according to the SITC classification, covering the period 1994 - 2004. Results indicate that the GCC as a regional trade arrangement has actually promoted trade integration significantly between the member countries in agri-food products as opposed to total aggregate trade. Trade integration is highest in dairy products where GCC intra-trade is 10 times more than what would be predicted by the basic model, followed by meat, fish, and cereal products. The GCC intra-trade did not seem however to change significantly over the years and had probably reached its full potential during the 1993 - 1996 period. The newly created GCC Custom Union is therefore promising enhancing new opportunities of trade as it goes beyond the removal of tariffs to the elimination of non tariff barriers. Except with the Mashreq countries, trade of GCC with other regional groups and sub-groups is less than expected in all commodities suggesting that there is untapped trade potential which can be enhanced by negotiating a freer trade arrangement between these groups and the GCC region. ...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2004 BMJ Publishing Groupbjective: To assess {{effects of}} the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) and the four {{individual}} state settlements on tobacco company decisions and performance. Design: 10 -K reports filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, firm and daily data from the Center for Research in Security Prices, stock price indices, market share and advertising data, cigarette export and domestic consumption data, and newspaper articles {{were used to assess}} changes before (1990 – 98) and after (1999 – 2002) the MSA was implemented. Subjects: Five major tobacco manufacturers in the USA. Main outcome measures: Stockholder returns, operating performance of defendant companies, exports, market share of the original participants in the MSA, and advertising/promotion expenditures. Results: Returns to investments in the tobacco industry exceeded returns from investments in securities of other companies, using each of four indexes as comparators. Domestic tobacco revenues increased during 1999 – 2002 from pre-MSA levels. Profits from domestic sales rose from levels prevailing immediately before the MSA. There is no indication that the MSA caused an increase in tobacco <b>exports.</b> <b>Total</b> market share of the original participating manufacturers in the MSA decreased. Total advertising expenditures by the tobacco companies increased at a higher rate than the 1990 – 98 trend during 1999 – 2002, but total advertising expenditures net of spending on coupons and promotions decreased. Conclusion: The experience during the post-MSA period demonstrates that the MSA did no major harm to the companies. Some features of the MSA appear to have increased company value and profitability.

40|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{bias in the}} {{existing}} gravity equations {{used to assess the}} impact of non-reciprocal preferential trade policies (NRPTPs). The main inconsistency comes from the use of aggregate export flows at country level to analyse the effects of trade preferences which, by contrast, apply at product level. The second source of bias is that the literature does not deal with the main econometric issues which are likely to be present when a gravity equation is estimated. This paper discusses the first problem using evidence based on three levels of data aggregation (total <b>exports,</b> <b>total</b> agricultural exports and 2 -digit). Furthermore, the estimation methods take into account the unobservable country heterogeneity as well as the endogeneity of trade preferences and the potential selection bias which zero-trade values pose. We consider all NRPTPs granted by 8 major OECD countries to exports from developing countries over the period 1995 - 2003. We find two key results. First of all we show that the impact of NRPTPs on total exports is positive, whatever the estimator. This means that, other things being equal, the national exports to the preference-giving country of a preferred country are higher than those of a non-preferred country. Secondly, when the analysis is conducted at 2 -digit level, it emerges that the preference premium is very high in many 2 -digit sectors, whatever the preferential treatment (GSP and/or other preferences). This finding stands in contrast with the result obtained when total exports are considered, which places the preference gain at lower values. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
