50|$|The eponymous label Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (sometimes misspelled with {{a single}} n) refers to the {{earliest}} clinical descriptions of childhood SMA by Johann Hoffmann and Guido Werdnig. The eponymous term <b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease</b> is after Erik Klas Hendrik Kugelberg (1913-1983) and Lisa Welander (1909-2001), who distinguished SMA from muscular dystrophy. Rarely used Dubowitz disease (not {{to be confused with}} Dubowitz syndrome) is named after Victor Dubowitz, an English neurologist who authored several studies on the intermediate SMA phenotype.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 43 -year-old male patient with adult onset of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The patient first came to our {{attention}} with atrioventricular (AV) block. A dual-chamber pacemaker (DDD-PM) was implanted. Four years later, the PM data log showed occurrence of frequent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The episodes progressed in duration and frequency. An electrophysiological study revealed prolonged His-ventricular (HV) interval duration and induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient was successfully upgraded to a prophylactic dual-chamber cardioverter defibrillator. Our case is the first description of a patient with adult-onset SMA (<b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease</b> [KWD]) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} the respiration, respiratory control, and Pi:O ratios with different substrates in mitochondria isolated from five cases of human neuromuscular disorders (two cases of central core disease, two cases of neuropathy of Dejerine-Sottas, and one case of <b>Kugelberg-Welander's</b> <b>disease)</b> and compared them with normal human muscle. In all the myopathies studied, a severe derangement of the respiratory control with variable derangement of oxidative phosphorylation was found. This {{supports the idea}} that a group of neuromyopathies shares the same biochemical lesion as the so-called mitochondrial myopathies, forming with them a group of myopathies which may be related through a similar biochemical lesion of varying degree. Alternatively, disturbance of mitochondrial functions in a number of myopathies could be considered as a non-specific finding...|$|R
40|$|A total {{population}} study of chronic childhood {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (arrested Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, <b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease,</b> SMA type II and III) was undertaken in north-east England to establish gene and carrier frequencies, incidence, and prevalence. The incidence of this disease was 1 in 24 100 live births. Prevalence was 1. 20 per 100, 000 of the general population. A technique for estimating an autosomal recessive gene frequency in the known presence of dominant new mutations (or phenocopies), using data from a segregation analysis, is described. Gene frequency was in the range (0. 00451 to 0. 00659 (95 % confidence limits), with a working estimate of 0. 0055. Carrier rates for the autosomal recessive gene concerned were 1 in 76 to 1 in 111 (95 %) confidence limits), with a working estimate of 1 in 90 for genetic counselling purposes...|$|E
40|$|Immunocytochemical {{analysis}} utilising antibody to neural {{cell adhesion}} molecule (N-CAM) was carried out on skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with childhood spinal muscular atrophy. Children with both Werdnig-Hoffmann and <b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease</b> showed positive N-CAM reactivity. There were however differences in the N-CAM expression profiles in these two sets of patients. All myofibres were positive for N-CAM in the Werdnig-Hoffmann patients. This included both the normal sized fibres and the atrophic fibres. In contrast only the atrophic fibres were positive in the Kugelberg-Welander patients. No reactivity was found associated with the large hypertrophic fibres. It is likely that in the Werdnig-Hoffmann patients the positive N-CAM reactivity reflects unstable innervation of myofibres that had been previously innervated. A similar mechanism may operate in the Kugelberg-Welander patients, but the innervation of the hypertrophic fibres is more stable as {{they are able to}} repress N-CAM expression. These results contrast with a lack of N-CAM expression found previously on muscle biopsies from adults with denervation disease...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) {{is the second}} most common lethal {{autosomal}} recessive disorder. It is divided into the acute Werdnig-Hoffmann disease (type I), the intermediate form (type II), the <b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease</b> (type III), and the adult form (type IV). The gene involved in all four forms of SMA, the so-called survival motor neuron (SMN) gene, is duplicated, with a telomeric (tel SMN or SMN 1) and a centromeric copy (cent SMN or SMN 2). SMN 1 is homozygously deleted in over 95 % of SMA patients. Another candidate gene in SMA is the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene; it shows homozygous deletions in 45 – 67 % of type I and 20 – 42 % of type II/type III patients. Here we studied the SMN and NAIP genes in 92 Algerian SMA patients (20 type I, 16 type II, 53 type III, and 3 type IV) from 57 unrelated families, using a semiquantitative PCR approach. Homozygous deletions of SMN 1 exons 7 and/or 8 were found in 75 % of the families. Deletions of exon 4 and/or 5 of the NAIP gene were found in around 25 %. Conversely, the quantitative analysis of SMN 2 copies showed a significant correlation between SMN 2 copy number and the type of SMA...|$|E

40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA), {{the second most}} common lethal {{autosomal}} recessive disorder, has an incidence of 1 : 10, 000 newborns. SMA is divided into acute (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease, type I), intermediate (type II) and juvenile forms (<b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease,</b> type III). The gene of all three forms of SMA maps to chromosome 5 q 11. 2 - 13. 3. Two candidate genes, the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene and the neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) gene, have been identified; SMN is deleted in most SMA patients. We studied both genes in 87 Brazilian SMA patients (20 type I, 14 type II and 53 type III) from 74 unrelated families, by using PCR and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Deletions of exons 7 and/or 8 of the SMN gene were found in 69 % of the families: 16 / 20 in type I, 9 / 12 in type II and 26 / 42 in type III. Among 51 families with deletions, 44 had both exons deleted while seven had deletions only of exon 7. Deletions of exon 5 of the NAIP gene were found in 7 / 20 of type I, 2 / 12 of type II and 1 / 42 of type III patients. No deletion of SMN and NAIP genes was found in 112 parents, 26 unaffected sibs and 104 normal controls. No correlation between deletions of one or both genes and phenotype severity was found...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is characterised by {{degeneration}} of anterior horn {{cells of the}} spinal cord and represents the second most common, lethal, autosomal recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis. Based on the criteria of the Internatinal SMA Consortium, childhood SMAs are classified into type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), type II (intermediate form), and type III (<b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease).</b> Recently, two genes {{have been found to}} be associated with SMA. The survival motor neurone gene (SMN) is an SMA determining gene as it is absent in 98. 6 % of patients. A second gene, XS 2 G 3, or the highly homologous neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene (NAIP) {{have been found to be}} more frequently deleted in type I than in the milder forms (types II and III). We investigated the correlation between the clinical phenotype and the genotype at this loci. A total of 106 patients were classified into type I (44), type II (31), and type III (31) and analysed using SMN, markers C 212 and C 272, and NAIP mapping upstream and downstream from SMN respectively. The combined analysis of all markers showed a large proportion of type I patients (43 %) carried deletions of both SMN and its flanking markers (C 212 / 272) and NAIP exon 5), as compared with none of the patients with type II or III SMA. The presence of large scale deletions involving these loci is specific to Werdnig-Hoffman disease (type I) and allows one to predict the severity of the disease in our series...|$|E
40|$|Proximal spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused by low levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. In humans, SMN 1 and SMN 2 encode the SMN protein. In SMA patients, the SMN 1 gene is lost and the remaining SMN 2 gene only partially compensates. Mediated by a C 3 ̆eT nucleotide transition in SMN 2, the inefficient recognition of exon 7 by the splicing machinery results in low levels of SMN. Because the SMN 2 gene is capable of expressing SMN protein, correction ofSMN 2 splicing is an attractive therapeutic option. Although current mouse models of SMA characterized by Smn knock-out alleles in combination with SMN 2 transgenes adequately model the disease phenotype, their complex genetics and short lifespan have hindered the development and testing of therapies aimed at SMN 2 splicing correction. Here we show that the mouse and human minigenes are regulated similarly by conserved elements within in exon 7 and its downstream intron. Importantly, the C 3 ̆eT mutation is sufficient to induce exon 7 skipping in the mouse minigene as in the human SMN 2. When the mouse Smn gene was humanized to carry the C 3 ̆eT mutation, keeping it {{under the control of}} the endogenous promoter, and in the natural genomic context, the resulting mice exhibit exon 7 skipping and mild adult onset SMA characterized by muscle weakness, decreased activity and an alteration of the muscle fibers size. This Smn C 3 ̆eT mouse represents a new model for an adult onset form of SMA (type III/IV) also know as the <b>Kugelberg–Welander</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{group of}} {{autosomal}} recessive (AR) muscular dystrophies includes, among others, two main clinical entities, the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) and the distal muscular dystrophies. The former are characterized mainly by muscle wasting {{of the upper}} and lower limbs, {{with a wide range of}} clinical severity. This clinical heterogeneity has been demonstrated at the molecular level, since the genes for six AR forms have been cloned and/or have been mapped to 15 q 15. 1 (LGMD 2 A), 2 p 12 - 16 (LGMD 2 B), 13 q 12 (LGMD 2 C), 17 q 12 -q 21. 33 (LGMD 2 D), 4 q 12 (LGMD 2 E), and 5 q 33 - 34 (LGMD 2 F). The AR distal muscular dystrophies originally included two subgroups, Miyoshi myopathy, characterized mainly by extremely elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity and by a dystrophic muscle pattern, and Nonaka myopathy, which is distinct from the others because of the normal to slightly elevated serum CK levels and a myopathic muscle pattern with rimmed vac-uoles. With regard to our unclassified AR LGMD families, analysis of the affected sibs from one of them (family LG 61) revealed some clinical and laboratory findings (early involvement of the distal muscles, mildly elevated serum CK levels, and rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsies) that usually are not observed in the analysis of patients with LGMD 2 A—LGMD 2 F. In the present investigation, through a genomewide search in family LG 61, we demonstrated linkage of the allele causing this form of muscular dystrophy to a 3 -cM region on 17 q 11 - 12. We suggest that this form, which, interestingly, clinically resembles AR <b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease,</b> should be classified as LGMD 2 G. In addition, our results indicate the existence of still another locus causing severe LGMD...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is an {{autosomal}} recessive neurodegenerative disease {{caused by a}} genetic mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN 1) gene (5 q 11. 2 -q 13. 3) (Lefebvre 1995). With an incidence of one in 10, 000 live births, it is the leading genetic cause of infant death (Lunn 2008; Mercuri 2012). SMA is characterized by degeneration of spinal cord α-motor neurons, which results in progressive proximal muscle weakness, fatigue, scoliosis, nutritional problems, respiratory complications, and severe functional limitations. SMA has a broad clinical spectrum but in general can be classified into four clinical types {{on the basis of}} age of onset and maximum motor function achieved (Mercuri 2012). SMA type 3 (<b>Kugelberg-Welander</b> <b>disease)</b> is the mildest subtype but shows large clinical heterogeneity, which can be further classified into type 3 a (clinical symptoms before three years of age) and type 3 b (clinical symptoms after three years of age) (Zerres 1997). Symptoms become evident after the age of 18 months. Children generally reach all major milestones, including independent walking, but their level of motor performance varies greatly. Some children are hardly able to stand up and take a few steps unaided, while others walk well, are able to climb stairs, and mainly experience problems in running and sports (Rudnik-Schöneborn 2001). Long-term follow-up studies (follow-up time of two to 20 years) in people with SMA type 2 and type 3 suggest a very slow deterioration of muscle strength and motor function that takes years to detect (Deymeer 2008; Kaufmann 2012; Werlauff 2012). Nevertheless, about 50 % of people with SMA type 3 will lose independent ambulation during the second decade of life and only a small subgroup will remain ambulatory throughout life (Mercuri 2012; Russman 1996). In general people with SMA type 3 b perform better on functional outcome measures, such as the six-minute walk test and the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded, in comparison to people with SMA type 3 a (Mazzone 2013; Montes 2010). There is no proven effective drug treatment for SMA type 3 (Wadman 2012), and current standards of care concentrate on SMA-associated complications, such as impaired mobility, scoliosis, fatigue, and respiratory infections.
