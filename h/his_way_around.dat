5|$|Hodgkinson worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> to {{the left}} towards the Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{accompanied}} Desaix's Left Wing {{with the}} divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne (vice Beaupuy), Bourcier's Reserve and Saint-Cyr's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains. Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each {{time by the}} Austrians. Latour tried to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve. Finding his horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E

50|$|After winning {{his first}} two races, {{including}} the Northland Breeders Stakes at Ruakaka, his problem with left-handed tracks first made itself obvious with his fifth placing as favourite in the Wanganui Guineas, followed by fourth in the Hawke's Bay Guineas. He then made up for those disappointments running <b>his</b> preferred <b>way</b> <b>around</b> with an impressive win in the Great Northern Guineas at Ellerslie before heading south for the 2000 Guineas, which {{was probably one of}} his best performances.|$|R

5|$|Philip {{finally began}} his {{campaign}} against the Chalkidian league in 349 BC, probably in July, when the Etesian winds would prevent Athens sending aid. Diodorus says that he started by besieging, capturing and razing the fortress of Zereia (possibly Stageira; otherwise unknown). Philip seems to have methodically worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the 32 cities of the League, leaving Olynthos to the end. At least some cities submitted to him, including Toroni and Mecyberna—a small town which acted as the harbour of Olynthos—having seen {{the fate of the}} cities which resisted Philip. By the spring of 348 BC, the western part of Chalkidiki had been lost, and the Olynthians resorted to ravaging their former territory.|$|E
5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>around</b> the flank and up to a position directly {{on top of the}} blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a peer Francis Thun (1809 - 1871) {{who was one}} of the most important personalities in the public and cultural life in Bohemia from the 30 s till the end of the 60 s of the 19 th century. Thun [...] a gifted visual artist himself - was particularly interested in the institutions connected with the visual art. The author shows where his long-life interest in the visual arts was formed. She follows his childhood, upbringing, his own artistic beginning and his studies. She particularly considers <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>around</b> Europe and <b>his</b> stay in Dresden, that used to be one of the most important centres of the European Romanticism, and more than a year-long traveling around England, western Europe and Italy. The last part of this thesis deliberates František Thuns public activities [...] mainly his work in the artistic politics and in the care of monuments. This work also follows Thuns personal life, particularly his marriage with a burgher girl thanks to it he couldnt inherite the fideicommissum. This biography is mainly based on personal materials [...] letters and diaries. In terms of them it attempts to show Thuns personality and his important life moments...|$|R

As they approached Dannic was shot dead by a sniper firing from the hotel's rooftop. Despite this, Massu continued up the hotel's steps and entered The Majestic's lobby to find fifty German officers and 300 other ranks. The Germans surrendered to Massu without further resistance, using a bilingual bell-boy from the hotel as their interpreter.|$|E
