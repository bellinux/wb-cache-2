500|$|The concerts were a {{considerable}} financial outlay for Bache, {{who did not}} have a regular salary until 1881 and had to sustain himself through teaching. By 1873, he wrote, he had to [...] "decide whether I shall sacrifice myself entirely to the production of Liszt's orchestral and choral works (which after all can never be immortal as Bach, Beethoven and Wagner: here I feel that Bülow is right). Or shall <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own improvement the object of my life, and not spend a third of my income in one evening." [...] Bülow became concerned enough about the situation to waive his fee after one concert he conducted, and to contribute £50 out of his own pocket. Liszt was also concerned, writing, [...] "For years [...] has sacrificed money for the performance of my works in London. Several times I advised him against it, but he answered imperturbably, 'That is my business.'" [...] Whenever Bache was asked about finances for the concerts, he would tell whoever was asking that the cost was [...] "a just recompense" [...] and add that even if Liszt had charged him for his lessons {{at the same rate as}} the average village piano teacher, he would still be deeply in his debt.|$|E

But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|Owen said he grew {{up around}} [...] "a mob of entertaining, troublesome, fascinating" [...] actors {{involved}} in challenging the Lord Chamberlain during {{some of the most}} exciting days of a very controversial Royal Court Theatre. When he was at Highgate School, because his father was an actor, his teachers thought that {{he should be able to}} act, too. However, at first he was not interested. [...] "I was always made to read plays at school but I never wanted to. Then I was made to take part in a school play and I didn't want to do that either but I started to get approval for my acting.
