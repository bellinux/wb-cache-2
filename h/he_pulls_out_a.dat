5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) {{arrive at}} the police station to see Billy. Doggett {{interviews}} the boy, who seems to be mute. In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E
5|$|At the party, Veronica {{notices that}} the “rape coasters” which test for date rape drugs do not {{actually}} work. Veronica, Mac, and Piz test various peoples’ cups and find nothing. After Keith tells Dean O’Dell {{that his wife}} is cheating on him with Veronica’s criminology professor, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gun. Wallace and Piz find a drink that was tested positive for GHB, and Wallace and Piz dash to her dorm. Dean O’Dell finds and enters into the room in which his wife and the criminology professor are carrying on their affair as Veronica learns that they have tracked the wrong girl. Just as Mercer (Ryan Devlin) (the actual rapist) is about to rape his next victim, he abruptly learns that Veronica has changed places with his victim. Veronica tases Mercer, {{and they have a}} quick fight before Veronica escapes. She is let into Moe’s (Andrew McClain) room.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{situation}} involving sibling rivalries, David {{is confronted}} by James, who he blames for {{being taken away}} from their mother and being consigned to a worse life with King George. After James knocks David out by using his stun gun, he tricks his niece Emma and Robin Hood to lead him to Zelena's baby. James reveals himself when they reach the rendezvous point, after slapping an anti-magic cuff on Emma, and is joined by Cruella, who is {{still looking for a}} way to escape the Underworld, by stealing Zelena's baby for leverage with Hades. When Cruella and James enter the harbor, as part of their plan to send Emma and Robin to their deaths, David and Hook arrive to rescue Emma and Robin, before it's too late. Hook grabs the gun dropped by James and removed the cuffs from Emma, and Cruella runs back to safety. Meanwhile, David attempts to help James move on while confronting him, as James continues to believe that killing David is the [...] "unfinished business" [...] that is keeping him in the Underworld. After David's plea to help James falls on deaf ears, the twins continue fighting each other on the edge of the dock, with David wanting the others to stay out of the struggle. As James begins to lose, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> boot knife, despite David's pleas to stop. David eventually twists James off into the River of Lost Souls, condemning him to eternal torment, while Cruella flees the scene. Emma tells her father that there was nothing he could do to save James, despite his best efforts, and that some people just won't ever move on.|$|E

6000|$|CARMODY (looking about shiftily and {{reaching}} for the inside pocket of his overcoat). I'll be havin' a nip now we're alone, and that cacklin' hen gone. I'm feelin' sick {{in the pit of}} the stomach. (<b>He</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pint flask, half full.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wi' that {{he opens}} a bag {{he had on}} his back an' showed me a lot o' birds, big an' small, that he'd been shootin'; an' then <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> small book, in which he'd been makin' picturs of 'em--an' r'ally I was raither took wi' that for the critter had got 'em down there {{almost as good as}} natur'.

6000|$|The old bailiff grinned, for he {{understood}} English (having {{had plenty of}} English customers), and says in French, as master goes out, [...] "I think, sir, you had better let your servant get a coach, for I am under the painful necessity of arresting you, au nom de la loi, for the sum of ninety-eight thousand seven hundred francs, owed by you to the Sieur Jacques Francois Lebrun, of Paris;" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> number of bills, with master's acceptances on them sure enough.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{handful of}} gold, {{and the girl}} looked at it with covetous eyes. She sighed as she once more shook her head.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pocket-compass {{about the}} size of an {{ordinary}} watch, which instrument it was his habit to guard with the most anxious care.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mister be blowed!' cried Wegg, {{yielding}} to his honest indignation. 'Boffin. Dusty Boffin. That foxey old grunter and grinder, sir, {{turns into the}} yard this morning, to meddle with our property, a menial tool of his own, a young {{man by the name}} of Sloppy. Ecod, when I say to him, [...] "What do you want here, young man? This is a private yard," [...] <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> paper from Boffin's other blackguard, the one I was passed over for. [...] "This is to authorize Sloppy to overlook the carting and to watch the work." [...] That's pretty strong, I think, Mr Venus?' ...|$|E
6000|$|However, as {{he pressed}} me to speak, I told him I {{had no reason}} to {{question}} the sincerity of his love to me after so many protestations, but--and there I stopped, as if I left him to guess the rest. 'But what, my dear?' says he. 'I guess what you mean: what if you should be with child? Is not that it? Why, then,' says he, 'I'll take care of you and provide for you, and the child too; and that you may see I am not in jest,' says he, 'here's an earnest for you,' and with that <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> silk purse, with an hundred guineas in it, and gave it me. 'And I'll give you such another,' says he, 'every year till I marry you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ay, how indeed? Do {{you wish}} to know? Is your curiosity excited? Well, I DO know how I escaped. I could tell the most {{extraordinary}} adventures that happened to me. I could show you resemblances to people at home, {{that would make them}} blue with rage and you crack your sides with laughter. [...] . And what is the reason I cannot write this paper, having all the facts before me? The reason is, that walking down St. James Street yesterday, I met a friend who says to me, [...] "Roundabout my boy, have you seen your picture? Here it is!" [...] And <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> portrait, executed in photography, of your humble servant, as an immense and most unpleasant-featured baboon, with long hairy hands, and called by the waggish artist [...] "A Literary Gorilla." [...] O horror! And now you see why I can't play off this joke myself, and moralize on the fable, as it has been narrated already DE ME.|$|E
60|$|To {{emphasize}} his remarks, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gold-sack {{the size}} of a bologna sausage and thumped it down on the bar. Doc Watson thumped his own sack alongside.|$|R
60|$|Quest was on {{his hands}} and knees, fumbling under his truckle bed. <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> crude form of fire escape, a rough sort of cradle with a rope attached.|$|R

6000|$|It {{would look}} {{a little too much}} like a romance here to repeat all the kind things he said to me on that occasion, but I can't omit one passage. As he saw the tears drop down my cheek, <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> fine cambric {{handkerchief}}, and was going to wipe the tears off, but checked his hand, as if he was afraid to deface something; I say, he checked his hand, and tossed the handkerchief to me to do it myself. I took the hint immediately, and with a kind of pleasant disdain, [...] "How, my lord," [...] said I, [...] "have you kissed me so often, and don't you know whether I am painted or not? Pray let your Highness satisfy yourself that you have no cheats put upon you; for once let me be vain enough to say I have not deceived you with false colours." [...] With this I put a handkerchief into his hand, and taking his hand into mine, I made him wipe my face so hard that he was unwilling to do it, for fear of hurting me.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, after dinner, he very gravely says to me, {{his sisters}} being all by, 'Mrs. Betty, I must ask a favour of you.' 'What's that?' says his second sister. 'Nay, sister,' says he very gravely, 'if you can't spare Mrs. Betty to-day, {{any other time}} will do.' Yes, they said, they could spare her well enough, and the sister begged pardon for asking, which they did but of mere course, without any meaning. 'Well, but, brother,' says the eldest sister, 'you must tell Mrs. Betty what it is; if it be any private {{business}} that we must not hear, you may call her out. There she is.' 'Why, sister,' says the gentleman very gravely, 'what do you mean? I only desire her {{to go into the}} High Street' (and then <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> turnover), 'to such a shop'; and then he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for, and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to the turnover that he showed, to see if they would take my money for the neckcloths; to bid a shilling more, and haggle with them; and then he made more errands, and so continued to have such petty business to do, that I should be sure to stay a good while.|$|E
60|$|I was {{no sooner}} {{come back to}} the inn but he fell upon me with irresistible words, that since he had {{had the good fortune to}} meet me, and {{everything}} concurred, it would be hastening his felicity if I would put an end to the matter just there. 'What do you mean?' says I, colouring a little. 'What, in an inn, and upon the road! Bless us all,' said I, as if I had been surprised, 'how can you talk so?' 'Oh, I can talk so very well,' says he, 'I came a-purpose to talk so, and I'll show you that I did'; and with that <b>he</b> <b>pulls</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> great bundle of papers. 'You fright me,' said I; 'what are all these?' 'Don't be frighted, my dear,' said he, and kissed me. This was the first time that he had been so free to call me 'my dear'; then he repeated it, 'Don't be frighted; you shall see what it is all'; then he laid them all abroad. There was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his wife, and the full evidence of her playing the whore; then there were the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where she lived, proving that she was buried, and intimating the manner of her death; the copy of the coroner's warrant for a jury to sit upon her, and the verdict of the jury, who brought it in Non compos mentis. All this was indeed to the purpose, and to give me satisfaction, though, by the way, I was not so scrupulous, had he known all, but that I might have taken him without it. However, I looked them all over as well as I could, and told him that this was all very clear indeed, but that he need not have given himself the trouble to have brought them out with him, for it was time enough. Well, he said, it might be time enough for me, but no time but the present time was time enough for him.|$|E
60|$|The seaman's look of {{surprise}} melted into a broad grin of amusement while this speech was being fluently delivered. At its conclusion <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> penny {{and held it}} up.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> filthy pipe, {{and filled}} it with what, when he struck <b>a</b> match, turned <b>out</b> to be {{particularly}} vile tobacco, and Leslie, who fumed in his chair, said presently: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Mara." [...] <b>He</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> {{chair and}} sat down quickly, folding {{his hands on the}} table before him. He noticed Thacher and drew back a little. [...] "Pardon me," [...] he murmured.|$|R

60|$|There was no answer, and he puffed his cigarette, {{swung his}} legs, and drummed {{on the table}} with rather dirty fingers. Then <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> roll of bills as if to count them.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I've {{seen this}} too--once," [...] {{continued}} the youth, smiling, as <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> tobacco-pipe. Then <b>he</b> bent his head suddenly, put his {{nose to the}} bag, and made a face expressive of supreme disgust.|$|R
6000|$|... "By golly, I'se out fo' dat reward!" [...] {{came from}} Aleck, and <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> horse pistol {{which he was}} carrying. [...] "Jess let me see dem willains." [...] And he flourished the weapon wildly.|$|R
