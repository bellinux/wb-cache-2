40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the experiences of young children who participate intensively <b>in</b> <b>sport.</b> The literature study brought to light the fact that factors such as the experience of success <b>in</b> <b>sport,</b> self-image, competition anxiety, sportsmanship and spectator behaviour influence the young child's experience of sport. A measuring instrument was developed with six main sections to measure the young child's experience of sport. These sections are experience of enjoyment <b>in</b> <b>sport,</b> pressure to perform <b>in</b> <b>sport,</b> competition anxiety, sportsmanship, spectator behaviour and the desire to withdraw from sport. The results of the investigation showed that, broadly speaking, young children experience intensive participation <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> far more negatively than parents and coaches would suppose. Girls also experience intensive participation <b>in</b> <b>sport</b> more negatively than boys, while individual sport types are inclined to be more stressful for young children than team sports. Competition anxiety, followed by spectator behaviour and pressure to perform are experienced most negatively by young children who participate extensively <b>in</b> <b>sport.</b> Parents' and coaches' misperceptions of their childrens'/athletes' experience of sport largely correspond...|$|R
