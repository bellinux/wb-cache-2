The majority of the energy is extinguished in the extreme lower region of the ionosphere (around 50-80 km in altitude). This area is particularly important to ionospheric radio communications because this is the area where most of the absorption of radio signal energy occurs. The <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionization</b> produced by incoming energetic protons increases the absorption levels in the lower ionosphere and can have the effect of completely blocking all ionospheric radio communications through the polar regions. Such events are known as Polar Cap Absorption events (or PCAs). These events commence and last as long as the energy of incoming protons at approximately greater than 10 MeV (million electron volts) exceeds roughly 10 pfu (particle flux units or [...] ) at geosynchronous satellite altitudes.|$|E

Correlation is considered {{at different levels of}} approximation with the time-dependent generalized-active-space configuration-interaction method. The results of our studies show that <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionization</b> occurs in multielectron molecules, that correlation is important and they also demonstrate significant deviations between the results of the single-active-electron approximation and more accurate configuration-interaction methods.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} ionizationmechanism behind {{the formation of}} remarkably high charge states observed in the laser-pulse-induced fragmentation of different hydrocarbon molecules by Roither et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 163001 (2011) ], who suggested <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionization</b> occurring at multiple C-H bonds as the underlying ionization mechanism. Using multiparticle coincidence momentum imaging we measure the yield of multiply charged fragmenting ethylene and acetylene molecules at several intensities and pulse durations ranging from the few-cycle regime to 25 fs. We observe, at constant intensity, a strong increase of the proton energy with increasing laser pulse duration. It is shown that this {{is caused by a}} strong increase in the yield of highly charged parent molecular ions with pulse duration. Based on experimental evidence we explain this increase by the necessary population of precursor states in the parent ion that feature fast C-H stretch dynamics to the critical internuclear distance, where efficient ionization via <b>enhanced</b> <b>ionization</b> takes place. For increasing pulse duration these precursor ionic states are more efficiently populated, which leads in turn to a higher enhanced-ionization probability for longer pulses.
