500|$|In an {{interview}} at the April 2011 Big Four concert, Robert Trujillo said Metallica will work with Rick Rubin again as producer for the new album and were [...] "really excited to write some new music. There's no shortage of riffage in Metallica world right now." [...] He added, [...] "The first album with Rick {{was also the first}} album for me, so in a lot of ways, you're kind of testing the water. Now that we're comfortable with Rick and his incredible engineer, Greg Fidelman, who worked with Slayer, actually, on this last recordit's my heroit's a great team. And it's only gonna better; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that.</b> So I'm super-excited." [...] In June 2011, Rubin said Metallica had begun writing its new album. [...] On November 9, 2010, Metallica announced it would be headlining the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro on September 25, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Bégin's {{father taught}} his son that his {{best chance of}} making a career in hockey was as a {{defensive}} specialist and impressed on him {{the need for a}} strong work ethic. [...] He was raised to follow role players like Mario Tremblay, Guy Carbonneau and Bob Gainey rather than stars such as Guy Lafleur or Wayne Gretzky. [...] Bégin has played the majority of his career as a grinder, willing to play a physical game. His style often results in bruises and injuries, a part of the game he relishes. [...] Speaking of his comeback with the Flames in 2013, he noted: [...] "What I missed the most was the pain of playing hockey. The pain from blocking shots, getting hit, hitting people... I missed it a lot." [...] That attitude impressed his coaches; Bob Hartley argued that players like Bégin are a valuable commodity: [...] "Players with the commitment of Steve Begin, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there’s not enough (of them) in the NHL. [...] I always admired the way that he played. I look at the spirit, the leadership. Pretty amazing what he’s done for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jean Thesman (1929-2016) was {{a popular}} and award-winning novelist for young adults whose {{predominant}} theme was the heroine finding {{her place in the}} world by coming to understand her family. [...] "I loved telling the story, because <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> families were made up of the people you wanted, not the people you were stuck with." [...] —Emily Shepherd ...|$|R
5000|$|An active leader, Bellamy Powell <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{she should}} do no less than what she asked of others, stating, [...] "I was not looking for more danger, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shouldn’t do less than what I would ask others to do." [...] Thus, she often worked in field among her colleagues, {{participating}} {{in the civil rights}} organizing efforts in Greene County, Alabama.|$|R
6000|$|Oakes laughed tolerantly. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> never <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> preposterous {{theory for}} one moment. I {{just put it}} in to round out my report. I hadn't begun {{to think about the}} case then--not really think." ...|$|R
500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. I always felt Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
2500|$|During [...] "The Callas Debate", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, [...] "The timbre of Callas's voice, {{considered}} purely as sound, {{was essentially}} ugly: {{it was a}} thick sound, which {{gave the impression of}} dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable." [...] However, in his review of Callas's 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, [...] "Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the [...] "bottled" [...] quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured." ...|$|E

I have been offered a hundred thousand pounds to superintend the conveyance of certain documents and a certain letter to Berlin. The adventure appeals to me, and I have undertaken it. Until I found this man following me this afternoon, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> we had put every one off the track. I {{know for a fact that}} most of the American officials <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the papers for which they have searched so long and anxiously are in that trunk with the broken seals which they found at Halifax." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lou Reed, the group's main songwriter, {{said of the}} album: [...] "I really didn't {{think we}} should make another White Light/White Heat. I {{thought it would be}} a terrible mistake, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> thought we had to {{demonstrate}} the other side of us. Otherwise, we would become this one-dimensional thing, and that had to be avoided at all costs." [...] Drummer Maureen Tucker said, [...] "I was pleased with the direction we were going and with the new calmness in the group, and thinking about a good future, hoping people would smarten up and some record company would take us on and do us justice." [...] Doug Yule said the album [...] "was a lot of fun. The sessions were constructive and happy and creative, everybody was working together." ...|$|R
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.'

6000|$|... "Why, I know," [...] said Forester, laughing, [...] "that {{lawyers have}} not the credit, generally, of {{preventing}} many disputes, but I believe they do.

5000|$|Stroop later recalled, After {{inquiring about}} my family, {{he asked for}} a full report on events in Wiesbaden and congratulated me on my success with Von Kluge. Adolf Hitler was {{behaving}} oddly, he confided, and might even be ill. Heinrich Himmler... ended our talk by asking if I would join his personal staff and eventually go north with him to Lübeck and later Denmark. Flattered though I was, I expressed my belief that during this period of temporary reversals, it was essential to organize a central resistance point in the southern Alps, until new weapons were ready. To my surprise, Heinrich Himmler asked if <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Third Reich could win the war. I insisted that nothing could quell the Germanic spirit awakened in our people by Adolf Hitler and his deeds. Besides, I argued, how could I desert my SS brothers and the hundreds of young Werwolf fighters whom I had ordered to the Bavarian Alps to set up a National Socialistic bunker for the preservation of the Third Reich? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't be stupid!" [...] she replied. [...] "Please {{remember}} that when you are with me, at any rate, you are in Bohemia and not Belgravia. I don't expect such attentions.

60|$|He had brooded {{so much on}} his wrong, had poor Jim, that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it {{had turned}} his head; for he had a glare in {{his eyes as he}} spoke that was hardly human.
