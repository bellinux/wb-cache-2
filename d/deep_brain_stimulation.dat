5|$|Anticholinergics {{and surgery}} (lesioning of the corticospinal pathway {{or some of}} the basal ganglia structures) were the only {{treatments}} until the arrival of levodopa, which reduced their use dramatically. Levodopa was first synthesized in 1911 by Casimir Funk, but it received little attention until the mid 20th century.

5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulation,</b> subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use.

5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective.

Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms.

5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disorder {{affecting the}} basal ganglia (BG), a set of small subcortical nervous system nuclei. The hallmark of the disease is a dopaminergic denervation of the input stage of the BG, altering information patterns along movement-related ganglia-mediated pathways in the brain, inducing therefore movement disorders such as tremor at rest, bradykinesia, akinesia, and rigidity. It is still unclear how dopamine depletion causes those motor symptoms. Experimental {{studies have shown that}} abnormally synchronized oscillatory activities- rhythmic bursting activity at the neurocellular level and beta frequency band oscillations at the network level-emerge in PD at multiple levels of the BG-cortical loops and are correlated with motor symptoms. We propose a computational model of the BG using a novel unicellular mechanism to explain the induction of bursting activity and beta band oscillations in the network. We show how a single change in the dopaminergic level at the input stage of the BG can switch the model from its physiological state to the pathological state. This computational model also proposes a simple mechanism for high-frequency <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulations...</b>|$|R

50|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is a {{progressive}} neurological condition {{result of the}} death of the cell that contains and produces dopamine in substantia nigra. People with PD may develop disturbance in their motor activities. Some activities can be tremor or shaking, rigidity and slow movements (bradykinesia). Patients may eventually present certain psychiatric problems like depression and dementia. Current pharmacological intervention consist on the administration of L-dopa, a dopamine precursor. The L-dopa therapy increases dopamine production of the remaining nigral neurons. Other therapy is the <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> to modulate the overactivity of the subthalamic nucleus to the loss of dopamine signaling in the stratum. However, with this treatment, the number of substantia nigra neurons decrease so it becomes less efficient.|$|R

50|$|Treatment {{typically}} involves {{improving the}} patient's quality of life. This is accomplished through {{the management of}} symptoms or slowing the rate of demyelination. Treatment can include medication, lifestyle changes (i.e. quit smoking, adjusting daily schedules to include rest periods and dietary changes), counselling, relaxation, physical exercise, patient education and, in some cases, <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> thalamic <b>stimulation</b> (in the case of tremors). The progressive phase of MS appears driven by the innate immune system, which will directly contribute to the neurodegenerative changes that occur in progressive MS.

40|$|The {{field of}} Neural Engineering spawned in {{response}} to the perpetual problem of neurology: injured central nervous system neurons do not regenerate or repair, and stem cell/molecular genetic solutions, while the ideal intervention, are far away from clinical utilization. A current solution is to substitute computers and electrodes for neurons, as either transducers (cochlear implants, retinal implants, and visual cortex ECoG implants for sensory replacement), regulators (<b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulations</b> for Parkinson's disease), and output signal readers (motor cortex neuroprosthetics). I have focused on improving the technology of motor neuroprosthetics, and in this dissertation I investigated three sub-systems of this relatively new technology in a rat model. In my first experiment, I demonstrated that the cingulate cortex, part of the prefrontal cortex, can be used as an additional control signal for a motor neuroprosthetic device in the event that upper motor neurons of the motor cortex are degenerated by neurodegenerative diseases. In my second experiment, I examined whether electrocorticograms (ECoGs) and local field potentials (LFPs) are independent from the spiking activity of motor neurons and could be thus used as additional control channels. I showed these signals are not necessarily independent, specifically, the spikes phase-lock to the field potentials at defined frequencies, and careful algorithms will have to be developed to combine spikes, LFPs, and ECoGs as different control channels for a neuroprosthetic device. In my third experiment, I investigated the use of feedback in a neuroprosthetic model. I combined intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) of the visual cortex with simultaneous motor cortex ensemble recordings in real time to demonstrate the feasibility of a closed-loop neuroprosthesis. I showed that though sensory cortex ICMS can be combined with motor cortex recording in real-time in a viable preparation, increased technological development in simultaneous decoding with <b>brain</b> <b>stimulation</b> needs to occur before feasible clinical implementation can become a reality.

40|$|Abnormal {{neuronal}} synchrony {{plays an}} important role in a number of brain diseases. To specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchrony by desynchronization, Coordinated Reset (CR) stimulation, a spatiotemporally patterned stimulation technique, was designed with computational means. In neuronal networks with spike timing–dependent plasticity CR stimulation causes a decrease of synaptic weights and finally anti-kindling, i. e. unlearning of abnormally strong synaptic connectivity and abnormal neuronal synchrony. Long-lasting desynchronizing aftereffects of CR stimulation have been verified in pre-clinical and clinical proof of concept studies. In general, for different neuromodulation approaches, both invasive and non-invasive, it is desirable to enable effective stimulation at reduced stimulation intensities, thereby avoiding side effects. For the first time, we here present a two-stage CR stimulation protocol, where two qualitatively different types of CR stimulation are delivered one after another, and the first stage comes at a particularly weak stimulation intensity. Numerical simulations show that a two-stage CR stimulation can induce the same degree of anti-kindling as a single-stage CR stimulation with intermediate stimulation intensity. This stimulation approach might be clinically beneficial in patients suffering from brain diseases characterized by abnormal neuronal synchrony where a first treatment stage should be performed at particularly weak stimulation intensities in order to avoid side effects. This might, e. g., be relevant in the context of acoustic CR stimulation in tinnitus patients with hyperacusis or in the case of electrical <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> CR <b>stimulation</b> with sub-optimally positioned leads or side effects caused by stimulation of the target itself.

40|$|Invited conference talk [URL] audienceObjective: The {{neurobiology}} {{of schizophrenia}} remains frustratingly poorly understood {{when it comes}} to deal with the development of innovative therapies for an increasing number of patients. The glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine is a translational psychotomimetic substance that induces psychotic-like symptoms in both humans and animals and is widely used in schizophrenia research. In the present study we wanted to evaluate the impact of a single subcutaneous low-dose (< 5 mg/kg) administration of ketamine on the state and function of the rodent thalamocortical system. Methods: Multisite network electrophysiological recordings in the rat somatosensory thalamocortical system, natural stimulation of the vibrissae and high-frequency electrical stimulation of the thalamus were conducted during quiet immobile wakefulness. Results: Ketamine induces a hyperactive behavior, increases the amount of spontaneous brain network gamma (30 - 80 Hz) oscillations, and impairs the ability of the thalamocortical system to discriminate the signal from spontaneous activities during the processing of sensory information. These abnormalities are accompanied by a transient disruption of the long-term potentiation (LTP) of thalamocortical synapses induced by high-frequency <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> electrical <b>stimulation</b> (hfDBS). Unexpectedly, in contrast to the ketamine action, thalamic stimulation increases the amplitude of the sensory response and decreases the power of ongoing gamma oscillations. The present data support the hypothesis that NMDAr hypofunction is, likely at least through impairment of synaptic plasticity, involved in sensory integration dysfunction, a core feature in schizophrenia. Investigating the link between the state and function of the thalamocortical system may be a key strategy to discover and design innovative therapies against neuropsychiatric disorders...|$|R
25|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulation</b> (DBS) uses implantable {{electrodes}} to send high-frequency electrical {{signals to}} the thalamus. The electrodes are implanted as described above. The patient uses a hand-held magnet to turn on and turn off a pulse generator that is surgically implanted under the skin. The electrical stimulation temporarily disables the tremor and can be “reversed,” if necessary, by turning off the implanted electrode. Batteries in the generator last about 5 years and can be replaced surgically. DBS is currently used to treat parkinsonian tremor and essential tremor. It is also applied successfully for other rare causes of tremor.|$|E
25|$|Essential tremor (ET), {{also known}} as benign {{essential}} tremor, or familial tremor, {{is the most common}} movement disorder. It is estimated that 5 percent of people worldwide suffer from this condition, affecting those of all ages but typically staying within families. ET typically affects the hands and arms but can also affect the head, voice, chin, trunk and legs. Both sides of the body tend to be equally affected. The tremor is called an action tremor, becoming noticeable in the arms when they are being used. Patients often report that alcohol helps lessen the symptoms. Primary medical treatments for ET are usually beta-blockers. For patients who fail to respond sufficiently to medication, <b>deep</b> <b>brain</b> <b>stimulation</b> and thalamotomy can be highly effective.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet).

Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.|$|E

Objective: To measure the clinical changes and collateral effects of bilateral electric stimulation of the ventro-medial globus pallidus, in a sample of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease with predominance of rigidity. Methodology: An auto-control study of direct assignation was carried out, open to evaluate the changes according to the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III) in a basal period, within 6 and 12 months of follow up same as the collateral effect and the medicament doses. Results: 12 patients were included (5 women) with ages of 62. 4  ±  12. 7 years (media ± DE), history of PD was 14. 2  ±  5. 3 years, with Hoehn and Yahr stages within II and IV. UPDRS III score in OFF- medication of 73  ±  11. 3. Beyond 6 months of follow up, a significant statistical change towards tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, posture and gait, can be appreciated (p <  0. 05). The best effect can be observed in the qualification of UPDRS III after implantation (35 to 38 delta points of the scale) and for stimulation particularly for bradykinesia (delta of 11 points). There were no significant changes in levodopa doses. The collateral effects such as phosphenes, contralateral paresthesias, deviation of labial commissure and dysarthria, were avoided with the adjustment of stimulation parameters during the surgery.
