Tracking and pose recognition are treated as two coupled problems in a probabilistic framework: a template-based algorithm with multiple pose-specific reference models is used to determine jointly the position and {{the scale of the}} target and its head pose. Target representation is based on Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) : descriptors which are at the same time robust under varying illumination, fast to compute and discriminative with respect to pose. To improve pose recognition accuracy, we define the likelihood as a parameterized function and we propose to learn it from training data with a new discriminative approach based on the large-margin paradigm.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel method to {{estimate}} the head yaw rotations based on the asymmetry of 2 -D facial appearance. In traditional appearance-based pose estimation methods, features are typically extracted holistically by subspace analysis such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), etc., which are not designed to directly model the pose variations. In this paper, we argue and reveal that the asymmetry in the intensities of each row of the face image is closely relevant to the yaw rotation of the head and, at the same time, evidently insensitive to {{the identity of the}} input face. Specifically, to extract the asymmetry information, 1 -D Gabor filters and Fourier transform are exploited. LDA is further applied to the asymmetry features to enhance the discrimination ability. By using the simple nearest centroid classifier, experimental results on two multipose databases show that the proposed features outperform other features. In particular, the generalization of the proposed asymmetry features is verified by the impressive performance when the training and the testing data sets are heterogeneous.

A water extract of M. oleifera seed was applied to a wastewater treatment sequence comprising coagulation–flocculation–sedimentation–sand filtration. The study was laboratory based using an actual wastewater. Overall COD removals of 50 % were achieved at both 50 and 100 mg/l M. oleifera doses. When 50 and 100 mg/l seed doses were applied in combination with 10 mg/l of alum, COD removal increased to 58 and 64 %, respectively.

The definitions, chemical and physical natures of organic synthetic and natural polyelectrolytes are described.

The unit operations of coagulation and flocculation are introduced and the mechanisms of action of polyelectrolytes (charge neutralisation and inter-particle bridging) in relation to these processes and interactions with turbidity and colour are discussed. The application of polyelectrolytes to water treatment processes as coagulants, coagulant aids, flocculant aids and filter aids is described, together with the water quality conditions and mixing regimes that give optimum performance. Residuals and contaminents present in polyelectrolytes and their significance in relation to public health risks is also assessed. The use of polyelectrolytes to enhance the direct filtration process is discussed and together with the results of experimental pilot plant work undertaken by the author in 1983 and 1984.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{in the use of}} megavoltage cone-beam computed tomography (MV CBCT) data for radiotherapy treatment planning. To calculate accurate dose distributions, knowledge of the electron density (ED) of the tissues being irradiated is required. In the case of MV CBCT, it is necessary to determine a calibration-relating CT number to ED, utilizing the photon beam produced for MV CBCT. A number of different parameters can affect this calibration. This study was undertaken on the Siemens MV CBCT system, MVision, to evaluate the effect of the following parameters on the reconstructed CT pixel value to ED calibration: the number of monitor units (MUs) used (5, 8, 15 and 60 MUs), the image reconstruction <b>filter</b> (<b>head</b> and neck, and pelvis), reconstruction matrix size (256 by 256 and 512 by 512), and the addition of extra solid water surrounding the ED phantom. A Gammex electron density CT phantom containing EDs from 0. 292 to 1. 707 was imaged under each of these conditions. The linear relationship between MV CBCT pixel value and ED was demonstrated for all MU settings and over the range of EDs. Changes in MU number did not dramatically alter the MV CBCT ED calibration. The use of different reconstruction filters was found to affect the MV CBCT ED calibration, as was the addition of solid water surrounding the phantom. Dose distributions from treatment plans calculated with simulated image data from a 15 MU head and neck reconstruction filter MV CBCT image and a MV CBCT ED calibration curve from the image data parameters and a 15 MU pelvis reconstruction filter showed small and clinically insignificant differences. Thus, the use of a single MV CBCT ED calibration curve is unlikely to result in any clinical differences. However, to ensure minimal uncertainties in dose reporting, MV CBCT ED calibration measurements could be carried out using parameter-specific calibration measurements...|$|E
40|$|SummarySignal {{transfer}} in neural circuits is dynamically modified {{by the recent}} history of neuronal activity. Short-term plasticity endows synapses with nonlinear transmission properties, yet synapses in sensory and motor circuits are capable of signaling linearly over a wide range of presynaptic firing rates. How do such synapses achieve rate-invariant transmission despite history-dependent nonlinearities? Here, ultrastructural, biophysical, and computational analyses demonstrate that concerted molecular, anatomical, and physiological refinements are required for central vestibular nerve synapses to linearly transmit rate-coded sensory signals. Vestibular synapses operate in a physiological regime of steady-state depression imposed by tonic firing. Rate-invariant transmission relies on brief presynaptic action potentials that delimit calcium influx, large pools of rapidly mobilized vesicles, multiple low-probability release sites, robust postsynaptic receptor sensitivity, and efficient transmitter clearance. Broadband linear synaptic <b>filtering</b> of <b>head</b> motion signals is thus achieved by coordinately tuned synaptic machinery that maintains physiological operation within inherent cell biological limitations...|$|R
