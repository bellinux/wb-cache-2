25|$|The {{development}} of a yeast-based system that allows stable episomal HPV replication provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means to study several aspects of the HPV lifecycle (Angeletti 2002). For example, E2-dependent transcription, genome amplification and efficient <b>encapsidation</b> of full-length HPV DNAs can be easily recreated in yeast (Angeletti 2005).|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} Bunyaviridae, {{each of the}} three {{segments}} has a consensus 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5' terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family. These sequences appear to form panhandle structures which seem likely {{to play a role in}} replication and <b>encapsidation</b> facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. The large segment is 6530-6550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613-3707 nt in length and the small is 1696-2083 nt in length.|$|E
25|$|The Inverted Terminal Repeat (ITR) {{sequences}} comprise 145 bases each. They {{were named}} {{so because of}} their symmetry, which was shown to be required for efficient multiplication of the AAV genome. The feature of these sequences that gives them this property is their ability to form a hairpin, which contributes to so-called self-priming that allows primase-independent synthesis of the second DNA strand. The ITRs were also shown to be required for both integration of the AAV DNA into the host cell genome (19th chromosome in humans) and rescue from it, {{as well as for}} efficient <b>encapsidation</b> of the AAV DNA combined with generation of a fully assembled, deoxyribonuclease-resistant AAV particles.|$|E
25|$|New MPyV virions are {{assembled}} in the nucleus in dense local aggregations known as virus factories. Capsid proteins, produced in the cytoplasm of the host cell, enter the nucleus as assembled capsomers consisting of pentameric VP1 associated with VP2 or VP3. Nuclear localization sequences consistent with karyopherin interactions {{have been identified in}} capsid protein sequences, facilitating their transit through nuclear pores. Once inside the nucleus they assemble into mature capsids containing a copy of the viral genome, although the exact mechanism of <b>encapsidation</b> is not well understood. Filamentous or tubular structures representing polymerized VP1 have been observed in the nuclei of infected cells as intermediates in the assembly process from which mature virions are produced.|$|E

[...] With this assumption many methods were established for efficient production of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors containing a reporter or therapeutic gene. [...] However, it was also published that the ITRs are not the only elements required in cis for the effective replication and <b>encapsidation.</b> [...] A few research groups have identified a sequence designated cis-acting Rep-dependent element (CARE) inside the coding sequence of the rep gene.

5000|$|The Avian HBV RNA <b>encapsidation</b> signal epsilon (AHBV_epsilon) is an RNA {{structure}} that {{is shown to}} facilitate <b>encapsidation</b> of the pregenomic RNA required for replication. There are two main classes of <b>encapsidation</b> signals in avian HBV viruses - Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) and Heron hepatitis B virus (HHBV) like. DHBV {{is used as a}} model to understand human HBV. Although {{studies have shown that the}} HHBV epsilon has less pairing in the upper stem than DHBV, this pairing is not absolutely required for DHBV infection in ducks.|$|E

5000|$|The RNA <b>encapsidation</b> ({{packaging}}) signal {{participates in}} the process of RNA packaging and aids in making viral packaging and <b>encapsidation</b> more efficient. RNA packaging is characterized by an initial recognition event between the Gag polyprotein and the RNA <b>encapsidation</b> (packaging) signal. Research suggests this specifically takes place at the 5’ end of the viral genome and involves stable RNA secondary structures. These structures interact with amino acids located in the nucleocapsid, or NC domain, of the Gag protein. [...] Once the <b>encapsidation</b> region and the Gag protein interact, the NC domain recruits the genome of the virus to be packaged into the retrovirus capsid. Recently, it has also been proposed that the matrix (MA) domain of Gag {{plays an important role in}} recognizing genomic RNA early on in this process. Furthermore, it has been found that this MA domain is involved in gRNA packaging due to the presence of charged residues in this region, which are vital for successful packaging to take place.|$|E
50|$|The HBV RNA <b>encapsidation</b> signal epsilon (HBV_epsilon) is {{an element}} {{essential}} for HBV virus replication.|$|E
50|$|Many of the Gammaretroviruses share a conserved RNA {{structural}} element called a core <b>encapsidation</b> signal.|$|E

50|$|The Gammaretrovirus core <b>encapsidation</b> {{signal is}} an RNA element {{known to be}} {{essential}} for stable dimerisation and efficient genome packaging during virus assembly. Dimerisation of the viral RNA genomes is proposed {{to act as an}} RNA conformational switch which exposes conserved UCUG elements and enables efficient genome <b>encapsidation.</b> The structure of this element is composed of three stem-loops. Two of the stem-loops called SL-C and SL-D form a single co-axial extend helix.|$|E

50|$|Several non-coding RNA {{elements}} {{have been}} identified in the HBV genome. These include: HBV PREalpha, HBV PREbeta and HBV RNA <b>encapsidation</b> signal epsilon.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unknown}} if viral {{replication}} can occur at all without {{the presence of}} this RNA encapsidaiton (packaging) signal. Mutation or deletion of the RNA <b>encapsidation</b> (packaging) signal reduces RNA viral packaging, but still allows for the viral particle to be made. Mutation of the NC domain in Gag, similarly, halts RNA packaging, but also prevents the assembly of retroviral particles. If the <b>encapsidation</b> (packaging) signal is not essential for this particle assembly, then the protein interactions among Gag molecules are likely solely responsible for viral replication. However, further research of the NC domain involving recombinant Gag proteins show the <b>encapsidation</b> signal is necessary for viral particle assembly. Two hypotheses currently stand to explain these contradictory findings. First, small cellular RNAs, specifically tRNAs, in the retroviruses could be utilized during particle production. Second, viral particles without genomic RNA could use other cellular RNAs as structural support during replication.|$|E

50|$|It is {{also known}} that the <b>encapsidation</b> (packaging) signal {{is made up of}} {{secondary}} structures. There are two stable stem-loop structures in the primary region and one stem-loop structure in the secondary region. The two primary stem-loops are located in the matrix (MA) domain of the gag gene, downstream of the start codon, while the secondary signal stem-loop is found in the capsid (CA) domain of gag. It is known when mutations in the primary region make one of its stem-loops inoperable, viral replication decreases by a factor of 7. Also, replication decreases 40-fold when neither primary signal stem-loop is properly functioning, creating a phenotype similar to BLV strains that do not have a primary signal region. A similar effect is found in the secondary signal stem-loop, where mutations in this region reduce viral replication 4 to 6 times. However, it has also been found that replication rates of mutant BLV strains can be reestablished to normal levels by implementing counter mutations. Furthermore, when the <b>encapsidation</b> signal regions of type 1 or type 2 human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), a virus within the same family as BLV, replace these mutated primary and secondary regions of mutated BLV, replication improves, implying the <b>encapsidation</b> regions of HTLV and BLV are homologous. Chimeric forms of BLV RNA are also not as efficient, suggesting secondary and tertiary structures of these <b>encapsidation</b> regions are important for replication success.|$|E
50|$|The genome {{includes}} a conserved RNA structural element called a core <b>encapsidation</b> signal that directs packaging of RNA into the virion; the tertiary structure of this element has been solved using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} spectroscopy.|$|E

50|$|The other region, {{composed}} of 132 nucleotide base pairs, is {{located within the}} gag gene between nucleotides 1015 and 1147. This region, {{also known as the}} secondary signal, will facilitate RNA <b>encapsidation</b> if the primary region is present and fully functional.|$|E
50|$|Stem-loop 3 (SL3) {{consists}} of a highly conserved 14 nt stem-loop which was predicted and confirmed by mutagenesis and mass spectrometric detection (MS3D). HIV-1 SL3 is sufficient by itself to induce heterologous RNA into virus-like particles but its deletion does not completely eliminate <b>encapsidation.</b>|$|E

50|$|DIS, or dimer {{initiation}} site, is {{a highly}} conserved RNA-RNA interacting sequence constituting the SL1 stem-loop in the Psi packaging element of many retroviruses.

50|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is {{an example}} of a helper virus that helps Hepatitis D virus (HDV) (a {{replication}} defective, helper dependent ssRNA virus) to replicate -- as HDV requires the surface antigen of HBV (HBsAg) for the <b>encapsidation</b> of its own genome. The envelope proteins on the outer surface of HDV are entirely provided by HBV.|$|E
50|$|The <b>encapsidation</b> (packaging) {{signal of}} BLV {{is made up}} of two regions.

This region is called the primary signal and is essential for viral replication to occur.|$|E
50|$|Stem-loop 1 (SL2) and stem-loop 2 (SL2) are the {{specific}} secondary {{structures of the}} primary signaling region of BLV.
