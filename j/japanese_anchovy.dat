5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

50|$|Coilia nasus, {{also known}} as the <b>Japanese</b> {{grenadier}} <b>anchovy,</b> is a fish from the family Engraulidae (anchovies). It grows to 41 cm total length; it is a relatively large species for its genus. It is found in marine, freshwater, and brackish water at depths down to 50 m. It is anadromous, moving to freshwater to spawn. It is distributed in the northwest Pacific, between 21-42°N and 109-134°E, or from Guangdong in China to the Ariake Sound in southwestern Japan.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of benthic and pelagic primary production for demersal fish and some invertebrates in the western Seto Inland Sea of Japan was examined using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses. A few fishes, such as juvenile black rockfish Sebastes inermis and large <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovies</b> Engraulis japonicus, had isotopic carbon signatures similar to pelagic particulate organic matter (� 20. 1 � 1. 7 ‰), which indicates that their food was derived from production in the water column. However, 92 % of the 401 demersal fish that were analyzed had � 13 C signatures (� 17. 0 to � 13. 0 ‰) {{similar to those of}} benthic crustaceans, epilithic microphytobenthos, and macroalgae and unlike the signature of pelagic particulate organic matter or zooplankton. These results suggest that in the Seto Inland Sea there is not a tight coupling between pelagic primary production and the food web of demersal fishes, but rather that these fishes are dependent on carbon from benthic primary production. Petersen and Curtis (1980) suggested that pelagic–benthic coupling in the marine ecosystem should be tighter at higher latitudes than at lower latitudes.

5000|$|Bryde's whales feed on a {{wide variety}} of fish, planktonic crustaceans, and cephalopods. In the western North Pacific, Bryde's whales caught by Japanese {{scientific}} whaling vessels (2000-2007) mainly fed on <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis japonicus, 52%) and various species of euphausiid (36%, including Euphausia similis, E. gibboides, Thysanoessa gregaria, and Nematoscelis difficilis), as well as oceanic lightfish (Vinciguerria nimbaria, nearly 3%), and mackerels (Scomber spp., less than 2%). The prey differed by location and season. In coastal areas, euphausiids dominated the diet, comprising 89 and 75% of the diet in May and June, respectively. Further offshore, <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> was the dominant species, accounting for nearly 100% of the diet in late summer. Based on the stomach contents of Bryde's whales caught by Japanese pelagic whaling expeditions in the North Pacific in the 1970s, the majority where found to feed on euphausiids (nearly 89%), whereas only about 11% fed on fish.Off South Africa, prey preferences differed between the inshore and offshore forms. The former mainly feed on anchovies (Engraulis capensis, 83%), maasbankers (Trachurus trachurus, 36%), and pilchards (Sardinops ocellata, 33%), with only one (or 3%) being found with euphausiids (Nyctiphanes capensis). The latter, however, mainly feed on euphausiids (primarily Euphausia lucens, but also E. recurva, N. capensis, and Thysanoessa gregaria), as well as various deep-sea fish (including Mueller's pearlside, Maurolicus muelleri, and a species of Lestidium).

5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|E

Eighty-one individuals of C. nasus were collected from five locations and 12 individuals of Coilia mystus were sampled from the Yangtze River Estuary. A total of 371 loci were detected by five primer combinations, 310 of which were polymorphic (83. 56 %). Analysis of molecular variation (AMOVA) and pairwise fixation index (FST) revealed significant genetic differentiation among five samples, indicating limited gene flow among populations. The dendrogram for populations by neighbor-joining (NJ) cluster analysis provided evidence of a clear relationship between genetic and geographic patterns, supporting significant genetic differentiation between China coastal populations and Ariake Sea populations.

40|$|Based on a {{time series}} of ocean climate indices and catch records for seven pelagic fish speciesin the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) and Kuroshio-Oyashio Current (KOC) regions from 1910 to 2004, wedetected {{regional}} synchrony {{in the long-term}} fluctuations of the fish populations and identified alternation patternsof dominant species related to climate shifts. The annual catches of Pacific herring, <b>Japanese</b> sardines,Japanese <b>anchovies,</b> jack mackerel, chub mackerel, Pacific saury and common squid in the TWC regionfluctuated in phase {{with those in the}} KOC region, which suggests that they were controlled by the samebasin-wide climate forcing. After the collapse of the herring fishery, the alternation sequence was: sardines(1930 s), Pacific saury, jack mackerel, common squid and anchovies (1950 s∼ 1960 s), herring (late 1960 s∼early 1970 s), chub mackerel (1970 s) and then sardines (1980 s). As sardine biomass decreased in the late stages ofthe cool regime, catch of the other four species increased immediately during the warm period of the 1990 s. Regional differences in the amplitude of long-term catch fluctuations for the seven pelagic fishes could beexplained by regional differences in availability, fishing techniques and activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coilia nasus (<b>Japanese</b> {{grenadier}} <b>anchovy)</b> undergoes {{spawning migration}} {{from the ocean}} to fresh water inland. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} anadromous fish use olfactory cues to perform successful migration to spawn. However, limited genomic information is available for C. nasus. To understand the molecular mechanisms of spawning migration, it is essential to identify the genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior of C. nasus. Results: Using de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly, we constructed two transcriptomes of the olfactory epithelium from wild anadromous and non-anadromous C. nasus. Over 178 million high-quality clean reads were generated using Illumina sequencing technology and assembled into 176, 510 unigenes (mean length: 843 bp). About 51 % (89, 456) of the unigenes were functionally annotated using protein databases. Gene ontology analysis of the transcriptomes indicated gene enrichment not only in signal detection and transduction, but also in regulation and enzymatic activity. The potential genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior were identified. In addition, simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed to identify potential molecular markers. Conclusion: We, for the first time, obtained high-quality de novo transcriptomes of C. nasus using a high-throughput sequencing approach. Our study lays the foundation for further investigation of C. nasus spawning migration and genome evolution...|$|R

50|$|In the North Pacific, small {{schooling}} {{fish and}} krill are major food items. They feed exclusively on Pacific herring {{in the northern}} Okhotsk Sea and only on Alaska pollock east of Sakhalin Island. Japanese mackerel (found in 61 per cent of sampled stomachs) and Pacific saury (18%) are consumed east of the southern Kuril Islands, with only the former species being found in whales sampled in September and the latter species likewise only being found in whales taken in October. Euphausiids make up {{nearly two-thirds of the}} diet (62%) around the western Aleutian Islands, with unidentified fish (19%) constituting most of the rest. On the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido they mainly feed on euphausiids (55%), but also take sardine (24%) and sand lance (13%); on the Pacific side of Hokkaido, they feed almost exclusively on sardine (99%). In Sanriku, sardine makes up the bulk of the diet (54%), but euphausiids also play an important part (32%) - only a small percentage (9%) fed on sand lance. Euphausiids were a major food item on the Okhotsk Sea side of Hokkaido and off Sanriku in the spring (71, 72 and 62% from April-June in the former area, and 83% in April in the latter area), while sardine dominated the diet in the summer in both areas (71% in September for the former region, and 70, 92, and 93% from May-July in the latter region). More recent data from Japanese scientific catches in the western North Pacific shows <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> to be a major component of the diet in two of the three sub-areas (60 per cent by weight in sub-area 7 and 37.4% in sub-area 8), while Pacific saury was the major food item in sub-area 9 (64.6%) and played {{an important part of the}} diet in sub-area 8 (36.4%). Euphausiids (9.2% in all areas combined), Alaska pollock (7.8% in sub-area 7), minimal armhook squid (4.9% in sub-area 9), and mackerel were also consumed. They are thought to feed on juvenile herring and probably sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) around the San Juan Islands, while in the Monterey Bay region they have been observed feeding on baitfish - probably northern anchovy, which is abundant there.|$|E

Ichthyoplankton, copepods, and jellyfish were collected during two cruises in July 2005 in the Sea of Hiuchi and in July 2006 in Hiroshima Bay within the SIS. Sea surface temperature (˚C), salinity, bottom-layer dissolved oxygen (mg l- 1) and the abundance (no. m- 2) of fish eggs and larvae were significantly higher in the Sea of Hiuchi. <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> was most dominant (69. 3 % in number of eggs and 52. 3 % in number of larvae) among the ichthyoplankton. Mean jellyfish biomass (g m- 2) in Hiroshima Bay was significantly higher (50 -folds) than that in the Sea of Hiuchi. Moon jellyfish was the most dominant among the jellyfish collected, accounting for 85. 6 % in wet weight.

40|$|Climatic and {{ecosystem}} {{changes in the}} transition region between the subarctic Oyashio and the subtropical Kuroshio Extension fronts {{may be the key}} to understanding recruitment variability of small pelagic fish populations in the Pacific waters off Japan. The transition region is characterized by complex oceanographic structure with the meandering fronts, eddies and streamers creating large spatial and temporal variability in the environment. Juveniles of small pelagic fishes such as Japanese sardine (Sardinops melanostictus), Pacific saury (Cololabis saira), and <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis japonicus) migrate from the subtropical Kuroshio Current area to the subarctic Oyashio Current area across the transition region. A precipitous decline in number of age 0 recruits of Japanese sardine after the end of 1980 s appears {{to be related to the}} extremely high mortality rate of young-of-the-year fish in the transition region. In contrast, populations of Pacific saury and <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> increased after 1988. These synchronous changes in populations seem to be associated with the weakening of the Aleutian Low Pressure in the North Pacific and weakening of the Oyashio Current in winter, and a sea surface temperature (SST) rise in the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition region in spring. The contrasting responses of the fish populations to the SST rise can be explained by different temperature preference in terms of growth rate in larval and early juvenile stages; cool temperatures are preferred by sardine and warm temperatures are preferred by saury and anchovy...|$|E

Stomach contents analysis showed that the three whale species are highly dependent on small pelagic fish, i. e. <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy,</b> Pacific saury and mackerels in addition to copepods and euphausiids. Pianka’s niche overlap index showed high diet overlap among whale species that occur in some areas where they feed on pelagic fish. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated environmental and biological factors significantly contribute to the diet composition of whales. CCA also explained the distribution patterns of whales in relation to SST, chlorophyll a concentration and geographical variation. These analyses demonstrated that the diet composition of the baleen whales is determined by spatio-temporal environmental factors {{and the amount of}} small pelagic fish carried by the Kuro-shio Current. The total seasonal prey consumption by whales in the study area was estimated to be 774 000 t of <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> (16 % of the consumed biomass), 44 000 t of Pacific saury (1 % of the consumed biomass), and 140 000 t of mackerels (14 % of the consumed biomass), indicating these baleen whales are important components in the ecosystem, and warrant inclusion in fisheries assess-ments...|$|E
40|$|The {{swimming}} {{angle of}} larval <b>Japanese</b> <b>anchovy</b> (Engraulis japonicus) {{was measured in}} a tank, and target strength (TS) was calculated using a theoretical scattering model. The mean swimming angle was 12. 8 ° (s. d. = ± 22. 1). Increased speeds of flow led to increased mean swimming angles. The mean swimming angle at flow of 5 cm s^[- 1] was higher than those at other speeds. TS values were estimated using a distorted-wave Born approximation model for two cases. Average values were 1 - 3 cm s^[- 1] (Case 1 : 11. 5 ° ± 22. 1) and 5 cm s^[- 1] (Case 2 : 16. 6 ° ± 21. 7) for cases 1 and 2, respectively.
