50|$|In October 1899 {{a single}} <b>insulated</b> <b>van,</b> NTT 1, {{was built for}} the {{transportation}} of goods {{that needed to be}} kept cold, such as raw meat. Like NUU 1, it was painted white from new. Its walls were 5+1/4 in thick.|$|E
50|$|A {{dining car}} was {{introduced}} in 1931, attached to the train from Mitchell to Cunnamulla and return. When the air-conditioned Westlander {{was introduced in}} 1954, the dining car was attached at Roma. In 1967 a generator was fitted to an <b>insulated</b> <b>van</b> to provide power for an air-conditioned sitting car and mechanical refrigeration for the van to provide this comfort on the Quilpie service.|$|E
50|$|The Westlander was {{introduced}} in August 1954, replacing the Western Mail and its wooden carriages with the present Commonwealth Engineering, Rocklea steel air-conditioned carriages. The route from Brisbane to Cunnamulla was 973 km, with a connecting service to Quilpie from Charleville, 777 km from Brisbane. Initially the Quilpie connecting train was not air-conditioned, so in 1967 a generator was fitted to an <b>insulated</b> <b>van</b> to provide power for an air-conditioned sitting car and mechanical refrigeration for the van to provide this comfort on the Quilpie service.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 1923 (thus to start with, not built as Austauschbau versions), four-wheeled, {{refrigerated}} vans (Kühlwagen) were built with modern insulation that, unlike the <b>insulated</b> <b>vans</b> used previously, were also {{suitable for the}} transportation of fish and frozen meat (Class Gk… Berlin).|$|R
50|$|<b>Insulated</b> <b>Vans</b> (for meat), Meat Vans (ventilated {{for fresh}} meat), Insulfish <b>vans</b> (<b>insulated</b> for fish traffic - these had longer wheelbases {{so that they}} could be {{operated}} at higher speeds), Fruit Vans (ventilated vans for fruit traffic) and Banana Vans (unventilated and fitted with steam heating apparatus to warm and ripen the load, which was picked before ripening) were all specialist types for specific types of perishable goods traffic.|$|R
50|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} is {{a simple}} mechanical device. Small Van de Graaff generators are built by hobbyists and scientific apparatus companies and are used to demonstrate the effects of high DC potentials. Even small hobby machines produce impressive sparks several centimeters long. The largest air <b>insulated</b> <b>Van</b> de Graaff generator in the world, built by Van de Graaff himself, is operational and is {{on display in the}} Boston Museum of Science. Demonstrations during daytimes are a popular attraction. More modern Van de Graaff generators are insulated by pressurized dielectric gas, usually freon or sulfur hexafluoride. During recent years, Van de Graaff generators have been slowly replaced by solid-state DC power supplies without moving parts. The energies produced by Van de Graaff atomic particle accelerators are limited to about 30 MeV, even with tandem generators accelerating doubly charged (for example alpha) particles. More modern particle accelerators using different technology produce much greater energies, thus Van de Graaff particle accelerators have become largely obsolete. They are still used to some extent for graduate student research at colleges and universities and as ion sources for high energy bursts.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the new, upgraded type of <b>insulated</b> T <b>vans</b> for 1894, these vans were recoded to TH.|$|R
50|$|From late 1957, {{the last}} of the then-remaining TT <b>insulated</b> bogie <b>vans</b> were relettered to either BB for general use, or HH for {{breakdown}} train use. The fleet, previously with 31 vehicles, was renumbered from 1 to 21 to account for vehicles scrapped or otherwise converted since 1889.|$|R
5000|$|Refrigerated vans (Class I wagons), {{formerly}} known in Germany as T wagons (T = [...] "Thermos") - are <b>insulated</b> covered <b>vans</b> which are either cooled by a cooling medium {{such as water}} or dry ice like conventional refrigerated vans, or are machine-cooled wagons with their own cooling system.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} older type of 10 cwt van, the new 400E range found plenty of scope for special bodywork. Although the 'official' pickup was not catalogued until February 1961, others had been built by {{individual}} bodybuilders to order, as well as tippers, high top vans, etc. One interesting conversion {{was carried out by}} Normand on some special <b>insulated</b> <b>vans</b> for delivering ice cream. From the offside the van could be taken for a standard production 15 cwt at first sight, although at close range the shape was not exactly the same as the Ford body. Closer inspection revealed that the body was in fact thickly insulated and that the nearside door of the cab was louvred to provide ventilation for the refrigeration equipment carried in the nearside of the cab compartment. Also available from February 1961 was the Perkins 4/99 diesel engine for those who chose economy before performance.|$|R
5000|$|AB 745 was derailed by {{embankment}} subsidence at Hawera in 1956. Rather than {{recover the}} locomotive, NZR salvaged all parts from the right-hand (driver's) {{side of the}} locomotive, and buried it along with several V series <b>insulated</b> meat <b>vans.</b> The engine unit of 745 was dug out of the embankment in 2001. As of September 2012, AB 745 was owned by The Taranaki Flyer Society Inc., and they were restoring the locomotive in the former railway goods shed in Stratford, Taranaki, New Zealand. It is now owned by the Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust after the Taranaki Flyer Society Inc.'s leased building was vacated {{at the end of}} 2013. AB will be a long-term restoration project by the railway.|$|R
50|$|A {{refrigerator}} {{truck is}} a van or truck designed to carry perishable freight at specific temperatures. Like refrigerator cars, refrigerated trucks differ from simple <b>insulated</b> and ventilated <b>vans</b> (commonly used for transporting fruit), {{neither of which}} are fitted with cooling apparatus. Refrigerator trucks can be ice-cooled, equipped with any one {{of a variety of}} mechanical refrigeration systems powered by small displacement diesel engines, or utilize carbon dioxide (either as dry ice or in liquid form) as a cooling agent.|$|R
40|$|A new modular {{insulation}} panel {{technology for}} <b>insulating</b> reefer <b>vans</b> is proposed that can {{solve some of}} the problems of traditional methods. New insulating materials with lower thermal conductivity and aging rate are considered to be sandwiched in composite panels to provide better thermal performance in addition to stronger structure. The developed technology can be applied on a variety of commercial vans {{to improve the quality of}} insulation while reducing the cost and installation time of the process dramatically. The present method suggests prefabricating of modular insulation panels with accurate size in controlled conditions instead of spraying insulation foam inside the vehicles. In addition, the installation method of modular panels enables the operators to replace the damaged parts of insulation easily with less cost instead of changing the whole insulation in the old method. The MATLAB optimization toolbox is utilized to optimize the thickness of insulation panels based on energy cost and operational conditions. To validate the proposed model, a full-scale prototype is built and installed on a Ford transit connect and tested under road conditions for performance approval...|$|R
50|$|On Lake Victoria, {{the only}} (small) {{trawlers}} present belong to research institutes. Small-scale fishing boats are propelled mostly by sails, and paddles are {{used on the}} smallest boats. However, the number of boats propelled by outboard engines is on the rise, denoting a greater capital intensity of the local Nile perch fishery (see Beuving, 2013). One to three fishermen use a boat. The fish is caught mainly with gill nets and handlines and sometimes (short) longlines. Those caught by gill nets are usually dead when the nets are lifted. The fish are kept in the boat without protection or ice and taken to landing sites, mostly beaches, where they are weighed and purchased by company buyers using <b>insulated</b> boats or <b>vans</b> with ice, or the fish is bought by local women.|$|R
40|$|The Government of Sri Lanka is {{improving}} off-shore and deep-shore fishing by introducing {{more sophisticated and}} larger vessels into the Sri Lanka waters, together with the offer of subsidies, tax holidays and other concessions to {{those who seek to}} operate such fishing vessels. As a first step, some thirty 38 foot class fishing vessels are to be introduced. The requisite variety and quantity of fishing gear is supplied together with the vessels, and operators will be given further assistance to either export or market their catches locally by provision of <b>insulated</b> fish transport <b>vans,</b> jeeps with trailers, crushed ice plants, fish storage cabinets and adequate spares {{for at least the next}} few years. A description is given of the credit terms offered for the purchase of such vessels, pre-shipment finance, and loans and hire purchase facilities...|$|R
50|$|Captain Heinrich Podeus of Wismar {{founded a}} coach factory in 1894. In 1902 it {{was moved to}} a site outside the town that was next to the F. Crull iron foundry and {{engineering}} works that already belonged to Podeus. The coach factory was then renamed as Wagenbau F. Crull & Co Wismar (F. Crull Coachbuilders & Co, Wismar). After its takeover by Podeus' sons in 1907 it became the Waggonfabrik Wismar GmbH (Wismar Coach Factory). The firm concentrated {{on the construction of}} special coaches; both sleeping and dining cars as well as <b>insulated</b> and refrigerated <b>vans.</b> In addition to railway vehicles it also manufactured chassis for lorries. In 1911 the GmbH became an Aktiengesellschaft. In 1917 the Deutsche Waggonleihanstalt AG (German Coach Hire Firm) took a majority shareholding and merged both companies into the Eisenbahn-Verkehrsmittel A.-G. (Railway Transport Co.) On 23 March 1936 the coach factory was spun off again as the Triebwagen- und Waggonfabrik Wismar Aktiengesellschaft (Wismar Railbus and Coach Factory).|$|R
