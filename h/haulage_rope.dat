40|$|The proven safe {{operation}} {{and the high}} availability of aerial ropeways is mainly thanks to their design. This {{is based on the}} manufacturer’s extensive experience as well as the strict application of the relevant rules and norms. In that regard, this paper describes an analysis of the <b>haulage</b> <b>ropes</b> on ropeways in case of accidental loads. In solving this problem, analyzed ropeway system with sufficient accuracy was modeled as a system with three degrees of freedom. For solving differential equations we have used the software “Wolfram Mathematica”. At the end of the paper, we discuss the results of the dynamic forces in the <b>haulage</b> <b>ropes</b> in a certain time interval, and the results of the safety factors which in this case are sufficient to ensure reliable operation of the system...|$|R

50|$|An {{aerial tramway}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} two fixed cables (called track cables), one loop of cable (called a <b>haulage</b> <b>rope),</b> and a number of passenger cabins. The fixed cables provide support for the cabins while the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope,</b> by means of a grip, is solidly connected to the truck (the wheel set that rolls on the track cables). An electric motor drives the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> which provides propulsion. Aerial tramways are constructed as reversible systems; vehicles shuttling back and forth between two end terminals and propelled by a cable loop which stops and reverses direction when the cabins arrive at the end stations. Aerial tramways differ from gondola lifts in that gondola lifts are considered continuous systems (cabins attached onto a circulating haul rope that moves continuously).|$|E

5000|$|The Huwood Power Loader was {{mechanical}} device of roughly 6ft by 2ft by 1ft dimensions and {{powered by a}} 10hp engine, used to move cut coal from the coal face on to the conveyor. The machine was equipped with winches which used <b>haulage</b> <b>ropes</b> to drag the machine along the coal face and used both horizontal and rotary motions to shift the coal onto the conveyor. Pleasley Colliery, Derbyshire introduced {{one of the first}} such loaders in 1950.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> {{monorail}} {{transport system}} {{is an important}} kind of subsidiary transport system in the underground mine. We propose a control system using frequency conversion on <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> monorail transport system in this paper, which consists of PLC control console, AC inverter, speed sensor, over-wind protection switch, sound-light alarm, leakage monitoring device, etc. Our control system can realize the start-stop control, the forward and backward control, the frequency conversion control, the over-wind protection, and so on. This control system can also real-timely detect and display the status information of transport system. The field experiments have showed that our control system using frequency conversion can well satisfy the needs of automatic operation of <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> monorail transport system...|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{funicular}} is the Reisszug, {{a private}} line providing goods access to Hohensalzburg Castle at Salzburg in Austria. It was first documented in 1515 by Cardinal Matthäus Lang, who became Archbishop of Salzburg. The line originally used wooden rails and a hemp <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> and was operated by human or animal power. Today, steel rails, steel cables and {{an electric motor}} have taken over, but the line still follows the same route through the castle's fortifications.|$|E
5000|$|Eibsee Cable Car has {{a length}} of 4450 m and an {{elevation}} gain of 1950 m. The Eibsee Cable Car runs over two pylons, which are 65 m and 85 m high, respectively. The latter is the highest cable support pylon in Germany. The two cabins taking 44 persons each are suspended from two track ropes and are moved by two <b>haulage</b> <b>ropes.</b> The track ropes have a diameter of 46 mm each, and the hauling cables have a diameter of 29 mm each. It runs on [...] of power, generated in the valley station. The route is normally traveled in 10 minutes at a speed of 36 km/h. The tramway can accommodate 300 persons per direction each hour. The elevation gain of 1950 m {{continues to be the}} highest of all aerial cableways achieved in a single section.|$|R

40|$|In three-layered {{flattened}} wire ropes, which {{are common in}} mine haulage systems in coal mines, {{only part of the}} wires can be inspected by the visual method, so magnetic induction testing is employed as well. The project aimed at reducing inspection requirements without impairing the safety standard. Random sampling of {{flattened wire}} ropes have shown that this is possible, provided that fatigue and corrosion curves of the cable can be made comparable with the diagrams of magnetic induction tests. Monitoring of the strength reduction of these ropes must be possible throughout the whole rope life. The project focused on the following tasks: Assessment and description of the haulage systems and operating conditions (haulage equipment, mine climate, number of hoists per day, etc.); Inspection of the geometries of new and worn-out ropes and calculation of rupture forces and residual rupture forces; Modification of existing measuring and storage instruments, if possible in explosion-proof construction; Development of software for assessing the residual fracture force of <b>haulage</b> <b>ropes.</b> Available from TIB Hannover: RR 1344 (142) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEMinisterium fuer Wirtschaft und Mittelstand, Technologie und Verkehr des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Duesseldorf (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} a fire hit the ride, a major fatal {{accident}} occurred on 30 May 1972. A train being hoisted up {{to the start of}} the ride broke loose from its <b>haulage</b> <b>rope,</b> and rolled backwards towards the station. In spite of the efforts of the brakeman the train gathered speed and the back carriage jumped the rails and crashed through a barrier with the other 2 carriages crashing on top of it. Five children were killed, and thirteen others injured in the accident.|$|E
50|$|Railways began reappearing in Europe {{after the}} Dark Ages. The {{earliest}} known {{record of a}} railway in Europe from this period is a stained-glass window in the Minster of Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany, dating from around 1350. In 1515, Cardinal Matthäus Lang wrote {{a description of the}} Reisszug, a funicular railway at the Hohensalzburg Castle in Austria.

50|$|The fun fair's most {{spectacular}} ride was a rollercoaster called The Big Dipper, {{which opened in}} 1951. It was of wooden construction and suffered a major fire in 1970. It was closed after five children were killed and 13 injured in an accident on 30 May 1972 {{when one of the}} trains became detached from the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope,</b> rolling back to the station (the anti-rollback mechanism having failed) and colliding with the other train. This is the worst accident in the history of theme parks. The lack of a main attraction led to the decline in the popularity of the fun fair and its eventual closure in 1974.|$|E
50|$|In 1829 Rastrick was {{commissioned}} with James Walker {{to report on}} the economics of using either <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> or locomotives on the new Liverpool and Manchester Railway. After extensive travels to view the early railways of the age their report favoured <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> on economic grounds. They did however include the rider that there were some benefits to locomotive haulage not least their probable technical improvement. Given such a marginal judgement, the directors of the company decided to hold a competition to test the locomotives on offer. Rastrick was one of three judges at the Rainhill Trials of 1829 which conclusively proved the benefits of Stephenson's Rocket locomotive. Rastrick's diaries and notebook of the trial are valuable records of the performance of locomotives of that era.|$|R
50|$|Shincliffe (called Shincliffe Town from 1861): {{located in}} nearby Shincliffe, this station {{was built in}} 1839 and was served by the Durham and Sunderland Railway, using <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> until 1856. It closed when Elvet station opened in the city centre. A second station, Shincliffe, on the Leamside to Ferryhill line, was opened in 1844. That closed to {{passengers}} in 1941.|$|R
50|$|At its peak, {{there were}} four lines on the corridor, with three {{stationary}} engines {{in close proximity to}} the museum. Having already been in use on other parts of the lines, gradient improvements on the Blyth & Tyne's line allowed it to use steam locomotives throughout from the 1850s. Others persisted with <b>rope</b> <b>haulage,</b> the Seaton Burn wagonway being the last to convert in 1900.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1946 Lamb turned eighteen, the age that pit boys started to work {{underground}}. Before he could go underground he had three weeks training at the Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain {{as well as being}} given the equipment he would later need to use. Lamb then started work at the Busty Pit at Craghead Colliery, his 'first job was on the landing as a datal hand and was to send sets of four full tubs outbye (to the shaft bottom) on the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> and then to make sure the putters had plenty of chumins (empty tubs) that came back on the haulage rope' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{aerial lift}} line was {{constructed}} by the Austrian Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. With its length of 4359 m, {{it is one of}} the longest passenger-carrying aerial tramway lines in the world. There are four supporting towers located between the two terminals. The aerial tram consists of two passenger cabins, each capable of carrying 80 passengers. Two fixed track cables are for support while one loop of cable, solidly connected to the cabins, is for haulage. An electric motor drives the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope,</b> which provides propulsion. When the cabins arrive at the end stations, the cable loop stops and reverses direction so that the cars shuttle back and forth between the terminals.|$|E
5000|$|The line's varying {{slopes and}} the curve near its foot makes the wire <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> {{more prone to}} {{thrashing}} than most rope-worked lines, where gravity usually holds the rope in rollers. It receives its greatest wear nearest the tram, so by buying a rope deliberately longer than necessary {{it is possible to}} cut the worn end off three times before needing to replace the whole rope. Until the mid-1920s a gas engine provided the motive power. A Ruston petrol engine was then installed to provide electricity to the castle, enabling rechargeable batteries to be installed to power the tramway. In 1951 the island was connected to the National Grid, since when the rope has been powered by a [...] AC motor.|$|E
50|$|The term {{comes from}} the days of sailing ships, when a rigger was a person who worked with rigging, that is, ropes for {{hoisting}} the sails. Sailors could put their rope skills to work in lifting and hauling. In an era before mechanical <b>haulage</b> and cranes, <b>ropes,</b> pulleys and muscle power were all that was available to move heavy objects. In time, rigging became a trade in itself, giving rise to modern usages, with its roots all but forgotten.|$|R
50|$|Two {{options were}} {{discussed}} {{for the general}} route through Kaiserslautern, as {{the development of a}} route through the Palatinate Forest (Pfälzerwald) proved to be complicated. At first the responsible engineers considered a route through the Dürkheim valley. However, this proved impractical because its side valleys were too low, and above all the climb to Frankenstein would have been too steep. This would have required stationary steam engines and <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> to overcome the differences in altitude.|$|R
2500|$|Coal was {{originally}} forked into approximately [...] capacity wooden skips, hauled {{to the surface}} by horse and then carted down the mountain by a track joining Mount Keira Road near Hurt Street. Later improvements include a Main and Tail <b>Rope</b> <b>Haulage</b> installation to bring coal to the surface, and a self acting skip incline (that is, empty skips hauled up to the mine by the descending loaded skips) to transport the coal {{to the foot of}} the mountain at what is now Gooyong Street Keiraville ...|$|R
5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and hoisting rope, thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|E
50|$|Louisiana Land and Exploration bought Copper Range in 1977, {{then sold}} the {{operation}} to Echo Bay Mines Limited in 1983. Echo Bay sold the operation to the employees in 1985 but kept {{part of the}} milling circuit. In this transaction 70% of the shares went into an ESOP (Employees Stock Option Plan) and the remaining 30% were held by Mine Management Resources. It was {{at this time that}} an attempt was made to obtain a stock exchange listing, but it failed due to a variety of factors, including the move of mining into areas in which royalties had to be paid e.g. to AMAX in the south west area, the general decrepitude of the mining machinery and not least the start of a general crushing of the pillars and collapse in the centrally worked out areas, which was at least partially stoped by wrapping pillars with conveyor belt and old <b>haulage</b> <b>rope</b> to stabilize them. The employees subsequently sold Copper Range to Metall Mining Corporation (shortly to rename itself Inmet Mining) in 1989. After a fruitless attempt to put the mine back into profit again, Inmet closed it in 1995. Proposals to carry on mining by sulfuric acid leaching were considered but these were shelved in 1997. The mine was allowed to flood and reclamation work started. The refinery continues to operate however, and is now owned by HudBay Minerals.|$|E
50|$|The Edinburgh, Leith and Newhaven Railway was {{a railway}} company formed in 1836 {{to connect the}} city of Edinburgh with the {{harbours}} on the Firth of Forth. When the line connected to Granton, the company name was changed to the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway. It opened part of its route in 1846, but reaching the centre of Edinburgh involved the difficult construction of a long tunnel; this was opened in 1847. It was on a steep incline and was worked by <b>rope</b> <b>haulage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Coal was {{originally}} forked into approximately 1 LT capacity wooden skips, hauled {{to the surface}} by horse and then carted down the mountain by a track joining Mount Keira Road near Hurt Street.

5000|$|Nationalisation {{brought about}} a review of pre-war {{development}} plans, which resulted in re-organisation of the pits in the area. After abandoning No.5 shaft in 1950, in 1951 two horizontal 16 ft wide by 13 ft high tunnels were driven 2750 yd in a southerly direction from No's 3 and 4 shafts. In 1960 these tunnels intersected the Crombouke seam, allowing and two more faces to be opened for production. An endless <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> was installed and [...] capacity tubs were introduced to take coal to the skip pockets in No.4 shaft bottom.|$|R
2500|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{were first}} {{used on the}} London Underground when the first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway (C), was opened in 1890. [...] The first underground railways in London, the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and the District Railway (DR), used specially built steam locomotives to haul their trains through shallow tunnels which had many ventilation openings to allow steam and smoke to clear from the tunnels. It was impractical to use steam locomotives in the small unvented tubular tunnels of the deep-level lines, and the only options were <b>rope</b> <b>haulage</b> (as on the Glasgow Underground) or electric locomotives.|$|R
