25|$|Psychosis {{originally}} {{lost his}} mask to Rey Misterio Sr. during {{a tour of}} Mexico, as he removed the mask {{and handed it to}} Mysterio Jr. while simultaneously covering his face with a towel. He also lost the mask to Billy Kidman on the September 27 episode of Nitro, revealing <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American audience. On occasion, he was also paired with Juventud Guerrera, and when the later won the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Title, Guerrera was kayfabe injured and had Psychosis defend the title. In reality, Guerrera and Jerry Flynn were arrested on DUI charges; Psychosis immediately lost the belt to previous champion Jushin Thunder Liger. Neither Juventud Guerrera's championship win nor Psicosis' title defense was recognized by New Japan Pro Wrestling until 2007. Psychosis had a second Cruiserweight title reign in WCW shortly after unmasking, when the previous champion Lenny Lane, who portrayed a flamboyant homosexual on television, got WCW in trouble with GLAAD. As a result, Lane was pulled from television and Psychosis was given the belt to defend. The WCW announcers claimed that he had won it at a house show. However, on his first televised appearance with the title, Psychosis lost it to Disco Inferno. This earned him the dubious distinction of having lost two titles he never won.|$|E
500|$|His troubled son Philip, {{who became}} a {{successful}} portrait painter, died in 1926. His adored daughter Margaret (died 1953) married John William Mackail (1850–1945), the friend and biographer of Morris, and Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1911–1916. Their children were the novelists Angela Thirkell and Denis Mackail. In an edition of the boys' magazine, Chums (No.227, Vol. V, 13January 1897), an article on Burne-Jones stated that [...] "....his pet grandson used to be punished by being sent to stand in a corner with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wall. One day on being sent there he was delighted to find the wall prettily decorated with fairies, flowers, birds, and bunnies. His indulgent grandfather had utilised his talent to alleviate the tedium of his favourite's period of penance." ...|$|E
500|$|In Europe, it was owing {{in great}} measure to the Renaissance that the chair {{ceased to be}} a mark of high office, and became the {{customary}} companion of whoever could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. [...] We find almost at once began to reflect the fashions of the hour. No piece of furniture has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women’s dress but of men’s also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a “conversation chair” was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common.|$|E

500|$|Season ten {{begins with}} Clark {{stuck in the}} afterlife, where Jor-El informs him that a great {{darkness}} is coming to Earth. Clark is unknowingly resurrected by Lois, who is now aware that he is [...] "the Blur". Jor-El also informs Clark {{that he is not}} ready to be Earth's true savior, as there are inner demons that Clark must overcome first. In the episode [...] "Homecoming", Clark is visited by Brainiac 5, who shows Clark how his past has shaped his present, and will one day shape his future; including a vision of Clark's future self when he has fully embraced his destiny.

2500|$|The Greek {{style that}} may have {{continued}} to live on {{in the production of}} art in many places in the Parthian pre-Hellenistic traditions. In Assyria there were two pillars, which are held in such a Hellenic style. They each show a man standing in Parthian costume, however. The figure and the head are shown in profile and are thus in a Mesopotamian tradition. A third stele shows a similar figure, now, however, with <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front.

[...] The scene had to be reshot with the other side of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camera. [...] Scott's musical debut came to naught, however. Though Hal Wallis tried to get Scott's singing voice undubbed for the production, he was overruled by the studio heads, despite all of Scott's previous voice training. Production ran from late January 1957 to mid-March 1957.|$|E
