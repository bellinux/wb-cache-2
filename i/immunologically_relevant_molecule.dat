They are usually defined as compounds which only upon covalent interaction with proteins acquire the potential to induce hapten-specific B cell as well as T cell responses. Here we discuss recent developments in the basic understanding of MHC-restricted recognition of haptens by αβ T cells. Major emphasis is put on the structural elucidation of MHC-restricted epitopes for the model hapten TNP as well as for nickel as a major human contact sensitizer. Furthermore, we show that in addition to forming allergenic determinants penicillin and nickel can interact with the <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and heatshock proteins, respectively. Also taking into account that coordination complexes of metal ions as well as certain drugs may be recognized by T cells in noncovalent MHC association, the definition and functions of haptens may have to be reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|During {{productive}} {{infection with}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a dramatic suppression of cellular protein expression {{is caused by}} the viral alkaline exonuclease BGLF 5. Among the proteins downregulated by BGLF 5 are multiple immune components. Here, we show that shutoff reduces expression of the innate EBV-sensing Toll-like receptor- 2 and the lipid antigen-presenting CD 1 d molecule, thereby identifying these proteins as novel targets of BGLF 5. To silence BGLF 5 expression in B cells undergoing productive EBV infection, we employed an shRNA approach. Viral replication still occurred in these cells, albeit with reduced late gene expression. Surface levels of a group of proteins, including <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> such as CD 1 d and HLA class I and class II, were only partly rescued by depletion of BGLF 5, suggesting that additional viral gene products interfere with their expression. Our combined approach thus provides a means to unmask novel EBV (innate) immune evasion strategies that may operate in productively infected B cells...|$|R
30|$|As the {{development}} of the adaptive immune system nears completion, the foetal rete ovarii will undergo degeneration, thereby preventing further oogenesis. This process is caused by reductions in hormonal signals (the foetal hCG barrier) (Bukovsky et al. 2005). Further development of OMCs in the lymph nodes will then cease, and these cells will ultimately constitute the ovarian memory cell pool. During menarche and the reproductive years, hormonal signals and OMCT can facilitate periodic oogenesis by stimulating OSCs. Continuous renewal of follicles requires cyclic OCMT supplementation, as the memory cell pool will become exhausted if the OCMT proliferation rate in lymph tissue is too high. Therefore, even in the presence of hormone signals, depletions in the frequencies of OMCs will still terminate oogenesis. According to this view, as age increases, immunological anaplasia is the main point at which oogenesis and ovarian replenishment cease. This proposal is supported by extensive experimental data that reveal the close correlation between mammalian immunity and reproduction. This work has raised new questions about the influence of <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> on the proliferation and differentiation of ovarian germline stem cells.|$|R

We studied the possible role {{of the immune system}} in this process. Methods: We examined the expression of <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> by human cardiac valve endothelium in situ and in vitro and studied re-endothelialization of implanted allogeneic and xenogeneic valvular surfaces using explanted bioprostheses and valves obtained from donor hearts at cardiac retransplantation. Results: We demonstrate that human cardiac valve endothelial cells express molecules capable of initiating immune responses and might therefore {{play a role in the}} degeneration of viable cardiac valve prostheses. Also, we show evidence of re-endothelialization on the surfaces of xenografts and allografts but not on valves obtained from previously transplanted hearts. Conclusion: Inasmuch as valves from previously transplanted hearts seem to be free from degeneration, we conclude that reduction of the immunogenicity of allograft valve prostheses by HLA matching or immunosuppressive treatment might further improve long-term results after allograft valve replacement.

40|$|Immunogenicity of {{stem cells}} and their {{derivatives}} Nikola Doležalová Abstract Stem cells (SCs) {{have the potential to}} be used in regenerative medicine {{on the basis of their}} differentiation capacity and promising immunological properties, including low expression of histocompatibility antigens and costimulatory molecules, or secretion of suppressive cytokines. Their immunogenicity has often been ignored in the past but it is becoming clear that rejection of genetically incompatible SCs represents a very common issue. At present, SCs are extensively studied from the immunological point of view, since it represents a critical aspect of the safety of SC therapy. This thesis presents an overview of current knowledge about immunogenicity of SCs and their derivatives, including both pluripotent SCs (embryonic and induced pluripotent SCs) and adult SCs (mesenchymal, limbal, neural, haematopoietic and umbilical cord blood SCs). The expression of <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> on their surface and interaction with the immune cells in vitro and in vivo will be discussed, together with suggestions for overcoming the immunological barriers for transplantation.

40|$|Studying genetic {{diversity}} of <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>molecules</b> can improve our knowl-edge on their functional spectrum in normal immune responses {{and may also}} uncover a pos-sible role of different variants in diseases. We characterized the c. 503 T>C polymorphism in the human KLRB 1 gene (Killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily B, member 1) coding for the cell surface receptor CD 161. CD 161 is expressed by subsets of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells and {{the great majority of}} CD 56 + natural killer (NK) cells, acting as inhibitory receptor in the latter population. Genotyping a cohort of 118 healthy individuals revealed 40 % TT homozygotes, 46 % TC heterozygotes, and 14 % carriers of CC. There was no difference in the frequency of CD 161 expressing CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells between the different genotypes. However, the frequency of CD 161 + NK cells was significantly decreased in CC carriers as compared to TT homozygotes. c. 503 T>C causes an amino acid exchange (p. Ile 168 Thr) in an extracellular loop of the CD 161 receptor, which is regarded to be involved in binding of its ligand Lectin-like transcript 1 (LLT 1). Binding studies using soluble LLT 1 -Fc on 293 transfectants over-expressing CD 161 receptors from TT or CC carriers suggested diminished binding to the CC variant. Furthermore, triggering of CD 161 either by LLT 1 or anti-CD 161 antibodies inhibited NK cell activation less effectively in cells from CC individuals than cells from TT carriers. These data suggest that the c. 503 T>C polymorphism is associated with structural alterations of the CD 161 receptor. The regulation of NK cell homeostasis and activation apparently dif-fers between carriers of the CC and TT variant of CD 161...|$|R

During the SIMBOX (Science in Microgravity Box) mission on Shenzhou- 8, we investigated microgravity-associated long-term alterations in macrophageal cells, the most important effector cells of {{the immune system}}. We analyzed the effect of long-term microgravity on the cytoskeleton and <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> surface <b>molecules.</b> Human U 937 cells were differentiated into a macrophageal phenotype and exposed to microgravity or 1 g on a reference centrifuge on-orbit for 5 days. After on-orbit fixation, the samples were analyzed with immunocytochemical staining and confocal microscopy after landing. The unmanned Shenzhou- 8 spacecraft was launched on board a Long March 2 F (CZ- 2 F) rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center (JSLC) and landed after a 17 -day-mission. We found a severely disturbed actin cytoskeleton, disorganized tubulin and distinctly reduced expression of CD 18, CD 36 and MHC-II after the 5 days in microgravity. The disturbed cytoskeleton, the loss of surface receptors for bacteria recognition, the activation of T lymphocytes, the loss of an important scavenger receptor and of antigen-presenting molecules could represent a dysfunctional macrophage phenotype. This phenotype in microgravity would be not capable of migrating or recognizing and attacking pathogens, and it would no longer activate the specific immune system, which could be investigated in functional assays. Obviously, the results have to be interpreted with caution as the model system has some limitations and due to numerous technical and biological restrictions (e. g. 23 °C and no CO 2 supply during in-flight incubation). All parameter were carefully pre-tested on ground. Therefore, the experiment could be adapted to the experimental conditions available on Shenzhou- 8...|$|R

The severity of infection is, partly, dependent on the virus strain. Recently isolated Eastern-European subtype 3 strains are more pathogenic than the widespread subtype 1 strains. There is, however, almost no information available about the mechanisms involved in the pathogenicity of these subtype 3 strains. The objective {{of the present study}} was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo response of two European subtype 1 strains, Belgium A and Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV), and a virulent subtype 3 strain, Lena, in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC) (in vitro) and alveolar macrophages (in vitro and in vivo). It was shown that infection with the Lena strain resulted in a higher apoptosis of cells in vitro and a higher level of infectivity in vitro and in vivo than the other virus strains. Furthermore, infection with Lena resulted in a small downregulation of the <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> cell surface <b>molecules</b> SLA-I, SLA-II and CD 80 / 86 in vitro, and SLA-II in vivo. In spite of these differences, in vitro cytokine responses did not differ significantly between strains, except for the absence of IL- 10 production by Lena in BM-DC. The higher infectivity, apoptosis and downregulation of the cell surface molecules, may have contributed to the increased pathogenicity of Lena, and have dampened specific immune responses. This could explain the delayed and decreased adaptive immune responses observed after infections with this strain...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effectiveness of HLA typing in preventing corneal allograft rejection. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 459 consecutive HLA-typed patients who underwent perforating keratoplasty (PKP) between 1983 and 2001. Grafts were postoperatively transparent after donor-recipient selection by HLA-A, -B and -DR typing. Patients were divided into a low- and a high-risk group based on their preoperative diagnosis. RESULTS: We found a significant correlation between the number of HLA mismatches and the rate of allograft rejections: a donor-recipient match of two or more alleles in HLA-A, -B or -DR reduces the rejection rate by at least 10 % in low-risk (10 years after PKP; P< 0. 04) and 40 % in high-risk patients (3 years after PKP; P< 0. 0001). Especially HLA-B mismatches are important prognostic factors for both low- and high-risk patients. Considering both HLA-B and -DR mismatches significantly reduces the rate of allograft rejection, particularly in high-risk patients. Matching on a split typing level offers no significant advantage over broad level matching. CONCLUSION: Clinical results confirm theories developed to explain the function of the HLA (MHC) receptor. The closest possible donor-recipient match of HLA antigens based on broad level typing significantly reduces the rate of allograft rejection and thus improves the prognosis for long-term transparency of corneal grafts in both high- and low-risk patients. Besides HLA or major antigens, there are other <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> tissue surface <b>molecules</b> such as the non-MHC antigens of which blood groups and minor antigens are the most important.

Although ipilimumab undoubtedly exerts its therapeutic effects via immunostimulation, thus far clinically useful, <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> biomarkers that predict treatment efficiency have been elusive. Here, we show that neutralization of IL- 2 or blocking the α and β subunits of the IL- 2 receptor (CD 25 and CD 122, respectively) abolished the antitumor effects and the accompanying improvement of the ratio of intratumoral T effector versus regulatory cells (Tregs), which were otherwise induced by CTLA- 4 blockade in preclinical mouse models. CTLA- 4 blockade led to the reduction of a suppressive CD 4 + T cell subset expressing Lag 3, ICOS, IL- 10 and Egr 2 with a concomitant rise in IL- 2 -producing effector cells that lost FoxP 3 expression and accumulated in regressing tumors. While recombinant IL- 2 improved the therapeutic efficacy of CTLA- 4 blockade, the decoy IL- 2 receptor α (IL- 2 Rα, sCD 25) inhibited the anticancer effects of CTLA- 4 blockade. In 262 metastatic melanoma patients receiving ipilimumab, baseline serum concentrations of sCD 25 represented an independent indicator of overall survival, with high levels predicting resistance to therapy. Altogether, these results unravel a role for IL- 2 and IL- 2 receptors in the anticancer activity of CTLA- 4 blockade. Importantly, our study provides the first <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> biomarker, namely elevated serum sCD 25, that predicts resistance to CTLA- 4 blockade in patients with melanoma...|$|R

In order to identify domains within Pr 55 gag that can be replaced by <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> epitopes without affecting its capacity to assemble into VLPs, we deleted three domains of a predicted high surface probability. Deletion of amino acids 211 - 241 within p 24 CA and amino acids 436 - 471 within the p 6 LI portion of Pr 55 gag had no effect on the assembly, ultrastructure, biophysical properties, and yields of mutant VLPs when expressed via recombinant vaccinia viruses in mammalian cells. Deletion of amino acids 99 - 154 overlapping the p 17 MA/p 24 CA cleavage site completely abolished the capacity of the gag polyprotein to form VLPs and led to a reduction of immature Pr 55 VLPs released into the cell-culture supernatants when coexpressed with wild-type Pr 55 gag.

40|$|Although {{studies of}} the {{association}} of antigen with APC have been complicated by antigen-processing requirements, recent studies have suggested that <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> antigen should be present on the APC surface. Nevertheless, blocking of antigen presentation with antibody to the antigen has not been demonstrable in most systems. To study this problem we developed a system using avidin to block presentation of amino-terminal biotinylated synthetic peptide 132 - 146 of sperm whale myoglobin (B 132) to a murine T cell clone specific for this site in association with I-Ed. greater than 95 % specific inhibition was observed with doses of B 132 equipotent to unmodified peptide. Specific blocking could be observed: (a) after pulsing APC with antigen, washing, and incubating for a chase period of 8 - 16 h before addition of avidin and T cells to assure adequate time for intracellular trafficking and maximal display of antigen on the cell surface, or (b) when monensin is present during the antigen pulse to inhibit such traffic. Therefore, the inhibition appeared to be occurring at the cell surface unless dissociation and reassociation were constantly occurring. To distinguish these, B 10. GD APC (I-Ed- negative) were pulsed with antigen and cocultured with B 10. D 2 APC (I-Ed- positive). No detectable antigen presentation resulted. Thus, minimal dissociation and reassociation between antigen and APC occurs and, consequently, blocking by extracellular solution-phase binding of avidin to antigen is unlikely. Taken together, these data suggest that the blocking is occurring at the cell surface. Thus, under physiologic conditions, <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> antigen necessary for T cell activation appears to be present on the APC surface and is freely accessible to macromolecules the size of avidin.

The OAAs probably act as haptens but the proteins that form conjugates with OAAs in vivo are still unknown. Conjugates between the anhydrides and serum albumins (SAs) have routinely been used when testing for OAA-specific antibodies. However, the use of SA as the carrier-protein in these tests has never been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to identify major and also <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> protein conjugates of a particularly sensitizing OAA, hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA), in plasma. METHODS: Plasma was obtained from a HHPA-exposed worker, from a guinea-pig (GP) exposed to HHPA in an exposure chamber for 2 weeks (8 h/day, 5 days/week) and from a GP exposed once, nose-only, to tritium-labelled HHPA for 8 h. The plasma was fractionated using ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. These fractions and also aliquots of unfractioned plasma were hydrolysed, derivatized and analysed for anhydride adduct content using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Further, plasma from the tritium labelled HHPA-exposed GP was separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and analysed by autoradiography. In addition, <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> proteins were identified through specific IgE and IgG immunoblottings using sera from exposed workers. RESULTS: For humans > 85 % and for GPs > 74 % of the HHPA-adducts coeluted with SA in plasma. Autoradiography of GP-plasma shows a single 66 kDa protein that binds HHPA. IgE immunoblotting shows a major 66 kDa and a minor 28 kDa protein which could be inhibited by HHPA-SA conjugate. IgG immunoblotting showed a major 66 kDa protein and several minor protein bands.

This specific DNA macroarray contains 63 gene products, including 20 cytokines, 11 chemokines, and 12 <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> receptors. It was constructed by designing gene-specific oligonucleotide primers from porcine sequences available in the EMBL or TIGR expressed sequence tag data bank and using primers from conserved regions of aligned sequences from other species for sequences unavailable for swine. Amplicons produced by reverse transcription-PCR were cloned, sequenced, and spotted onto nylon filters. A trial DNA array was first produced to optimize the intensity, specificity, and variability of signals from amplicons amplified with either gene-specific or universal primers. The DNA macroarray was then validated by comparing the gene expression profile of nonstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to that of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate and ionomycin (PMA-Iono) -stimulated PBMCs from three different animals over a 48 -h time period. As already described for more conventional techniques, we showed that certain genes, such as those for CD 40, gamma interferon, interleukin 2 (IL- 2), the IL- 2 receptor, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, were upregulated in PMA-Iono-stimulated PBMCs.

Cellular effects of IFN-gamma are described, including up-regulation of pathogen recognition, antigen processing and presentation, the antiviral state, inhibition of cellular proliferation and effects on apoptosis, activation of microbicidal effector functions, immunomodulation, and leukocyte trafficking. In. addition, integration of signaling and response with other cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin- 4, type I IFNs, and lipopolysaccharide are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{examined}} the immunological response of antigen presenting cells (APC) to genotype-I isolates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection by analysing the cytokine profile induced and evaluating the changes taking place upon infection on <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> cell markers (MHCI, MHCII, CD 80 / 86, CD 14, CD 16, CD 163, CD 172 a, SWC 9). Several types of APC were infected with 39 PRRSV isolates. The results show that different isolates were able to induce different patterns of IL- 10 and TNF-α. The four possible phenotypes based {{on the ability to}} induce IL- 10 and/or TNF-α were observed, although different cell types seemed to have different capabilities. In addition, isolates inducing different cytokine-release profiles on APC could induce different expression of cell markers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Endotoxic {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS), {{a common}} structural component of all gram-negative bacteria, is well recognized for {{its capacity to}} interact with and perturb <b>immunologically</b> <b>relevant</b> cells. Using a radioiodinated, photoactivatable LPS probe, we have recently identified an 80 -kilodalton LPS-specific binding protein on murine B lymphocytes. We now have extended these studies to determine if other mammalian species, as well as representative endotoxin-resistant species (frog and chicken), have a similar LPS-binding protein. We have identified {{what appears to be}} a relatively conserved 80 -kilodalton LPS-binding protein on mononuclear cells of all mammalian species tested. However, both frog and chicken leukocytes failed to show the presence of a similar LPS-binding protein. It is possible that the presence of specific LPS-binding proteins may be important for endotoxin sensitivity of most mammalian species...|$|R
