40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been a rapid {{increase}} in the use of wrasses as cleanerfish for sealice on salmon farms. During 2010, the landed catch of wrasse was 440 tons, more than twice the 2009 catch and nearly ten times the 2008 catch. This rapid and exrteme increase in the fishing pressure on these species has occurred despite very limited knowledge of their biology, ecology and population dynamics. This has led to justifiable concern about the sustainibility of this resource. Wrasse demonstrate specialized life history traits. Many species change sex during their lifetime and exhibit species-specific mating behaviour, including nest building and parental care of eggs. This mating strategy lends to limited dispersal of offspring, ond only <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> have pelagic eggs. Many adult individuals are stationary, thereby creating a population struction dominated by Iocal populations. This population structure is also documented through genetic sludies in corkwing and <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse.</b> Small local populations are more vulnerable to overfishing and possible extinction of local genetic adaptations. Studies of growth of wild wrasse demonstrate that goldsinsy and rock cook grow slower than corkwing. This suggests that the first two will take longer to recover from heavy fishing pressure. Results presented here suggest that both the composition of species and the size distribution; vary between habitats, particularly between exposed and sheltered areas.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the impact of near-future levels of carbon dioxide on fish {{behaviour}} report behavioural alterations, wherefore abnormal behaviour has been suggested to be a potential consequence of future ocean acidification and therefore a threat to ocean ecosystems. However, an increasing number of studies show tolerance of fish to increased levels of carbon dioxide. This variation among studies in susceptibility highlights the importance of continued investigation of the possible effects of elevated pCO 2. Here, we investigated the impacts of increased levels of carbon dioxide on behaviour using the <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Ctenolabrus rupestris), which is a common species in European coastal waters and widely used as cleaner fish to control sea lice infestation in commercial fish farming in Europe. The wrasses were exposed to control water conditions (370 µatm) or elevated pCO 2 (995 µatm) for 1 month, during which time behavioural trials were performed. We investigated the possible effects of CO 2 on behavioural lateralization, swimming activity, and prey and predator olfactory preferences, all behaviours where disturbances have previously been reported in other fish species after exposure to elevated CO 2. Interestingly, we failed to detect effects of carbon dioxide for most behaviours investigated, excluding predator olfactory cue avoidance, where control fish initially avoided predator cue while the high CO 2 group was indifferent. The present study therefore shows behavioural tolerance to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse.</b> We also highlight that individual fish can show disturbance in specific behaviours while being apparently unaffected by elevated pCO 2 in other behavioural tests. However, using experiments with exposure times measured in weeks to predict possible effects of long-term drivers, such as ocean acidification, has limitations, and the behavioural effects from elevated pCO 2 in this experiment cannot be viewed as proof that these fish would show the same reaction after decades of evolution...|$|E

40|$|The salmon {{industry}} is {{heavily dependent on}} wrasse for delousing infected fish. The <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> is numerically the most important, and each year, millions are harvested from the wild and transported large distances into fish farms. Population genetic knowledge is required to sustainably exploit this species. Here, 1051 goldsinny wrasses from 16 locations across Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Spain were genotyped with 14 microsatellite and 36 SNP markers. Within-population genetic diversity decreased towards north, and a genetic break was observed across the North Sea. Samples from Northern Norway differed from rest of the Scandinavian samples, and samples from the British Isles differed from the Spanish ones. Within Scandinavia, isolation-by-distance was detected. Observed genetic patterns fitted well with expectations derived from oceanographic drift simulations. A sample from mid-Norway deviated from these patterns however, and was genetically very similar to southern Scandinavian samples. We conclude that the population structure of this species is primarily determined by the opposing evolutionary forces of passive drift, limited adult migration and spawning-site fidelity, whereas the deviation in isolation-by-distance observed in mid-Norway is potentially caused by inadvertent translocations of wrasse from southern Scandinavia via current aquaculture practise. Inclusion of outlier loci gave greater resolution, suggesting that diversifying selection may also affect population structuring among goldsinny wrasses...|$|E

The pots, made of steel 1 x 1 cm square-meshed netting, were 105 cm in length and 31 cm in diameter. They were baited using various crushed crustaceans. The pots were placed at depths between 5 and 10 m on rocky bottom with a dense cover of Lamillaria spp. and other macroalgae. A professional fisherman conducted the fishing. Sometimes the pots were hauled once a day, and sometimes twice {{or three times a}} day. This did not influence the catch rates. The catch per pot ranked up to 390. The mean catch per pot was 25. 8, 18. 8, 46. 9, 42. 7, 55. 5 for 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Distribution of catch per pot was highly skewed to the left for the first 2 years, while the distribution became progressively more symmetrical for the later years. In 1997, 10 % of the pots yielded more than 90 fish, and, in 1998, 9 % yielded higher catches. For the other years, this figure ranges from 0. 1 % to 3 %.

40|$|Selective harvesting, {{where some}} {{individuals}} are actively targeted or possess phenotypes rendering them {{more vulnerable to}} capture, is inevitably happening in all commercial and recreational fisheries. Selective harvesting may affect reproduction and recruitment and cause fisheries induced evolution, potentially reducing fisheries yield and resilience to environmental change. Several species of wrasse (Labridae) are now being harvested as cleaner fish to reduce salmon lice-infestations in Norwegian aquaculture. The fisheries are regulated by minimum size limits are presuably sizeselective, but {{they may also be}} sex-selective since these wrasses exhibits sexual size dimorphism. In this thesis, I focus on life history traits of corkwing and <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> {{in the context of a}} growing, selective fishery in southern Norway. Specifically, my goals were to: 1) Study spatial and sexual variation in life history traits in corkwing (Symphodus melops) and <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Ctenolabrus rupestris) and elucidate the underlying processes producing such variation. 2) Estimate size and sex selectivity in the corkwing wrasse fishery and assess the effects of fishing on population parameters of corkwing and goldsinny and 3), evaluate the current management and fishing practice in a selective harvesting perspective. In Paper I, we show that sexual dimorphism of corkwing wrasse is more male biased in populations further north on the western coast of Norway. The size limit is therefore selective against males who builds nests and provide parental care. In Paper II; we further explore the male selective fishery in a tagging experiment, finding that the nesting males have higher vulnerability for being captured in the fishery, independent of body size. It is also shown that a small marine protected area reduces fishing mortality, but have similar sex selectivity as the fished site. In Paper III, we assessed the effect of four MPAs on corkwing and goldsinny populations in Skagerrak, finding that MPAs, relative to control areas, have higher abundance of both species and older and larger corkwing, but no consistent differences for goldsinny. Paper IV further explores goldsinny individual growth rate variability in the same four MPA-control pairs. No MPA effect was detected, but there were indications of growth rates being negatively affected by local population density and abundance of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), a wrasse predator. I have shown that the fishery and the current regulations promote selective harvesting of wrasse at different levels which has implications for management. Some specific advices are proposed: For corkwing, introducing a slot size limit (protecting both small and large fish) can protect nesting males and females in more equal proportions. A slot size limit should also be beneficial for goldsinny, which as a considerably longer life span and is therefore more prone for truncated natural age distribution as a consequence of size-selective fishing. Moreover, slot limits are likely to reduce selection for slow growth and ensure a more balanced exploitation of populations with different growth rates. Further, I suggest increasing the number of marine protected areas. The results of paper II and III show that MPAs can be effective as a management tool for wrasse, especially considering that these species exhibit high site fidelity and fine-scaled variability in life history traits...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} wrasse (Labridae) {{are used as}} cleaner fish to remove salmon lice from farmed Atlantic salmon. We {{estimated}} the fishery and use of wrasse in Hardangerfjord. The estimated numbers of labrids used on salmon and rainbow trout farms varied between 86, 000 and 251, 000 from 2002 – 2006, but increased {{to as much as}} 1. 1 million in 2009 and 2010. A total of 93, 500 kg (around 1. 54 million) labrids were reported landed during 2000 – 2010. Corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) was by far the most important wrasse species: 52 % by weight and 56 % by number. Ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) made up 34 % by weight but only 14 % by number (due to its larger size). The relative proportion of species between the different sampling locations in the fjord was significantly different, as was the condition factor of some species. <b>Goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Ctenolabrus rupestris) had the slowest growth of the labrids in this study, and did not reach the minimum commercial catch size (11 cm) before they were 4 – 5 years old. Very few goldsinny caught were over that size. Corkwing reach commercial size in 1 – 2 years. The results {{of this study indicate that}} wrasse should be protected during the spawning season. Species such as goldsinny grow so slowly that they will most likely be collected several times in heavily fished areas but discarded because they are smaller than the minimum allowable size. This could be avoided through the use of modified traps with escape routes for undersized fish. This study represents a first step towards establishing a knowledge-based management plan for the wrasse fishery...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{offshore}} wind farms (OWF) is increasing {{to meet the}} demands for renewable energy. The piles and hard substrate surrounding these piles creates new habitat for species with preference to hard substrates. We studied the impact of this hard substrate on the fish community in a Dutch OWF in the sandy southern North Sea, which had been in operation for five years. Multi-mesh gillnets were placed near the OWF structures on the hard substrate protection revetments and on the sandy bottom {{in the middle of the}} farm. The catches indicated attraction of cod, pouting, bullrout and edible and velvet crab, while attraction to the sandy habitat was shown for flatfish and whiting. Further, two species previously not caught in this area, <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> and grey trigger fish, were caught on the hard substrate. In addition a Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar (DIDSON) was used to record transects through the farm to observe individual fish in the water column throughout the farm and very near the OWF structures. High abundances of fish near the structure were observed during some days, while during other days equal distribution of fish in the area was observed. The area around the structures is thus only used temporarily for shelter or feeding. The DIDSON also allowed looking at the aggregation level of the fish. Seasonally the aggregation level differed most likely due to different species occurring in the area. In April, most fish were aggregated in schools, while in summer most observations were individual fish or loose aggregations. The wind farm structures had limited effect on the aggregation level compared to season or weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sammendrag Kolonien av mellomskarv (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) i Øra naturreservat, Fredrikstad, har vært nøye fulgt siden den etablerte seg med 15 par i 1997. Kolonien har siden da hatt en voldsom populasjonsvekst før veksten flatet ut i 2004. De påfølgende årene har Øra naturreservat hatt en populasjon med en variasjon fra rundt 820 – 1090 hekkende par i året. Mellomskarven er en fiskespisende {{predator}} og kan derfor påvirke fiskesamfunn i områder hvor den hekker. For å påvise i hvilken grad, må man vite mer om hvilke arter skarven spiser og i hvilke mengder. Dette ble undersøkt i juni og juli 2011 ved å identifisere 6612 otolitter (øresteiner) fra 211 gulpeboller fra skarven i Øra naturreservat. Lengde og bredde på otolittene fra byttefisk ble målt, og brukt til å estimere lengde og vekt på fisk som var spist. Mellomskarvens diett var variert, og minst 30 fiskearter var representert. Størstedelen av dietten i 2011 bestod av fisk fra leppefiskfamilien (Labridae), og torskefamilien (Gadidae). I en lignende undersøkelse fra 2002 utgjorde leppefiskfamilien en betydelig større andel enn torskefamilien. En sammenligning mellom 2002 og 2011 viser videre at 25 arter var felles, men at andelen av de forskjellige artene varierte mellom årene. Andelen av grønngylt (Ctenolabrus reupestris) var større i 2002 enn i 2011 (35 % mot 4. 2 % i 2011), mens andelen av torsk (Gadhus morhua) var større i 2011 (8 % mot 4 % i 2002). Dette kan ha en sammenheng med tilbudet av de aktuelle artene siden mellomskarven er en generalist. Basert på antatt daglig fôrbehov konsumerte mellomskarven i Ørakolonien 205 - 293 tonn fisk i løpet av sesongen 2011, og torsk hadde størst betydning med 43 - 61 tonn. Vekt av ål (Anguilla anguilla) i dietten var større i 2011 enn i 2002 selv om antallet var mindre. Det er vanskelig å si noe om mellomskarvens predasjon av fisk har betydning for fisket i denne delen av Oslofjorden, men for en større forståelse og en best mulig forvaltning, bør økosystemet i Øra naturreservat nøye overvåkes, og flere undersøkelser bør gjøres, både på skarvens diett og fiskesamfunnet i området rundt. Summary The {{colony of}} great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Øra Nature Reserve, Fredrikstad, has been followed closely since 15 pairs established there in 1997. The colony has since then, increased dramatically until the growth levelled off in 2004. Over the subsequent years, the population varied annually between 820 and 1090 breeding pairs. The great cormorant is a fish-eating predator, and may therefore affect the fish communities in their feeding area. In this connection, {{it is necessary}} to study the diet composition of the cormorants, and evaluate the total fish consumption of the colony. This was done in June and July 2011 by identifying 6612 otoliths (ear stones) from 211 pellets from cormorants in the Øra Nature Reserve. Length and width of the otoliths found in the pellets was measured, and used to estimate the length and weight of the preyed fish, as well as identify the species. The diet of the great cormorants was diverse, with at least 30 fish species represented. The wrasse family (Labridae) and the cod family (Gadidae) were the most common fish families preyed upon. In a similar diet study from 2002 the wrasse family was significantly more common than the cod family. Furthermore, a comparison of the diet between 2002 and 2011 show that 25 species were identical in both years, but the proportion of the different species varied between years. The share of the <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Ctenolabrus rupestris) was considerably larger in 2002 than in 2011 (from 35 % in 2002 to 4. 2 % in 2011), while the share of cod (Gadhus morhua) was larger in 2011 (from 4 % in 2002 to 8 % in 2011). These changes may related to the availability of the species, since the great cormorant is a generalist. Based on the estimated daily food rate, the great cormorants in Øra consumed 205 - 293 tonnes of fish in the season 2011 with cod as the most important with regard to biomass consumed (43 - 61 tons). Weight of the eel (Anguilla anguilla) in the diet was higher in 2011 than in 2002, although the estimated number was much lower. For a better understanding of cormorant feeding and effects on the fish populations and the fishery, ecosystem in Øra nature reserve should be carefully monitored, including a survey of both the cormorants diet and the fish community in the surrounding area...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} infections due to antibiotic resistant bacteria {{has led to}} renewed interest in bacteriophages (= phages) and phage therapy. Although phage therapy {{has been applied to}} control bacterial diseases in plants, poultry, livestock and humans, its application in aquaculture is still relatively limited. The emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants has been considered {{to be one of the}} major limitations of phage therapy. This study aimed to (i) isolate and characterise phages; (ii) select phages and their bacterial hosts to set up in vivo phage therapy models with aquaculture animals, and estimate the efficiency of phage therapy; (iii) investigate the generation and characteristics of phage-resistant mutants, and thus estimate the consequence of applying phage therapy when phage-resistant mutants emerge; and (iv) discuss the prospects for application of phages in aquaculture. Two Vibrio isolates and their phages were isolated from a Scottish marine fish farm. Based on the results of conventional phenotype testing and 16 S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, the two vibrios, V 9 and V 13, were identified as Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio cyclitrophicus, respectively. The bacterial characteristics including morphology, temperature and salinity range of growth, production of extracellular enzymes, and the possession of virulence genes were examined. According to the morphological characteristics observed using transmission electron microscopy by negative staining, phage PVS 9 of V. splendidus V 9 was identified as a myophage, while phage PVC 13 of V. cyclitrophicus V 13 was identified as a siphophage. The phages could only lyse one bacterial host strain and their genomic DNA was double stranded with a size of 46 kb. The two Vibrio isolates were found to be non- or of low virulence to rainbow trout, <b>goldsinny</b> <b>wrasse</b> and Artemia in pathogenicity experiments. Thus an in vivo phage therapy model could not be set up using these Vibrio isolates and their phages. Two phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6 were isolated using the Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida Hooke strain as the host. Phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6 had a similar genome size of 50 kb, and the same relatively narrow host range within A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains. The siphophage pAS- 3 formed clear plaques and inhibited A. salmonicida Hooke growth in vitro completely for at least 18 hours when using MOI = 1, 000, whereas the podophage pAS- 6 formed turbid plaques and weakly inhibited Hooke growth. Rainbow trout exposed by intraperitoneal injection with 0. 1 mL of the raw phage preparations at a concentration of 108 PUF mL- 1 showed no adverse effects over 14 days. In the phage therapy trial, fish were firstly injected with 1 x 102 CFU fish- 1 of A. salmonicida Hooke, then immediately injected with phage preparations of pAS- 3 and pAS- 6, respectively, using MOI = 10, 000. Compared with the control group (which did not receive phage treatment), phage treated groups showed a delay in the time to death, and lower mortalities. However, the mortalities and time to death between phage treated and non-treated groups were not significantly different. Phage-resistant mutants of pathogenic A. salmonicida strain Hooke were induced by repeatedly challenging with phage pAS- 3. One of the mutants, termed HM, was chosen to compare the characteristics with the parental wild-type strain Hooke. Test results including the formation of ‘smooth’ colonies on TSA, autoagglutination negative, the formation of creamy colonies on Coomassie Brilliant Blue agar, and the degradation of a thick/furry layered structure on the cell surface indicated a deficiency of the A-layer in the phage-resistant mutant HM. Therefore, it was deduced that the A-layer either directly acted as the receptor of A. salmonicida phage pAS- 3, or was affected indirectly by the change of an unknown phage receptor. The greater wax moth larvae model was used to compare the virulence of the phage-resistant mutant HM and the parental wild-type strain Hooke, as it is an ethically acceptable animal model, which has the advantages of being low cost and convenient for injection, and is also a recognised alternative model for bacterial pathogens of fish. The results showed that virulence of the phage-resistant mutant HM did not decline in the greater wax moth larvae model compared with that of the parental wild-type strain Hooke. In conclusion, different approaches were used to isolate and characterise phages from different aquaculture environments for potential use in phage therapy. A rainbow trout model was set up using pathogenic A. salmonicida strain Hooke and two A. salmonicida phages pAS- 3 and pAS- 6. The use of phage treatment led to lower cumulative mortalities and delay to the time of death, although the differences between the groups were not significant, futher work is required to determine if these phages have potential in phage therapy. The consequence of applying phage therapy when phage-resistant mutants emerge was estimated based on their characteristics and virulence, and no decline in virulence of the phage-resistant mutant from this study indicates the importance of fully testing the virulence of phage-resistant mutants before carrying out large scale field trials of phage therapy. It appears feasible to use phage therapy as an alternative approach to control bacterial infections in aquaculture, but further studies are required to focus on improving effectiveness, and also to overcome the concrete limitations and hurdles in application and commercialisation. Moreover, a broader range of applications of phages in aquaculture should be explored...|$|E
