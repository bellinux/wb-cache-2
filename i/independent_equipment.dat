40|$|Abstract: Developing device drivers {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} tasks to develop or port operating systems. A device driver needs to be described according to the target device and OS. A major design goal in operating system developments is stability and one of the challenges of this stability is device drivers. Device drivers are more likely to crash the operating system for two reasons: on one side they typically run in kernel mode and not as easily be confined as the normal application programs and on the other hand side many drivers are built by <b>independent</b> <b>equipment</b> manufactures. This paper proposes Windows CE 6. 0 support system for stream driver development...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a number of}} quality assurance procedures for PV performance evaluations using data that has been acquired with commercially operating PV power plants. Summarized under the term “performance verification”, these procedures aim to make reliable use of data gathered by PV operators, despite inaccuracies in such data. To this end, short-term measurements with <b>independent</b> <b>equipment</b> and/or data sources are factored in. This ensures both meteorological and PV performance data gathered by operators have sufficient quality. Given a sufficient quality, site-adaptation of satellite based solar irradiation time series and optimizations of PV models may allow for significantly reduced uncertainties of yield predictions. This we anticipate to be {{of great interest to}} a broad range of PV stakeholders. The prerequisite for this, however, are appropriate quality of on-site sensors and strict maintenance of the PV performance monitoring systems in place...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{absolute}} calibration of a vectorial (tri-axial) magnetometer is addressed with the objective that the apparatus, once calibrated, gives afterwards, for a few years, the absolute values of the three components of the geomagnetic field (say the Northern geographical component, Eastern component and vertical component) with an accuracy {{of the order of}} 1 nT. The calibration procedure comes down to measure the orientation in space of the three physical axes of the sensor or, in other words, the entries of the transfer matrix from the local geographical axes to these physical axes. Absolute calibration follows indeed an internal calibration which provides accurate values of the three scale factors corresponding to the three axes – and in addition their relative angles. The absolute calibration can be achieved through classical absolute measurements made with an <b>independent</b> <b>equipment.</b> It is shown – after an error analysis which is not trivial – that, while {{it is not possible to}} get the axes absolute orientations with a high accuracy, the assigned objective (absolute values of the Northern geographical component, Eastern component and vertical component, with an accuracy of the order of 1 nT) is nevertheless reachable; this is because in the time interval of interest the field to measure are not far from the field prevailing during the calibration process...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Some {{theoretical}} and experimental {{studies have been}} developed to obtain <b>independent</b> <b>equipment</b> for inspection and maintenace of electric and communication lines, allowing to increase the efficiency of the process and {{to reduce the risk of}} accidents with the employees who execute the task. This activity is perfectly adequate for mobile robots because they are capable to move in avoiding the existing obstacles on the cables. The more important mechanical characteristic of the mobile robots is related with its stability, that are in two types: the static stability that is its capacity to maintain a configuration from reaction forces; and the dynamic stability that is its capacity to maintain a configuration from reaction forces and inertia forces. In this paper we present the kinematic analysis and the project of a robot with four legs to move suspended on wire. The kinematic analysis have been developed by considering the capability of the robot in transposing obstacles on the wire. For that, two analysis have been made: the first one considers all legs having equal lengths and, the second one unequal lengths. The analysis enable to verify the maximum obstacle dimension that the robot can transpose, when the obstacle doesn't occupe the foot position when it returns on the wire. Simulations of the legs and the robot behavior have been carry out using graphical software. Results of the mathematical model and simulations are presented...|$|E

40|$|Fractal {{dimensions}} of aggregates formed under natural and engineered fluid environments were investigated. Latex microsphere aggregates were generated under two separate hydrodynamic environments. Fractal dimensions were determined using power law relationships and relationships with slopes of aggregate size distributions.

Aggregates generated in a paddle mixer and a rolling cylinder had D 3 fractal {{dimensions of}} 1. 92 ± 0. 04 and 1. 59 ± 0. 16, respectively, indicating rolling cylinder aggregates are more fractal than paddle mixer aggregates. Fractal dimensions of marine snow aggregates were determined from image analysis of in-situ aggregate photographs at two different research facilities. Fractal dimensions from the two facilities were equal, indicating this analysis technique is <b>independent</b> of <b>equipment</b> and analyst.

50|$|RNAV systems {{evolved in}} a manner similar to {{conventional}} ground-based routes and procedures. A specific RNAV system was identified and its performance was evaluated through a combination of analysis and flight testing. For land-based operations, the initial systems used very high frequency omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) for estimating position; for oceanic operations, inertial navigation systems (INS) were employed. Airspace and obstacle clearance criteria were developed based on the performance of available equipment, and specifications for requirements were based on available capabilities. Such prescriptive requirements resulted in delays to the introduction of new RNAV system capabilities and higher costs for maintaining appropriate certification. To avoid such prescriptive specifications of requirements, an alternative method for defining equipment requirements has been introduced. This enables the specification of performance requirements, <b>independent</b> of available <b>equipment</b> capabilities, and is termed performance-based navigation (PBN). Thus, RNAV is now one of the navigation techniques of PBN; currently the only other is required navigation performance (RNP).|$|R
25|$|Although {{one of the}} {{original}} purposes of the second-tier series was for driver development, Cup Series drivers have been moonlighting in the series since its inception in 1982 (as the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series), when Winston Cup Champion Dale Earnhardt won the series' inaugural event at Daytona International Speedway. Prior to the year 2000, Cup drivers would often limit their schedules in the Busch Series, partially because the majority of the races were held at separate venues from the Cup Series. Two of the most notable drivers to frequent the second-tier series, Mark Martin and Harry Gant, have never run more than 17 Busch series races during any single season in their career except for Martin's 1987 season. In the past, Cup drivers had also run in <b>equipment</b> <b>independent</b> from Cup Series teams; drivers Michael Waltrip and Joe Nemechek for example fielded their own race teams in the then-Busch Series for many years. The presence of veteran Cup drivers helped to develop several future Cup Series regulars, including Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte, and Jeff Burton.|$|R

Lia writes that covert contacts and counter-terrorism collaboration between the PLO and the CIA had been ongoing in the 1970s and throughout the Lebanese Civil War in the 1980s but were not favored in the Reagan and Bush administrations. After the Oslo accords, the Clinton Administration revived covert ties and intelligence training. In January 1994 media sources reported that PLO officials and bodyguards were traveling to the U.S. to receive training {{as a result of}} an agreement between Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Publicly, the U.S. was ambivalent regarding support for police and security sector activities. The Gaza–Jericho Agreement between the PLO and Israel signed on May 4, 1994 increased U.S. interest in coordinating public international efforts to fund the PLO police who were to deploy into Gaza and Jericho. The day after the treaty was signed, the U.S. announced a $5 million grant for the PLO police and they worked to encourage other nations to donate flexible funds for the same purpose.|$|R
