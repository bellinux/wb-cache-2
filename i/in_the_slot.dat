5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

A biscuit joiner uses a small circular saw blade to cut a crescent-shaped hole (called the mouth) in the opposite edges of two pieces of wood or wood composite panels. An oval-shaped, highly dried and compressed wooden biscuit (beech or particle wood) is covered with glue, or glue is applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> The biscuit is immediately placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot,</b> and the two boards are clamped together.

25|$|The second {{generation}} Athlon, the Thunderbird, debuted on June 5, 2000. This {{version of the}} Athlon shipped in a more traditional pin-grid array (PGA) format that plugged into a socket ("Socket A") on the motherboard (it also shipped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> A package). It was sold at speeds ranging from 600MHz to 1.4GHz (Athlon Classics using the Slot A package could clock up to 1GHz). The major difference, however, was cache design. Just as Intel had done when they replaced the old Katmai-based Pentium III with the much faster Coppermine-based Pentium III, AMD replaced the 512kB external reduced-speed cache of the Athlon Classic with 256kB of on-chip, full-speed exclusive cache. As a general rule, more cache improves performance, but faster cache improves it further still.|$|E
25|$|Attraction {{between the}} plates {{can be easily}} {{understood}} {{by focusing on the}} one-dimensional situation. Suppose that a moveable conductive plate is positioned at a short distance a from one of two widely separated plates (distance L apart). With a << L, the states within the slot of width a are highly constrained so that the energy E of any one mode is widely separated from that of the next. This is not the case in the large region L, where there is a large number (numbering about L / a) of states with energy evenly spaced between E and the next mode in the narrow slot ndash& in other words, all slightly larger than E. Now on shortening a by da (< 0), the mode in the narrow slot shrinks in wavelength and therefore increases in energy proportional to minus&da/a, whereas all the L /a states that lie in the large region lengthen and correspondingly decrease their energy by an amount proportional to da/L (note the denominator). The two effects nearly cancel, but the net change is slightly negative, because the energy of all the L/a modes in the large region are slightly larger than the single mode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot.</b> Thus the force is attractive: it tends to make a slightly smaller, the plates attracting each other across the thin slot.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Stanley Cup Final pitted the Ducks {{against the}} Ottawa Senators. Ottawa was making their first {{appearance}} in the Finals. The Ducks fell behind 2–1 in Game 1 at home, but in the third period, Ryan Getzlaf tied the game and with few minutes remaining, Rob Niedermayer fed Travis Moen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> for the game winner. Game 2 was a low-scoring but exciting game. The only goal came off the stick of Samuel Pahlsson to give the Ducks a two-game series lead. Game 3 saw the Ducks lose 5–3 on a controversial goal by Daniel Alfredsson; it appeared on replays Alfredsson kicked the puck into the net, but the officials ruled it a goal. Once again, however, Chris Pronger was suspended one game, this time for an elbow {{to the head of}} Dean McAmmond. Game 4 was tied {{at the end of the}} second period when more controversy arose—Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson appeared to shoot the puck intentionally at Scott Niedermayer, which set off a brawl at the end of the period. In the third period, Dustin Penner scored a goal from a Selanne pass to score the eventual game-winner in a 3–2 victory. On June 6, the Ducks defeated the Senators 6–2 at Honda Center to claim their first-ever Stanley Cup in franchise history. Scott Niedermayer was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP, the second Duck to win the award after Giguere did so in 2003. After their championship victory, the Ducks became the first Californian team, and the first West Coast team since the 1925 Victoria Cougars, to win the Stanley Cup.|$|E

500|$|An early {{pit stop}} during the safety car phase had put Sergio Pérez up into third place, with Daniel Ricciardo behind in fourth. By lap 43, Ricciardo, Bottas and Räikkönen had all moved into {{striking}} distance of Pérez, {{who was trying to}} keep his older tyres alive. On lap 45, Bottas used DRS to move ahead of Ricciardo's Red Bull. One lap later, Räikkönen tried to follow suit, only to run wide, having to concede the position back to Ricciardo. On lap 47, Carlos Sainz retired after spinning off the track due to a brake failure, losing his rear wing. Retrieving the wing from the track under racing conditions, a track marshall was called [...] "one very brave Russian" [...] by the passing Sebastian Vettel, who barely avoided contact. Just after being passed by Räikkönen on lap 49, Daniel Ricciardo had to retire with a suspension failure. The end of lap 52 saw Valtteri Bottas move ahead of Pérez into third place, with Räikkönen moving past the Force India as well. However, just some corners later on the last lap of the race, the two collided, forcing Bottas to retire and causing heavy damage to Räikkönen's Ferrari. Pérez thereby reclaimed third place and achieved Force India's first podium finish of the season. At the front, Vettel moved closer to Hamilton due to the latter suffering from a compromised rear wing, probably caused by rubber debris <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slot</b> gap. However, Hamilton held on and took his ninth victory of the season, finishing ahead of Vettel, who was now his closest championship rival.|$|E
