Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and <b>even</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E

However, the players agreed to a draw after 56...Rb6+! 57. Kc1 Rh6! Because of continuous checks and mate threats from Black's rook, White will never have time to queen either pawn.

25|$|Some cities {{survived the}} Avar and Slav incursions {{and were able}} to {{maintain}} communications with Constantinople via sea and rivers. Chronicles mention a Roman commander of Singidunum in the middle of Heraclius' reign. But also on many Danube tributaries accessible by ship, Roman settlements survived, as for instance modern-day Veliko Tarnovo on the Yantra River, which <b>even</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> church built in the 7th century. Heraclius made use of the short time between {{the end of the last}} war against Persia in 628 and the commencement of Arab attacks in 634 to try to re-establish at least some sort of authority over the Balkans. Clear evidence is the construction of the fortress of Nicopolis in 629. Heraclius also allowed the Serbs to settle in the Balkans as foederati against the Avars, and the Croats in Dalmatia and Lower Pannonia; the Croats even pushed the frontier to the Sava in 630. Having to fight off the Arabs in the east, however, he could not finish his project. Roman rule in rural areas of the Balkans was limited to the successes attained in short summer campaigns. The cities of the Balkans, traditionally the major centres of Roman civilization, had degenerated from the populous, wealthy and self-sufficient polis of Antiquity to a limited, fortified kastron. They were unable to form a cultural and economic nucleus upon which the Roman state could build. Their population was consequently assimilated by the Slavic settlers. Even so, some cities along the Danube retained their Roman traits until the Proto-Bulgarian invasion of 679, also being under Byzantine rule until this date. The fact that the Proto-Bulgarians used a debased form of Greek as administrative language shows that Roman population and administrative structures existed there even after 679. In Dalmatia, Romance idioms (Dalmatian) persisted into the late 19th century, whereas in Macedonia, the ancestors of modern-day Aromanians survived as transhumant nomads. In central Albania, a small ethnic group, unnoticed over centuries of Roman rule, retained its pre-Roman language and also survived Slavic landfall, the ancestors of modern-day Albanians. Summed up, the decline of Roman power on the Balkans was a slow affair, only taking place due to the lack of Byzantine military presence. Being short on troops in the Balkans, there was no possibility for Byzantium to provide for safe communication between the cities. Byzantium could only locally impose a rule over the Balkan Slavs and only on a short-term basis, not enough to assimilate them. Byzantium, however, used any opportunity given by pauses of activity on the Arab front to subjugate the Slavs and resettle them en masse to Asia Minor. With a delay of two centuries, Thrace and Greece were re-hellenized, while, with the exception of the Albanians and the proto-Romanian Vlachs, the remainder of the Byzantine Balkans were permanently Slavicized.|$|E

500|$|References to {{the fact}} that Gregory House was based on the famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle appear {{throughout}} the series. Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character's indifference to his clients unique. The resemblance is evident in House's reliance on deductive reasoning and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable, and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting. His investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes used a similar method. Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is dependent on Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally). House's relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Dr. John Watson. Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his character—whose name is very similar to Watson's—were originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House's diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role. Wilson <b>even</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> dead-beat brother who may be dead, like Watson's dead alcoholic brother. (season 1, episode 10) Shore said that House's name itself is meant as [...] "a subtle homage" [...] to Holmes. House's address is 221B Baker Street, a direct reference to Holmes's street address. Wilson's address is also 221B.|$|E

2500|$|Subaru and {{his twin}} sister Hokuto, {{as well as}} Seishirō, were first {{conceived}} by series creator Nanase Ohkawa for a dōjinshi novel about an onmyōji who hunts elves, of which only the beginning exists. The characters were twice drawn for covers, and when South asked Clamp {{to create a new}} series for them, these characters were used. Originally, the twins were conceived more as mascots with Subaru being a penguin. His name was taken from the car Subaru Leone. Ohkawa remembers having troubles when writing Subaru as she was not used to writing kind hearted characters. Subaru and Seishiro's respective designs pay homage to Yasunori Kato, the protagonist of the fantasy novel Teito Monogatari, widely credited with starting the [...] "onmyoji boom" [...] in Japan.

2500|$|When {{activated}} macrophages {{start to}} secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), {{as well as}} IL-1; both {{increase the amount of}} cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. [...] Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's synergism with CRH. Cortisol <b>even</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria.
