5|$|Another {{potential}} source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, which are carried to the surface. Recovery of lithium has been <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> the field; the lithium is separated by simple filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E
5|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, energy flow and biogeochemical cycling set an upper {{limit on the}} number and mass of organisms in any ecosystem. Human impacts on the Earth are <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> a general way through detrimental changes in the global biogeochemical cycles of chemicals that are critical to life, most notably those of water, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.|$|E

5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are <b>demonstrated.</b> <b>In</b> about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
5|$|Eusociality is {{the highest}} level of social organization. These {{societies}} have an overlap of adult generations, the division of reproductive labor and cooperative caring of young. Usually insects, such as bees, ants and termites, have eusocial behavior, but it is <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> two rodent species: the naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat.|$|E

5|$|First {{discovered}} in hoverflies in 1995, motion camouflage by minimising optic flow has been <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> another insect order, dragonflies, {{as well as}} in two groups of vertebrates, falcons and echolocating bats. Since bats hunting at night cannot be using the strategy for camouflage, it has been named, describing its mechanism, as constant absolute target direction. This is an efficient homing strategy, and {{it has been suggested that}} anti-aircraft missiles could benefit from similar techniques.|$|E
5|$|H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) Gram-negative {{bacterium}} about 3μm long with {{a diameter of}} about 0.5μm. H. pylori can be <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|However, {{adaptation}} {{to climate change}} has been <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> many cases. These are usually due to a shift in coral and zooxanthellae genotypes. These shifts in allele frequency have progressed toward more tolerant types of zooxanthellae. Scientists found that a certain scleractinian zooxanthella is becoming more common where sea temperature is high. Symbionts able to tolerate warmer water seem to photosynthesise more slowly, implying an evolutionary trade-off.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose {{may be due}} to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> patients with NIDDM.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> 1859 {{that the}} growth of {{microorganisms}} causes the fermentation process, and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and moulds, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|Numerous authors {{described}} cretinism, myxoedema {{their relationship}} with the thyroid in the nineteenth century. Charles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910, Hakaru Hashimoto documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, and autoantibodies were <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> 1956. Knowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.|$|E

Few days later, on 26 February, an anti-Armenian pogrom broke out in the Azerbaijani seaside industrial city Sumgait, forcing thousands of Armenians to leave Azerbaijan en masse.|$|E
