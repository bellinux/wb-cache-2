5|$|Newspapers {{reported}} that Myers had {{a monopoly on}} the making of hydrogen gas balloons and was the only producer in the United States of these balloons for the government. A loft in the Myers house was made available for a sewing area of balloon materials to make the large balloons. The fabric material was patterned, sewed together into large strips, and made ready for varnishing. He had a patent of a fabric made from sea island cotton that {{was used for the}} varnish application. Myers' patented varnish formula made the fabric impervious to hydrogen. The varnish used to seal the fabric material for the balloon envelopes was prepared in a low pit outdoors in a ravine behind the house. This was below ground level so the fabric being prepared was sheltered from the wind. It also provided a fire-pit in case the flammable material caught on fire. There was a water-hose <b>handy</b> <b>for</b> putting out a fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} {{effort of}} the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousand residents of the Gniezno region {{who were involved in}} building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords was made in response to a perceived deadly threat, not just to help them pursue regional conquests. After 935, when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko's father Siemomysł, the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany. The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community. A Polabian Slav uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I, and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time (unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto, helping restrain the Polabians). When the situation stabilized, the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be <b>handy</b> <b>for</b> facilitating the Piast's own expansion, led at this stage by Siemomysł.|$|E

25|$|One of the downsides {{to having}} no {{physical}} branches was {{the risk of}} deposits getting lost, damaged, or delayed in the mail. Several people complained about NetBank losing or delaying payments to the account {{for a variety of}} reasons.

The widespread nature of NetBank's customers made it difficult to have an ATM <b>handy</b> <b>for</b> all customers, though and many were still required to use mail-in deposits.|$|E

On 12 September 1873 he was appointed to Wolseley’s staff for special services. He commanded a flank at the Battle of Amoaful (31 January 1874) where he was wounded. and at the Battle of Esaman. He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it {{would be difficult to}} imagine a more cowardly, useless lot of men”. He did, however, discourage British officers from using physical abuse on them.|$|E

[...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in <b>handy</b> <b>for</b> swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed.

His mildly corrupt tenure there gave him good contacts with the police.

(He) was taking all of this as ridicule, although I had publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which I felt the University of Michigan should be proud." [...] The faculty voted unanimously to suspend <b>Handy</b> <b>for</b> a year for [...] "publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors." [...] In addition to the suspension, Handy was charged as a [...] "faker" [...] in the press: Henry J. Handy, the student-correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers, relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love-making, has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a 'fake.' [...] Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama, when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose.|$|E

2500|$|This time, Griffith's gamble {{paid off}} and he succeeded in {{establishing}} his printing works in Middle Abbey Street, {{across the street from}} the Freeman's Journal and the newspaper wholesalers Eason & Son. The financial health of the SFPP remained, however, extremely fragile as payments for debentures trickled in over a six-year period. These sums came in <b>handy</b> <b>for</b> petty cash and to pay small bills but could not be used for any long-term investment. Griffith was therefore forced to make the daily newspaper as attractive as possible for the greatest number of readers, what might be called [...] "tabloidisation" [...] today. In contrast with the austerity of Griffith's previous publications, the Sinn Féin Daily was abundantly illustrated with cartoons, photographs and maps. We find large tables of national statistics, articles on industry or the language movement, and extracts from the Resurrection of Hungary side by side with descriptions of the latest Paris fashions, serialised novels and sensational news gleaned from the international press. It is a measure of Griffith's understanding of the market and his skill as an editor that the circulation of the two newspapers reached 64,515 during the month which followed the launch of the daily.|$|E

Reid also installed the world's first oil furnace in the new hotel, prompting a Los Angeles oil company to build tankers to carry the oil to Coronado.
