5|$|Van Peebles {{began to}} develop the film after being offered a three-picture {{contract}} for Columbia Pictures. No studio would finance the film, so Van Peebles funded the film himself, shooting it independently {{over a period of}} 19 days, performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several sex scenes, reportedly unsimulated. He received a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project. The film's fast-paced montages and jump-cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time. The picture was censored in some markets, and received mixed critical reviews. However, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> a lasting impression on African-American cinema.|$|E
5|$|The {{southwest}} monsoon {{arrives in}} two branches: the Bay of Bengal branch and the Arabian Sea branch. The latter extends towards a low-pressure area over the Thar Desert and is roughly three times {{stronger than the}} Bay of Bengal branch. The monsoon typically breaks over Indian territory by around 25 May, when it lashes the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It strikes the Indian mainland around 1 June near the Malabar Coast of Kerala. By 9 June, it reaches Mumbai; it appears over Delhi by 29 June. The Bay of Bengal branch, which initially tracks the Coromandal Coast northeast from Cape Comorin to Orissa, swerves to the northwest towards the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Arabian Sea branch moves northeast towards the Himalayas. By {{the first week of}} July, the entire country experiences monsoon rain; on average, South India receives more rainfall than North India. However, Northeast India receives the most precipitation. Monsoon clouds begin retreating from North India by the end of August; it withdraws from Mumbai by 5 October. As India further cools during September, the southwest monsoon weakens. By the end of November, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> the country.|$|E

25|$|Constructivist {{architecture}} {{was a form}} of Modern {{architecture that}} flourished in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s. It combined advanced technology and engineering with an avowedly Communist social purpose. Although it was divided into several competing factions, the movement produced many pioneering projects and finished buildings, before falling out of favour around 1932. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> marked effects on later developments in architecture.|$|E

500|$|The {{plastic surgery}} used to {{reconstruct}} Smith's face following his crash in the Western Desert in 1943 left his face somewhat lopsided, with partial paralysis. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn {{writes that the}} grafted skin on his face [...] "almost hides the injuries even today, though <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> him with a slightly blank expression". This was often commented on by observers, and when Smith died in 2007, it was prominent in many of his obituaries. [...] "It was Ian Smith's war-damaged left eye that drew people's attention first," [...] began the report printed in the London Times: [...] "wide open, heavy-lidded and impassive from experimental plastic surgery, it hinted at a dull, characterless nature. The other was narrow, slanting and slightly hooded. Being watched by it was an uncomfortable experience. Each eye could have belonged to a different person." [...] The Daily Telegraph took a similar line, reporting that the operation to reconstruct Smith's face had [...] "left him with a somewhat menacing stare".|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 13thcentury and during the {{following}} century the chapel in the south transept {{was replaced by a}} grander two-chambered chapel.

After the status of the foundation was elevated from a priory to an abbey, a tower house was added to the west range. This is shown on the engraving by the Buck brothers, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> little in the way of archaeological remains. The church was extended by the addition of a north aisle. There is little evidence of later major alterations before the dissolution. There is evidence to suggest that the cloister was rebuilt, and that alterations were made to the east range.|$|E

500|$|The World Trade Center {{bombing in}} New York City in February 1993 had caused {{bankruptcy}} in 40% {{of the affected}} companies within {{two years of the}} attack, according to a report from analysts IDC. As a result of the Baltic Exchange and Bishopsgate bomb attacks, City-based companies were well-prepared to deal with the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001, with a spokesman for the Corporation of London stating: [...] "After the IRA bombs, firms redoubled their disaster recovery plans and the City recovered remarkably quickly. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> the City pretty well-prepared for this sort of thing now." [...] The initial estimate of £1 billion worth of damage was later downgraded, and the total cost of reconstruction was £350 million. The subsequent payouts by insurance companies resulted in them suffering heavy losses causing a crisis in the industry, including the near-collapse of the Lloyd's of London market. A government-backed insurance scheme, Pool Re, was subsequently introduced in Britain, with the government acting as a [...] "re-insurer of last resort" [...] for losses over £75 million.|$|E

2500|$|In {{southern}} England, {{where the}} climate is mild and the hills low, transhumance historically took the opposite form to more mountainous areas. Cattle were grazed on dry, sandy heath on the hills in winter and in the rich, low-lying flood-meadows (also called water meadows) in summer, once flood-water receded[...] The Weald, as another example, was used [...] for the grazing of pigs; a use known as pannage.

2500|$|He {{is quick}} to add however, {{that it would be}} presumptuous to {{conclude}} that writing alone determined the course of civilizations.

[...] "We are apt to overlook the significance of the spoken word," [...] he writes, [...] "and to forget that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>left</b> little tangible remains." [...] For Innis, this tendency poses a problem. [...] "It is scarcely possible for generations disciplined in the written and the printed tradition to appreciate the oral tradition." [...] Therefore, the media biases of one civilization make understanding other peoples difficult, if not impossible.|$|E
