40|$|Systemic {{thrombolysis}} with recombinant {{tissue plasminogen}} activator (rt-PA), streptokinase or urokinase is considered as high-risk treatment in pregnancy. However, several reports have described the successful use of systemic thrombolysis in pregnant patients with massive pulmonary embolism and haemodynamic instability. Case: We describe a 34 -year old, pregnant female, who presented at 25 weeks of gestation with an acute collapse with reduced consciousness and shortness of breath caused by massive pulmonary embolism. Because of significant haemodynamic instability, increased right ventricular pressure and no improvement after intravenous heparin, thrombolytic therapy was administered. The response to thrombolytic therapy was excellent. No severe haemorrhagic complications were observed. Anticoagulant therapy with LMWH was continued until delivery. A healthy child was born at term. Review: In English literature, 13 patients received thrombolysis during pregnancy because of pulmonary embolism. No maternal deaths, four non-fatal maternal major bleeding complications, 30. 8 %; 95 %CI(9. 1 - 61. 4), two fetal deaths, 15. 4 %; 95 %CI(1. 9 - 45. 5), and five preterm deliveries, 38. 5 %; 95 %CI(13. 9 - 68. 4), were observed. Surgical <b>embolectomy</b> and <b>catheter</b> <b>embolectomy</b> or <b>catheter</b> thrombolysis has only been performed in 12 patients. Conclusion: The number of reports on thrombolytic therapy, surgical <b>embolectomy</b> and <b>catheter</b> <b>embolectomy</b> or thrombolysis for massive pulmonary embolism during pregnancy are limited. We suggest an international registry for pregnant patients undergoing thrombolysis or embolectomy to gain more information about these treatment options. Nevertheless, complication rates of thrombolytic therapy are acceptable {{in the light of}} the underlying disease, and in the meantime, current data do not justify withholding pregnant women from thrombolytic therapy in case of life-threatening PE.

40|$|Background: Arterial occlusions {{are divided}} as acute and chronic. Emboli {{is the most}} common cause of acute {{arterial}} occlusion, which is treated by perforating <b>embolectomy</b> using fogarty <b>catheter.</b> Some of these cases that are not diagnosed in early phase of the disease (within the first month), should be treated using open surgical techniques, since <b>embolectomy</b> via fogarty <b>catheter</b> is not effective in such instances.

40|$|AbstractDistal {{embolization}} is a {{complication of}} aortoiliac aneurysm repair. Fluoroscopy-assisted catheter thromboembolectomy {{is useful in}} removing popliteal and tibial emboli from the femoral approach. Concomitant presence of aortoiliac and popliteal aneurysms, a known association, may present a difficult challenge to embolus extraction. Currently available <b>embolectomy</b> <b>catheters</b> large enough for thrombus extraction from a popliteal aneurysm are too large for safe tibial artery cannulation, and tibial balloon catheters cannot be enlarged sufficiently to transfer the thrombus through the aneurysmal popliteal segment. We treated a patient who embolized to his popliteal aneurysm and distal tibial circulation following aortoiliac aneurysm repair. A fluoroscopy-assisted dual-catheter technique was used to extract the thrombus through the femoral approach, {{eliminating the need for}} direct popliteal or tibial exploration. This technique uses two balloon catheters of graduated size, maneuvered concurrently under fluoroscopic guidance into the tibial and popliteal circulation. The smaller tibial catheter is inflated, and thrombus is withdrawn into the popliteal segment. The larger popliteal balloon catheter is then inflated distal to the smaller catheter, and both catheters are withdrawn simultaneously to deliver the clot through the femoral arteriotomy. This technique can be useful for successful balloon catheter extraction of thrombus via remote access, in an arterial system with variable diameter, eliminating the need for direct popliteal or tibial exploration.

40|$|Background—Acute massive {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) carries an exceptionally high mortality rate. We explored how often adjunctive therapies, particularly thrombolysis and inferior vena caval (IVC) filter placement, were performed {{and how these}} therapies affected the clinical outcome of patients with massive PE. Methods and Results—Among 2392 patients with acute PE and known systolic arterial blood pressure at presentation, from the International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism Registry (ICOPER), 108 (4. 5 %) had massive PE, defined as a systolic arterial pressure 90 mm Hg, and 2284 (95. 5 %) had non–massive PE with a systolic arterial pressure 90 mm Hg. PE was first diagnosed at autopsy in 16 patients (15 %) with massive PE and in 29 patients (1 %) with non–massive PE (P 0. 001). The 90 -day mortality rates were 52. 4 % (95 % CI, 43. 3 % to 62. 1 %) and 14. 7 % (95 % CI, 13. 3 % to 16. 2 %), respectively. In-hospital bleeding complications occurred in 17. 6 % versus 9. 7 % and recurrent PE within 90 days in 12. 6 % and 7. 6 %, respectively (P 0. 001). In patients with massive PE, thrombolysis, surgical <b>embolectomy,</b> or <b>catheter</b> <b>embolectomy</b> were withheld in 73 (68 %). Thrombolysis was performed in 33 patients, surgical embolectomy in 3, and <b>catheter</b> <b>embolectomy</b> in 1. Thrombolytic therapy did not reduce 90 -day mortality (thrombolysis, 46. 3 %; 95 % CI, 31. 0 % to 64. 8 %; no thrombolysis, 55. 1 %; 95 % CI, 44. 3 % to 66. 7 %; hazard ratio, 0. 79; 95 % CI, 0. 44 to 1. 43). Recurrent PE rates at 90 days were similar in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy (12 % for both; P 0. 99).

40|$|Acute massive {{pulmonary}} embolism after cardiac surgery is very rare. Although accurate diagnosis and rapid treatment {{are crucial to}} a successful outcome, there is no standard treatment option.

40|$|This review {{provides}} meta-analytic data {{of studies}} aiming at improved treatment of {{deep vein thrombosis}} and pulmonary embolism. The introduction of low molecular weight heparin has considerably ameliorated the initial treatment of deep vein thrombosis, and should now {{be regarded as the}} treatment of choice for most patients with deep vein thrombosis. Oral anticoagulant treatment is presently considered safe and effective for the long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism, provided that the INR is maintained at 2. 0 - 3. 0. However, the optimal duration as well as the optimal intensity of anticoagulation have still to be determined. Patients with submassive pulmonary embolism should presently be treated with adjusted dose unfractionated heparin and coumarins. Studies determining the efficacy and safety of low molecular weight heparin in this condition deserve priority. Thrombolytic therapy should be restricted to patients with massive pulmonary embolism, unless safer methods of thrombolysis have been developed.

40|$|Persistent sciatic artery (PSA) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} malformation.

40|$|Massive {{pulmonary}} embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition {{with a high}} early mortality rate due to acute right ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, an IV bolus of unfractionated heparin should be administered.

Many patients with massive PE cannot receive thrombolysis because of an increased bleeding risk, such as prior surgery, trauma, or cancer. In these patients, <b>catheter</b> or surgical <b>embolectomy</b> are helpful for rapidly reversing right ventricular failure.
