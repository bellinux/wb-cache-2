2500|$|The {{original}} Ducellier alternator {{supplied with}} the early production DMC-12s could not provide enough current to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the battery would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted <b>door</b> <b>jamb</b> switches. This switch activated the [...] "safety" [...] lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, further draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner Johnny Carson shortly after he was presented with the vehicle. Later cars were fitted from the factory with a higher output Motorola alternator which solved this problem. This also is believed [...] to be the reason behind the improvement in the sound quality of the horn. Earlier models emitted a weak sound, not loud or strong enough {{to be effective in}} normal traffic.|$|E
6000|$|A {{few days}} passed, {{and no one}} came to the {{dwelling}} of the wizard; and as such an absence of customers was very unusual, Jeremy began to fear that the supernatural stranger had not forgotten his threat. On {{the evening of the}} fifth day he crept into the little town to purchase some articles of food. Previously, whenever he had had occasion to make a similar journey, as he passed along the street the children ran away in terror, and the older people addressed him with remarkable humility; but this time, as he stepped rapidly past the houses, the youngsters went on with their games as though only an ordinary mortal went by, and a burly fellow who was leaning against a <b>door</b> <b>jamb</b> took his pipe from his mouth to cry familiarly-- ...|$|E

"I see Mrs. Gerrish has {{got here}} first," [...] Mrs. Munger said, {{indicating}} the perambulator at the door, and she dismounted and fastened her pony with a weight, which she took {{from the front}} of the phaeton. On either <b>door</b> <b>jamb</b> of the store was a curved plate of polished metal, with the name GERRISH cut into it in black letters; the sills of the wide windows were of metal, and bore the same legend. At the threshold a very prim, ceremonious little man, spare and straight, met Mrs. Munger with a ceremonious bow, and a solemn [...] "How do you do, ma'am I how do you do? I hope I see you well," [...] and he put a small dry hand into the ample clasp of Mrs. Munger's gauntlet.|$|E
60|$|Johnny Atwood lay {{stretched}} {{upon the}} grass in the undress uniform of a Carib, and prated feebly of cool water to be had in the cucumber-wood pumps of Dalesburg. Dr. Gregg, through the prestige of his whiskers and as a bribe against the relation of his imminent professional tales, was conceded the hammock that was swung between the <b>door</b> <b>jamb</b> and a calabash-tree. Keogh had moved out upon the grass a little table that held the instrument for burnishing completed photographs. He was the only busy one of the group. Industriously from between the cylinders of the burnisher rolled the finished depictments of Coralio's citizens. Blanchard, the French mining engineer, in his cool linen viewed the smoke of his cigarette through his calm glasses, impervious to the heat. Clancy sat on the steps, smoking his short pipe. His mood was the gossip's; the others were reduced, by the humidity, {{to the state of}} disability desirable in an audience.|$|E

A semi-cylindrical drum, carved directly above the central panel, was used in imitation of the reed-mat that was used to close real doors.|$|R

50|$|A doorjamb, <b>door</b> <b>jamb</b> (also {{sometimes}} doorpost) is {{the vertical}} {{portion of the}} door frame onto which a door is secured.
