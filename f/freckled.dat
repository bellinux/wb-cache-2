5|$|Henry {{was said}} by chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, <b>freckled,</b> {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky body and was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work the {{influence}} of process parameters on <b>freckle</b> formation in superalloy CMSX- 4 is demonstrated. A series of experiments were carried out using a laboratory furnace of Bridgman-type in which the temperature gradient G and solidification velocity V can be precisely controlled and individually varied over a wide range. On the etched surface and longitudinal sections of the quenched samples the formation and evolution of <b>freckles</b> were investigated. The initiation position of the <b>freckles</b> within the mushy zone was then determined. Based on the experimental observations a complete diagram was plotted to indicate the probability of <b>freckle</b> occurrence which is related to solidification parameters G and V. In this <b>freckling</b> map the <b>freckle</b> region is delimited by different criteria. <b>Freckles</b> arise only within a certain G/V-range for columnar dendrite growth; otherwise the solidification structure changes into cellular or equiaxed structure, depending on whether G/V-value increases or decreases. In comparison with the well-known <b>freckling</b> map of Copley et al., some new freckle-free regions are proposed. It {{is interesting to note}} that the <b>freckle</b> formation is also suppressed at very low cooling rates. In addition, the initiation position of the <b>freckle</b> formation in the mushy region was determined to be less than 2 mm below the dendrite tip of the solidification front...|$|R

25|$|Kangaroo Island {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of the vulnerable fairy tern, the near threatened bush stone-curlew, hooded plover and western whipbird, and the biome-restricted rock parrot and purple-gaped honeyeater. It also supports over 1% of the world populations of Cape Barren geese, black-faced cormorants, Pacific gulls and pied oystercatchers, and sometimes of musk ducks, blue-billed ducks, <b>freckled</b> ducks, Australian shelducks, chestnut teals and banded stilts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Freckle</b> {{occurrence}} {{is known}} to be dependent on the casting size and the superalloy components with large cross section are more prone to <b>freckle</b> formation. In our directional solidification experiment of superalloys <b>freckles</b> are observed in some thin samples, while some significantly thicker samples in the same shell mould cluster remain <b>freckle</b> free. The EBSD analysis shows that the samples with <b>freckles</b> have a good axial orientation, while in <b>freckle</b> free samples the primary dendrite stems diverge from the sample axis. In an analogue system the flow behaviour through a mushy zone was simulated, in which the dendrite network was placed in different orientation. The dendrite array shows the lowest resistance to the vertical melt flow. As the dendrite alignment diverges from orientation, the flow speed slows down and reaches the minimum at the orientation. This orientation effect of the interdendritic permeability explains well why the crystal orientation plays such {{an important role in the}} occurrence of <b>freckles</b> in superalloy castings. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|<b>Freckles</b> {{are not a}} skin disorder, {{but people}} with <b>freckles</b> {{generally}} have a lower concentration of photo-protective melanin, {{and are therefore more}} susceptible to the harmful effects of UV radiation. It is suggested that people whose skin tends to <b>freckle</b> should avoid overexposure to sun and use sunscreen.|$|R
40|$|<b>Freckles</b> are {{numerous}} pigmented macules {{on the face}} commonly occurring in the Caucasian and Chinese population. As <b>freckling</b> is {{considered as an independent}} trait, no gene or locus for it has been identified to date. Here we performed genome-wide scan for linkage analysis in a multigeneration Chinese family with <b>freckles.</b> A maximum LOD score of 4. 26 at a recombination fraction of 0 has been obtained with marker D 4 S 1566. Haplotype analysis localized the <b>freckles</b> locus to a 16 Mbp region flanked by D 4 S 2952 and D 4 S 1607. We have thus mapped the gene for <b>freckles</b> to chromosome 4 q 32 –q 34. This will aid future identification of the responsible gene, which will be very useful for the understanding of the molecular mechanism of <b>freckles...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of regions of alternating pigmented and unpigmented skin may not definitively suggest the leopard gene. They {{may not be}} visible due {{to the effects of}} other genes. For example, extensive white markings on the face may mask the {{presence of}} mottling around the eyes and muzzle, and white markings on the legs often end in white hooves. Furthermore, other genes may produce similar conditions: white sclera are associated with broad white face markings, striped hooves with the Silver dapple gene, and <b>freckled</b> skin with the Champagne gene.|$|E

40|$|<b>Freckle</b> defects usually {{appear on}} the surface of {{castings}} and industrial ingots during the directional solidification process {{and most of them are}} located near the interface between the shell mold and superalloys. Ceramic cores create more interfaces in the directionally solidified (DS) and single crystal (SX) hollow turbine blades. In order to investigate the location of <b>freckle</b> occurrence in superalloys, superalloy CM 247 LC was directionally solidified in an industrial-sized Bridgman furnace. Instead of ceramic cores, Alumina tubes were used inside of the casting specimens. It was found that <b>freckles</b> occur not only on the casting external surfaces, but also appear near the internal interfaces between the ceramic core and superalloys. Meanwhile, the size, initial position, and area of <b>freckle</b> were investigated in various diameters of the specimens. The initial position of the <b>freckle</b> chain reduces when the diameter of the rods increase. <b>Freckle</b> area follows a linear relationship in various diameters and the average <b>freckle</b> fraction is 1. 1 % of cross sectional area of casting specimens. The flow of liquid metal near the interfaces was stronger than that in the interdendritic region in the mushy zone, and explained why <b>freckle</b> tends to occur on the outer or inner surfaces of castings. This new phenomenon suggests that <b>freckles</b> are more likely to occur on the outer or inner surfaces of the hollow turbine blades...|$|R

500|$|In 1942 Blyton {{released}} {{the first book}} in the Mary Mouse series, Mary Mouse and the Dolls' House, about a mouse exiled from her mousehole who becomes a maid at a dolls' house. Twenty-three books in the series were produced between 1942 and 1964; 10,000 copies were sold in 1942 alone. The same year, Blyton published the first novel in the Famous Five series, Five on a Treasure Island, with illustrations by Eileen Soper. Its popularity resulted in twenty-one books between then and 1963, and the characters of Julian, Dick, Anne, George (Georgina) and Timmy the dog became household names in Britain. Matthew Grenby, author of Children's Literature, states that the five were involved with [...] "unmasking hardened villains and solving serious crimes", although the novels were [...] "hardly 'hard-boiled' thrillers". Blyton based the character of Georgina, a tomboy she described as [...] "short-haired, <b>freckled,</b> sturdy, and snub-nosed" [...] and [...] "bold and daring, hot-tempered and loyal", on herself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA 3 -D {{model of}} <b>freckle</b> (solute channel) {{formation}} at a microstructural level was coupled with in situ X-ray radiography {{to investigate the}} mechanisms of <b>freckle</b> initiation and growth. The model predictions for solute partitioning, diffusion and convection were validated via in situ X-ray radiographic measurements in Ga– 25 wt. % In alloy, showing good agreement. Other key features, such as <b>freckle</b> channel width and critical Rayleigh number, also correlated well. The validated model was used to investigate <b>freckle</b> formation under a range of solidification conditions. Two distinct stages of <b>freckle</b> onset were observed, identified via the dendrite tip growth and solute profiles. The first stage corresponds to lower flow velocities with large fluctuations; in the second stage the velocities stabilize, with established recirculating flows forming solute channels. The influence of imperfections in dendritic morphology, such as grain boundaries and primary spacing variations, on the critical Rayleigh number was studied. It was found that that these features initiate <b>freckles.</b> Non-intuitively, converging grain boundaries were observed to have the greatest propensity for <b>freckle</b> formation. The resulting new insights on solute plume formation impact a range of phenomena from single-crystal superalloys to magma flows...|$|R
