5|$|Madagascar was an {{important}} transoceanic trading hub connecting ports of the Indian Ocean in the early centuries following human settlement.

European contact began in 1500, when the Portuguese sea captain Diogo Dias sighted the island. The French established trading posts along the east coast in the late 17th century.|$|E

The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes.

However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at a point where the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been forgotten and were viewed as powerful ancestors.|$|E

5|$|While H2 is {{not very}} {{reactive}} under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that {{is critical to the}} stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II in 1939, the GWR returned to direct government control, {{and by the end}} of the war a Labour government was in power and again planning to nationalise the railways. After a couple of years trying to recover from the ravages of war, the GWR became the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948. The Great Western Railway Company continued to exist as a legal entity for nearly two more years, being formally wound up on 23 December 1949. GWR designs of locomotives and rolling stock continued to be built for a while and the region maintained its own distinctive character, even painting for a while its stations and express trains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> of chocolate and cream.|$|E
