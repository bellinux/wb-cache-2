The show's creators were acutely aware of educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and <b>educational</b> <b>content,</b> as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E
5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics with <b>educational</b> <b>content.</b> Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E

In this paper, we analyzed previous m-Learning scenarios and future technology prospects. Based on the proposed m-Learning scenario, we designed cellular phone-based <b>educational</b> <b>contents</b> and service structure, implemented m-Learning system, and analyzed m-Learning service satisfaction. The design principles of the m-Learning service are 1) to provide learners with m-Learning environment with both cellular phones and desktop computers; 2) to serve announcements, discussion boards, Q&A boards, course materials, and exercises on cellular phones and desktop computers; and 3) to serve learning activities like the reviewing of full lectures, discussions, and writing term papers using desktop computers and cellular phones.

500|$|Seductive {{details are}} often used in textbooks, lectures, slideshows, {{and other forms of}} <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> to make a course more {{interesting}} or interactive. Seductive details can take the form of text, photos, illustrations, sounds or music and are by definition: (1) interesting and (2) not directed toward the learning objectives of a lesson. [...] John Dewey, in 1913, first referred to this as “fictitious inducements to attention.” While illustrated text can enhance comprehension, illustrations that are not relevant can lead to poor learning outcomes. Since the late 1980s, many studies in the field of educational psychology have shown that the addition of seductive details results in poorer retention of information and transfer of learning. Thalheimer conducted a meta-analysis that found, overall, a negative impact for the inclusion of seductive details such as text, photos or illustrations, and sounds or music in learning content. This reduction to learning is called the seductive details effect. Recently, there have been many criticisms of this theory. Critics cite unconvincing and contradictory evidence to argue that seductive details do not always impede understanding and that seductive details can sometimes be motivating for learners.|$|E

She held the show {{partly responsible for}} the declining verbal abilities of American students, and accused the show of affirming negative stereotypes about women. According to Hymowitz, the show's creators discouraged children's natural curiosity about the world. She criticized the show for, instead of transforming television, being [...] "devoured" [...] by it. She took issue with its use of cultural references, stating that the show taught young children to embrace the negative values of commercialism, celebrity, and anti-intellectualism. She insisted that by using television's production values, the producers of Sesame Street emphasized their [...] "jazzy medium" [...] more than the <b>educational</b> <b>content</b> they were supposed to convey. Hymowitz took issue with the show's educational claims, stating that Sesame Street diminished young children's readiness for reading by limiting their abilities to engage in analytical and creative thinking.
