The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 {{in response to an}} imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown participatory budgeting system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity <b>Governance</b> <b>Scheme.</b> In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the project <b>governance</b> <b>scheme</b> in the Polish road sector. It {{is based on the}} case study of the project of the {{expressway}} S- 7 realized in northern Poland. The aim of this research was to present Polish road sector scheme and to analyse it with basis on the implemented project. To provide investigation properly, a literature study was performed as well as a definition of the road sector scheme based on guidelines and law acts. Based on the research, significant strengths and weaknesses were identified. The most important weaknesses were found to be, firstly, a too large number of actors in decision-making process, and secondly, slighting of the economic values. The most important strengths were found to be, firstly, a very accurate supervision of environmental impact, and secondly, the self-control of the General Directorate of National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA). The thesis had many limitations what encourages to further research. The biggest limitation was difficulties with obtaining accurate data adopted to the analysis for project. The thesis offers two main possible ways for further research. The first consist in advancing deeper into an analysis of the road sector. The other consist in the possibility of an analysis of other sectors and, based on a comparative approach, trying to propose measures with the intention of creating a general national project <b>governance</b> <b>scheme</b> for Poland. On basis of the thesis, some suggestions were formulated based on identified European practices. Examples of these are, reducing the number of participants involved into the scheme, and addressing economic issues in more detail. This thesis should contribute real value for Polish scientists, who are interested in project governance, and international society of scientists by presenting Polish project <b>governance</b> <b>scheme</b> in road sector...|$|E

40|$|International administrations {{are a very}} {{specific}} form of statebuilding architecture. In the course of six months, the international community proceeded to create two international administrations encompassing legislative, judicial and executive power – in Kosovo and Timor-Leste in 1999. With a specific focus on Kosovo, this paper claims that the limits of this <b>governance</b> <b>scheme</b> lie in {{the very nature of}} the mandate. Placed in the situation of a de facto government of Kosovo, the international administration has to face the same requirements that any legitimate government has. Even more complicated was the fact that there were no check-and-balances included in the international framework, granting the international administration with full authority in terms of governance. International administrators found themselves in a ‘legitimacy dilemma:’ everything they do to reinforce their rule actually perpetuates their weakness. Its legitimacy waning, the state-building agenda put forth by the international administrations came to be seen as more exogenous, reinforcing the delegitimization process. This paper attempts to shed light on the specific issues of this <b>governance</b> <b>scheme,</b> while trying in turn to understand the limits of the orthodox conception of statebuilding. This paper will specifically address the influence of the Weberian approach to legitimacy on the statebuilding literature as well as its limits. It will also attempt to chart other possible avenues for statebuilding, more in line with a wider understanding of legitimacy and intervention...|$|E

However, the importance of pension <b>scheme</b> <b>governance</b> has recently been realised and many companies are now trying to manage the risks that are inherent in their occupational pension schemes. Consequently, academic interest in the subject has also begun to increase and this paper will look at this burgeoning field of pension <b>scheme</b> <b>governance.</b> However, this paper has a radically different approach to the subject than the previous, more quantitative, research in that it will follow a qualitative research methodology of semi-structured interviews followed by an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis of these interviews, which has previously not been undertaken. The aim of this research was to identify and understand the different experiences of pension <b>scheme</b> <b>governance</b> that exist in the pensions industry. Different experiences of pension <b>scheme</b> <b>governance</b> were found to exist in the pensions industry and these differences largely related to whether the research participant had experience of large or small pension schemes. What this research indicates is that there are many variances in the operation of pension <b>scheme</b> <b>governance</b> in practice with most of the best practices occurring with larger pension schemes, due to the impracticalities of these taking place on smaller pension schemes. Thus, this research suggests other governance mechanisms that could well be utilised by smaller pension schemes to improve their standards of governance. These mechanisms include: governance audits; codes of practice; and professional independent trustees. This research also indicates that it may well be useful for a review comparable to that conducted by Derek Higgs, on non-executive directors in public companies, to be conducted on the role and effectiveness of independent professional trustees in ensuring the good <b>governance</b> of pension <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

During {{the last}} decade, {{we have seen}} the emergence, under the auspices of non-state authorities, of market-driven <b>governance</b> <b>schemes</b> for {{certification}} of forest holdings and eco-labelling of wood products. Do these schemes affect actual management practices and envi-ronmental protection in forestry? This article examines the effectiveness of forest certification in Norway and Sweden – two ecologically and politically similar countries, but with different certification schemes. It is found that certification processes in both countries have resulted in high participation in certification schemes, high market penetration by certified forest or-ganisations, and reduced conflict prevalence over forestry practices. Although forest certifi-cation seems to have modified on-the-ground practices in ways that lead to less environmental deterioration of forests, we still know too little about forest certification’s environmental impact and efficacy as a problem-solving instrument. More research is therefore urged in these areas...|$|R

Considering that TGSs mainly address issues of public concern, the general public represents a major source of legitimacy in transnational governance. We theorize how members of the general public, whom we conceptualize as intuiters, apply heuristics to bestow legitimacy on TGSs. Given the difficulty of assessing TGSs, we argue that intuiters draw on affect-based responses towards a TGS's better-known network affiliates, such as participating business firms, to judge the legitimacy of the TGS as a whole. This substitution produces a “vertical” legitimacy spillover. More specifically, we examine the heuristic process of judgment underlying vertical spillovers in TGSs and derive implications for the legitimacy construct and the analysis of spillover phenomena...|$|R
