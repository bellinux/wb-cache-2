40|$|The Navigation Rules Expert System (NRES) is a CLIPS-based {{implementation}} of the International and <b>Inland</b> <b>Maritime</b> Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M 16672. 2 C) to assist mariners. NRES functionality {{is divided into two}} components, the Mariner-Assistance Module and the Student-Tutor Module. The Mariner-Assistance Module (MAM) is designed for use in real-time operations to assist mariners in correctly determining both the maritime situation and the necessary action(s) to be taken in accordance with the International and <b>Inland</b> <b>Maritime</b> Navigation Rules. In practice, NRES could double-check navigation decisions and issue warnings when the possibility of accidents arises; while some human judgment will always be necessary in this task, it could well be useful on the bridge to have a different and dispassionate point of view. The Student-Tutor Module (STM) is designed to train students in the understanding and application of the International and <b>Inland</b> <b>Maritime</b> Navigation Rules in order to strengthen maritime navigation situational decision-making. The STM utilizes the NRES CLIPS rules database as the source from which the tutor questions are drawn and employs audio and visual cueing information derived from th...|$|R
