25|$|One {{persistent}} rumor {{was especially}} prevalent in Europe; fake news circulated that Shirley {{was not a}} child but a 30-year-old dwarf {{due in part to}} her stocky body type. The rumor was so prevalent that the Vatican dispatched Father Silvio Massante to investigate if she were indeed a child. The fact that she never seemed to miss any teeth led some people to conclude that she had all her adult teeth. Temple was actually losing her teeth regularly through her days with 20th Century Fox, most notably during the sidewalk ceremony in front of Grauman's Theatre, where she took off her shoes and placed <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> in the cement to take attention away from her face. When acting, she wore dental plates and caps to hide the gaps in her teeth. Another rumor pertaining to her teeth was the idea that they were filed to make them appear like baby teeth.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010 as the Jets were {{preparing}} for the playoffs, a foot fetish video of woman appearing to be Ryan's wife Michelle surfaced on various internet outlets. The video features a clothed Michelle having <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> handled and commented on by an unseen camera operator with a voice similar to Rex's. The Jets released a press statement saying that Ryan and the organization considered the situation a private matter and would provide no comment. Multiple media reports soon linked the Ryans to a user profile named [...] "ihaveprettyfeet" [...] on a site for alternative sexual lifestyles, and more videos of Michelle emerged in the following months. In September 2015, a photo of Ryan surfaced of him {{sitting at his desk}} with a framed photo of a person's feet behind him.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Cautionary Tales", Elle {{comes back}} to the United States. Former Company {{employee}} Noah Bennet captures Elle for collateral, as Bob had captured his daughter, Claire. He ties Elle's hands to a chair and ties <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> together and puts them in a metal dog bath which is full with water. Elle tries to use her abilities while in the dog bath, but she shocks herself. During this time, Noah tells Elle that Bob allowed the Company to perform tests on her which had begun as early as the age of seven. This included subjecting her to high doses of electricity, which scarred her emotionally for life. Elle has no recollection of the tests, and Noah suggests the Haitian had a role in causing Elle to forget her experiences. After an agreement is made, she is reunited with Bob and Claire momentarily reunited with Noah. However, Elle attacks Claire and West as they leave. She tries to attack Noah, but he shoots Elle in the arm before she can hurt him or anyone else. As it seems Noah is going to kill Bob, Mohinder Suresh, a scientist working with Noah and the Company, shoots and kills Noah. Elle leaves with Bob and Mohinder, giving Bob a look of distrust.|$|E

60|$|The {{examination}} {{proved that}} <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot</b> was nearly two sizes wider {{and at least}} one size longer than the footprints in the flour. Furthermore, it needed but a glance for the jury, as well as the doctor, to prove that she had been going barefoot, as she claimed, for many weeks. Her foot was brown and her toes showed nothing of the close confinement of a pointed shoe.|$|R
2500|$|He {{has lived}} in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing Gypsy in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard {{a knock on the}} door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been keeping me awake all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, [...] "My guess is that she wanted to stand there in <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet,</b> suffering for her art".|$|E
2500|$|After {{starring}} in an HBO Half Hour Comedy Special, Griffin {{had her first}} consistent public exposure in 1996, when she was cast as the acerbic colleague of Brooke Shields' title character on the NBC sitcom Suddenly Susan. In 1998, Griffin starred in her first one-hour special, HBO's Kathy Griffin: A Hot Cup of Talk. She honed a comedy and television career that poked fun at her relatively modest place in the Hollywood hierarchy in a self-deprecating manner. She frequently appears in such self-consciously tacky projects as the reality show competition Celebrity Mole Hawaii, in which she won the 2003 edition after undergoing such experiences as walking over hot lava with <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> She identifies her victory as the moment she became a [...] "D-list" [...] celebrity.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the liberation}} of Paris in 1944, the American {{journalist}} Ernie Pyle observed that the women were all [...] "brightly dressed in white or red blouses and colourful peasant skirts, with flowers in their hair and big flashy earrings." [...] while Lady Diana Cooper, whose husband, Duff Cooper, became British Ambassador to Paris that year, wrote that, during the occupation, Parisienne women had worn [...] "grotesquely large hats hung with flowers and fruits and feathers and ribbons" [...] as well as high carved wooden shoes. However, in contrast to such striking bohemian adornments and subsequently the [...] "New Look" [...] (which itself scandalised some Parisennes), the clothes of the post-war bohemians were predominantly black: when Gréco first performed outside Saint-Germain she affronted some of her audience by wearing [...] "black trousers, <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> slipped into golden sandals". In old age she claimed that this style of dress arose from poverty: ...|$|E

60|$|Opposite to him {{sits the}} Story Girl, with her scarlet rosetted head, <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> crossed before <b>her,</b> one slender hand propping her high, white brow, {{on either side}} of which fall her glossy curls.|$|R
60|$|Dea Flavia {{could not}} now have moved, {{even if she}} would. <b>Her</b> small <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> seemed glued to the cold mosaic of the floor, her hand seemed {{fastened}} with clamps of steel to the curtain which it clutched.|$|R
2500|$|Detective Ron Phillips {{testified that}} when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, Simpson sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Detective Tom Lange testified that Brown was {{probably}} killed first because the soles of <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> were clean, implying that she was struck {{down to the ground}} before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Detective Lange, Cochran proposed two hypotheses for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one, or more, drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted cocaine abuser. In the second hypothesis, Cochran suggested that [...] "an assassin, or assassins," [...] followed Goldman to the South Bundy house to kill him.|$|E
60|$|I turned about. Miss Croyden was {{standing}} behind me. She had, so I argued, removed her stockings and {{was standing}} in <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet.</b> There is something, I am free to confess, about a woman in <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet</b> which hits me where I live. With instinctive feminine taste the girl had twined a piece of seaweed in her hair. Seaweed, as a rule, gets me every time. But I checked myself.|$|E

He slewed himself round and clawed <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot.</b> If you'd just seen the look she gave him you'd know whether she was a witch or not. And she went off down the lane, muttering and throwing her hands round, just like she did in Lem Hill's cow pasture. She put a spell on Pat, that's what she did. He was sick the next morning." ...|$|R

60|$|Her {{room was}} a little rough-plastered garret room, with an eastern window, and at last she saw the yellow light inter-filtrate the dark-blue of the eastern sky, and she rose and pattered about in <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet,</b> while she put up her hair like a woman and slipped on her underskirt, stiff with starch, and then her dress, with its {{open-work}} sleeves and ruche of lace, threaded with blue ribbon. She moved about on <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>feet,</b> rejoicing in the crisp rustle of her new clothing, and put on her wide hat with its hectic rose-buds and paris-green thick leaves.

50|$|The Stooges are stowaways on a boxcar {{headed for}} Hollywood (to be exact, a {{furniture}} consignment to Hollywood). Fully expecting {{for no good}} reason to get a job and become movie stars, and dressed for the occasion, the Stooges sneak into a movie studio - where they are mistaken for three new executives who are due to take over the facility. Given the authority, they promptly abuse it and take over the production of a movie set in hopes of shooting a blockbuster movie. Curly gets off on the wrong foot when, unable to light his match for a smoke, spots an actress receiving a pedicure (silent star Mildred Harris). He then strikes the match on the sole of <b>her</b> <b>bare</b> <b>foot,</b> startling <b>her.</b> Angered, she is about to storm off the set until the trio convince her to stay.
