These inorganic pollutants are highly toxic {{because they are not}} biodegradable; thus, researches are going on for decades to find some methods to adsorb metal ions from aqueous solution. Among them, chromium has become a serious health concern because it causes many severe diseases. Strong exposure to Cr(VI) causes cancer in the digestive tract and may cause epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, severe diarrhoea, and haemorrhage (Mohanty et al. 2005). Chromium is one of the contaminants, which exist in hexavalent [Cr(VI)] and also in the trivalent form [Cr(III)] (Rao et al. 2015). Chromium and its compounds are widely used in many industries such as metal finishing, dyeing, pigments, inks, glass, ceramics, tanning, textile, wood preserving, <b>electroplating,</b> <b>steel</b> fabrication, and canning industries (Rao et al. 2015). Chromium (VI) is more toxic to human physiology because of its mutagenic and carcinogenic properties, which may even lead to death (Rao et al. 2015). The chromate (CrO 2 − 4 [...]) and dichromate (Cr 2 O 2 − 7 [...]) forms of Cr(VI) are extremely hazardous (Eliodorio et al. 2017), and the maximum acceptable limit by various standards has been set (Uddin 2017). Permissible limits for Cr(VI) in drinking water (mg/L) according to various standards are very low: 0.050 (IS 10500) (FAD 25 : Drinking Water 2012), 0.050 (WHO) (Uddin 2017), 0.100 (EPA) (Uddin 2017), 0.050 (EU standard) (Wikipedia).|$|R
