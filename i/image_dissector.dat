In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents.

25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> {{camera tube}} {{transmitted}} its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently {{to hold a}} demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|In 1931, David Sarnoff of RCA {{offered to}} buy Farnsworth's patents for US$100,000, with the {{stipulation}} that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused. In June of that year, Farnsworth joined the Philco company and moved to Philadelphia {{along with his wife}} and two children. RCA would later file an interference suit against Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin's 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth's design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years with Sarnoff finally agreeing to pay Farnsworth royalties. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application; he also divided his original application in 1931, receiving a patent in 1935, while a second one was eventually issued in 1938 by the Court of Appeals on a non-Farnsworth-related interference case, and over the objection of the Patent Office.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin {{was also}} experimenting with the {{cathode ray tube}} to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an {{electronic}} camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary. Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, {{on the basis of}} Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application, he also divided his original application in 1931. Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application. In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.|$|E

40|$|Some of the {{information}} that as used in arriving at a design for a high quality image input device is documented. The device uses a PIN photo-diode directly coupled to an FET-input op-amp as the sensor and two moving-iron galvanometer-driven mirrors as the deflection system. The disadvantages of a system like this are its long random access time (about 4 milli-seconds) and the long settling time of the diode-amplifier system (about 1 milli-seconds). In almost all other respects such a sensor is superior to other known image sensors. Pictures taken with this device have shown that some of the difficulties experienced in image analysis can be directly traced to the low quality of images read in through vidicons and <b>image</b> <b>dissectors.</b> This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

50|$|Because only {{a limited}} number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain {{diameter}} became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal. The advancement of all-electronic television (including <b>image</b> <b>dissectors</b> and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.|$|R

40|$|A densidade mineral óssea (DMO) é o exame padrão-ouro para o diagnóstico da osteoporose. No entanto, sabe-se que apenas essa medida não é suficiente para identificar completamente a fragilidade óssea e o conseqüente risco de fratura, tornando-se necessário a investigação da estrutura óssea. OBJETIVOS: Avaliar se a característica de Euler-Poincaré (CEP) para analisar a conectividade do osso trabecular poderia fornecer um suporte adicional na identificação da deterioração da estrutura óssea. MATERIAIS E MÉTODOS: Analisou-se um conjunto de imagens formando disectors, obtidas da tomografia computadorizada de vértebras lombares, a partir dos quais foi estimada a característica Euler-Poincarè. (CEP). Para lidar com o processamento de imagens dos disectors, foi desenvolvido um programa de computador usando o GTK+ para MS-Windows. Os resultados foram comparados com a DMO. RESULTADOS: Verificou-se que a medida da CEP está correlacionada com os resultados obtidos por meio da DMO para as vértebras lombares. Ficou demonstrado também que a área de conectividade das trabéculas que é propagada ao longo dos disectors corrobora para assegurar que os resultados da CEP sejam consistentes com a medida da DMO. CONCLUSÕES: A aplicação da CEP na análise das tomografias vertebrais poderá vir a se constituir num método para avaliar a estrutura óssea trabecular, e sua correlação com a resistência mecânica do osso, sendo necessários porém mais estudos para confirmar esses dados. The {{bone mineral}} density (BMD) is the gold {{standard}} test for the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate if the Euler-Poincaré characteristic (EPC) for the analysis of the connectivity of the trabecular bone could supply an additional support in identifying the deterioration of the bone structure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of <b>images</b> forming <b>dissectors</b> were analyzed, obtained from the computerized tomography of the lumbar vertebrae, from which the Euler-Poincarè characteristic (EPC) was estimated. To deal with the processing of <b>images</b> of the <b>dissectors,</b> a computer program was developed using the GTK+ for MS-Windows. The results were compared to the BMD. RESULTS: It was verified that the measurement of the EPC is correlated with the results obtained by means of the BMD for the lumbar vertebrae. It was also demonstrated that the area of connectivity of the trabecular that is propagated over the dissectors corroborates to ensure that the results of the EPC are consistent with the BMD measurement. CONCLUSIONS: The application of ECP in the analysis of the vertebral tomographies could constitute a method to evaluate the trabecular bone structure, and its correlation with the mechanical resistance of the bone, however being necessary more studies to confirm this data...|$|R
2500|$|In 1933 RCA {{introduced}} an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was {{claimed to be}} much more sensitive than Farnsworth's <b>image</b> <b>dissector.</b> However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> through the invention of a completely unique [...] "multipactor" [...] device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931. This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Vladimir Zworykin, who {{had been}} {{developing}} his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923, but which {{he had never been}} able to make work or satisfactorily demonstrate to his superiors, was recruited by RCA to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth's laboratory and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. But Zworykin later abandoned research on the <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector,</b> which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects to be effective, and turned his attention to what would become the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, [...] "Farnsworth was closer to this thing you're using now [...] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn't have the mosaic , he didn't have storage. Therefore, [...] definition was very low.... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method." [...] Contrary to Zworykin's statement, Farnsworth's patent #2,087,683 for the <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> (filed April 26, 1933) features the [...] "charge storage plate" [...] invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a [...] "low velocity" [...] method of electron scanning, also describes [...] "discrete particles" [...] whose [...] "potential" [...] is manipulated and [...] "saturated" [...] to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth's patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a [...] "charge storage dissector" [...] and [...] "charge storage amplifier," [...] respectively.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German {{licensee}} company Telefunken. The [...] "image iconoscope" [...] ("Superikonoskop" [...] in Germany) was produced {{as a result}} of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the <b>image</b> <b>dissector,</b> having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958.|$|E
2500|$|Baird's {{television}} {{systems were}} replaced by the electronic television system developed by the newly formed company EMI-Marconi under Isaac Shoenberg, which had access to patents developed by Vladimir Zworykin and RCA. Similarly, Philo T. Farnsworth's electronic [...] "Image Dissector" [...] camera was available to Baird's company via a patent-sharing agreement. However, the <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> camera {{was found to be}} lacking in light sensitivity, requiring excessive levels of illumination. Baird used the Farnsworth tubes instead to scan cinefilm, in which capacity they proved serviceable though prone to drop-outs and other problems. Farnsworth himself came to London to Baird's Crystal Palace laboratories in 1936, but was unable to fully solve the problem; the fire that burned Crystal Palace to the ground later that year further hampered the Baird company's ability to compete.|$|E
2500|$|Farnsworth {{worked out}} the {{principle}} of the <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> in the summer of 1921, not long before his fifteenth birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by RCA in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. [...] Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Although Farnsworth was paid royalties by RCA, he never became wealthy. [...] The video camera tube that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices started to appear.|$|E
2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> {{camera tube}} {{transmitted}} its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver {{in another room}} of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator; so the television system now had no mechanical parts. [...] That year Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images using his television system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Pem.|$|E
