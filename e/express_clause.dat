6000|$|I say, I well {{remember}} that bill, {{and every one}} of its honest and its wise provisions. It is not true that this debt was ever protected or enforced, or any revenue whatsoever set apart for it. It was left in that bill just where it stood: to be paid or not to be paid out of the Nabob's private treasures, according to his own discretion. The Company had actually given it their sanction, though always relying for its validity on the sole security of the faith of him[14] who without their knowledge or consent entered into the original obligation. It had no other sanction; it ought to have had no other. So far was Mr. Fox's bill from providing funds for it, as this ministry have wickedly done for this, and for ten times worse transactions, out of the public estate, that an <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> immediately preceded, positively forbidding any British subject from receiving assignments upon any part of the territorial revenue, on any pretence whatsoever.[15] ...|$|E
60|$|But why {{not refer}} all {{subjects}} {{to such a}} South African court as was finally accepted by both sides? The answer {{is that it is}} a monstrous hypocrisy to carry cases into an arbitration court, when you know beforehand that by their very nature they cannot possibly be settled by such a court. To quote Milner's words, 'It is, of course, absurd to suggest that the question whether the South African Republic does or does not treat British residents in that country with justice, and the British Government with the consideration and respect due to any friendly, not to say suzerain power, is a question capable of being referred to arbitration. You cannot arbitrate on broad questions of policy any more than on questions of national honour.' On this point of the limitation of arbitration the Transvaal leaders appear to have been as unanimous as the British, so that it is untrue to lay the blame of the restriction upon one side only. Mr. Reitz, in his scheme of arbitration formulated upon June 9, has the <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> 'That each side shall have the right to reserve and exclude points which appear to it to be too important to be submitted to arbitration.' To this the British Government agreed, making the further very great concession that an Orange Free Stater should not be regarded as a foreigner. The matter was in this state when the Transvaal sent its ultimatum. Up to the firing of the first shot the British Government still offered the only form of arbitration which was possible without giving away the question at issue. It was the Transvaal which, after agreeing to such a Court, turned suddenly to the arbitrament of the Mauser and the Creusot.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the need for}} choice of law and jurisdiction clauses in the contract entered into between the virtual enterprise members {{and also in the}} contracts between the virtual enterprise and external parties such as customers or suppliers. There is first an examination of what happens where there is no <b>express</b> jurisdiction <b>clause,</b> followed by an analysis of the situation where there is no express choice of law clause. It is shown that where there is no such <b>express</b> <b>clauses,</b> it may be very difficult for the parties to have a measure of legal certainty the moment a dispute arises as regards where to sue and which law will apply to resolve their dispute. The discussion focuses on the legal situation in Western Europe, i. e. in EU and EFTA countries...|$|R

50|$|The main duty of {{the buyer}} is paying the agreed {{purchase}} price of the vessel. Normally, the time of payment is not the essential factor unless there is an <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> in the contract. The buyer must also accept delivery under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, s27. It is provided under s27, that payment and delivery should be concurrent unless otherwise stipulated. Of course, the buyer also has the obligations to prevent misrepresentation during the negotiation stage.|$|E
50|$|Vita sued Unus in Nova Scotia for {{the damage}} to the cargo, salvage and other expenses. It also alleged that the Hurry On was unseaworthy, and that the bills of lading were illegal because they did not contain an <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> {{adopting}} the Hague Rules, and thus was subject to the liabilities of a common carrier. Unus, in its defence, asserted that, as the bills stated that they would be governed by English law, the Hague Rules were incorporated by reference, as they were the ones in force under the English Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, the {{creditor}} may cancel the contract if “time {{was of the}} essence of the contract,” or was made so by a notice of rescission.” Time is of the essence when the parties expressly or impliedly agreed that default of performance by the day fixed would entitle the other party to cancel the contract. An <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> to this effect is known as a lex commissoria. Even in the absence of such a clause, however, the circumstances often show that the parties regard the time for performance as being of {{the essence of the}} contract: for example, where they use precise language in fixing the time, or deliberately alter the date fixed in the original draft of the contract. Time is generally of the essence of a contract in mercantile transactions, particularly in respect of commodities that fluctuate in value, but not as a rule in transactions concerning land. In all cases, however, the decisive test is the intention of the parties.|$|E
2500|$|In some languages, {{for example}} English, {{there is often}} a {{similarity}} between <b>clauses</b> <b>expressing</b> an action or event in the passive voice and <b>clauses</b> <b>expressing</b> a state.

5000|$|A full {{conditional}} sentence (one which expresses the condition {{as well as}} its consequences) therefore contains two clauses: the dependent <b>clause</b> <b>expressing</b> the condition, called the protasis; and the main <b>clause</b> <b>expressing</b> the consequence, called the apodosis. An example of such a sentence (in English) is the following: ...|$|R
5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} {{carried by sea}} by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the {{contract}} of carriage does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts of affreightment. In charter parties the shipowner may negotiate an <b>express</b> <b>clause</b> excluding his liability for unseaworthiness or he may, as it more usual, agree to incorporate the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 into the charter.|$|E

5000|$|Fernando Pereira and David Warren, {{two other}} early architects of Prolog, {{coined the term}} [...] "definite clause grammar" [...] and created the {{notation}} for DCGs that is used in Prolog today. They gave credit for the idea to Colmeraur and Kowalski, and they note that DCGs are a special case of Colmeraur's metamorphosis grammars. They introduced the idea in an article called [...] "Definite Clause Grammars for Language Analysis", where they describe DCGs as a [...] "formalism ... in which grammars are <b>expressed</b> <b>clauses</b> of first-order predicate logic" [...] that [...] "constitute effective programs of the programming language Prolog".|$|R
25|$|If {{there are}} {{uncertain}} or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, {{it may be}} possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, <b>express</b> <b>clauses</b> may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.|$|R

For this purpose, <b>express</b> <b>clauses</b> in the agreement signed by each Principal with the Agent may identify specific types or categories of activities that do not breach the duty of loyalty and so long as these exceptions are not unreasonable, they bind the Principals.|$|R
