5000|$|Greg LeMond (...) {{suffered}} from a <b>dropped</b> <b>chain</b> halfway through the course, which caused him to post a [...] "horrible" [...] time according to El País writer Luis Gómez. Tony Rominger (...) , Erik Breukink (...) , and Erich Maechler (...) chose to use rear lenticular wheels instead of a traditional wheel with spokes. Rominger came in second overall {{with a time of}} 13' 10", Breukink came in fourth at 13' 15", and Maechler came in third after finishing with the same time as Breukink. After the stage, Rominger told reporters that his time slower than it could have been due to a fall that occurred due to his front wheel being too inflated. Pedro Delgado (Reynolds), who rode a standard bike, finished in twentieth position, twenty-eight seconds behind stage winner Jean-François Bernard (...) [...] Bernard traversed the course with the fastest time of 13' 07" [...] at a pace of 41.168 km/h.

50|$|Shift ramps {{are complex}} tooth profiles, {{in the rear}} {{sprockets}} and front chainrings, designed {{to pick up and}} <b>drop</b> the <b>chain</b> during shifting. They allow for shifting under greater load than was previously possible, and for smoother and cleaner shifting. The different systems are branded Hyperglide by Shimano, UltraDrive by Campagnolo, and OpenGlide by SRAM. The chain itself is specifically manufactured for ease of shifting, and to interface with a particular manufacturer's shift ramps; using a different type of chain may result in sub-optimal shifting.|$|R

40|$|Several {{species of}} {{flatfish}} in the Southern New England (SNE) area have been assessed as overfished {{and in need}} of rebuilding. These species have some common characteristics in terms of life history patterns, use of habitat, and distribution. Many are targeted species in directed fisheries; others are bycatch/discard species, especially in the small mesh fishery in SNE for squid, (Loligo pealeii), butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) and scup (Stenotomus chrysops); these species include summer (Paralichthys dentatus), winter (Pseudopleuronectes americanus), yellowtail (Limanda ferruginea) and windowpane (Scophthalmus aquosus) flounders. As a result, {{there is a need to}} find gear solutions to prevent capture. A modified fishing net (MFN) was designed using a standard bottom trawl squid net with the addition of 30. 5 cm (12 inch) extensions to the headrope and a 30. 5 cm (12 inch) <b>drop</b> <b>chain</b> between the sweep and the footrope. It was tested on its ability to reduce the capture of flatfish by creating a space between the sweep and the footrope. Initial testing to make adjustments to the sweep design of the modified fishing net was conducted at the flume tank facility at the Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources located at the Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland. ^ A catch characterization study was conducted aboard two commercial fishing vessels targeting squid using the 2 ̆ 2 side-by-side 2 ̆ 2 towing method comparing the standard fishing net (SFN) with the MFN. The nets were switched every two days and used an equal number of times on each vessel. Work was done over 12 months around Block Island Sound and Rhode Island Sound and consisted of 8 fishing days. Each fishing day consisted of six 40 minute tows. For each tow all flatfish were sampled or if necessary a sub-sample was taken following Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) protocols (NEFSC 2010). Catch included target species, (i. e. squid, butterfish, scup), flounder species (fluke, sand dabs, fourspot flounder (Paralichthys oblongus), winter flounder, yellowtail flounder) and skate (Leucoraja erinacea) which were weighed. Other appropriate bycatch was also sampled and weighed. When appropriate, flatfish species were measured and sorted into sublegal and legal sizes prior to weighing. ^ After checking for vessel effects, a paired t-test was used to test for differences between the combined mean weight (catch by species) per tow (in kilograms) of the SFN and MFN. Results show a significant difference between mean weights per tow for summer, winter, yellowtail, fourspot and windowpane flounders. There was no significant difference between mean weights captured by the SFN and MFN for all three target species. ^ The findings of this research indicate the 30. 5 cm (12 in.) <b>drop</b> <b>chain</b> trawl net design has the ability to reduce the capture of flatfish while retaining target species in the small mesh fishery of Southern New England. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{dispute with}} franchisees {{came to a}} head in 1962.

Behind Talansky, Rui Costa completed the overall podium for the , after recording the fourth-quickest stage time. Following his Paris–Nice win earlier in the year, Wiggins became the first rider to win both races in the same year since Dario Frigo in 2001.|$|R

A plain bearing on the timing side main bearing sometimes wore rapidly. The primary chain ran in a shallow oil-bath but if the level <b>dropped,</b> the <b>chain</b> could suffer lubrication failure and stretch. The chain was not tensioned - and even worse, the primary chain case on early models was a slightly 'waisted' shape. A worn chain could strike both {{the inside of the}} cover and the crankcase itself, making the oil-level even more difficult to maintain in the future. Another common complaint was that the Cub would travel at highway speed (50 mph) for 1/2 hour and then stop unexpectedly. Some attributed this to overheating, but a cure was never found.|$|R
