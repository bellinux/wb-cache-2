Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal <b>decanter</b> with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric softener and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E

25|$|Immiscible liquids, such {{as water}} and toluene, easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are {{referred}} to as a low boiling azeotrope because the boiling point of the azeotrope is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the azeotrope is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The azeotrope is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid–liquid separator (a <b>decanter)</b> to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.|$|E

In <b>decanters</b> from 14 different manufacturers, measured lead concentrations ranged from 100 to 1800 micrograms/L. The pH of the leaching medium is probably the dominant factor determining the extent of lead leached, with greater leaching occurring at lower pH values.

Rooney lobbied the United States Post Office Department seeking for the Peace Candle to {{chosen for}} the {{official}} Christmas Stamp in the following year. However, it was rejected both years by the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which reviewed the proposals and narrowed the applications. In 1968, {{an image of the}} painting The Annunciation by Jan van Eyck was chosen rather than the Peace Candle. In October 1979, the Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania-based Michter's Distillery created whiskey decanters patterned after the Peace Candle. The idea was first posed by Mark Hammerstone of Palmer Township, a <b>decanter</b> collector who approached Schultz with the concept in 1978. Schultz brought the idea to the distillery, which chose to base their second annual Christmas <b>decanter</b> on the Peace Candle. They spent $3,500 to build a [...] sculpture based on photos of the structure. The <b>decanter,</b> which holds [...] is off-white with red and yellow flames atop the candles and bunches of Christmas greens around the base. Six thousand decanters were produced and originally sold for a $49.50 retail price. They were shipped to collectors as far as Texas, California and England.|$|E

"On {{the night}} before such an event neither Mamma, Pappa, or Daughter Gale could get those minutes' solid sleep for thought {{that they might have}} {{overlooked}} some essential in the guests' comfort. At the first crow of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the larder into shape. So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need of the said pie. First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state, and give it a stir; then Pappa Gale would tiptoe over and give it a stir; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise. Then arrived the guests. The Minister and the Mrs. Minister, they were, and some neighbors. While she was receiving them the recollection came to Mamma Gale that the beloved mince pie had not received its flavoring. Off she speeds to a <b>decanter</b> of whiskey in the kitchen. She pours into the pie the right proportion of liquor, and goes back to her guests. Then Pappa Gale remembers that the pie has not been flavored. He, too, excuses himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred mince. No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than Daughter Gale, who has just remembered about the forgotten flavoring, rushes in and makes for the whiskey. She pours 'the right proportion' in, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|Citrus {{juices and}} other acidic drinks leach lead from crystal as {{effectively}} as alcoholic beverages. Under conditions of repeated use of the <b>decanter,</b> the lead leaching steeply decreases with increasing use. This finding is [...] "consistent with ceramic chemistry theory, which predicts that leaching of lead from crystal is self-limiting exponentially {{as a function of}} increasing distance from the crystal-liquid interface." [...] Lead leaching still occurs, but the quantity that leaches into a glass of wine or other beverage let stand for a few hours is much smaller than the quantity of lead consumed daily in ordinary diet.|$|E
2500|$|Without {{calling into}} {{question}} the abilities of the tasters, scientific concerns have been raised about the methodology used by individual judges {{as well as the}} validity of any statistical interpretation.

2500|$|As is {{the case}} for other New Zealand wine, New Zealand Pinot noir is fruit-driven, forward and early {{maturing}} in the bottle. [...] It tends to be quite full bodied (for the variety), very approachable and oak maturation tends to be restrained. [...] High quality examples of New Zealand Pinot noir are distinguished by savoury, earthy flavours with a greater complexity. In an article in <b>Decanter</b> (September 2014), Bob Campbell suggests that regional styles are starting to emerge within New Zealand Pinot Noir. Marlborough, with by far the largest plantings of Pinot, produces wines that are quite aromatic, red fruit in particular red cherry, with a firm tannic structure that provides cellaring potential.|$|E
