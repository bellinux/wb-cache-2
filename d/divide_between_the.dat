5|$|The castle's deer park, which {{merged into}} the larger Rising Chase, was {{positioned}} behind the castle {{in a similar way}} to that at Devizes Castle. The castle effectively formed an interface between the town and the park; the great hall in the keep faced the settlement, and the lord's chamber overlooked the park, creating a symbolic <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> public and private aspects of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Briar Creek {{is located}} in the ridge and valley physiographic region. The top of Lee Mountain forms a drainage <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> creek's watershed and another watershed.

5|$|The <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Dutch-speaking north (Flanders) and the French-speaking South (Wallonia) {{has caused}} the {{parliamentary}} democracy to become ethnically polarized. Though {{an equal number of}} seats in the Chamber of Representatives are prescribed to the Flemish and Walloons, Belgian political parties have all divided into two ideologically identical but linguistically and ethnically different parties. The political crisis has grown so bad in recent years that the partition of Belgium has been feared.|$|E

5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the party, Harper's relationship with the Reform Party leadership was frequently strained. In early 1994, he criticized a party decision to establish a personal expense account for Manning {{at a time when}} other Reform MPs had been asked to forego parliamentary perquisites. He was formally rebuked by the Reform executive council despite winning support from some MPs. His relationship with Manning grew increasingly fractious in the mid-1990s, and he pointedly declined to express any opinion on Manning's leadership during a 1996 interview. This friction was indicative of a fundamental <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two men: Harper was strongly committed to conservative principles and opposed Manning's inclinations toward populism, which Harper saw as leading to compromise on core ideological matters.|$|E

5|$|Hatfield {{joined the}} U.S. Navy after graduation, {{taking part in}} the World War II battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a landing craft officer where he {{witnessed}} the carnage of the war. A lieutenant, he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, {{as one of the first}} Americans to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War). After Japan, he served in French Indochina, where he witnessed firsthand the wealth <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie. After his discharge, he spent one year at Willamette’s law school, but decided politics or teaching better suited him.|$|E
5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence. The influx of former refugees from Uganda and elsewhere during the late 20th century has created a linguistic <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> English-speaking population and the French-speaking remainder of the country. Kinyarwanda, English, and French are all official languages. Kinyarwanda {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya and Tanzania. In 2015, Swahili was introduced as a mandatory subject in secondary schools. Inhabitants of Rwanda's Nkombo Island speak Amashi, a language closely related to Kinyarwanda.|$|E
5|$|The entire Slavonia {{belongs to}} the Danube basin and the Black Sea {{catchment}} area, but it is divided in two sub-basins. One of those drains into the Sava—itself a Danube tributary—and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube. The drainage <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two sub-basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains, in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica-Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega-Slavonia County, cuts through the Osijek-Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar-Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok. The Entire Brod-Posavina County {{is located in the}} Sava sub-basin.|$|E

5|$|Vast {{expanses of}} Rus' lands, {{including}} the Dnieper River basin and territories extending {{south to the}} Black Sea, were at that time under Lithuanian control. In order {{to gain control of}} these vast holdings, Lithuania had fought the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362 or 1363 against the invading Mongols and had taken advantage of the power vacuum to the south and east that resulted from the Mongol destruction of Kievan Rus'. The population of the Grand Duchy's enlarged territory was accordingly heavily Ruthenian and Eastern Orthodox. The territorial expansion led to a confrontation between Lithuania and the Grand Duchy of Moscow, which found itself emerging from the Tatar rule and itself in a process of expansion. Uniquely in Europe, the union connected two states geographically located on the opposite sides of the great civilizational <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Western Christian or Latin world, and the Eastern Christian or Byzantine world.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the <b>divide</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
