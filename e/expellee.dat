25|$|The German Federal <b>Expellee</b> Law of 1953 {{defines as}} <b>expellee</b> all German {{nationals}} and ethnic Germans with a primary residence outside post-war Germany, who lost this {{residence in the}} course of the World War II-related flight and expulsions.|$|E

25|$|These numbers {{subsequently}} increased, {{with two}} million additional expellees counted in West Germany in 1950 {{for a total}} of 7.9 million (16.3% of the population). By origin, the West German <b>expellee</b> population consisted of about 5.5 million people from post-war Poland, primarily the former German East/new Polish West, two million from the former Sudetenland, and the rest primarily from Southeast Europe, the Baltic states and Russia.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{conditions}} of voluntarity, issuance of the deed, and leaving German territory (if applicable), were usually not fulfilled for German citizens authoritatively naturalised by the Eastern European states they happened to live in after 1945. Their children gained German citizenship by jus sanguinis (RuStAG §4). Those Aussiedler of foreign citizenship but descending from ancestors holding German citizenship before 1918 (regardless of ethnicity) were granted German citizenship by the Federal <b>Expellee</b> Law (BVFG §6 (2)), while those Aussiedler without such German descent but of German ethnicity (to be evidenced by German culture, language, traditions, etc.) received German citizenship also (see BVFG §1 (1) No. 1).|$|E

25|$|When the Federal Republic of Germany was founded, a law {{was drafted}} on 24 August 1952 that was {{primarily}} intended {{to ease the}} financial situation of the <b>expellees.</b> The law, termed the Lastenausgleichsgesetz, granted partial compensation and easy credit to the expellees; {{the loss of their}} civilian property had been estimated at 299.6 billion Deutschmarks (out of a total loss of German property due to the border changes and expulsions of 355.3 billion Deutschmarks). Administrative organisations were set up to integrate the <b>expellees</b> into post-war German society. While the Stalinist regime in the Soviet occupation zone did not allow the <b>expellees</b> to organise, in the Western zones <b>expellees</b> over time established a variety of organizations, including the All-German Bloc/League of <b>Expellees</b> and Deprived of Rights. The most prominent—still active today—is the Federation of <b>Expellees</b> (Bund der Vertriebenen, or BdV).|$|R
50|$|The Federation of <b>Expellees</b> {{was formed}} on 27 October 1957 in West Germany. Before its founding, the Bund der Heimatvertriebenen (League of <b>Expellees</b> and Deprived of Rights), formed in 1950, {{represented}} {{the interests of}} displaced German <b>expellees.</b> Intriguingly, in its first few years, the league was more successful in West Germany than in East Germany.|$|R
2500|$|Steinbach was {{a member}} of the CDU {{national}} board from 2000 to September 2010, when she chose to resign from the position following a controversy over comments about the German invasion of Poland. Steinbach, in support of other members of her <b>expellee</b> organization, said that the German attack on Poland was just a response to Poland's mobilization, resulting in criticism of her. Steinbach's resignation [...] was met with mixed feelings within the CDU/CSU. Some members were worried that her departure could cause a split, and a formation of a new right wing party in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Altogether, around 8 million ethnic German {{refugees}} and expellees from across Europe eventually settled in West Germany, with a further 3 million in East Germany. [...] In West Germany these represented a major voting block; maintaining a strong culture of grievance and victimhood against Soviet Power, pressing for a continued commitment to full German reunification, claiming compensation, pursuing {{the right of}} return to lost property in the East, and opposing any recognition of the postwar extension of Poland and the Soviet Union into former German lands. Due to the Cold War rhetoric and successful political machinations of Konrad Adenauer, this block eventually became substantially aligned with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany; although in practice 'westward-looking' CDU policies favouring the Atlantic Alliance and the European Union worked against the possibility of achieving {{the objectives of the}} <b>expellee</b> population from the east through negotiation with the Soviet Union. But for Adenauer, fostering and encouraging unrealistic demands and uncompromising expectations amongst the expellees would serve his [...] "Policy of Strength" [...] by which West Germany contrived to inhibit consideration of unification or a final Peace Treaty until the West was strong enough to face the Soviets on equal terms. Consequently, the Federal Republic in the 1950s adopted much of the symbolism of <b>expellee</b> groups; especially in appropriating and subverting the terminology and imagery of the Holocaust; applying this to post-war German experience instead. [...] Eventually in 1990, following the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, the unified Germany indeed confirmed in treaties with Poland and the Soviet Union that the transfer of sovereignty over the former German eastern territories in 1945 had been permanent and irreversible; Germany now undertaking never again to make territorial claims in respect of these lands.|$|E
2500|$|Most ethnic Germans fled or were {{expelled}} from European countries (Czechia, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) under the Potsdam Agreement from 1945 to 1948 {{towards the end}} and after the war. [...] Both those who became ethnic Germans by registering in the Deutsche Volksliste and Reichsdeutsche retained German citizenship {{during the years of}} Allied military occupation, after the establishment of East Germany and West Germany in 1949, and later in the reunified Germany. In 1953 the Federal Republic of Germany - by its Federal <b>Expellee</b> Law - naturalised many more East European nationals of German ethnicity, who neither were German citizens nor had enrolled in any 'Volksliste', but had been stranded as refugees in West Germany and fled or {{were expelled}} due to their German or alleged German ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|According to a 1967 {{report by}} the West German Federal Ministry for <b>Expellees,</b> in 1950 there were 14,447,000 persons {{affected}} by the expulsions, 11,730,000 had fled or were expelled, and 2,717,000 still remained in their homelands. By 1966 {{the sum total of}} German <b>expellees</b> and their offspring had increased to 14,600,000 persons. The higher figure of 14 million <b>expellees</b> is often cited by historians.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>expellees</b> {{are still}} highly active in German politics, and {{are one of}} the major social groups of the nation, with around 2 million members. The {{president}} of the Federation of <b>Expellees</b> is [...] a member of the Bundestag.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>expellees</b> {{and their}} {{descendants}} were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the <b>expellees</b> and German civilian victims.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1945, {{the then}} German city of Swinemünde (Świnoujście in {{contemporary}} Poland) was the destination port for refugees from East Prussia. On the 12th of March 1945, the US Eighth Air Force raided the city. Due to uncertainty concerning {{the number of}} refugees within the city {{the exact number of}} casualties is unknown. As the capacity of air raid shelters was limited to the regular populace, many refugees were killed at the spa gardens. The motor vessel Andros, carrying about 2,000 refugees, had just arrived at the harbour and was sunk with the loss of about 570 people. About 500 victims of the raid were identified and buried close to the entrance of the cemetery and the remaining dead were buried in mass graves. The estimated number of victims, including residents of Swinemünde who were also encompassed by the expulsions, varies from about 5,000 to 23,000. 1958 the West German Government demographic study of <b>expellee</b> deaths estimated the total civilian dead in the East Pommerian [...] region due to Anglo-American air raids after 1/31/45 at 8,000. The German War Graves Commission estimates that 20,000 victims are buried at the Golm War Cemetery with further burials within the town limits.|$|E
2500|$|Polish {{ambassador}} to Germany, Marek Prawda, Poland's Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk expressed unease with Steinbach's {{appointment to the}} board of the Center against Expulsions in February 2009. Władysław Bartoszewski, an Auschwitz survivor who is Poland’s commissioner on relations with Germany, said that giving Mrs Steinbach a seat on the board would be akin to the Vatican appointing a Holocaust denier like Richard Williamson to manage relations with Israel. On 16 September 2010, Steinbach attested Bartoszewski [...] "a bad character" [...] on German TV. At the time the Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, privately warned Berlin that allowing Mrs Steinbach’s appointment would shake German-Polish relations “to their foundations”. [...] "Do people whose families lived there for generations want to be identified with a person like Mrs. Steinbach, who came to our country with Hitler and had to leave it with Hitler too?" [...] Sikorski said in Brussels on February 23, 2009, referring to Steinbach’s father having moved to German occupied Poland during the war and asked her to follow the example of President Horst Köhler, who was born within a family of wartime German settlers in Poland and never considered himself an <b>expellee.</b> The fact that Steinbach represents a person born to a German officer stationed in occupied Poland has been described as one of the essential issues for Poles.|$|E

2500|$|... 3—Germans {{from west}} of Oder Neisse resettled during war. This {{category}} includes only those German nationals living {{west of the}} Oder–Neisse line in 1939 who were resettled in occupied eastern Europe by Nazi Germany. In all 560,000 were resettled in Eastern Europe (530,000 in the postwar territory of Poland and 30,000 in Czechoslovakia). They are considered <b>expellees</b> {{in the eyes of}} German law. In 1950 460,000 were counted as <b>expellees,</b> and by 1982 the number had increased to 500,000. According to the German law defining <b>expellees</b> (BVFG §1 (4)), Nazi German occupational functionaries and other German expatriates who had relocated to German-annexed or German-occupied foreign territory during the war were not considered <b>expellees</b> unless they showed circumstances (such as marrying a resident of the respective area) indicating the intention to permanently settle abroad after the war. Section BVFG §1 (5) of the German law excludes those persons as <b>expellees</b> who were implicated in Nazi war crimes and violations of human rights.|$|R
