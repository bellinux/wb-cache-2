2500|$|In {{the film}} Iron Man 3, Maya Hansen {{mentions}} Wernher von Braun to Pepper Pots â€“ [...] "before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed of space travel, he star gazed. Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{when the first}} V2 hit London? The rocket performed perfectly, it just landed on the wrong planet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well!' {{cried the}} boy, so much nettled by her sarcasm {{that he did}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'I think--considering--considering our situations, I might be worth her consideration!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was arrested}} dozens of times, {{but he always}} got off. Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> once, when they pulled him for thugging a fellow out in New Jersey?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was by {{no means}} {{apparent}} that Mr. Grewgious <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> though it was very apparent that he meant to say something highly friendly and appreciative.|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor {{whispered to}} the Nurse [...] And the Surgeon <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> And <b>he</b> grew pale at the Doctor's tale [...] And trembled in his sick bed.|$|R
60|$|He raved, he ranted, <b>he</b> scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> or did, and yet {{the words}} he uttered sank deep into my heart, and a sudden, wild {{ambition}} swelled my bosom.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Soldiers do not choose, they obey.' He {{inclined}} {{his head}} {{to show that we}} were dismissed, and turned round to Berthier. I do not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but I heard them both laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And whilst thou wert {{speaking}} to her, my poor Pereo, the devil of an American Doctor was {{speaking to}} her mother, thy mistress--our mistress, Pereo! Wouldst thou <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said?</b> Oh, it was nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{naturally}} don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to you, but I can't help {{believing that}} he acquitted himself rather well," [...] she observed. [...] "After all, {{it must have}} been a little painful to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Raven croak'd as she sate at her meal, [...] And the Old Woman <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] And {{she grew}} pale at the Raven's tale, [...] And sicken'd {{and went to}} her bed.|$|R
60|$|I had no {{difficulty}} now in commanding myself, {{for it was}} easy to see Rupert scarce <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> With such a man I saw no great necessity for using extraordinary delicacy or much reserve.|$|R
60|$|He took a dislike to us {{the moment}} he saw us. I {{was the first to}} come out of the hotel. He turned his head, and looked me up and down with a cold, glassy eye; and then he looked across at another horse, a friend of his that was {{standing}} facing him. I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> had an expressive head, and he made no attempt to disguise his thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-noight," [...] {{replied the}} man, from the {{sheer force of}} innate politeness, for he stood in such a {{condition}} of open-mouthed amazement that it was quite plain he did not very well <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> or did.|$|E
6000|$|Late {{last night}} Fuller telegraphed you, as you say, that [...] "the Stars and Stripes float over Vicksburg and the victory is complete." [...] Did he <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> {{or did he}} say it without knowing it? Your {{despatch}} of this afternoon throws doubt upon it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We, of course, {{talked to}} him. And do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me? 'What have we {{to do with}} Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the scoundrels.' Extirpate is all very well--but what then? The imbecile! I screamed at him, 'But you must spiritualize--don't you understand?--spiritualize the discontent.'..." ...|$|E
60|$|Ned checked himself, for <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was false.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to her, nor what reply she made, but {{she put her}} arm in his, and {{presently}} {{they were}} gliding over the polished floor. To Wayne the dance was a dream. He led her through the hall and out upon the balcony, where composure strangely came to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendidly done!" [...] Colonel Bulstrode exclaimed {{when she}} brought her story to an end. [...] "It was a {{magnificent}} idea, and it must have needed no end of pluck {{to carry it out}} as you did. But how, by looking at a fellow's mouth through a hole, you <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> beats me altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> I {{know that}} I was crying, {{and that he}} kissed me. It {{was the first time}} in his life. I know that he was pleased,--beyond measure pleased. After a while he became animated, and talked of doing ever so many things. He promised that very {{painting}} of which you spoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was very}} nearly gone," [...] he said, [...] "but {{we managed to}} get him round, {{and it seems to}} me that he has been better since. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to you or you to him, and I don't want to know; but he seems to have got {{something}} off his mind. He is less feverish than he was, and I have really some faint hopes of pulling him through, especially as he will now be in a more healthful atmosphere." ...|$|E
60|$|But now {{the moment}} {{approached}} {{for the performance}} to commence. M. Paul, setting us before him, harangued us briefly, like a general addressing soldiers about to charge. I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> except that he recommended each to penetrate herself {{with a sense of}} her personal insignificance. God knows I thought this advice superfluous for some of us. A bell tinkled. I and two more were ushered on to the stage. The bell tinkled again. I had to speak the very first words.|$|E
6000|$|Steadfast was by {{this time}} on the horse behind his little brother, {{pressing}} through the fields, which by ancient custom were all thrown open from harvest time till Christmas; and coming {{out into the open}} bit of common that the travellers had to pass before arriving at Breakneck Hill, he was just in time to meet them as they trotted on. <b>He</b> hardly <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as <b>he</b> doffed his hat, and exclaimed-- ...|$|R
6000|$|It cut {{her to the}} heart, for {{she could}} not but {{remember}} the harsh thoughts that had threatened her loyalty during the week past. After all, Billy, the splendid physical man, was only a boy, her boy. And he had faced and endured all this terrible punishment for her, for {{the house and the}} furniture that were their house and furniture. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> so, now, when <b>he</b> scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> [...] "WE needed the money." [...] She was not so absent from his thoughts as she had fancied. Here, down to the naked tie-ribs of his soul, when he was half unconscious, the thought of her persisted, was uppermost. We needed the money. WE! ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel, {{still in}} his place, declined, however, {{to be drawn into}} a {{statement}} of his idea. Statements were too much like theories, in which one lost one's way; <b>he</b> only <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable. Still, none the less, he had his point to make--for which he took another instant. But he made it, for the third time, in the same fashion. [...] "They'll manage in their own way." [...] With which he got out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think Mr. Drexley {{is quite}} the nicest man I know," [...] she {{declared}} gaily. [...] "I sent him three little fairy tales, and last week he sent me a cheque for them and asked for more. And do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> Douglas? I asked him to let me have his honest opinion as to whether I could make enough to live on by such work as I sent him, and he replied {{that there could be}} no possible doubt about it. He wants me to write something longer." ...|$|E
60|$|There was an {{eruption}} of new faces, {{and she saw}} Joe carried out on a canvas stretcher. Silverstein was buttoning the long overcoat and drawing the collar about her face. She felt the night air on her cheek, and looking up saw the clear, cold stars. She jammed into a seat. Silverstein was beside her. Joe was there, too, still on his stretcher, with blankets over his naked body; {{and there was a}} man in blue uniform who spoke kindly to her, though she did not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Horses' hoofs were clattering, and she was lurching somewhere through the night.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Upon my soul I don't {{know what}} he did, nor where he went, nor {{anything}} about him I only <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{to me as a}} caution to hold my tongue, when we parted; and I tell you this, Misses Brown, as a friend, that sooner than ever repeat a word of what we're saying now, you had better take and shoot yourself, or shut yourself up in this house, and set it a-fire, for there's nothing he wouldn't do, to be revenged upon you. You don't know him half as well as I do, Misses Brown. You're never safe from him, I tell you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it is but {{wood dust}} which I {{use for the}} {{cleaning}} of my nails," [...] cried Masapo, for he was so terrified I think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|He had a {{word for}} everybody; and, turning rapidly from one to another, gave {{utterance}} to some hasty witticism, which was sure {{to be followed by}} peals of laughter. To the females, {{as well as to the}} men, he addressed his discourse. Heaven only <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to them, but he caused smiles and blushes to mantle their ingenuous faces. I am, indeed, very much inclined to believe that Marnoo, with his handsome person and captivating manners, was a sad deceiver among the simple maidens of the island.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, we'll chance it," [...] {{concluded}} Belding. [...] "I'll go out now {{and call}} Rojas and his outfit over... Say, {{it might be}} as well for me to <b>know</b> just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in that paper." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he left me}} and I {{began to}} undress, for I was dog-tired and very sleepy. I slept fifteen hours and woke up finely {{refreshed}} at ten the next morning. Vienna coffee! It {{was the first thing}} I thought of--that unapproachable luxury--that sumptuous coffee-house coffee, compared with which all other European coffee and all American hotel coffee is mere fluid poverty. I rang, and ordered it; also Vienna bread, that delicious invention. The servant spoke through the wicket in the door and said--but you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> He referred me to the bill of fare. I allowed him to go--I had no further use for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Whist,' says I, 'I {{have no time}} {{to waste}} upon ye. The master and the troops are {{stationed}} just across the river, at Ballygan. Mr. Davenant has given me a letter for Miss Conyers, telling her all about it. I don't exactly <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and maybe she would like it given privately, so do you hand it to Bridget in the morning, and ask her to give it to her mistress, and to hand over to you any answer there may be. I will come across for it tomorrow night. But that's not all, Pat. You know the devil's work that William's men have been carrying on, on the march.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{inducing}} you {{to trust}} me. Now I know--to-day I know. Do {{you remember what}} I asked you in Rome? Then I was quite in the dark. But to-day I know on good authority; everything's clear to me to-day. It {{was a good thing}} when you made me come away with your cousin. He was a good man, a fine man, one of the best; he told me how the case stands for you. He explained everything; he guessed my sentiments. He was a member of your family and he left you--so long as you should be in England--to my care," [...] said Goodwood as if he were making a great point. [...] "Do you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to me the last time I saw him--as he lay there where he died? He said: 'Do everything you can for her; do everything she'll let you.'" ...|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{stared at}} me. 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you mean,' <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|But Randal was so sure, {{that she}} did not scold him. She <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The nearer a {{man comes}} in any work that God {{commands}} {{him to the}} doing of it according to his will, so much the more hard and difficult it is; and the reason is, because man, as man, {{is not able to}} do it. But prayer, as aforesaid, is not only a duty, {{but one of the most}} eminent duties, and therefore so much the more difficult: therefore Paul <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I will pray with the Spirit." [...] He knew well it was not what others writ or said that could make him a praying person; nothing less than the Spirit could do it.|$|R
