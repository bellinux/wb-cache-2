40|$|I {{present a}} {{brief review of}} what is known about double-barred galaxies, where a small ("inner") bar is nested inside a larger ("outer") bar; the review is focused {{primarily}} on their demographics and photometric properties. Roughly 20 % of S 0 [...] Sb galaxies are double-barred; they may be rarer in later Hubble types. <b>Inner</b> <b>bars</b> are typically ~ 500 pc in radius (~ 12 % the size of outer bars), but sizes range from ~ 100 pc to > 1 kpc. The structure of at least some <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> appears very similar to that of outer bars (and single large-scale bars). Direct and indirect evidence all support the hypothesis that <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> rotate independently of outer bars, although actual pattern speeds <b>for</b> <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> are poorly constrained. Finally, I note that <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> do not appear to promote nuclear activity. Comment: LaTeX, 9 pages, 6 PDF figures (plus small logo PDF figure).

Not all pattern speeds are allowed when the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> rotates {{in the same direction}} as the outer bar.

40|$|We analyze how {{the orbital}} {{support of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> in a double-barred galaxy (nested bars) depends on the angular {{velocity}} (i. e. pattern speed) of this bar. We study orbits in seven models of double bars using the method of invariant loops. The range of pattern speed is covered exhaustively. We find that not all pattern speeds are allowed when the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> rotates {{in the same direction}} as the outer bar. Below a certain minimum pattern speed orbital support <b>for</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> abruptly disappears, while at high values of this speed the orbits indicate an increasingly round bar that looks more like a twist in the nuclear isophotes than a dynamically independent component. For values between these two extremes, orbits supporting the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> extend further out as the bar's pattern speed decreases, their corresponding loops become more eccentric, pulsate more, and their rotation becomes increasingly non-uniform, as they speed up and slow down in their motion. Lower pattern speeds also lead to a less coherent bar, as the pulsation and acceleration increasingly varies among the loops supporting the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> The morphologies of fast and slow <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> expected from the orbital structure studied here are recently recovered observationally by decomposition of double barred galaxies. Our findings allow us to link the observed morphology to the dynamics of the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> Comment: ApJ accepte...|$|R
40|$|In double sandbar systems, the alongshore {{variability}} in the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> oftenresembles that of the outer bar, suggesting that the outer bar acts as a morphologicaltemplate <b>for</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> Earlier observations have indicated that this resemblance, alsotermed “coupling,” may take several forms. Here we apply a nonlinear 2 DHmorphodynamic model with time-invariant forcing {{to show that the}} angle of waveincidence (Â) is crucial for the alongshore-variable morphodynamic evolution of the innerbar, for a given crescentic outer bar. In contrast to previous modeling efforts ofdouble-barred systems, which mostly used highly idealized boundary conditions, weforce our model with realistic hydrodynamics and bathymetrical data derived from videoobservations at the double-barred Gold Coast, Australia. The results show that for smallangles of wave incidence (Â < 10 ı) over a crescentic outer-bar, cell-circulation patternsgovern the ﬂow at the <b>inner</b> <b>bar,</b> giving rise to rip channels that incise the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> at thelocations of the landward perturbations in the outer bar (horns). On the other hand, forobliquely incident waves (Â = 10 ı– 20 ı) over a crescentic outer bar, the circulatory natureof the ﬂow disappears and gives way to a meandering alongshore current. Theoffshore-directed sections of this meandering alongshore current erode the inner-bardowndrift of the outer-bar horns, leading to landward perturbations of the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> thatare coupled to the outer-bar horns; an observed coupling type that had not beenreproduced as yet. Oblique wave incidence thus proves to be crucial to the developmentof this type of sandbar coupling, as previously hypothesized from sandbar-couplingobservations at the Gold Coast.

40|$|Four {{years of}} {{bi-monthly}} topographic surveys {{have been conducted}} on a 350 m stretch of the meso- to macro-tidal Truc Vert beach, France. Here we study the dynamics of both the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> and {{the upper part of}} the beach where a berm can develop in the presence of fair weather conditions. <b>For</b> the <b>inner</b> <b>bar,</b> the occurrences of the different states within the intermediate classification, following that of Wright and Short (Wright, L. D., Short, A. D. 1984. Morphodynamic variability of surf zones and beaches: a synthesis. Marine Geology 56, 93 – 118), are presented and compared to other sites in both micro- and meso-tidal environments. The results show a similar frequency of occurrence of the Transverse Bar and Rip (TBR) state, while the more dissipative states, Rhythmic Bar and Beach (RBB) and Longshore Bar and Trough (LBT), are less regularly observed despite the high wave energy levels. The LBT and RBB states are also observed in the presence of fair weather conditions and the TBR state can persist during very energetic events. Similar results are also observed with the upper beach dynamics. Very energetic events are not necessarily associated with erosion while and low-energy events are not necessarily accompanied by accretion. The conditions given here indicate, that berm development occurs preferentially when the beach morphology exhibits a TBR or a LTT state. Apart from the control exerted by offshore wave conditions, the beach state and berm development patterns exhibited by Truc Vert beach are also discussed within the framework of possible morphological (morphodynamic) feedback and of the influence of the meso- to macrotidal range which modulates the type, intensity and duration of the wave processes operating on the cross-shore profile...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe North-East {{part of the}} Lido de Sète beach owns two nearshore sandbars. Field {{measurements}} {{have shown}} that the outer bar is relatively stable. The behaviour of the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> is more complex. In the classic configuration, both bars are straight and parallel to the shoreline. After stormy conditions, the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> can be segmented and reoriented so that each segment becomes parallel to the crests of the incident waves. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> A linear stability analysis has been performed with a model called MORFO 60. Simulations have shown that morphodynamical instabilities can develop along the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> when stormy waves come from the South or the East.

40|$|When {{integrals}} in {{the standard}} Tremaine-Weinberg method are evaluated for {{the case of a}} realistic model of a doubly barred galaxy, their modifications introduced by the second rotating pattern are in accord with what can be derived from a simple extension of that method, based on separation of tracer’s density. This extension yields a qualitative argument that discriminates between prograde and retrograde <b>inner</b> <b>bars.</b> However, the estimate of the value of <b>inner</b> <b>bar’s</b> pattern speed requires further assumptions. When this extension of the Tremaine-Weinberg method is applied to the recent observation of the doubly barred galaxy NGC 2950, it indicates that the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> there is counter-rotating, possibly with the pattern speed of − 140 ± 50 km s − 1 arcsec − 1.

40|$|We {{investigate}} rapid mass {{supply process}} by nested bars in the Galaxy by numerical simulation. We simulate gas {{flow in the}} whole galaxy disk with nested bars, which are the outer <b>bar</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>bar,</b> especially with highly spatial resolution in the galactic central region. We assume two cases of <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> size which are a smaller one and a larger one than the radius of the 200 pc gas ring which is corresponds to the Central Molecular Zone. From our numerical results, in the large size <b>bar</b> cases, the <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> with large elongation induce sufficient mass inflow and destroy the 200 pc gas ring. On the other hand, in the small size <b>bar</b> cases, the <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> with large elongation induce large mass inflow and do not destroy the 200 pc gas ring. This mass inflow is caused by straight shocks excited by the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> In this case, nuclear gas disks of ~ 15 pc radius are formed. The nuclear gas disks are self-gravitationally unstable and we expect formation of compact star clusters under strong tidal force in the nuclear gas disks. We discuss evolution of the nuclear gas disk. Comment: 36 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of double-barred galaxies predict the build-up of different structural components (e. g., bulges, inner discs) {{in the central}} regions of disc galaxies. In those simulations, <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> have {{a prominent role in}} the internal secular evolution of their host galaxies. The development of bulges and inner discs is, however, poorly understood observationally due to the small number of studies focusing on the stellar populations of these systems. In order to provide constraints on the relevant processes inducing the creation of these components in the presence of <b>inner</b> <b>bars,</b> we have carried out a detailed kinematical and stellar population analysis in a sample of four double-barred galaxies, ranging from SB 0 to SBb, observed with integral-field spectroscopy. We find that the <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> present distinct stellar population properties, being younger and more metal-rich than the surrounding bulges and outer bars. While we detect signatures of gas inflow through the <b>inner</b> <b>bars,</b> we find no evidence of associated star-forming regions or newly-formed structures around them. This result suggests that, regardless of their formation scenario, at present these <b>inner</b> <b>bars</b> are playing a moderate or even a minor role in the morphological evolution of this sample of double-barred galaxies.

The {{presence of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> does not produce {{major changes in the}} line-of-sight velocity, but it appears to have an important effect in the stellar velocity dispersion maps: we find two sigma-hollows of amplitudes between 10 and 40 km/s {{on either side of the}} center, at the ends of the <b>inner</b> <b>bars.</b> We have performed numerical simulations to explain these features. Ruling out other possibilities, we conclude that the sigma-hollows are an effect of the contrast between two kinematically different components: the high velocity dispersion of the bulge and the more ordered motion (low velocity dispersion) of the <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures.

40|$|Using high {{resolution}} N -body simulations, we recently {{reported that a}} dynamically cool inner disk embedded in a hotter outer disk can naturally generate a steady double-barred (S 2 B) structure. Here we study the kinematics of these S 2 B simulations, and compare them to integral-field observations from ATLAS 3 D and SAURON. We show that S 2 B galaxies exhibit several distinct kinematic features, namely: (1) 	significantly distorted isovelocity contours at the transition region between the two bars, (2) peaks in σLOS along the minor axis of <b>inner</b> <b>bars,</b> which we term “σ-humps”, that are often accompanied by ring/spiral-like features of increased σLOS, (3) h 3 − v¯ anti-correlations {{in the region of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> <b>for</b> certain orientations, and (4) rings of positive h 4 when viewed at low inclinations. The most impressive of these features are the σ-humps; these evolve with the <b>inner</b> <b>bar,</b> oscillating in strength just as the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> does as it rotates relative to the outer bar. We show that, in cylindrical coordinates, the <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> has similar streaming motions and velocity dispersion properties as normal large-scale bars, except for σz, which exhibits peaks on the minor axis, i. e., humps. These σz humps are responsible for producing the σ-humps.

40|$|Double-barred {{galaxies are}} common in the local Universe, with {{approximately}} one third of barred spirals hosting an smaller, <b>inner</b> <b>bar.</b> Nested bars have been proposed as a mechanism for transporting gas to the very central regions of the galaxy, trigger star formation {{and contribute to the}} growth of the bulge. To test this idea, we perform {{for the first time a}} detailed analysis of the photometry, kinematics and stellar populations of a double-barred galaxy: NGC 357. We find that this galaxy is either hosting a pseudobulge or a classical bulge together with an inner disc. We compare the relative mean luminosity-weighted age, metallicity and alpha-enhancement between the (pseudo) bulge, <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> and outer bar, finding that the three structures are nearly coeval and old. Moreover, the bulge and <b>inner</b> <b>bar</b> present the same metallicity and overabundance, whereas the outer bar tends to be less metal-rich and more alpha-enhanced. These results point out that, rather than the classical secular scenario in which gas and star formation play a major role, the redistribution of the existing stars is driving the formation of the inner structures.

Proxies for shoreline and sandbar crest positions were extracted from video-images and compared with topo-bathymetric surveys. During the first 17 months part of the nourished sediments were moved seaward and a shore-parallel linear single-bar system was restored.
