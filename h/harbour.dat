5|$|Sheet <b>Harbour</b> is a {{small rural}} {{community}} located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The catchment area around the community includes approximately 5,500 people. Sheet <b>Harbour</b> is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area, due {{to the shape of}} the <b>harbour.</b> The population of Census Tract 2050154.00, which includes Sheet <b>Harbour</b> and a large amount of land around Sheet Harbour's land borders, is 3,478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census. Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each census tract has a numerical designation. The population of the community of Sheet <b>Harbour</b> is about 800. Immediately west of Sheet <b>Harbour</b> is Sheet <b>Harbour</b> 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve.|$|E
5|$|The New <b>Harbour</b> {{was later}} renamed as Keppel <b>Harbour</b> in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} an on-site survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the <b>harbour</b> in the 1880s. He was also known for his successful campaigns against the pirates in 1842 that were boldly harassing merchant ships {{in close proximity to}} the <b>harbour.</b> Piracy became less of a danger to the trade of Singapore only from the 1850s.|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, a {{political}} struggle began {{to complete the}} <b>harbour's</b> construction, but the other <b>harbours</b> in Denmark feared this. But the passing of a new law on 29 April 1960 finally led to the <b>harbour's</b> completion. It opened in 1967 and today {{is one of the}} largest <b>harbours</b> in Denmark.|$|R
5000|$|Seleucia's {{importance}} grew significantly over time, necessitating the {{enlargement of}} its <b>harbours</b> several times under Diocletian and Constantius.

5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New <b>Harbour</b> Company, with powers {{to build the}} <b>harbour</b> at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey. The Act {{included}} powers to build a short section of canal to link with {{the line of the}} Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal. The new <b>harbour</b> was completed in 1832.

5|$|As soon as {{they were}} ready, the charges were blown and Nuneaton started to tow Likomba out of the <b>harbour.</b> Aboard Duchessa d'Aosta, 11 men had managed to get aboard from Vulcan; while one group planted charges on the anchor chains, another searched below decks {{collecting}} prisoners. Blowing the anchor chains, Vulcan started to tow Duchessa d'Aosta out of the <b>harbour.</b> The explosions had alerted the population of the town, who started to gather on the pier, but no attempts were made to stop the ships from leaving. Several anti-aircraft emplacements opened fire at imaginary targets, believing the explosions to have been caused by an aerial attack, but the six-inch guns protecting the <b>harbour</b> itself remained silent. From entering the <b>harbour</b> to leaving with the ships under tow, the operation had taken 30 minutes, without any losses to the raiding party.|$|E
50|$|The Normandy coast was the location, during World War II, of {{the main}} Allied {{landings}} in France; the unavailability of significant <b>harbours</b> caused the Allies to construct artificial <b>harbours</b> (Mulberries) at Arromanches and Omaha Beach. There are remains of these <b>harbours</b> at Arromanches.|$|R

50|$|After the {{independence}} of the respective east African countries the East African Railways and <b>Harbours</b> Corporation continued to facilitate its mandate on the railways and ports until 1967. After 1967 the East African Community decided to separate the Railways and the <b>Harbours</b> Corporation, and in 1969 the East African <b>Harbours</b> Corporation was formed. The East African <b>Harbours</b> Corporation had the authority to run and develop the ports in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. The new company operated for 10 years and ceased operations in 1977 due to the dissolution of the East African Community. Each country formed their respective organisations and in Tanzania the Tanzania <b>Harbours</b> Authority.|$|R

5|$|Currently the <b>harbour</b> {{is being}} {{enlarged}} {{in order to}} accommodate larger vessels, especially cruise ships. From 2015 the enlarged <b>harbour</b> is expected to attract up to 40 large cruise ships per year compared to about a dozen smaller ships at present. The new <b>harbour</b> should provide new jobs increasing the workforce in the <b>harbour</b> from 2,000 today to some 2,600 on completion. Karstens Skibsværft, Danish Yacht, and the herring processing firm, Skagerrak Pelgic, are reported to be the most successful companies in Skagen but the town is also home to FF Skagen, the world's top producer of fish meal and fish oil.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{discovery}} Ritchie resolved {{to continue as}} ordered. He took the precaution of sending Helmuth to the <b>harbour</b> entrance to cover the withdrawal, and gathered together several small boats moored in the <b>harbour.</b> These he secured around his launch, providing added buoyancy in case it received fatal damage in the engagement he was sure would ensue. With preparations complete, one of Ritchie's boats (from the cruiser HMS Fox) moved to the <b>harbour</b> entrance. There it was met with a hail of fire from the shore, where the hidden German crews and town garrison had lain in wait. The Helmuth was also attacked, but despite sustaining severe damage both craft were able to limp to safety, carrying several wounded. From outside the <b>harbour</b> Fox and Goliath responded with a heavy barrage, demolishing several streets in the town, including the Governor's Palace. Ritchie, aboard the only remaining British boat in the <b>harbour,</b> attempted to pick up one of his officers who had earlier gone aboard the German hospital ship SS Tabora to conduct a medical inspection. This effort was unsuccessful, and on leaving the <b>harbour</b> Ritchie's launch came under sustained fire from machine guns, rifles and light artillery.|$|E

5|$|For generations, Skagen's {{economy has}} been based on its fishing {{industry}} which continues to prosper today, facilitated by its fishing <b>harbour,</b> the largest in Denmark. Skagen also has the country's main herring processing facility and the world's largest fish oil factory. The town's evolving fishing industry led to considerable growth in the local population which reached some 11,500 in the 1960s. A fish auction is held at dawn in the <b>harbour,</b> and between May and October the <b>harbour</b> also attracts yachting enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|Fragrance may {{refer to}} the sweet taste of the harbour's fresh water estuarine influx of the Pearl River or to the incense from {{factories}} lining the coast of northern Kowloon.

50|$|When {{planning}} {{the invasion of}} France the allies knew they needed to supply the troops who were ashore. The only reliable method of landing resources was through a major port. As the German army held all of France's <b>harbours,</b> the solution was the Mulberry <b>harbours.</b> A building program followed, creating two operational <b>harbours</b> within two weeks. A number of caissons were moored at Portland in 1944, before being towed to France.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Juan's maximum {{sustained}} {{wind speed}} at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at 100mph (155km/h). The urban concentration surrounding Halifax <b>Harbour</b> bore {{the brunt of}} the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as 145mph (230km/h). Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax <b>Harbour</b> snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of 65ft (20m). Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the <b>harbour,</b> particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action. Storm surges of 5 to 7feet (1.5 to 2m) were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax <b>Harbour.</b> Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than 2inches (52mm).|$|E
