40|$|The {{planting}} of crops in degraded pasture areas is a formula used for decades by farmers {{to recover the}} productive capacity of pastures and soils. The integrated crop-livestock (ICL) consists of different production systems of grains, fibers, wood, meat, milk and agro-deployed in the same area, in intercrop, rotation or succession. Typically this integration mainly involves the {{planting of}} grain and pasture in the recovery or deployment. This work aimed to evaluate the macronutrients leaf contents of irrigated corn intercropped with forages of the genus Panicum and Urochloa simultaneously to sown corn. The experiment was conducted at the Farm for Teaching, Research and Extension, Faculty of Engineering - UNESP, Ilha Solteira in an Oxisol in Savannah conditions, in experimental area that {{had a history of}} no-tillage to 8 years (previous crop corn). The experimental design used was randomized blocks with four replications and five treatments: Panicum maximum cv. Tanzania sown simultaneously (CTS) corn; Panicum maximum cv. Mombaça sown simultaneously (CMS) to corn; Urochloa brizantha cv. Xaraes sown simultaneously (CBS) corn; Urochloa ruziziensis sown simultaneously (CRS) to corn, and corn without intercropping (CWI).

40|$|During {{the process}} of direct {{drilling}} different shaped drill coulters have been observed to create different micro-environments at the seed zone. This study has been to examine possible changes in soil structure {{and the state of}} soil compaction around the groove, which in turn might affect root penetration. Several methods and pieces of equipment were developed to investigate the influence on the soil of two contrasting coulter shapes. These were the commercially-available triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> and an experimental chisel coulter. To measure soil bulk density in the drilled groove zone, a small core sampler was designed and tested. Soil strength was assessed using a modified multi-point penetrometer which could be inserted vertically into the soil or normal to the groove walls. The instantaneous and permanent soil pressure zone of influence around the groove, which was created by the passing of the coulters, was monitored using a liquid-filled tube with a terminal diaphragm and a minipressure transducer. Macroscopic visual assessment of the compaction of soil at the seed level was undertaken using a freezing sampling technique which facilitated thin section subsamples to be studied by photographic techniques. In addition, 3 mm 3 subsamples were taken directly from the grooves for electron microscopy study. Supplementary measurements included draft force and the coulter-passage-disturbance-zone at the soil surface using a load cell and a displacement transducer respectively. Wheat and lupin seeds were sown to study the effects of soil changes on root growth of a fibrous and tap root system. The data suggested that the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> tended to compact well-defined zones around the groove while the chisel coulter produced no apparent compaction. Such soil compaction in a moist silt loam of initial bulk density less than 1. 1 g/cc did not result in any apparent differences in plant root responses between the two coulter types. In a drier, harder soil however (greater than 1. 32 g/cc) there appeared to be a clear disadvantage from use of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> in this respect. With lupin, root growth was restricted and deformed from use of the latter coulter, while in the case of wheat, seedling emergence was restricted in comparison with the chisel coulter. Smearing was found on the groove wall in moist soil <b>with</b> the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> but the experiments were not able to show any mechanical restriction to root and plant development arising from the smear. In the field conditions, in contrast to the laboratory conditions (where seedling performance and root growth were better with the chisel coulter in almost all of the tested conditions except with moist and loose soil where it was equivalent to the triple disc) any localised compaction of soil by the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (particularly at and near the base of the groove) appeared to be compensated by other factors (weather, earthworms etc.) during the plant's full growth cycle. Compaction and mechanical impedance in isolation {{did not appear to be}} solely responsible for the root and plant growth responses. A physiological study of soil moisture transport process and soil water vapour availability in the seed zone should therefore be the subject of further studies...|$|R
40|$|In crop production, {{the right}} {{operations}} {{are not known}} in beforehand. Many different factors are included: weather, soil type and preceding crop are examples of factors that vary. When soil tillage and seeding are carried out {{there are many different}} strategies to choose between. For a farmer {{to be able to handle}} every situation can be expensive, as it would be essential that the farmer have access to many different types of implements. The question to be asked before a operation is if the cost for the operation is leading to a equal amount of income. In a project that was started in the autumn 2003 with draught measurements the aim was to find out draught requirements for the most common types of implements as a function of soil type and working depth. Draught requirements for the different types of implements should then be the basis for calculation of power requirement and fuel consumption in a computer program for guidance of machinery costs. This work aim to complement earlier draught measurements with values from tillage operations carried out in the spring 2004 and to develop a calculation program for machinery costs. The tillage operations that was studied in this work was harrowing, seeding with shoe <b>coulter,</b> seeding <b>with</b> <b>discs</b> and reduced tillage (carrier and disk harrow). Measurements of draught requirement during seedbed preparation and seeding was done after catch crop, autumn mouldboard ploughing, spring mouldboard ploughing and reduced tillage. The tractor used for draught measurements was a Massey Fergusson 6290 (130 hp). The tractor's fuel consumption had been measured and calibrated by measuring the power at the PTO. With a logger that registered fuel consumption the power that the tractor developed during field work could be registered. Draught requirement for harrowing after ploughing was higher than after reduced tillage. Harrowing after spring mouldboard ploughing had the highest draught requirements. The draught requirement was reduced between first and second passage. Draught requirement for the grain <b>drill</b> <b>with</b> <b>discs</b> was highest at direct drilling tillage but there was small difference between the series. Seeding after conventional tillage (2 times harrowing after autumn mouldboard ploughing) was done with both shoe <b>coulter</b> and <b>discs,</b> the grain drill whit discs had a double draught requirement compared with shoe coulter. The calculation program was build up with the aim to be able to calculate the costs for all the machinery operations on a farm and use the results of the draught measurements to calculate fuel consumption. The program can simulate a farm with up to eight tractors and fifteen implements. Through connecting tractors with implements it´s possible to simulate tillage on the field. The program calculate tillage costs and time consumption for the farm. What changes in machinery and tillage system do for cost and time consumption for the farm can easily be answered by the program...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{associated}} with no-till and minimum tillage seeding operations {{is the presence}} of crop residue on fields which does not get cut with the existing seeding machines. This failure to cut crop residue results in improper placement of seed. Special seeding machines have been designed, (e. g., Haybuster 1206 grain and fertilizer drill) to overcome these problems. These machines re­quire extra investment for farmers already having conventional seeding machines if they want to practice minimum and no-tilling farming. The study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the perfor­mance of <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> under zero-till practice in the soil bin under different soil conditions and to provide design criteria for modification of existing seed drills so that they could be used under no till conditions. Cone index data on soil penetration resistance and soil moisture content were obtained from no-tilled and fall tilled fields at seeding time to simulate field conditions in the soil bin. Three sizes of <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> were evaluated for their cutting ability of the crop-residue in the soil bin. The data of cone index of packed soil, its moisture content, straw moisture content and straw density were also measured. Draft and vertical forces on coulters were reported for each test. Observations and analysis of data indicated a varying degree of crop residue being cut by the coulters under different soil conditions. The <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> 460 mm diameter performed satisfactorily and cut the straw at densities up to 5000 kg/ha at 50 mm depth of penetration and deeper...|$|R
40|$|Stand {{establishment}} of crops by direct drilling {{is a function}} of seed germination and seedling emergence efficacy and their interactions with the soil physical micro-environment created by direct drill coulters. Experiments conducted in two contrasting controlled climates using 0. 5 tonne undisturbed turf blocks suggested that the three coulter types compared (viz. an experimental chisel coulter, a hoe and a triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter)</b> performed significantly differently, in terms of wheat seedling emergence, when the seed was direct drilled into a fine sandy loam soil. Overall the chisel coulter promoted highest seedling emergence (63. 5 %) followed by the hoe coulter (50. 6 %) and the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> (27. 0 %). When the initial soil moisture potential was close to permanent wilting point, seedling emergence counts between these three coulters were highly significant with the difference between the chisel and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> being almost six-fold. When the initial soil moisture level was adequate, seedling emergence counts from the triple disc grooves, were Still significantly lower than from the chisel and hoe coulters which themselves performed equally. When the controlled relative humidity was increased from 60 % to 90 %, seedling emergence increased but this difference was significant only at a lower level of probability of P = 0. 10. Application of pressures (using press wheels) up to 70 kPa over the covered seeds after bar harrowing had no significant effect on seedling emergence at either the low or adequate initial soil moisture levels. When similar pressures were applied directly over the uncovered seeds, seedling emergence significantly increased to 60 % in the hoe coulter grooves and to 28 % in the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves compared to the impressed seeds. No significant increase was observed from the chisel coulter groove {{as a result of these}} pressures because it had already promoted a high seedling emergence count of 58 %. Further experiments, using small undisturbed turf blocks, to examine more closely the poor performance of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter,</b> indicated that smearing had not been the main cause of seedling emergence failure. When the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> grooves were modified using combinations of pressure applications and seed covering techniques, seedling emergence was significantly improved. It appeared that this improvement in seedling emergence was a function of a modified soil physical micro-environment at the seed-soil interface. Based on these results two hypotheses were evolved. The first hypothesis suggested that the transfer of liquid soil moisture to the seed for germination (and perhaps away from the unprotected seedling after germination but prior to emergence) could be altered by the shape of the seed groove and placement and covering of the seed. This was described as "soil moisture diffusion" The second hypothesis suggested that after the germination, subterranean seedling survival depended on the availability of vapour phase moisture which was also a function of the groove shape and covering medium. This was described as "soil moisture captivity". A thermo-electric dew point hygrometer was used to measure the in-groove vapour moisture potential within the drilled grooves in the larger turf blocks, in a controlled environment. Significant and repeatable differences in the drying rates of the grooves created by the three coulter types were measured and promised to at least partly explain the underlying causes of their abilities (or lack of abilities in some cases) to promote seedling emergence. Combined counts of seedling emergence and sub-surface seedling survival were moderately correlated (r = 0. 71) with the corresponding rates of loss of in-groove soil vapour moisture. It appeared from the data that the important design characteristics for direct drilling coulters were that they must have the ability to both exploit the limited supply of sub-surface liquid moisture for germination and also retain soil moisture in the vapour form for seedling emergence and/or survival. The latter function appeared to be aided by the creation of minimum surface shattering and maintenance of a high incidence of surface mulch in the form of sod or organic matter. Field experiments suggested that when the only measured soil moisture data available was at or prior to drilling, the present state of knowledge would not permit accurate seedling emergence data to be predicted for any given coulter and covering technique. If however, soil moisture data was available for the period between drilling and seedling emergence, reasonable predictions of seedling emergence could be made, given the characteristics of the coulter types and covering techniques used. Examples of mathematical models were constructed for each of the three coulter types used, to predict seedling emergence as a function of these soil moisture data. The field experiments also confirmed that higher seedling emergence counts could be expected when the chisel coulter was used in dry soils compared with the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters.</b> During a typical spring-summer-autumn period in the Manawatu, when wheat seed was direct-drilled at fortnightly intervals into a "Tokomaru silt loam soil"; from 16 % of the drillings the chisel coulter promoted significantly higher seedling emergence counts than either the hoe or triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters...</b>|$|R
40|$|When sowing grain {{we apply}} {{resource}} saving technologies-technologies such as «no till» and a technology called «mini-till». «No till» involves planting crops on untreated surfaces. "Mini-till" {{is designed for}} the planting with minimum tillage. During {{the movement of the}} sowing unit on these agricultural backgrounds we can see working bodies tipping out. Stabilization of the drilling depth is ensured in two ways - by moving part of the weight of the planter on the opener or the installation of ballast weights. Openers of grain drills for resource saving technologies for grain crops can be divided into three groups – foot, disc and anchor. <b>Disc</b> <b>coulter</b> has varieties – single disc, double <b>disc</b> and montesquiu <b>coulter.</b> To analyze the cost of power for the operation of the opener, the following indicators – the minimum engine power of the tractor on the coulter and engine power of tractors per unit of working width.

40|$|Methods of {{evaluating}} the techniques and equipment used for direct drilling of seeds into untilled soils were reviewed and developed. Field tests {{were used to}} highlight seedling establishment problems and were complimented by a tillage bin technique which sought to isolate variables such as climate, soil type and soil moisture regime. The tillage bin technique involved collecting half-tonne undisturbed blocks of turf in open ended steel bins using a special turf cutting machine. These tillage bins were subjected to a common climate and moisture supply by placing them beneath transparent rain canopies and applying water artificially. Drilling utilized a support bed on which several bins were placed end to end and which was straddled by a moving gantry and tool testing apparatus operating on rails alongside. This facility allowed close visual appraisal {{to be made of}} the action of coulters and seed deposition and was operated at speeds which were infinitely variable, within limits. Seed metering was precisely controlled and selected coulter forces and soil physical properties were measured with the apparatus. Turf blocks, in their tillage bins, were returned to the rain protection canopies after drilling for plant response studies. Soil cover over the seed appeared to be important in promoting seedling emergence. Field covering devices were evaluated and a bar harrow was developed and adopted as a standard covering procedure. The importance of covering the seed appeared to be more pronounced with large seeds such as maize and barley than with smaller seeds such as lucerne. A strong relationship between visual scoring of the amount and type of cover, and seedling emergence data was established. This favoured covering media with a predominance of unbroken dead pasture mulch, compared with loose soil and rubble. The performances of a range of drill coulters operating at slow speeds in association with the bar harrow, were compared in terms of plant responses under soil moisture stress. An experimental chisel coulter was developed to obviate the noted shortcomings of some of these existing coulters. In contrast to the "V" shaped grooves left by most coulters, the chisel confined most of its soil disturbance to sub surface layers, with a narrow opening at the surface. With all coulters, seed germination appeared to be less affected by coulter design than seedling emergence because of sub surface mortality of seedlings. In this respect clear seedling emergence responses favoured the chisel coulter. Maximum wheat seedling emergence with the chisel coulter assembly was 77 %, which was significantly greater than hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> <b>with</b> 27 % and 26 % respectively. As the initial soil moisture level was raised in other experiments the magnitude of these differences decreased but the order of ranking remained. A 22 % comparative decrease in initial soil moisture content was necessary to reduce the performance of the chisel coulter to a similar level to that of the hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters.</b> Difficulty was experienced in accurately monitoring in-groove soil moisture regimes, but irrigation responses and gravimetric determinations of sub samples suggested that the ability of grooves to retain available soil moisture was a critical factor in the plant emergence responses. Soil temperatures appeared not to be greatly affected by coulter type in these experiments although the in-groove minimum temperature with the chisel coulter was significantly higher than the hoe and triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulters</b> in one experiment. Observation of the modes of action of coulters showed that the chisel and hoe coulters produced some upward soil heaving while the triple disc appeared to operate with a downward and outward wedging action in the soil. An increase in soil density under the groove resulted from passage of the triple <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> but no effect on density was seen with the chisel or hoe coulters. The down forces required for 38 mm penetration of all coulters tested, appeared also to be closely related to their modes of action and relatively insensitive to soil moisture content in the stress range. In this respect the triple disc required 1. 4 times more force than the dished <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> and from 2. 3 to 4. 6 times more force than a range of 4 other coulters. Field tests of the wear rates of chisel coulters constructed of various steel based materials, with and without hardening treatments, suggested a number of preferred treatments but could not establish any difference in wear rate from coulters operating in the tractor wheel marks compared with those operating in unmarked soil...|$|R

40|$|Modified {{design of}} a planter to be {{attached}} to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this project. This research project {{was part of a}} larger project, called “Developing robotics assisted technology for farming”. The main motivation for this research project is the fact that mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed. Besides, it should require less draft force compared to existing planters so that it can be pulled by the mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To find the forces between soil engagement tool (<b>disc</b> <b>coulter)</b> and soil, experiments were designed and performed in the Linear Soil Bin at University of Saskatchewan. Disc and tilt angle of a <b>disc</b> <b>coulter</b> was changed and draft, vertical and side forces applied to it were measured to find the disc and tilt angle combinations that results in minimum draft force. Experiments showed that 7 ° disc angle and 25 ° tilt angle provides the least draft force compared to other disc angle and tilt angle combinations. Then, using the knowledge obtained from literature and the soil bin experiments, a planter was designed conceptually and in detail, based on the existing CNH planter. For further analyses computer modeling was performed. The whole planter was modeled in 3 D, using SolidWorks. Stress analysis was performed in ANSYS Workbench to calculate safety factor of the designed parts. Two prototypes were fabricated and were attached to the mobile robot for field tests. Tests were performed in indoor settings to measure the total draft force required to pull developed planters. Draft force was very close to the value that was calculated in design stage. Results showed that an average of 460 N pulling force is required to pull one row planter for 50 mm depth of cut, which can be compared to n existing CNH corn planter that requires a pulling force of between 900 N to 1300 N.
