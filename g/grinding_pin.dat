40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} focus-variation technique in measurements of ultrasonic vibrations of grinding pins. Ultrasonic vibrations of tools are applied in ultrasonic assisted grinding. Their measurements are significant for development of this hybrid machining process. Alumina and zirconia ceramic materials in the final fired state were machined in experiments which are known as scratch tests. Diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>pin</b> {{was used as a}} tool to machine scratches. Marks of diamond grains, left on the surface of workpieces after machining process, were investigated using The Infinite Focus Real 3 D optical microscope. Focus-variation is the principle of operation of this microscope. Investigations concerned possibilities of measurements of an amplitude of axial and radial vibrations in the case of two ceramic materials. Results of performed measurements are presented and discussed for selected machining parameters...|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{automatic}} tool path generation was developed at Sandia National Laboratories for finish machining operations. The system {{consists of a}} commercially available 5 -axis milling machine controlled by Sandia developed software. This system {{was used to remove}} overspray on cast turbine blades. A laser-based, structured-light sensor, mounted on a tool holder, is used to collect 3 D data points around the surface of the turbine blade. Using the digitized model of the blade, a tool path is generated which will drive a 0. 375 inch diameter CBN <b>grinding</b> <b>pin</b> around the tip of the blade. A fuzzified digital filter was developed to properly eliminate false sensor readings caused by burrs, holes and overspray. The digital filter was found to successfully generate the correct tool path for a blade with intentionally scanned holes and defects. The fuzzified filter improved the computation efficiency by a factor of 25. For application to general parts, an adaptive scanning algorithm was developed and presented with simulation results. A right pyramid and an ellipsoid were scanned successfully with the adaptive algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This work {{is focused}} on {{determination}} of effects of grinding conditions on effectiveness of abrasive electrodischarge grinding (AEDG) process applied for removal of machining allowance and forming of surface geometrical texture (SGT). These results were compared with one obtained for conventional grinding. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental investigations of deep-seated surface grinding of Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy using CBN grinding wheel with metal bond were the ground for this elaboration. The effectiveness of AEDG process was assessed based on specific tangential grinding force and energy of spark electric discharge and machining results were estimated on geometrical structure parameters. Findings: The effectiveness of machining allowance removal depended on conditions of AEDG process. Significant differences in SGT formed by AEDG process and conventional grinding were revealed. Practical implications: Abrasive electrodischarge grinding is useful to be particularly suitable for efficient and effective grinding of very hard structural materials such as high-alloy steel, sintered carbides, metal-based composite materials etc. Originality/value: AEDG experiments were carried out using the typical surface finishing grinder and especially adapted generator of spark discharge pulses. The majority of such experiments in the world were performed with the electrodischarge machine tool equipped with extra grinding wheel mounted on the <b>grinding</b> <b>pin</b> and functioning {{as one of the}} electrodes put into operation via pneumatic drive...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of contact and non-contact measurements of external profiles of selected <b>grinding</b> <b>pins.</b> The measurements were conducted in order to choose the appropriate measuring technique {{in the case of the}} considered measurement task. In the case of contact measurements the coordinate measuring machine ACCURA II was applied. The used coordinate measuring machine was equipped with the contact scanning probe VAST XT and the Calypso inspection software. Contact coordinate measurements were performed by using of different measurement strategies. The applied strategies included different scanning velocities and distances between measured points. Non-contact measurements were conducted by means of the tool presetter produced by the Mahr company. On the basis of gained results the guidelines concerning measurements of <b>grinding</b> <b>pins</b> were formulated. The measurements of analyzed <b>grinding</b> <b>pins</b> performed by means of the non-contact measuring system are characterized by higher reproducibility than the contact measurements. The low reproducibility of contact measurements may be connected with the inaccuracy of the selected coordinate measuring machine and the measuring probe, the measurement parameters and environmental conditions in the laboratory where the coordinate measuring machine is located. Moreover, the paper {{presents the}} possible application of results of conducted investigations. The results of non-contact measurements can be used in the simulation studies of grinding processes. The simulations may reduce the costs of machining processes...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with investigating the effects of dressing parameters {{and the effect of}} the cutting speed on the performance of micro-grinding of titanium Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. Extremely high dressing overlap ratios were used {{for the first time to}} dress the <b>grinding</b> <b>pins,</b> and the obtained micro-topography, measured on the surface of the pins, is found to be directly related to the grinding forces. More specifically, both the normal and tangential grinding force components increased with the dressing overlap ratio. Related effects of dressing on surface quality are also presented. <b>Grinding</b> with <b>pins</b> containing finer topography was accompanied by less loading with chips and hence a better surface finish. Moreover, down-dressing method generated rougher finished surface quality and induced lower grinding forces compared to the up-dressing. High values of the dressing overlap ratio (up to 1830) in the up-dressing method improved the surface finish significantly...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to machine the silicon die of an IC chip and the surrounding chip packaging. The silicon die had to be reduced from a thickness of 85 ?m to about 50 ?m by a machining technique such that not a single transistor of the 40 million under the die is destroyed and at the same the die presents a mirror finish for examination on a back emission infra red microscope. The chip packaging had to be machined such that the six layers of power conduits in the form of copper traces and the dielectric (insulator) between them could be studied at low magnification for discontinuity. Initially electroplated diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>pins</b> were used for the die that was successful but it left undesirable tracks behind that remained even after polishing. These pins were not ideal for the soft but tough chip packaging.

40|$|Machining of {{hard and}} brittle {{materials}} always pose {{problems such as}} rough surface, cracks, subsurface damage and residual stresses mainly due to its brittle nature. Recent developments in cutting tool technology coupled with rigid ultraprecision machine tools {{have made it possible}} to machine hard and brittle materials like optical glass in ductile mode with crack free surfaces. However this technique is reported to be relatively slow and too expensive for manufacturing less precision products like ophthalmic lenses, which do not require extreme form accuracy. Though not possible to machine glass in fully ductile mode with conventional grinding, substantial amount of partial ductile mode areas generated on the ground surface is proven to reduce polishing time significantly to get mirror finish. In this study, resinoid bonded diamond pins, with and without a central hole were used to grind BK 7 optical glass. Plano grinding operation was carried out using a high-speed jig grinder air motor, which was attached to a vertical spindle CNC milling machine. Both wet and dry grinding operations were performed. In wet grinding, ductile-fracture areas and surface roughness of ground surface were investigated by varying grinding conditions. Diamond <b>grinding</b> <b>pins</b> with and without central hole were found to have an effect on surface finish and flatness on the ground surfaces. Central holed diamond pins produced better surface finish and were 5 times superior in flatness compared to surfaces ground with diamond pins without central hole. Subsequently, zero velocity effect that cause chips trapped underneath of diamond pins are completely eliminated. Insufficient coolant penetration into grinding zone and fixture rigidity were found to have contributed stalling marks. Applications of higher coolant flow rate of 5 litres/min together with a rigid pocket groove holder were successfully used to eliminate stalling and this set-up was used in subsequent experimental trials for ductile-fracture and surface roughness analysis. Maximum ductile streaks were obtained at the lowest feed (5 mm/min) and in-feed (5 Âµm) for both 64 Âµm and 126 Âµm grit diamond pins. Finer ductile streaks were observed with 64 Âµm than 126 Âµm grit diamond pins in almost all conditions probably due to grain size effects. An image processing procedure has been successfully developed to quantify objectively the fraction of ductile and fracture areas generated on ground surfaces. Among the four alternatives developed, method B provided the least error. A linear relationship model was established for surface roughness when grinding with 64 Âµm grit diamond pins. The feed was found to have significant effect on the response investigated. The model was verified by the confirmation run and therefore can be used for prediction within the limits of the factors investigated. In dry grinding, various types of chips morphology were observed. A discovery was made during this study, namely the observation of solid spherical glass chips obtained at the lowest cutting condition (feed = 2. 5 mm/min and infeed = 5 Âµm) and its formation mechanism is described. ...|$|R

By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|R
40|$|Broken rice {{was used}} for the {{production}} of dry-milled flour by <b>grinding</b> on <b>Pin</b> Mill. Particle sizes distribution of the resulting flour shown that major portion was coarse flour. Physicochemical properties of the flour with differing particle sizes were investigated and utilized as raw material in rice noodle production; Sen Yai and Sen Mee. The protein content decreased whereas the ash content increased with decreasing particle size. The amylose content of each fraction was similar. Water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI) were greater for fine flour. Fine flour also possessed high value of lightness (L*) and low yellowness (b*). Rapid visco analysis indicated that fine flour had lower gelatinization temperature while higher peak viscosity, breakdown and final viscosity than coarse flour. Thxtural characteristics of Sen Yai prepared from dry-milled rice flour were affected by particle sizes, flour slurry concentration, flour soaking and steaming time. Good qualities of Sen Yai were obtained from the finest flour (< 200 mesh) with 33 % flour concentration, 3 hrs soaking and 5 min steaming. Increasing in soaking time and steaming time improved the noodle qualities. A process for production of Sen Mee from dry-milled rice flour comprised a) mixing rice flour with 35 - 40 % pregelatinise flour, added some water then kneaded to obtain a dough b) extruding the dough to form the noodle c) steaming the noodles d) drying the noodle at 45 - 48 °C to a moisture content below 12 % by weight. Noodle quality was examined by cooking yield, cooking loss, tensile strength, break distance, hardness and stickiness. The results indicated that Sen Mee prepared from dry-milled rice flour gave rougher texture and easier to break up on cooking than the ones in the market...|$|R

On initial contact at Aliens, I was introduced to Mr. Colson, who informed me that his company of Consulting Engineers had introduced a scheme of methods engineering work study and incentives payment and that the results on the grinding section were not fully satisfactory. The machine loading was based on synthetics which were working in other factories. There was methods and planning charts from which the Methods Engineering and Planning Sections worked when loading work onto the shops and it was required that the shortcomings of these charts should be corrected.

40|$|Surface texture {{influences}} {{friction and}} transfer layer formation during sliding. In the present investigation, basic studies were conducted using inclined pin-on-plate sliding tester {{to understand the}} effect of directionality of surface grinding marks of hard material on friction and transfer layer formation during sliding against soft materials. 080 M 40 steel plates were ground to attain different surface roughness with unidirectional <b>grinding</b> marks. Then <b>pins</b> made of soft materials such as pure Al, pure Mg and Al-Mg alloy were slid against the prepared steel plates. Grinding angle (i. e., the angle between direction of sliding and grinding marks) was varied between 0 degrees and 90 degrees in the tests. Experiments were conducted under both dry and lubricated conditions on each plate in ambient environment. It was observed that the transfer layer formation and the coefficient of friction, which has two components adhesion and plowing - depend primarily on the directionality of grinding marks of the harder mating surface, and independent of surface roughness of the harder mating surface. For the case of pure Mg, stick-slip phenomenon was observed under dry condition for all grinding angles and it was absent upto 20 degrees grinding angles under lubricated condition. However, for the case of Al, it was observed only under lubricated conditions for angles exceeding 20 degrees. As regards the alloy, namely, Al-Mg alloy, it, was absent in both conditions. For the case of pure Mg and Al, {{it was observed that}} the amplitude of stick-slip motion primarily depends on plowing component of friction. The grinding angle effect on coefficient of friction was attributed to the variation of plowing component of friction with grinding angle...|$|R

And as my ear listened, and my mind wandered in this happy retrospect, my every faculty seemed exalted, and, without any thought upon the matter, I ground points upon my pins so fine, so regular, and so smooth that they would have pierced with ease the leather of a boot, or slipped, without abrasion, among the finest threads of rare old lace.
