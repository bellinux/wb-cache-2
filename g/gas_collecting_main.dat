However, the lighter-than-air sewer <b>gas</b> <b>collects</b> in the ceiling, while propane collects on the floor. The explosion showed that stored shoes were tossed up, meaning that the fuel had to be at ground level. An upwards bent beam was also crucial to determining that the blast had come from below.|$|R
