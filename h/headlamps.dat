5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow <b>headlamps</b> and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed <b>headlamps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. <b>headlamps,</b> tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s, as {{interest}} in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various <b>headlamp</b> cleaning systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced {{high pressure fluid}} <b>headlamp</b> washers {{on a variety of}} their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each <b>headlamp.</b> In 1972, <b>headlamp</b> cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden.|$|R
5|$|Presara: the luxury-oriented Presara {{features}} a lavishly appointed interior with {{features such as}} electric seats with a two-memory setting, a moonroof, push-start engine operation, a reversing camera, and satellite navigation. The Presara, marketed under the Grande moniker in New Zealand and the Middle East, also features high-intensity discharge <b>headlamps</b> with auto levelling front lighting system. When reversing, the side mirrors face down towards the ground (unless the mirror adjustment switch is in the off position) to assist the driver when parking in places where space is compromised.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lexus {{incorporated}} the first production eight-speed automatic transmission {{in an automobile}} with the LS 460, and the gearbox was later adapted for the GS 460 and IS F models. Continuously variable transmissions, regenerative brakes, and electric motors have been used on all Lexus hybrid models. In 2007, Lexus executives signaled intentions to equip further models with hybrid powertrains, catering to demands for a decrease in both carbon pollution and oil reliance. Hybrid models have been differentiated by separate badging and lighting technology; in 2008, the LS 600h L became the first production vehicle to use LED <b>headlamps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Winter service {{vehicles}} are usually {{based on a}} dump truck chassis, which are then converted into winter {{service vehicles}} either by the manufacturer or an aftermarket third-party. A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra <b>headlamps,</b> a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E

5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped <b>headlamps</b> and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector <b>headlamps.</b> The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} produce new product design with {{features}} such as a lower cost, higher quality than the original product is {{a key factor in}} meeting the market demand. Design for Assembly (DFA) has been widely used in industry and has produced many successes. Some of the methods known in the DFA industry now are the Boothroyd- Dewhurst DFA method, Hitachi assemblability analysis method (AEM) and the Lucas DFA-Hull method. With these well-known methods, many important changes and developments carried out either manually or through the automatic assembly. The goals of this project are to analyse existing <b>headlamp</b> using Boothroyd-Dewhurst DFA and Hitachi Assemblability Evaluation Method (AEM) in terms of assembly time, assembly cost and assembly efficiency. The <b>headlamp</b> that has been used in this project is a Saga BLM <b>headlamp.</b> The original <b>headlamp</b> and proposed <b>headlamp</b> design have been compared between each other’s and the best result is the proposed design which has the lowest assembly time, lowest assembly cost and highest percentage of design efficiency that is the third proposed design <b>headlamp</b> for each method...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{microcontroller}} based head-lamp alignment system for auto mobile. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to design a <b>headlamp</b> system for automobile that can turn angle of <b>headlamp</b> {{to have a better}} vision. A driver drives a car on road when goes to sharp corner at night that will some area that the light of <b>headlamp</b> cannot reach. Sometime driver may forget turns off the high beam and cause the other driver uncomfortable and cannot see the front view from opposite lane. Therefore, the design of <b>headlamp</b> alignment system is important to solve this issue. The other objective is to fabricate a <b>headlamp</b> model that can be control with Arduino Mega. Also make a choosing mode for driver to choose auto mode or manual mode operation. In auto mode operation, all input device is use sensor such as ultrasonic and potentiometer to control the alignment system of headlamp; all are automatically control the alignment system without used any switch.

25|$|Vehicles {{equipped}} with HID <b>headlamps</b> (except motorcycles) {{are required by}} ECE regulation 48 also to be {{equipped with}} headlamp lens cleaning systems and automatic beam leveling control. Both of these measures are intended to reduce the tendency for high-output <b>headlamps</b> to cause high levels of glare to other road users. In North America, ECE R48 does not apply and while lens cleaners and beam levelers are permitted, they are not required; HID <b>headlamps</b> are markedly less prevalent in the US, where they have produced significant glare complaints. Scientific study of headlamp glare has shown that for any given intensity level, the light from HID <b>headlamps</b> is 40% more glaring than the light from tungsten-halogen <b>headlamps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later hidden <b>headlamps</b> require {{one or more}} vacuum-operated servos and reservoirs, with {{associated}} {{plumbing and}} linkage, or electric motors, geartrains and linkages to raise the lamps to an exact position to assure correct aiming despite ice, snow and age.

25|$|In 1968 when Federal auto {{equipment}} and safety regulations were initiated, {{the requirement for}} two large or four small round sealed beams was codified, freezing headlamp design for many years. At the same time, the new regulations prohibited any decorative or protective element {{in front of the}} <b>headlamps</b> whenever the <b>headlamps</b> are switched on. Glass-covered <b>headlamps,</b> used on e.g. the Jaguar E-Type, pre-1968 VW Beetle, 1965 Chrysler and Imperial models, Porsche 356, Citroën DS and Ferrari Daytona were no longer permitted and vehicles had to be imported with uncovered <b>headlamps</b> for the US market. This change meant that vehicles with headlamp configurations designed for good aerodynamic performance could not achieve it for the US market.|$|E
