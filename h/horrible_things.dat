5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
25|$|The Druidic temple: A conical stone {{structure}} {{just east}} of the road south of the reservoir was said to be a site where local Druids practiced their rituals, and <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> might come to pass for any intruder who looked too closely or came at the wrong time. The building is actually an iron smelter left over from the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 when the United States was forced into creating an economic independence to complement its political freedom. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Clinton Furnace in 1976. It is currently fenced off by the Newark water department to prevent any entrance and the liability for injury that might result.|$|E

The damage to the PLO was enormous, according to Abu Iyad, Arafat's deputy. Most people in the West and even many Arabs could not distinguish between the ANO and Fatah, he said.

500|$|On April 22, 1986, Yankovic began {{recording}} {{three new}} original songs {{for his next}} album: [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes", [...] "One of Those Days", and [...] "Dog Eat Dog". Although [...] "Don't Wear Those Shoes" [...] is an original composition, Yankovic admitted that the intro {{was inspired by the}} style of The Kinks. Lyrically, the song is a plea by the singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand. [...] "One of Those Days" [...] is a song detailing <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> as if they were everyday annoyances. Each horrible thing escalates up to global annihilation while more mundane annoyances pop up at different times.|$|E
500|$|While writing Residente o Visitante, the duo {{took a trip}} to South America {{to explore}} areas {{populated}} by Latin America's indigenous and African-descended minorities. [...] Residente reflected on the journey, stating, [...] "We saw <b>horrible</b> <b>things,</b> but also things that were incredibly beautiful. [...] Some of the contrasts are really intense." [...] The duo was strongly influenced by the experience; Visitante discovered and purchased several new musical instruments on the trip including a quijada, a charango and a bombo legüero, {{all of which were}} used on the song [...] "Llegale a Mi Guarida". [...] Residente and Visitante felt that writing on the road was conducive to the group's creative output. [...] The group's journeys were documented in a film entitled Sin Mapa, which debuted on July 29, 2009 at the New York International Latino Film Festival and later was released on DVD.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> happened to him {{when he was a little}} kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

500|$|Winsor McCay first {{produced}} Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in 1904, a {{year before}} the dream romps of his Little Nemo and a full generation before the artists of the Surrealist movement unleashed the unconscious on the public. [...] The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day's protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his or her psyche. [...] Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. [...] Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women's mink coats having a fight. [...] Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves dismembered, buried alive from a first-person perspective or a child's mother being planted and becoming a tree. [...] In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> happen to someone close to [...] [...] The protagonists are typically urban bourgeoisie whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation or loss of social esteem or respectability.|$|E
500|$|In her {{piece for}} Salon, Janet Turley {{claimed that the}} women [...] "become {{reflections}} of the men", given that the True Detective universe is seen {{through the eyes of}} the show's male leads. Sam Adams of Indiewire contended that the season's central story focused on [...] "the <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> men do to women", many of which are never reported to or investigated by authorities. Adams wrote, [...] "No one missed Dora Lange. Marie Fontenot disappeared, and the police let a rumor stop them from following up". Furthermore, he observed that the role of women is only more profound because Cohle is made to suffer by virtue of his ex-wife and deceased daughter, and Hart is unable to [...] "deal appropriately with the women who are there". According to Scott Wilson, a cultural studies lecturer at Kingston University, women are distinguished into three groups—what he calls [...] "the superegoic, the obscene and the sacred". Maggie, in Wilson's interpretation, is portrayed as the superegoic wife who [...] "constantly makes demands on her guilty husband or partner tying him or her down and deflecting him or her from his symbolic role as police." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> pounce on people, and they make you think you want to see this movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made <b>Horrible</b> <b>Things</b> Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E

It is a still more <b>horrible</b> <b>thing</b> to see tigers caught up and entangled and torn in machinery. It is horrible, a chaos beyond chaos, an unthinkable hell.|$|R

2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really <b>horrible</b> <b>things</b> were happening.|$|E

2500|$|Independent scholar Matthew White, in his popular {{history book}} The Great Big Book of <b>Horrible</b> <b>Things,</b> claims an {{estimated}} 4.6 {{million people were}} killed under his reign.

According to research by Stanford University and Cambridge University academic historian Audrey Truschke, he [...] "did not perpetrate anything resembling a genocide of Hindus." [...] The population estimates of economic historian Angus Maddison also show that the Indian population increased from 135 million in 1600 (under Akbar's reign) to 165 million in 1700 (under Aurangzeb's reign), an increase of 30 million between 1600 and 1700.|$|E

He wrote: [...] "In direct refutation of this portrayal {{is the fact that}} relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." [...] Later, Powell's assessment would be described as whitewashing the news of the massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public. In May 2004 Powell said to television and radio host Larry King, [...] "I was in a unit that was responsible for My Lai. I got there after My Lai happened.

Then {{it was just a matter}} of working out exactly how." [...] Taylor received [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] criticism for his Injustice comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to [...] "unfridge" [...] Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented [...] "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope." ...|$|E
