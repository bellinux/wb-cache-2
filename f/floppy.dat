5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and <b>floppy</b> disk. A <b>floppy</b> disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the <b>floppy</b> disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog to fit the game onto six diskettes.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in <b>floppy</b> disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a <b>floppy</b> drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5000|$|Windows NT 3.1 {{could be}} {{installed}} either {{by using the}} CD-ROM and a provided boot disk, or by utilizing a set of twenty-two 3.5" [...] <b>floppies</b> (twenty-three <b>floppies</b> for Advanced Server). Windows NT 3.1 could also be installed over the network. A coupon was included {{that made it possible}} to order a set of twenty-seven 5.25" [...] <b>floppies</b> (or twenty-eight <b>floppies</b> for Advanced Server). Compared to the <b>floppies,</b> the CD-ROM contained additional drivers and applications.|$|R
50|$|When {{formatted}} as XDF disks, 3½-inch <b>floppies</b> {{can hold}} 1860 KB, and 5¼-inch <b>floppies</b> can hold 1540 KB, using different number of sectors {{as well as}} different sector size per track (not all sectors in the same track are of the same size).|$|R

5|$|The low-end {{model was}} sold with 1MB memory, a 1.44 MB <b>floppy</b> drive, no hard disk, and {{included}} a keyboard for $999. The high-end model cost $1,499 but contained an additional 1MB memory expansion card and a 40MB hard disk.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading the}} work of Mark Frauenfelder on Boing boing, Idol hired him to use {{graphics}} software {{in the design of}} artwork associated with the album. This included its use for the album and singles' cover art, the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk <b>floppy</b> disk, and in the press pack released to the media.|$|E
5000|$|The {{playing field}} is a carpeted, {{rectangular}} area. Alliances score points by positioning [...] "floppies," [...] their robots, and a [...] "puck" [...] on the playing field. [...] "Floppies" [...] are light-weight, pillow-like objects with Velcro-loop material located in its centre and around its perimeter. The [...] "puck" [...] is a short, octagonal platform that rolls freely on castor wheels. Around {{the perimeter of the}} field are four stations for human players, who may throw <b>floppies</b> to each other or onto the playing field. Two additional areas around the field are for the human players who control the robots. At the start of each match, each human player station contains three of the alliance's <b>floppies.</b> Four <b>floppies</b> per alliance are located on the playing field. The <b>floppies</b> are color-coded to identify alliance ownership.|$|R
5000|$|Modular Micro Group sold two {{different}} models. The Zorba 7 sold for $1,595. It had a 7" [...] green CRT screen and 2 410K <b>floppies.</b> The Zorba 2000 sold for $2,000. It had a 9" [...] green or yellow screen, 2 820K <b>floppies,</b> and an available 10 meg hard drive.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of the DISCiPLE and +D systems, most software released for them took the form of utility software. The ZX Spectrum +3 enjoyed much more success when it came to commercial software releases on <b>floppy</b> disk. More than 700 titles were released on 3-inch disk from 1987 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch <b>floppy</b> disk drive (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long <b>floppy</b> ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E

5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with {{the black and white}} of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in <b>floppy</b> disk drive in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional <b>floppy</b> disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on both <b>floppy</b> disk and CD-ROM, with the CD version featuring a fully voiced cast of characters. For the Japanese PlayStation and Saturn releases, all voice acting was redone by a prominent Japanese comedian, a major selling point for the game in Japan. A port had been under way for the Philips CD-i in 1996, and had entered its final stages of development, but was never released.|$|E
5000|$|The basic 1130 {{came with}} an IBM 2310 voice-coil {{actuated}} disk drive, called [...] "Ramkit", from IBM's General Products Division in San Jose. These read pizza-box-sized IBM 2315 single platter cartridges that held 512,000 words or 1,024,000 bytes (less than a 3.5" [...] HD <b>floppy's</b> 1.44Mb {{or even the}} 5.25" [...] HD <b>floppy's</b> 1.2Mb).|$|R
5000|$|When half-height {{floppy-disk drives}} and hard disks became available, Eagle drives that had worn out could be {{replaced}} with ones that took up less space and drew less power. The Eagle BIOS supported up to two double-sided floppy-disk drives and up to four 8 MB hard-disk partitions. Systems could be built with two half-height <b>floppies</b> and a 10, 20, or 32 MB hard disk. (A system with two <b>floppies</b> and a 10 MB hard disk was jokingly called a [...] "IV plus", while one with a 20 MB hard disk was called a [...] "4 and a half" [...] however many <b>floppies</b> it had.) ...|$|R
50|$|Their early <b>floppies</b> were {{manufactured}} at {{a factory}} in Limerick, Republic of Ireland starting 1979.|$|R
5|$|The only <b>floppy</b> {{disk drives}} that were readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 disk drive which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one disk drive sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was normally a <b>floppy,</b> wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred several generations of silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, <b>floppy</b> ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E

5000|$|IBM developed, {{and several}} {{companies}} copied, an autoloader mechanism that can load {{a stack of}} <b>floppies</b> {{one at a time}} into a drive. These are very bulky systems, and suffer from media hangups and chew-ups more than standard drives, [...] but they were a partial answer to replication and large removable storage needs. The smaller 5¼- and 3½-inch <b>floppies</b> made this a much easier technology to perfect.|$|R

5|$|In 1996, Bruce Perens {{assumed the}} project leadership. Perens was a {{controversial}} leader, regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian. He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month-long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship {{in the midst}} of the free software vs. open source debate, Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF. He led the conversion of the project from a.out to ELF. He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single <b>floppy,</b> and wrote a new installer. By the time Debian 1.2 was released, the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers. Perens left the project in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Square trademarked Seiken Densetsu in , {{intending}} {{to use it}} for a game project subtitled The Emergence of Excalibur, and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System. According to early advertisements, the game would consist of an unprecedented five <b>floppy</b> disks, {{making it one of the}} largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point. Although Square solicited pre-orders for the game, Kaoru Moriyama, a former Square employee, affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages. In October 1987, customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded. The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role-playing game in a similar vein: Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. <b>Floppy</b> trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E
