As human beings evolved in a gravitational field of 1g (9.8m/s²), an ideal propulsion system would be one that provides a continuous acceleration of 1g (though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the ill effects of free fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of taste, or leaching of calcium from their bones.|$|E

After Yukina blackmails him, Shigure does things to try to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> one of them being finding out her glasses secret to no avail. Shigure denies that he has feelings for Yukina but for some reason can't understand why he feels he needs to keep Yukina to himself. He is also jealous of Akira and Hisame but denies it, he later on confesses his love to Yukina but because of her unsure feelings in the past, she did not respond to his feelings until after Shigure came back from his studies and told him her feelings. They started going out.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's death {{marked the}} end of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, a period of {{discovery}} characterised by journeys of geographical and scientific exploration in a largely unknown continent without any of the benefits of modern travel methods or radio communication. In the preface to his 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of Scott's team on the Terra Nova Expedition, wrote: [...] "For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> give me Shackleton every time".|$|E

500|$|Despite [...] "new celebrity" [...] status, Bell {{claimed that}} she was not {{concerned}} because [...] "no one ever recognizes me anyway". As Bell explained, [...] "I hang out with Hayden quite a bit—they never take pictures of me. I just step to the side, and I push myself in front of her when she wants to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> or put her in the car." [...] Bell was a recurring guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, appearing in interviews as well as sketches. On The Late Late Show, she shows a humorous hostility towards Craig's robot skeleton sidekick Geoff Peterson, claiming that she had wanted to be Craig's sidekick on his show and taking it upon herself to cut Geoff down every chance she gets. Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E
500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, and felt like writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Mansfield's {{first film}} part was a {{supporting}} role in Female Jungle, a low-budget drama completed in ten days {{while she was still}} a student at UCLA. Her part was filmed over a span of just a few days, and she was paid $150 ($ in [...] dollars). The film was released unofficially in early 1955. In February 1955, James Byron, her manager and publicist, negotiated a seven-year contract with Warner Brothers, who were intrigued by her publicity antics. The contract initially paid her $250 a week ($ in [...] dollars) and landed her two films—one for an insignificant role and another unreleased for two years. She filed for separation from Paul Mansfield that January. Mansfield was given bit parts in Pete Kelly's Blues (1955), starring Jack Webb, and Hell on Frisco Bay (1955), starring Alan Ladd. She acted in one more movie with Warner Brothers—another small, but significant role opposite Edward G. Robinson in the courtroom-drama Illegal (1955). Dissatisfied with the Warner contract, she hired attorney Greg Bautzer to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, Marvel Studios {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to shoot the film primarily out of EUE/Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Michigan was also in contention to land the production, but the Michigan Film Office could not match North Carolina's tax incentives. In April 2012, Ben Kingsley entered into negotiations to play a villain in Iron Man 3. The following week, producer Kevin Feige revealed that Iron Man 3 would begin shooting in North Carolina [...] "in five weeks," [...] and said that it [...] "is a full-on Tony Stark-centric movie... very much inspired by {{the first half of}} Iron Man ... e's stripped of everything, he's backed up against a wall, and he's gotta use his intelligence to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He can't call Thor, he can't call Cap, he can't call Nick Fury, and he can't look for the Helicarrier in the sky." [...] A few days later, The Walt Disney Company China, Marvel Studios and DMG Entertainment announced an agreement to co-produce Iron Man 3 in China. DMG partly financed, produced in China with Marvel, and handled co-production matters. DMG also distributed the film in China in tandem with Disney.|$|E
500|$|Under earlier {{contractual}} theory {{a contract}} was an [...] "empty form" [...] {{that the two}} parties, as equal partners, could use to create such obligations and rights as they saw fit. Once a contract was signed, ways to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> were limited to whether it had been signed under duress, misrepresentation, or fraud. The general theory was freedom of contract; a contract can include almost any terms, as long as both parties agree to them. But in reality this doctrine was problematic. Firstly, while {{the idea that a}} person should be held to those terms he agrees to and signs works well with individually negotiated contracts, it does not with [...] "standard form" [...] contracts– printed, non-specific contracts drawn up in advance by one party, such as those used by banks. Such contracts can include clauses that severely restrict the rights of one party (exclusion clauses). Secondly, while the idea that signing a contract indicates consent worked well when there was little disparity between the parties, when the parties are a small business or individual and a major corporation, the smaller party may have to [...] "take or leave" [...] the contract, which can be a problem if all other corporations in the industry use similar terms. Although it had long been argued that [...] "unfair" [...] clauses should be struck down, the courts were obliged by the doctrine of freedom of contract to uphold them.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing how to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in Ripken's career, he became the only Ripken in the Orioles' organization, as the Orioles ousted his father as coach and traded Billy to Texas. His slump {{continued}} {{at the start of the}} 1993 season, but Ripken managed to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in May by adopting a taller batting stance. Because of his early-season struggles, some criticized him for playing every day. Bobby Bonds said of Ripken's playing every day, [...] "That's idiotic. If I were his manager, he'd be out of there." [...] Oriole coach Davey Lopes responded that only Ripken could tell whether or not he needed a day off. On June 6, Ripken injured his knee during a brawl against the Seattle Mariners and was convinced for most of the next day that he would be unable to play. However, the knee felt better at gametime, enabling the streak to continue. Ripken achieved a personal milestone on July 10, when he collected his 2,000th career hit, during a game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards against Wilson Álvarez of the White Sox. Because of Ripken's struggles, most managers and some sportswriters felt he should be left out of the All-Star Game in Baltimore that year; however, the fans gave him over two million votes to ensure his spot. Following the All-Star break, Ripken's hitting improved greatly, as he batted [...]300 with 14 home runs and 46 RBI for the rest of the season. He finished the year batting [...]257 with 24 home runs and 90 RBI.|$|E
500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. There have been so many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
