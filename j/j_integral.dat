40|$|In this paper, the {{mechanics}} of a semi-infinite crack interacting with near crack-tip singularities (e. g., dislocations) in two-dimensional solids is investigated using the concept of potential energy release rate. The spontaneous relationship between the crack potential energy release rate and the well-known vector conservative <b>integral</b> <b>J</b> i (i = 1, 2) is derived. It is demonstrated that J 1 and <b>J</b> 2 <b>integrals</b> are equally important in solving crack problems. This allows a more rational criterion to be proposed, based on the criterion of maximum energy release rate, to assess the so-called shielding/amplification effect on the crack tip due {{to the presence of}} the singularities. It is shown that the new criterion can not only assess the shielding/amplification effect under pure mode I or mode II remote loading, but also efficiently assess crack-singularity interaction under mixed mode remote loading. Simultaneously, it is found by re-examining the <b>J</b> i <b>integrals</b> that there exists a simple but universal relation among the three values of the vector <b>J</b> i <b>integral</b> corresponding separately to the contributions induced from the semi-infinite crack tip, the singularity, and the remote loading. Next, a multi-singularity-crack interaction model is addressed, and the closed-form solution is obtained. Finally, as an example, the problem of a single dislocation interacting with a main crack is solved to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and the new criterion. </p...|$|R

50|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} James R. Rice (then at Brown University) and G. P. Cherepanov {{independently}} {{developed a new}} toughness measure to describe the case where there is sufficient crack-tip deformation that the part no longer obeys the linear-elastic approximation. Rice's analysis, which assumes non-linear elastic (or monotonic deformation theory plastic) deformation ahead of the crack tip, is designated the J-integral. This analysis is limited to situations where plastic deformation at the crack tip does not extend to the furthest edge of the loaded part. It also demands that the assumed non-linear elastic behavior of the material is a reasonable approximation in shape and magnitude to the real material's load response. The elastic-plastic failure parameter is designated JIc and is conventionally converted to KIc using Equation (3.1) of the Appendix to this article.

40|$|International audienceThe goal of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{severity}} of semi-elliptical crack defects and to study the degree of damage in the poly-ethylene pipe in bending during the crack propagation. The semi-elliptical cracks are considered in this work located in different position in {{the wall of the}} pipe. The three finite element method based on the computation of the <b>J</b> <b>integral</b> was used to analyse the fracture behaviour of these structures. The effect of the position, shape and size of the crack on the <b>J</b> <b>integral</b> values was highlighted. The effects of strain rate and the temperature on the <b>J</b> <b>integral</b> values were also examined. The obtained results show that the strain rates have a strong influence on the <b>J</b> <b>integral</b> values especially for circumferential crack at higher bending moment. However, the energy for circumferential crack is more important compared to axial crack. The effect of the depth of the crack becomes important when the ratio (a/t) reaches a critical value of 0. 6 (a/t = 0. 6), especially when the ratio a/c is weak (semi-elliptical crack, a/c = 0. 2) where the <b>J</b> <b>integral</b> values becomes independently of the crack depth, this conclusion is opposite to the above for the poly-ethylene pipe subjected to internal pressure. We recall finally, that the temperature effect on circumferential cracks behaviour is more important compared to the axial cracks at critical crack size (a/c = 0. 2 and a/t = 0. 6). It is also shown that in the wall of pipe, the internal cracks are more dangerous than the external cracks...|$|E
