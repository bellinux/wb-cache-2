The application to an exchange option is made attempt and the valuation formula for this option like the Black-Scholes one is derived. A simple relation similar to the put-call-parity between the <b>exchange</b> <b>call</b> option and the put option is provided.

It is of great theoretical and practical significance to study the foreign exchange options, especially its pricing model. In order to more accurately portray the authenticity of foreign exchange market, this paper applies fractional Brown motion in the fractal market hypothesis and combines with jump diffusion process so as to establish the pricing model of foreign exchange option. Moreover, this paper put forward the pricing formulas of European foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>call</b> and put option, as well as their relationships by using the method of insurance actuary pricing.

40|$|Properly {{designed}} handover {{procedure in}} cellular wireless systems {{are essential for}} maintaining continuity of a call in progress and minimizing the probability of forced termination, signaling and switching load on the network. In this research, the Handover Channel Exchange (HCE) scheme is modeled and analyzed for channels between two mobiles that are moving in opposite directions across the handover area of adjacent cells of a GSM network. The channel exchange method is interesting since it yields low values of handover failure probability {{as compared to the}} case with no channel exchange. This work compares the performance of the cellular system with and without channel exchange, using the data obtained from a GSM network, with MATLAB as the platform for the simulation and analysis. The results as presented show improvement in handover failure probability obtained by using the channel exchange as against that of no channel exchange obtained from the GSM network General Terms: failure Probability, Handover Channel <b>Exchange,</b> <b>call</b> arrival rate...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study three different, but {{interconnected}} low-factor market models: LIBOR market model, Markov-functional model, and two-currency Markov-functional model. The LIBOR market model (LMM) {{is one of}} the most popular term structure models. However, it suffers from a major drawback, it is high-dimensional. The problem of highdimensionality can be in part solved imposing a separability condition. We will be interested how the separability condition interacts with time-homogeneity, a desirable property of an LMM. We address this question by parametrising two- and three-factor separable and time-homogeneous LMMs and show that they are of practical interest. Markov-functional models (MFMs) are a computationally efficient alternative to the LMMs. We consider two aspects of the MFMs, implementation and specification. First we provide two new algorithms that can be used to implement the one-dimensional MFM under the terminal and the spot measure driven by a general diffusion process. Since the existing literature has been focused exclusively on the Gaussian driving processes our algorithms open the scope for new parameterisations. We then prove that the dynamics of the onedimensional MFM are only affected by the time dependence of the driving process, described by a copula, and not by its marginal distributions. We then shift our focus and show that the one-dimensional MFM under the terminal measure is closely related to the one-factor separable local-volatility LMM. Finally, we move our attention to the models of a two-currency economy. We propose a new three-factor model that we calibrate to the domestic and foreign caplet prices and the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>call</b> options. To maintain the no-arbitrage condition while calibrating to foreign exchange market we propose a predictor-corrector type step. It is our conjecture that the predictor-corrector step converges, thus the model is well defined...|$|E
