However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person". During an interview with Nicole Mastrogiannis of iHeartRadio, the singer explained {{the meaning of the}} album track-by-track, saying that [...] "Sober" [...] was about being blinded by love in an unhealthy relationship: [...] "It's easy to run away from your feelings, but I have to understand, and people need to understand, that {{you have to go through}} everything. You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in that situation where you can't help it.

Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Mussenden {{was hired}} as casting director, and held casting calls {{throughout}} the United States including San Antonio, Texas, Miami, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Casting calls began on March 16, 1996 and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose 10-year-old Becky Lee Meza of Harlingen to portray young Selena, her acting debut. [...] Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena {{and that it would}} be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition. Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was [...] "among the strongest". Lopez had previously worked with Nava in My Family (1995). Screen testing was described as [...] "grueling" [...] and required [...] "nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script." [...] After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play a Texan of Mexican descent. The Mexican media disapproved the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: [...] "I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus [...] <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> really supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was [...] "a little hurtful", and felt the protesters [...] "should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Lopez, one of our own, is becoming a star." [...] The announcement was described as the [...] "role of a lifetime." [...] from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million, which made Lopez the highest paid Hispanic actress in history. Dave Karger of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "nothing could have prepared [...] for the hype attached to her million-dollar salary." ...|$|E
