Enthusiasts at the Bay of Islands Canterbury Charitable Trust proposed the idea of scuttling her as a dive wreck at Deep Water Cove in the Bay of Islands. The New Zealand Navy ships Tui and Waikato are already lying on the ground off the Tutukaka Coast, while the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior was scuttled off Matauri Bay. It is hoped that the wreck, in addition to becoming an artificial reef enhancing biodiversity, will also provide additional options for the regions diving tourism. It is considered that removed scrap metal and equipment (such as ship's lockers or the propeller) will bring up to NZ$400,000 to offset the NZ$650,000 costs of cleaning up and scuttling her, while the worth to the local economy could be in the millions. The ship itself had been sold to the trust for a symbolic NZ$1.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 she was {{chartered}} to the American Star Line (Greek owned) and renamed Betsy Ross for cruises between Florida and Brazil. However, {{these were}} undersubscribed so instead she ran cruises between Venice and Piraeus until being laid-up. By this time her general condition was deteriorating and a charter for African cruises {{had to be}} abandoned after a short time.In 1989 she was chartered as Amalfi, only to be laid up for debt at Venice. She was purchased at auction in 1990 by Stargas, renamed Star of Venice, and put under the Vanuatu flag. After a fire in 1991 she was repaired in Rijeka only to become a <b>floating</b> police <b>hostel</b> in 1992 both at Genoa and at Pianosa, Italy, at that time a maximum-security prison island which housed terrorists {{and members of the}} Mafia. Once more she was laid up at Venice until being brought into operation for Mediterranean Cruises in 1998, with disastrous results stemming from her poor mechanical condition. In 2000 she was last used as a hotel ship at Ravenna.|$|R
