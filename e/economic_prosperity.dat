30|$|In {{reviewing}} the previous studies, {{we find that}} not many research efforts have examined the performance assessment on energy usage and sustainability in Asian nations {{even if they have}} been developing their <b>economic</b> <b>prosperities</b> in a short period, but simultaneously suffering from various pollution problems. In particular, China and India are such good examples of such a rapid development. In contrast, Asia contains many underdeveloped nations such as Bangladesh and North Korea. As a consequence of such existence of large developed and small undeveloped nations, previous DEA studies have not yet explored the relationship between energy usage and sustainability development in Asia.|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{increased}} wartime {{manufacturing and}} industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity,</b> and Indianapolis's population increased from 8,000 in 1850 to 45,000 at the end of 1864. A real-estate boom led to the establishment of new residential suburbs, but the city retained its slums. Indianapolis also experienced improvements to its public services, such as health care, utilities, street railways, and public schools. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. Construction for the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument began in 1888, in the center of downtown Indianapolis, after decades of discussion. The city's iconic monument was dedicated on May 15, 1902.|$|E

Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E

The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions.

5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth {{ushered in a}} new era of <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity</b> and the rise of labor unions in the city. By 1880 Indianapolis was Indiana's commercial and industrial center. New industries in Indianapolis included pork-packing plants and foundries, as well as numerous manufacturers, small businesses, retail shops, and banks. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory on Indianapolis's Pearl Street, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. The Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards Company, another major employer, opened in 1877. After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a transportation hub. Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
5|$|Lima flourished {{during the}} 17th century {{as the center}} of an {{extensive}} trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern-day Panama. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty was required to go through Callao on its way to and from overseas markets. The resulting <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity</b> of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.|$|E

The Xin regime, established by the former regent Wang Mang, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from Chang'an to Luoyang. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.|$|E
5|$|The last Hindu {{function}} for Hell-based reincarnations is the text Preta khanda in the Garuda Purana used by Hindu priests during Śrāddha rituals.

This ritual {{is directly related to the}} <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity</b> of Hindu priests and their ability to “save” the dying soul from a hellish reincarnation through gifts given on behalf of the deceased to the priest performing the ritual. With each gift given, crimes committed during the deceased's life are forgiven and the next life is progressively improved.|$|E
5|$|By 1826, <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity</b> was {{beginning}} {{to return to the}} state. The Old Court party augmented their majority in the House and gained a majority in the Senate. One legislator's proposition to resolve the controversy was to call for the resignation of the governor and lieutenant governor, the entire General Assembly, as well as the justices from both the Old and New Courts, essentially allowing the state to reset its entire government. This extreme measure was rejected. Instead, on December 29, 1826, the General Assembly repealed the reorganization act, and overrode Governor Desha's veto of the measure. They also repealed the replevin law that had touched off the controversy. On January 1, 1827, Francis Blair returned the court records in his possession to the Old Court.|$|E

3000|$|Although the {{scientific}} claim {{proposed by the}} IPCC is very important, this study can easily imagine that no organization {{at the level of}} nations and companies pay serious attention the claim, because the IPCC within the UN does not have any clear implementation strategy from business and policy perspectives. We also combat not only the global warming and climate change but also other types of various pollutions (e.g., air, water and nuclear waste pollutions). It may be true that all the entities (i.e., nations and companies) prefer the development of their clean images, indeed, so that they can attain their <b>economic</b> <b>prosperities.</b> The reality may be different from the truth. Just a green image is important for them. A typical example {{can be found in the}} recent corporate scandal of Volkswagen in 2015 that has been long cheating on the CO 2 emissions produced by cars.

5|$|By 1920, due {{in large}} part to the city's <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity,</b> Cleveland became the nation's fifth largest city. The city counted Progressive Era {{politicians}} such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders. In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland's incorporation as a city, the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown. Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression, it drew four million visitors in its first season, and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937. The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport, among others.|$|E

Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|The American Civil War altered Indiana's society, politics, and economy, {{beginning}} a population shift to central and northern Indiana, {{and contributed to}} a relative decline {{in the southern part}} of the state. Increased wartime manufacturing and industrial growth in Hoosier cities and towns ushered in a new era of <b>economic</b> <b>prosperity.</b> By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural state than it previously had been. Indiana's votes were closely split between the parties for several decades after the war, making it one of a few key swing states that often decided national elections. Between 1868 and 1916, five Indiana politicians were vice-presidential nominees on the major party tickets. In 1888 Benjamin Harrison, one of the state's former Civil War generals, was elected president of the United States.|$|E
