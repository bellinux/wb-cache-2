40|$|International audienceA {{calculation}} procedure {{to determine the}} influence of the silicone volume fraction on the physical absorption of VOCs in water/silicone oil mixtures is presented (eta(silicone) oil = 5 mPa s). It is based on the ''equivalent absorption capacity'' concept previously developed by Dumont et al. (2010) 111 and applied to a countercurrent gas-liquid absorber. The {{calculation procedure}} is first applied to three VOCs: dimethylsulphide (DMS), <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> (DMDS) and toluene, and then generalised to other VOCs. The influence of VOC partition coefficients (H(voc,water) and H(voc,solvent)) and the ratio MR = H(voc,water) /H(voc,solvent) is shown. For VOCs having a much higher affinity for silicone oil than for water (m(R) > 20 as for DMDS and toluene). it is preferable to use pure silicone oil rather than water/silicone oil mixtures for absorption.

40|$|Hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) is a {{catalytic}} process {{aimed at}} reducing the nitrogen content of petroleum crudes. We studied the reactivity of organic nitrogen compounds, aniline and indole, representative of those present in the crudes. The catalytic tests were {{carried out in the}} presence of H 2 S in the reacting gas phase. It was generated in situ by adding sulphur compounds which decomposed easily to H 2 S and hydrocarbon. The use of CS 2 as H 2 S precursor led to the occurrence of side reactions: two methylindole isomers were identified in the indole reaction products. These side reactions were not observed with other H 2 S precursors like <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> or diethyldisulphide. We established that the formation of the methylindole isomers results from a reaction between (undecomposed) CS 2 and the five-membered hetero-ring of indole or indoline and we proposed a two-step reaction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} {{absorption of}} three Volatile Organic Compounds (<b>dimethyldisulphide</b> (DMDS), dimethylsulphide (DMS) and toluene) in "water/silicone oil" systems {{at a constant}} flow rate for mixtures of different compositions (f = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 100 %) was investigated using a dynamic absorption method. The results indicate that silicone oil addition leads to a dramatic decrease in KLa which {{can be related to}} the change in the partition coefficient (Hmix). They confirm the results obtained for styrene absorption using another measurement technique [15]. The interpretation of the results using dimensionless ratios KLa(f) /KLa(f= 0 %) and KLa(f) /KLa(f= 100 %) versus f also confirms the importance of the partition coefficient ratio mR = Hwater/Hoil in the KLa change. Moreover, the results obtained for toluene absorption in "air/water/silicone oil" systems (f = 10, 15 and 20 %) suggest that the mass transfer pathway is in the order gas→water→oil for these operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} of this work was to propose a model able to predict the partition coefficient of odorous or toxic gaseous pollutants (dimethylsulphide, <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> and toluene) in water/silicone oil mixtures. Experimental measurements using a static headspace method were carried out for pure water (H(voc,water)), for pure silicone oil (H(voc,solvent)) and for mixtures of varying composition (H(voc,mixture)). The dramatic decrease in the partition coefficient (H(voc,mixture)) with oil addition clearly showed a deviation from linearity, which was more pronounced for increasing H(voc,water) /H(voc,solvent) ratios. Moreover, experiments using a dynamic absorption method underlined that the absorption capacity of a biphasic water/silicone oil mixture can be classed as the absorption capacity of a pseudo-homogeneous phase whose physical properties (molecular weight and density) can be calculated from the physical properties of water and solvent, and balanced using the ''equivalent absorption coefficients'' H(voc,mixture) /H(voc,water) and H(voc,mixture) /H(voc,solvent). An ''equivalent absorption capacity'' concept is then proposed, which should be useful to design absorption units using two-phase liquid mixtures {{for the treatment of}} industrial air loaded with volatile organic compounds.

40|$|From natural samplex eleven {{isolates}} {{were obtained}} which {{were capable of}} cometabolic degradation of trichlsoroethylene (TCE) by an enzyme system for phenol degradation. At an initial TCE concentration of 1 mg/l, the resting cells of particular cultures degraded 33 - 94 % TCE in 24 hours and their transformation capacities ranged from 0. 3 to 3. 1 mg TCE/g organic fraction. Further an analysis of a mixed phenol-fed culture with an excellent TCE-degrading ability was performed. A markedly minority isolate represented in the consortium {{was found to be}} responsible for this property. This culture, designated RF 2, degraded TCE even at a low inoculum density and attained a transformation capacity of 14. 7 mg TCE/g. The increase in chslorides concentration after degradation was quantitative when compared with the decrease in organically bound chlorine. Attention was further given to the effect of <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> on the degree of TCE degradation while proving this substance can significantly reduce dthe degrading ability of some tested cultures (as much as 60 %) however, it does not cause this inhibition with others...|$|E
40|$|The light-struck {{taste is}} a defect of bottled white wine {{due to the}} light {{exposure}} and involving the riboflavin (RF), as a photosensitizer, and methionine. The reaction pathways lead {{to the formation of}} volatile sulfur compounds, methanethiol and <b>dimethyldisulphide,</b> conferring cabbage-like aromas. The development of this defect is limited at low RF concentrations. In this study, the yeast-mediated release of RF, RF degradation kinetics in model solution and white wine, and RF removal by using insoluble adjuvants were investigated. The results showed the RF release was a strain-dependent property and the fermentation rate did not affect the RF synthesis. The RF degradation followed a 1 st order kinetic in both model solution and white wine in which the degradation rate was halved. Among the adjuvants tested, bentonite and active charcoal were the most effective in RF removal and higher concentrations were needed for effectively treating white wine. The selection of low RF-producing yeasts and the treatment with active charcoal could represent useful tools to avoid the white wine spoilage during the shelf-life...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{identification}} of a sex pheromone in a heliozelid moth, Holocacista capensis van Nieukerken & Geertsema. This leafminer recently infested grapevine in South Africa. Compared to solvent extraction of pheromone glands, solid phase microextraction (SPME) proved to be highly effective for collection of the pheromone from calling females. The volatiles collected by SPME were analyzed by gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC/EAD). Three compounds eliciting electrophysiological activity from the male antenna were identified as (Z) - 5 -tetradecenal, (Z) - 7 -tetradecenal, and (Z) - 9 -hexadecenal by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). GC/MS analysis of <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> (DMDS) derivatives of fatty acyl moieties in pheromone gland extracts confirmed {{the presence of the}} corresponding putative pheromone precursors with double bonds in the same position and with Z geometry. Field trapping experiments in a South African vineyard confirmed that both (Z) - 5 -tetradecenal and (Z) - 7 -tetradecenal are essential for the attraction of male H. capensis, whereas addition of (Z) - 9 -hexadecenal to the blend did not affect the attractiveness.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} {{activated}} sludge acclimation on the biodegradation of toluene and <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> (DMDS) {{in the presence}} of a nonaqueous phase liquid, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), in a two-phase partitioning bioreactor was characterized. The influence of the presence of PDMS, at a ratio of 25 % (v/v), and acclimation of activated sludge on two hydrophobic VOC biodegradation was studied. Activated sludge were acclimated to each VOC and {{in the presence of}} the non-aqueous phase liquid, namely in the emulsion of PDMS in water. Using acclimated cells, 97. 9 % and 108. 7 % improvement of the mean biodegradation rates were recorded for toluene and DMDS,respectively, if compared to the values recorded in the absence of acclimation. While and in agreement with the lower solubility in water of DMDS if compared to toluene, a most significant effect of PDMS addition on the rate of DMDS removal was recorded, 87. 0 % and 153. 6 % for toluene and DMDS, respectively. In addition and if both biomass acclimation and PDMS addition were considered, overall improvements of the removal rates were 204 % and 338 % for toluene and DMDS...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Twenty-two free {{amino acid}} (FAA) {{concentrations}} were observed during manufacture (7 days) and ripening period (42 days follow-up) of Olomoucké tvarůžky (PGI, smear acid cheese). During the ripening period, the amounts of volatile compounds and selected sensory attributes were also analysed. The {{free amino acid}}s were determined by means of ion-exchange chromatography, and the volatile compounds were detected and identified using HS-SPME coupled with GC/MS method. The development of the individual FAA content positively correlated with the ripening period (r = 0. 7734 - 0. 9229; P < 0. 01). Forty-six volatile compounds (14 alcohols; 10 esters; 7 ketones; 5 acids; 4 aldehydes; 3 sulphur compounds; 2 phenol compounds; and 1 terpene) were identified. Concentrations of several compounds increased (e. g. 3 -methylbutanal, 2 -butanol, 2 -butanone; P < 0. 05) or decreased (e. g. <b>dimethyldisulphide,</b> methanethiol, 2 -phenylethylacetate, methylbutyric acid; P < 0. 05) over cheese ageing. The results gave information {{about the development of}} sensory active substances and its precursors in Olomoucké tvarůžky during ripening. In conclusion, we found that free amino acid concentrations and sulphur compounds are positive with improved flavour. © 2013 Institute of Food Science and Technology...|$|E
40|$|A Coorongite {{sample of}} Lake Balkash (Kazakhstan, CIS) was {{analyzed}} in detail by 13 C-NMR, FTIR, Curie point pyrolysis 9 ̆ 7 gas chromatography 9 ̆ 7 mass spectrometry, and by fractionation and derivatization with <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> of an off-line pyrolysate. Both the spectroscopic and the pyrolysis {{data indicate that}} the Coorongite was derived almost entirely of organic matter of the green microalga Botryococcus braunii race A. Homologous series of n-alkanes and n-alk- 1 -en- 9 in all pyrolysates indicated the presence of algaenan, a highly aliphatic and resistant cell wall biomacromolecule of B. Braunii race A. Highly specific pyrolysis products, in particular n-alkadienes, n-alkatrienes, alk- 1 -en- 9 -ones, and alk- 1 -en- 10 -ones with C 27, C 29, and C 31 carbon atoms clearly indicated that C 27, C 29, and C 31 alkadienes and alkatrienes, originally present in B. braunii race A as such, were cross-linked by oxygen during the very early stages of diagenesis under oxic conditions. Furthermore, several types of dialkenylethers, also present as soluble lipids in B. braunii race A, had undergone cross-linking by oxygen as well. These cross-linked lipids contribute significantly to the Coorongite and clearly demonstrate that under specific conditions kerogen consists of both preserved biomacromolecules and insoluble, cross-linked, low-molecular-weight lipids...|$|E
40|$|Host-seeking {{behaviour}} of the anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles gambiae {{sensu stricto}} (Diptera: Culicidae) is mediated predominantly by olfactory cues. Several hundreds of odour components {{have been identified}} from human emanations, {{but only a few}} have been proven to act as attractants or synergists in the host-seeking behaviour of female An. gambiae. In previous work, aromatics, alcohols and ketones in human odours were found to elicit electrophysiological activity in antennal olfactory neurons of female An. gambiae. However, the behavioural effects of these compounds have not been investigated. In this study, behavioural responses of female An. gambiae to components of human breath, urine and sweat at a series of concentrations, or a single concentration in the case of acetone, were examined in combination with ammonia and L-lactic acid in a dual-choice olfactometer. The results showed that at specific concentrations 4 -ethylphenol, indole, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol and two ketones inhibited the attractive effect of a mixture of ammonia and lactic acid. Acetone on its own was not attractive; however, when combined with lactic acid, the binary mixture was attractive. When combined with ammonia, acetone inhibited the attractiveness exerted by ammonia alone. Dodecanol and <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> did not affect the attraction exerted by ammonia and lactic acid at any of the concentrations tested. By contrast, a human-specific armpit odour, 7 -octenoic acid, augmented the attraction exerted by the combination of ammonia and lactic acid at a specific dosage...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} precursor compounds of green leaf volatiles (GLV) s and other biogenic compounds released by mechanically damaged Brassica oleracea leaves, plants were exposed for two consecutive 16 h light phases to highly enriched (13) CO(2). Analysis by GC-MS indicated (1) biogenic compounds released upon wounding, (2) a different labelling pattern between and (3) within compounds, and (4) evidence for spatial heterogeneity of the precursor pool extrapolated from points (1) -(3). First, GLVs comprised C(5) and C(6) molecules, with the GLV pentenyl acetate being reported {{here for the first}} time from higher plants. Second, the labelling pattern found in most GLVs indicates a low turnover of the precursor alpha-linolenic acid. Moderate labelling of <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> indicates a connection to an active plastidic methyl pool closely connected to CO(2) fixation, and very weak labelling of terpenes indicates a constitutive monoterpene pool. Third, not all GLVs exhibit similarly strong labelling patterns (hexenyl acetate vs. hexyl acetate), indicating different precursors. As the labelling patterns of alcohol and acetate moieties in the esters differ, with only the former being strongly labelled, the precursor of the acetate moiety, acetyl-CoA, is likely to derive from a different cellular pool to that used in chloroplastic fatty acid synthesis, or was rapidly synthesised after the end of labelling. Fourth, the exceptionally high relative abundance of labelled GLV and the low concentration of unlabelled molecules are likely to occur because recently synthesized alpha-linolenic acid is bound in lipids that are organised in distinct areas, or are chemically different from the older lipids. They must be preferentially used as precursors...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{volatile}} {{sulphur compounds}} generate {{an impact on}} the environment, because of the bad smell and its low odour threshold. Compared with the existing physicochemical technologies for their elimination, biotrickling filters are an economically and environmentally sustainable alternative. Usually mixed cultures of microorganisms are used for inoculating biotrickling filters, in this case a pure culture of Thiobacillus thioparus is used for generating a biofilm, allowing to measure its capacity for the oxidation of four volatile reduced sulphur compounds: hydrogen sulphide, dimethyl sulphide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl disulphide, using a residence time of 0. 033 hrs. The viable cells of the biofilm were quantified by epifluorescence microscopy, staining the cells with ethidium bromide and acridine orange, polymerase chain reaction analysis in real time was used for testing the predominance of T. thiopharus in the biofilm. The microorganism was able to adhere and grow on the surface of rings made of polyethylene, with a viable population of 7 · 10 (7) cell·ring- 1, a 74 % of total cells. The real time PCR showed a persistence of the population of T. thioparus for more than 300 days of operation, without being displaced by other microbial species. The maximum elimination capacities for each compound were 34. 4; 21. 8; 30. 8 and 25. 6 gS·m- 3 ·h- 1 for H 2 S, dimethylsulphide, <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> and methyl mercaptan, respectively. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} implement a biotrickling filter with the bacteria T. thioparus, which can oxidize volatile reduced sulphur compounds efficiently...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of near-edge and surface extended x-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS and SEXAFS), normal incidence x-ray standing wavefield absorption (NIXSW) and (laboratory-based) x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction (XPS and XPD) {{has been used}} to investigate the local phases and associated structures resulting from the interaction of methylthiol (CH 3 SH) and <b>dimethyldisulphide</b> ((CH 3 S) (2) -DMS) with Ni(111). The interaction was followed by adsorbing at low temperature and observing the effects of sequential heating cycles to up to 373 K. At the lowest temperature DMS appears to be intact on the surface, but at slightly higher temperatures, up to at least 223 K, a second molecular species is formed which is also obtained by the thiol adsorption, even at 153 K. This is identified as methylthiolate (CH 3 S-) and appears to be bonded (through the S atom) to the hollow sites on the surface with a S-NI bondlength of 2. 24 Angstrom; essentially equal occupation of both (fcc and hcp) hollow sites is found. Both XAFS and XPD indicate that this species shows a substantial tilt angle of the S-C symmetry axis away from the surface normal; the situation is somewhat similar to that reported for the same species on Pt(111) on the basis of C K-edge NEXAFS and vibrational spectroscopy, and comparative S K-edge NEXAFS measurements for Pt(111) are also reported here. The tilted geometry found on both Ni and Pt surfaces contrasts with the perpendicular orientation found on Cu(111). Heating the Ni(111) surface to 373 K converts the thiolate species to a third state which we identify as atomic sulphur. Both SEXAFS and NEXAFS show that this final species has the same local geometry as that found in earlier studies of atomic S on Ni(111) : in particular, while the S-Ni nearest-neighbour spacing {{is similar to that of}} the thiolate, the S in this phase appears to penetrate the top Ni layer...|$|E
