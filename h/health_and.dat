40|$|Objective: Communication is {{a crucial}} process in the {{effective}} delivery of <b>health</b> care services <b>and</b> the promotion of public health. However, there are often tremendous complexities in using communication effectively {{to provide the best}} health care, direct the adoption of <b>health</b> promoting behaviors, <b>and</b> implement evidence-based public <b>health</b> policies <b>and</b> practices. This article describes Weick's model of organizing as a powerful theory of social organizing that can help increase understanding of the communication demands of <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion. The article identifies relevant applications from the model for <b>health</b> communication research <b>and</b> practice. Conclusion: Weick's model of organizing is a relevant and heuristic theoretical perspective for guiding <b>health</b> communication research <b>and</b> practice. There are many potential applications of this model illustrating the complexities of effective communication in <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion. Practice implications: Weick's model of organizing {{can be used as a}} template for guiding both research <b>and</b> practice in <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion. The model illustrates the important roles that communication performs in enabling <b>health</b> care consumers <b>and</b> providers to make sense of the complexities of modern <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion, select the best strategies for responding effectively to complex <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion situations, <b>and</b> retain relevant information (develop organizational intelligence) for guiding future responses to complex <b>health</b> care <b>and</b> <b>health</b> promotion challenges. 9 page(s...|$|R
