50|$|SFN {{transmission}} {{can be considered}} as a severe form of multipath propagation. The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as self-interference) may result in fading. This is problematic especially in wideband communication and <b>high-data</b> rate digital communications, since the fading in that case is frequency-selective (as opposed to flat fading), and since the time spreading of the echoes may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). Fading and ISI can be avoided by means of diversity schemes and equalization filters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduced}} {{the use of}} two-hop forwarding to increase the throughput of an 802. 11 network in our earlier work (Narayanan et al., Proceedings of IEEE WCNC’ 05, March 2005). Other researchers have also consid-ered the benefits of forwarding in the 802. 11 infrastructure mode to increase the total network throughput. But the <b>high-data</b> rate node that forwards data for other nodes will have to spend its energy transmitting this data. Previous work on forwarding implicitly assumed that in an enterprise network, the collective good is sufficient to justify this increased energy expense. However, {{it is important to}} address the advantages and the cost of participating in such schemes from the individual forwarding node’s perspective. Since a node cannot know whether there are other <b>high-data</b> rate nodes in the network capable and willing to forward data, it needs to assume that it is the only node with the capability to do so. In this paper, we focus our analysis on the cost benefit for such a forwarding node. We quantify the throughput improvement, medium access delay reduction and energy consumption for the forwarding node in a saturated network. The analysis and simulation results demonstrate that in a saturated network, participa-tion in forwarding provides the <b>high-data</b> rate node with significant benefits in throughput and media-access-delay, while increasing the number of bits-per-joule even if it is the only node participating in data forwarding as suggested in this paper. The increase in the bits-per-joule is due to the reduction in the total amount of time needed by the high data rate node to transmit a given number of its own application bits. This results in savings in energy expenditur...|$|E
40|$|National High Technology Research and Development Program [2014 AA 093301]In long-distance, {{high-speed}} underwater laser communication, {{because of}} the strong absorption and scattering processes, the laser pulse is stretched {{with the increase in}} communication distance and the decrease in water clarity. The maximum communication bandwidth is limited by laser-pulse stretching. Improving the communication rate increases the intersymbol interference (ISI). To reduce the effect of ISI, the Viterbi equalization (VE) algorithm is used to estimate the maximum-likelihood receiving sequence. The Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the stretching of the received laser pulse and the maximum communication rate at a wavelength of 532 nm in Jerlov IB and Jerlov II water channels with communication distances of 80, 100, and 130 m, respectively. The <b>high-data</b> rate communication performance for the VE and hard-decision algorithms is compared. The simulation results show that the VE algorithm can be used to reduce the ISI by selecting the minimum error path. The trade-off between the <b>high-data</b> rate communication performance and minor bit-error rate performance loss makes VE a promising option for applications in long-distance, high-speed underwater laser communication systems...|$|E
