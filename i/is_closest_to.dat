At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

5|$|The International Planetary Patrol Program {{was formed}} in 1969 as a {{consortium}} to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars.

Even more notable are the perihelic oppositions of Mars, which occur every 15 or 17 years and are distinguished because Mars is close to perihelion, making it even closer to Earth.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, and when it <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this {{was among the first}} observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Antilope, Eudorcas, Gazella and Nanger form a clade {{within their}} tribe Antilopini. A 1995 {{study of the}} {{detailed}} karyotype of Antilope suggested that within this clade, Antilope <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the Gazella group. A 1999 phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Antilope is the closest sister taxon to Gazella, although an earlier phylogeny, proposed in 1976, placed Antilope as sister to Nanger. In a more recent revision of the phylogeny of Antilopini {{on the basis of}} sequences from multiple nuclear and mitochondrial loci in 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann (of the University of Cambridge) and colleagues reexamined the phylogenetic relationships and found Antilope and Gazella to be sister genera distinct from the sister genera Nanger and Eudorcas.|$|E
5|$|Mint Chief Engraver James B. Longacre had, since 1849, {{designed}} coins {{with various}} visages {{of the goddess}} Liberty, based on a bust, Venus Accroupie, {{he had seen in}} a Philadelphia museum on loan from the Vatican. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the Roman numeral III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 Indian Head cent reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.|$|E

5|$|The Iago sparrow {{was once}} thought to be most closely related to the rufous sparrows, a group of species within the genus Passer which live in similar {{habitats}} on continental Africa. Though the Iago sparrow <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the rufous sparrows in appearance, it has a number of crucial differences in morphology and behavior, and is separated by thousands of kilometres. It may in fact be more closely related to the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow. In Cape Verde it occurs on all but one island, and on most of them it is quite common. The Iago sparrow occurs in most habitats on available in its range, such as lava plains, rocky hills, and gorges; however, the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow are typically present instead in denser settlements and richer cultivated areas respectively. Because the Iago sparrow is not under any serious threats, it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that <b>is</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being the diameter of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
