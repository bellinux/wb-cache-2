40|$|This {{research}} evaluated {{a methodology}} of cutting logs that involves both their classification {{and the establishment}} of cutting models for different diametrical classes. The software MaxiTora was employed aiming the optimization of cutting logs. A total of 80 logs of Pinus sp had been selected with diameter that varied from 24 cm to 33 cm, gathering four diametrical classes with 20 logs each. In each diametrical class, the logs had been separate in two lots with 10 units, where the first lot was submitted to conventional cutting and the second lot was submitted to the programmed cutting. For each log the effective time of cut was recorded until the last lumber piece was edged. For the conventional cutting system, the efficiency reached from the same cutting system varied from 9. 71 to 11. 22 m 3 /operator. day and the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded to 10. 18 m 3 /operator/day. In the programmed cutting system, the efficiency reached through the same cutting system varied from 7. 78 to 8. 99 m 3 /operator. day, while the <b>general</b> <b>average</b> corresponded the 8. 07 m 3 /operator. day.
