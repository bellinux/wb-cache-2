40|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} an unfamiliar target face from an identity lineup declines when it {{is accompanied by a}} second face during visual encoding. This two-face disadvantage is still little studied and its basis remains poorly understood. This study investigated several possible explanations for this phenomenon. Experiments 1 and 2 varied the number of potential targets (1 or 2) and the number of faces in a lineup (5 or 10) to explore if this effect arises from the number of identity comparisons that need to be made to detect a target in a lineup. These experiments also explored if this effect arises from an uncertainty concerning which is the to-be-identified target in two-face displays, by cueing the relevant face during encoding. Experiment 3 then examined whether the two-face disadvantage reflects the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>face</b> encoding or a memory effect. The results show that this effect arises from the additional comparisons that are necessary to compare two potential targets to an identity lineup when memory demands are minimized (Experiment 1), but it reflects a difficulty in remembering several faces when targets and lineups cannot be viewed simultaneously (Experiments 2 and 3). However, in both cases the two-face disadvantage could not be eliminated fully by cueing the target. This hints at a further possible locus for this effect, which might reflect perceptual interference during the initial encoding of the target. The implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E

Therefore, this paper investigates the machining induced residual stresses for milling of a workpiece material with increasing usage in industry, β-titanium. For stress determination a practical modification of an indirect measuring method, the layer removal method, is applied, as it can offer advantages compared to X-ray-measurements. It is robust against material properties such as grain size or texture which can complicate the X-ray-method. Afterwards two typical machining processes, face milling and peripheral milling are investigated regarding residual stress.

Traditionally {{this has been}} done in two-dimensions due to the easy data acquisition and data representation. But with the emerge of cheap TOF-cameras the three-dimensional domain is now more feasible to explore. Appearance Models are statistical models providing an effective mean of sepa-rating inter- and intra-class variation. The models integrate shape and intensity information from images to derive a compact class description. In this thesis an extension has been made to the default model to incorporate the <b>depth</b> map <b>of</b> the third dimension. The Active Appearance Model(AAM) is a learning-based deformable model often used for image segmentation. This is an optimization problem of trying to estimate the parameters of an appearance model to best match a given input. In this thesis statistical models are constructed based on the amplitude images and corresponding <b>depth</b> maps <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> generated by a TOF-camera.

The overall conclusion is that the use of TOF-data results in mixed answers ii to whether or not to use the depth-maps for tracking. It seems that models using the depth maps improve the segmentation and tracking on high variance datasets. On low variance datasets, where the default shape/texture model is sufficient, the depth-model only further complicates the model by introducing more parameters and the end-result tends to be worse...|$|R
