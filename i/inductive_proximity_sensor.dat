40|$|Inductive {{proximity}} sensors {{are widely}} used for the contactless measurement of object or target displacement and position in numerous technical products and systems. They are found in various application domains such as transportation, robots, assembly lines, telecommunication or security. The inductive sensing principle {{is known for its}} robustness, high precision and low sensitivity to environmental conditions as well as to extreme working conditions like cryogenic temperatures. The typical measuring range of inductive proximity sensors is between 0. 1 cm and 5 cm. The overall dimensions of the smallest inductive proximity sensors, including the sensing coil and the electronic circuit interface, is rarely under some cubic centimeters, due to the high number of components of which such sensors are composed. Although the electronic interface circuitry may be integrated in an "application specific integrated circuit" (ASIC), the traditional fabrication processes of the inductive primary transducer (the coil and the flux concentrator) set the limit to the scaling down. The introduction of the inductive principle for proximity sensors into new technical mechatronic systems requires a small size and ease of fabrication (i. e. a low cost). The challenge of this thesis work was to develop such a sensor by using new technologies for the integration of microsystems. In this work, we successfully demonstrate the integration of an <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> on a small-size chip, and its usefulness as a key component in new sensing and mechatronic applications. To the best of our knowledge, we have realized the first fully integrated <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> ever reported. This challenge has been taken up by first studying the effect of the miniaturization on the basic behavior of sensing coils, and then by determining the scaling down laws as well as the limitations due to the parasitics, especially the increase of the inductor series resistance. Considering these first results, we developed a new and simple electronic interface, namely the differential relaxation oscillator. This highly sensitive, self oscillating circuit has only few components and the output signal is digital compatible. This readout principle is well adapted for miniaturized coils with low Q factor. A comparator has been designed and integrated with the two relaxation branches, forming the oscillator, on an ASIC. The miniaturized flat coil has been integrated on top of this ASIC using photolithography and electrodeposition compatible with the standard processes. The connections between the coil and the electronic circuit interface is realized through vias. In its smaller version, the integrated sensor chip size is of 1. 5 x 2 mm 2 with a square coil of 1 x 1 mm 2 on top. This miniaturized flat coil has an inductance of 75 nH, a serial resistance of 6. 2 Ω and a resonance frequency of 315 MHz. Its excitation frequency is close to 10 MHz. No external component is needed for this microsensor basic functioning, and the connections with the external world are limited to power supply and output signal. This integrated sensor is fabricated using the 1 µm 3 V CMOS technology and the standard and compatible gold bumping layer to form the coil. This new device has been successfully tested. In the measuring range from 50 µm up to 150 µm, it shows a high sensitivity (24 kHz/µm) and a submicrometric resolution. The temperature behavior of integrated coils, of the electronic circuit principle and of their combination as a integrated sensor, has been studied. A simple temperature compensation scheme using one NTC resistor, compatible with the sensor integration, has been developed and tested successfully. Using this method, a temperature independence better than ± 100 ppm/°C between - 20 °C and + 80 °C has been achieved with the 3. 8 mm side flat coil version of the integrated <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor.</b> New application have been demonstrated, using the good performances of the developed <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> microsystems. Metallic profile and inductive coin imaging have been successfully recorded. The angular position control of a watch motor has been evidenced with an angular precision of 2 DEG (limited by the step motor). The angular speed and position sensing of a non-ferromagnetic toothed wheel has been sensed up to at least 7800 rpm (corresponding to an excitation of 13 kHz). The application and the promising perspective of our integrated <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> into active magnetic bearings for hard disk drives has been presented. This multidisciplinary thesis work has been realized with emphasis on using simple elements and on obtaining a simple overall behavior. The device has only one coil, it uses only one comparator, it is made of only one chip, and moreover it can be fabricated in only one wafer foundry using standard processes. By focusing on the optimization of the global sensor system, good performances have been achieved and the integration of an <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> has been proven...|$|E

This study establishes and implements a two-dimensional look-up table that reduces the online computational complexity through structural modeling and by conducting an IPS operating principle analysis. This table is effectively compressed by considering the distribution characteristics of the sample data, thus simplifying the processing circuit. Moreover, power consumption is reduced.

Computer simulation of the sensor coil could shorten this design process by eliminating the need for extensive building and testing of prototypes. Analytical solutions require extensive information about the material properties of the ferrite core, which is not readily available. While there are software packages commercially available that use the finite element method to simulate magnetic fields, these packages require extensive user training, and they involve lengthy run times. In this work, a linear minimal node finite element model of a <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> coil is developed, serving as a rapid design simulation tool that requires little operator training. Using this minimal node model, a rapidly converging Pascal program is created to calculate the Q of a coil vs. frequency and vs. temperature. Measured and simulated data are compared for coils having 14. 4 mm x 7. 5 mm and 22 mm x 6. 8 mm cores. Because this model is linear and uses a minimal number of nodes, errors do exist between measured and simulated data. The simulated Q curves are still reasonable representations of the measured Q curves, however, indicating that the model can be used as a rapid design tool to reduce the flowtime of new coil designs.

The flexure-based microgap rheometer (FMR) is a shear-rate-control led device capable of measuring the shear stress in a plane Couette configuration with directly controlled gaps between I and 200 mu m. White light interferometry and a three-point nanopositioning stage using piezo-stepping motors are used to control the parallelism of the upper and lower shearing surfaces, which are constructed from glass optical flats.

The method presented in this study employs a barrier of ceramic tile material developed for the space shuttle program. While it may be intuitive that the ceramic tile material will provide adequate protection for extreme temperatures, what is not clear is the adaptability of this material to commercial use in a steel mill environment. One of the potential problems associated with using any thermal barrier is a partial or complete attenuation of the magnetic field generated by the sensor. To effectively utilize the shielding material in an application such as this it is necessary to understand the effect of the ceramic material on the magnetic field generated by the <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor.</b> In order to test the effectiveness of the ceramic tile to provide the level of thermal protection required and to discover if the tile will allow adequate magnetic field penetration for sensor detection, a series of two separate tests will be run. The first test will verify that the thermal shielding properties maintain the cool side temperature within the operational threshold of the sensor; the second test will establish the maximum sensing distance with the ceramic tile interposed between the sensor and the detectable object.

Para a calibração dinâmica, o mesmo sistema foi posto em rotação nas velocidades nominais dos geradores hidroelétricos de FURNAS CENTRAIS ELÉTRICAS S. A. (90 rpm, 120 rpm, 150 rpm e 180 rpm). A resposta do sensor foi então comparada nas diferentes rotações, com o que se determinou a atenuação do sinal devido ao aumento da freqüência de operação. Os dados obtidos estaticamente e dinamicamente foram avaliados, e as incertezas determinadas. As calibrações estáticas {{realizadas}} pelo procedimento de FURNAS e deste trabalho produziram os mesmos resultados, considerando a faixa de incerteza de medição. Para reduzir a incerteza de calibração do procedimento de FURNAS, propõe-se que seus resultados sejam ajustados por um polinômio do segundo grau. A calibração dinâmica realizada em várias freqüências mostrou que não existe diferença entre os valores obtidos estaticamente e dinamicamente, muito embora esta tenha uma incerteza mais elevada. Para simplificação da calibração dos sensores, propõe-se que ela seja, portanto, realizada estaticamente. This work {{presents the}} results of the behavior of the <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor</b> at the measurement of oscillation in hydroelectric generators from the generation system of Furnas Centrais Elétricas S. A [...] To develop this study, two (2) inductive proximity sensors were used. The methodology consisted of calibrating statically and dynamically the <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> <b>sensor.</b> For this, it was used a test mockup: a system composed by an engine with variable speed and a disc with variable and controlled eccentricity connected to the axle. The eccentricity of the test mock-up was adjusted and thirteen (13) points were marked on the disc, every 30 °. The static calibration of the test mock-up has been made, by measuring the displacement in each one of these thirteen (13) points with a calibrated dial indicator. For the static calibration of the sensor, the sensor itself was positioned in front of the test mock-up disc at a known distance, the axle was dislocated manually for each one of the points and the output signal of the sensor was measured with a calibrated signal analyzer. The curve of the static calibration then was determined with the respective uncertainty of the measurement. For the dynamic calibration, the same system was run in the nominal speeds of the hydroelectric generators from Furnas Centrais Elétricas S. A. (90 rpm, 120 rpm, 150 rpm and 180 rpm). The response of the sensor was then compared at the different rotations, being determined the attenuation of the signal due to the increase of the operation frequency. The static and dynamic data were evaluated, and the uncertainties determined. The static calibrations carried through by the procedure of FURNAS and by this work produced the same results, considering the range of measurement uncertainty. To reduce the calibration uncertainty of the FURNAS procedure, it is proposed that its results be adjusted by a polynomial of second degree. The dynamic calibration carried at several frequencies showed that there is no difference between the static and dynamic values, even though the dynamic calibration has a more elevated uncertainty. To simplify the calibration of the sensors, it is proposed then that it is carried statically only...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Tumbling mills {{are still}} the mostly used milling device in the mineral {{processing}} industry for both coarse and fine grinding applications. A number of factors affect the performance of tumbling mill. One of these factors is volumetric filling which is the volume of charge in the mill expressed as {{a fraction of the}} total volume available. The volumetric filling controls the mill throughput, power draw and product size. The common method of measuring volumetric filling is by taking in situ measurements when the mill is stationary. This method is disruptive to production due to the mill downtime involved. The use of on-line sensors for measuring the volumetric filling using acoustic, <b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> and conductive <b>sensors</b> are the new technologies attempting to monitor volumetric filling in situ. The methods are non-intrusive and low cost approach for direct monitoring of dynamic volumetric filling conditions in the tumbling mill. The dynamic volumetric filling was assumed to be directly related to static mill filling conditions. In this study, the volumetric filling was calculated from the toe and shoulder angles estimated by the CSIRO monitor (acoustic) and the Magotteaux Sensomag (<b>inductive</b> <b>proximity</b> and conductive) <b>sensors.</b> The CSIRO acoustic sensor was installed on a run-of-mine (RoM) ball mill at Angloplatinum UG 2 Concentrator at Rustenburg, South Africa. The toe and shoulder angles were obtained from the surface vibration caused by the impact of the charge on the mill shell. The industrial scale experiments were performed at varied mill feed rate at constant ball load of 28 %. In the pilot scale experiments, the Magotteaux ball mill at Frank Concentrator was equipped with a Sensomag sensor for measuring the toe and shoulder angles of the slurry and ball load based on the principle of conductance and induction, respectively. The mill was configured to operate as a RoM ball mill. The experiments were conducted at varying mill speeds (75 %- 85 % critical speed), feed rate (1200 - 2800 kg/hr) and ball loads (15 - 26 %). The static mill filling was determined from physical measurements after crash stopping the mill...|$|R
