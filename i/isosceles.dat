5|$|As {{a simple}} {{polyhedron}} with 180 triangular faces (60 <b>isosceles,</b> 120 scalene), 270 edges, and 92 vertices. This interpretation {{is useful for}} polyhedron model building.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} are only used in certain {{sections of the}} cloth. For example, a row of <b>isosceles</b> triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head. However, pasung and dhlorong are occasionally found in the body. Other motifs such as buketan (flower bouquet) and birds are commonly used in either the head or the body.|$|E
5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right <b>isosceles</b> triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C. In the southwestern {{part of the}} constellation, it is 170 ± 7 light-years from Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is {{the brightest star in}} the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree <b>isosceles</b> triangle from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or <b>isosceles</b> triangles.|$|E
25|$|An <b>isosceles</b> {{triangle}} has {{two sides}} of equal length. An <b>isosceles</b> triangle also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the {{two sides of}} the same length; this fact is the content of the <b>isosceles</b> triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an <b>isosceles</b> triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an <b>isosceles</b> triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles <b>isosceles</b> triangles. The 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is <b>isosceles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The triangles with {{reflection}} symmetry are <b>isosceles,</b> the quadrilaterals {{with this}} symmetry are the kites and the <b>isosceles</b> trapezoids.|$|E
25|$|The pentagram {{includes}} ten <b>isosceles</b> triangles: five {{acute and}} five obtuse <b>isosceles</b> triangles. In all of them, {{the ratio of}} the longer side to the shorter side is φ. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse <b>isosceles</b> triangle highlighted via the colored lines in the illustration is a golden gnomon.|$|E
25|$|Every antiparallelogram has an axis of {{symmetry}} {{through its}} crossing point. Because of this symmetry, it has two pairs of equal angles {{as well as two}} pairs of equal sides. Together with the kites and the <b>isosceles</b> trapezoids, antiparallelograms form one of three basic classes of quadrilaterals with a symmetry axis. The convex hull of an antiparallelogram is an <b>isosceles</b> trapezoid, and every antiparallelogram may be formed from the non-parallel sides (or either pair of parallel sides in case of a rectangle) and diagonals of an <b>isosceles</b> trapezoid.|$|E
25|$|It {{can be seen}} as a net of a {{pentagonal}} pyramid {{although with}} <b>isosceles</b> triangles.|$|E
25|$|By the Pythagorean theorem: c2 = a2+b2 = b2+b2 = 2b2. (Since the {{triangle}} is <b>isosceles,</b> a = b).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the design}} of the East Building by {{architect}} I. M. Pei is geometrical, dividing the trapezoidal shape of the site into two triangles: one <b>isosceles</b> and the other a smaller right triangle. The space defined by the <b>isosceles</b> triangle came to house the museum's public functions. The portion outlined by the right triangle became the study center. The triangles in turn became the building's organized motif, echoed and repeated in every dimension.|$|E
25|$|Triangular antiprisms: Two {{faces are}} equilateral, lie on {{parallel}} planes, {{and have a}} common axis of symmetry. The other six triangles are <b>isosceles.</b>|$|E
25|$|If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α {{because of}} the bisection, and CAB = α {{because of the}} similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the {{original}} <b>isosceles</b> symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse <b>isosceles</b> triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.|$|E
25|$|Start with an <b>isosceles</b> right {{triangle}} with side lengths of integers a, b, and c. The {{ratio of the}} hypotenuse to a leg is represented by c:b.|$|E
25|$|The ships' pennant is a {{horizontal}} piece of canvas {{in the shape}} of an <b>isosceles</b> triangle, with a 1:10 ratio, on which is printed the Romanian national tricolor.|$|E
25|$|Heptagonal pyramid: One {{face is a}} heptagon (usually regular), and the {{remaining}} seven faces are triangles (usually <b>isosceles).</b> It is not possible for all triangular faces to be equilateral.|$|E
25|$|No Pythagorean triples are <b>isosceles,</b> {{because the}} ratio of the {{hypotenuse}} to either other side is 2, but 2 cannot be expressed as {{the ratio of}} 2 integers.|$|E
25|$|That {{means that}} we can make a right <b>isosceles</b> {{triangle}} where the side lengths are natural numbers and the legs and the hypotenuse do not share any common factors (except 1).|$|E
25|$|The golden {{triangle}} {{can be characterized}} as an <b>isosceles</b> triangle ABC with the property that bisecting the angle C produces a new triangle CXB which is a similar triangle to the original.|$|E
25|$|A polygon {{which has}} a {{circumscribed}} circle is called a cyclic polygon (sometimes a concyclic polygon, because the vertices are concyclic). All regular simple polygons, all <b>isosceles</b> trapezoids, all triangles and all rectangles are cyclic.|$|E
25|$|The {{next table}} shows that {{splitting}} the odd number Hn into nearly equal halves gives a square triangular number when n is even and a near <b>isosceles</b> Pythagorean triple when n is odd. All solutions arise in this manner.|$|E
25|$|These dual tilings {{are listed}} by their face configuration, {{the number of}} faces at each vertex of a face. For example V4.8.8 means <b>isosceles</b> {{triangle}} tiles with one corner with four triangles, and two corners containing eight triangles.|$|E
25|$|As a result, in an <b>isosceles</b> {{triangle}} {{with one}} or two angles of 36°, the longer of the two side lengths is φ times that of the shorter of the two, both {{in the case of the}} acute as in the case of the obtuse triangle.|$|E
25|$|A {{triangle}} {{that has}} two angles {{with the same}} measure also has two sides with the same length, and therefore it is an <b>isosceles</b> triangle. It follows that in a triangle where all angles have the same measure, all three sides have the same length, and such a triangle is therefore equilateral.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of bowstring trusses {{were used}} during World War II for {{holding up the}} curved roofs of {{aircraft}} hangars and other military buildings. Many variations exist in the arrangements of the members connecting the nodes of the upper arc {{with those of the}} lower, straight sequence of members, from nearly <b>isosceles</b> triangles to a variant of the Pratt truss.|$|E
25|$|In late August 1989, {{while working}} as an {{engineer}} on the jack-up barge GSF Galveston Key in the North Sea, Chris Gibson and another witness saw an unfamiliar <b>isosceles</b> triangle-shaped delta aircraft, apparently refueling from a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and accompanied {{by a pair of}} F-111 fighter-bombers. Gibson and his girlfriend watched the aircraft for several minutes, until they went out of sight. He subsequently drew a sketch of the formation.|$|E
25|$|Let ABC be an <b>isosceles</b> {{triangle}} with AB and AC {{being the}} equal sides. Consider the triangles ABC and ACB, where ACB {{is considered a}} second triangle with vertices A, C and B corresponding respectively to A, B and C in the original triangle. Angle A is equal to itself, AB=AC and AC=AB, so by side-angle-side, triangles ABC and ACB are congruent. In particular angle B = angle C.|$|E
25|$|Influenced by {{bands like}} Genesis, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Rush and Dream Theater the {{underground}} progressive rock and progressive metal scene has been constantly growing since 2005, with many trends like: metal - influenced bands like Fughu, Dudosa Moral and Destino 101, progressive - pop - metal like De Rien, jazz fusion - progressive rock outfit Fantasía Cromática, progressive - folk <b>Isósceles,</b> King Crimson - Frank Zappa influenced Souls Ignite and symphonic rockart rock Rodrigo San Martín and Maybe.|$|E
25|$|Both the Pell {{numbers and}} the {{companion}} Pell numbers may be calculated {{by means of a}} recurrence relation similar to that for the Fibonacci numbers, and both sequences of numbers grow exponentially, proportionally to powers of the silver ratio 1+. As well as being used to approximate the square root of two, Pell numbers can be used to find square triangular numbers, to construct integer approximations to the right <b>isosceles</b> triangle, and to solve certain combinatorial enumeration problems.−e can be calculated as the product of a Pell number with the corresponding Fibonacci number.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem of}} {{constructing}} three circles tangent {{to each other}} within a triangle was posed by the 18th-century Japanese mathematician Ajima Naonobu prior {{to the work of}} Malfatti, and included in an unpublished collection of Ajima's works made a year after Ajima's death by his student Kusaka Makoto. Even earlier, the same problem was considered in a 1384 manuscript by Gilio di Cecco da Montepulciano, now in the Municipal Library of Sienna, Italy. Jacob Bernoulli is also said to have studied a special case of the problem, for <b>isosceles</b> triangles.|$|E
25|$|The Bridge of Asses (Pons Asinorum) {{states that}} in <b>isosceles</b> triangles the angles {{at the base}} equal one another, and, if the equal {{straight}} lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another. Its name {{may be attributed to}} its frequent role as the first real test in the Elements of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 November 1860, Symonds became Admiral Superintendent at Devonport Dockyard, {{with his}} flag in the second-rate HMS Indus, in December 1862. Promoted to vice-admiral on 2 April 1866, {{he went on}} to be Commander-in-Chief, Channel Squadron, with his flag in the {{armoured}} frigate HMS Minotaur, in December 1868. In that role he invented the scalene triangle naval formation, replacing the older <b>isosceles</b> triangle naval formation, and earned himself a reputation as a tactician. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 13 March 1867.|$|E
25|$|A half {{symmetry}} {{form of the}} rhombicuboctahedron, , exists with pyritohedral symmetry, , (3*2) as Coxeter diagram , Schläfli symbol s2{3,4}, and can {{be called}} a cantic snub octahedron. This form can be visualized by alternatingly coloring {{the edges of the}} 6 squares. These squares can then be distorted into rectangles, while the 8 triangles remain equilateral. The 12 diagonal square faces will become <b>isosceles</b> trapezoids. In the limit, the rectangles can be reduced to edges, and the trapezoids become triangles, and an icosahedron is formed, by a snub octahedron construction, , s{3,4}. the compound of two icosahedra is constructed from both alternated positions.|$|E
25|$|Deriving {{the volume}} of a bicylinder (white) {{can be done by}} packing it in a cube (red). A plane (parallel with the cylinders' axes) {{intersecting}} the bicylinder forms a square and its intersection with the cube is a larger square. The difference between the areas of the two squares is the same as 4 small squares (blue). As the plane moves through the solids, these blue squares describe square pyramids with <b>isosceles</b> faces in the corners of the cube; the pyramids have their apexes at the midpoints of the four cube edges. Moving the plane through the whole bicylinder describes a total of 8 pyramids.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Japanese {{researcher}} Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama {{surmised that}} the cover illustration Saint-Exupéry painted for Le Petit Prince deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created {{to celebrate the}} author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exupéry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an <b>isosceles</b> triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exupéry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the Armée de l'Air (French Air Force).|$|E
