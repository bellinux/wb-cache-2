6000|$|We had {{not started}} {{purposely}} {{to see the}} Ghetto, {{and for this reason}} it had that purely incidental relish, which is the keenest possible savor of the object of interest. We were on an expedition to find Sior Antonio Rioba, who has been, from time immemorial, the means of ponderous practical jokes in Venice. Sior Antonio is a rough-hewn statue set in the corner of an ordinary grocery, near the Ghetto. He has a pack on his back and a staff in his hand; his face is painted, and is habitually dishonored with dirt thrown upon it by boys. On the wall near him is painted a bell-pull, with the legend, Sior Antonio Rioba. Rustics, raw apprentices, and honest Germans new to the city, are furnished with packages to be carried to Sior Antonio Rioba, who is very hard to find, and not able to receive the messages when found, though there is always a crowd of loafers near to receive the unlucky simpleton who brings them. [...] "E poi, che commedia vederli arrabiarsi! Che ridere!" [...] That is the Venetian notion of fun, and no doubt the scene is amusing. I was curious to see Sior Antonio, because a comic <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> his name had been published {{during the time of the}} Republic of 1848, and from the fact that he was then a sort of Venetian Pasquino. But I question now if he was worth seeing, except as something that brought me into the neighborhood of the Ghetto, and suggested to me the idea of visiting that quarter.|$|E
60|$|In 1709, {{when the}} {{publication}} of the Tatler began, our great-great-grandfathers must have seized upon that new and delightful paper with much such eagerness as lovers of light literature in a later day exhibited when the Waverley novels appeared, upon which the public rushed, forsaking that feeble entertainment of which the Miss Porters, the Anne of Swanseas, and worthy Mrs. Radcliffe herself, with her dreary castles and exploded old ghosts, had had pretty much the monopoly. I have looked over many of the comic books with which our ancestors amused themselves, from the novels of Swift’s coadjutrix, Mrs. Manley, the delectable author of the New Atlantis, to the facetious productions of Tom Durfey, and Tom Brown, and Ned Ward, writer of the London Spy and several other volumes of ribaldry. The slang of the taverns and ordinaries, the wit of the bagnios, form the strongest part of the farrago of which these libels are composed. In the excellent newspaper collection at the British Museum, you may see, besides the Craftsman and Post Boy, specimens, and queer specimens they are, of the higher literature of Queen Anne’s time. Here is an abstract from a notable <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> date, Wednesday, October 13th, 1708, and entitled The British Apollo; or, Curious Amusements for the Ingenious, by a Society of Gentlemen. The British Apollo invited and professed to answer questions upon all subjects of wit, morality, science, and even religion; and two out of its four pages are filled with queries and replies much like some of the oracular penny prints of the present time.|$|E

40|$|AbstractJournal {{bearings}} {{are used}} in {{a large number of}} critical positions in automotive internal combustion engines (ICE) and contribute a major contribution to the total friction power losses in these engines. Due to the worldwide effort to reduce CO 2 emissions, automotive manufacturers investigate the remaining potential for friction reduction also in the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> which leads to severe operating conditions due to the lower viscosity lubricants. At the same time modern ICEs utilize higher combustion pressures for increased thermodynamical efficiency, which imposes further stress on the <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> These reasons motivate in addition the accurate and reliable simulation of the operating conditions and friction power losses in <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> Within this work, the lubrication of <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> is investigated in detail starting from an extensive thermo-elastohydrodynamic (TEHD) simulation, which yields important insights into the thermodynamical behavior of <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> From these results a powerful isothermal elastohydrodynamic (EHD) simulation model using a simple approach to calculate equivalent temperature is derived.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{summarizes}} the work {{carried out in}} the development of hydro-dynamic lubricated <b>journal</b> <b>bearings</b> with magnetic fluids. Two different fluids have been analyzed: one is the ferrofluid from FERROTEC APG s 10 n and the other is the magnetorheo-logical (MR) fluid from LORDCorp., MRF 122 - 2 ED. Theoretical analysis has been carried out with numerical solutions of Reynolds equation, based on apparent viscosity modulation for ferrofluid and Bingham model for MR fluid. To validate this model, one test bench has been designed, manufactured, and set up, where preliminary results showed in this article demon-strate that magnetic fluids can be used to develop active <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> Key Words: magnetorheological, ferrofluid, <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> hydrodynamic pressure, bingham model...|$|R

40|$|Often, the {{presence}} of unexpected super-synchronous harmonic components in the vibrations of rotating machines is considered a reliable symptom of serious faults like: shaft cracks, rotor-tostator rubs and severe misalignments. However, the not unusual occurrence of malfunctions that cause high synchronous vibration levels can generate non-linear forces in oil-film <b>journal</b> <b>bearings,</b> which, in turn, give rise to unexpected super-synchronous vibrations of the shaft.
