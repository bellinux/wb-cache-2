25|$|The correct {{technique}} maximizes fat graft survival by minimizing cellular trauma {{during the}} liposuction harvesting and the centrifugal refinement, and by injecting {{the fat in}} small aliquots (equal measures), not clumps (too-large measures). Injecting minimal-volume aliquots with each pass of the cannula maximizes the surface area contact, between the grafted fat-tissue and the recipient breast-tissue, because proximity to a vascular system (blood supply) encourages histologic survival and minimizes the potential for fat necrosis. Transplanted autologous fat tissue undergoes histologic changes like those undergone by a bone transplant; if the body accepts the fat-tissue graft, it is replaced with new fat tissue, if the fat-graft dies it is replaced by fibrous tissue. New fat tissue is generated by the activity of a large, wandering histocyte-type cell, which ingests fat and then becomes a <b>fat</b> <b>cell.</b> When the breast-filler fat is injected to the breasts in clumps (too-large measures), fat cells emplaced too distant from blood vessels might die, {{which can lead to}} fat tissue necrosis, causing lumps, calcifications, and the eventual formation of liponecrotic cysts.|$|E

40|$|Obesity {{has emerged}} as a major threat to public health in both the western and {{developing}} world. Essentially a disorder of energy balance, obesity occurs when energy intake and storage exceeds expenditure. Much of energy homeostasis depends on the activity and function of adipose tissue. Adipocytes in mammals fall into two categories classified by their primary functions: white <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> that mediate energy storage and thermogenic <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> that counteract hypothermia and obesity through adaptive thermogenesis. Whereas white fat and its function as an energy reservoir and endocrine organ have been studied for decades and are relatively well understood, until recently many aspects of the thermogenic fat biology have remained elusive. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that thermogenic <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> arise from at least two different developmental origins: the ones of a skeletal muscle-like lineage are now called “classical” brown <b>fat</b> <b>cells,</b> {{and the rest of the}} thermogenic <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> are normally referred to as the beige <b>fat</b> <b>cells.</b> The last decade has witnessed an explosion of interest and studies focusing on the regulation of thermogenic <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> and potential therapeutics targeting these adipocytes.

Although the {{expression}} of age-related molecules in the trophocytes and <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> of young and old workers have been determined, {{the expression of}} age-related molecules in queens is unknown. In this study, we examined the expression of age-related molecules in the trophocytes and <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> of young and old queens. Molecular analyses detected no differences in telomerase activity or telomere lengths between trophocytes and <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> from young and old queens, indicating that these cells do not divide in adulthood.

40|$|In {{the life}} history of {{holometabolous}} insects, distinct developmental stages are tightly linked to feeding and nonfeeding periods. The larval stage {{is characterized by}} extensive feeding, which supports {{the rapid growth of}} the animal and allows accumulation of energy stores, primarily in the larval fat body. In Drosophila melanogaster access to these stores during pupal development is possible because the larval fat body is preserved in the pupa as individual <b>fat</b> <b>cells.</b> These larval <b>fat</b> <b>cells</b> are refractive to autophagic cell death that removes most of the larval cells during metamorphosis.
