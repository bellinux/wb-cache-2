50|$|The outer {{coverings}} of the cottonseed, {{known as}} cottonseed hulls, {{are removed from}} the cotton kernels before the oil is extracted. Cottonseed hulls serve as {{an excellent source of}} feed for the livestock as they contain about 8% of cotton linters which have nearly 100% cellulose in them. They require no grinding and easily mix with other feed sources. As they are easy to handle, their transportation cost is fairly low, as well. Whole cottonseed is another feed product of cottonseed used to feed livestock. It is the seed left after the separation of long fibres from cotton, and serves as a good source of cellulose for ruminants. Whole cottonseed leads to high production of milk and fat, if it is being fed to a high-producing dairy cow. It can be cost effective and provides nutrients such as high protein value of about 23%, crude fibre value of 25%, and high energy value of 20%. Whole cottonseed serves as a highly digestible feed which also improves the reproductive performance in livestock.

40|$|Within {{the latter}} half of the 20 th century, {{contemporary}} academics have noted a significant reorientation of criminal justice policy and practice. Explanations for this reorientation have been explained by: the emergence of a postmodern penality (Feeley and Simon, 1992); the limits of the sovereign state and the culture of high crime societies (Garland, 1996, 2000); and the imposition of 2 ̆ 7 New Right 2 ̆ 7 politics (O 2 ̆ 7 Malley, 1999). This thesis specifically examines Feeley and Simon 2 ̆ 7 s proposition that a postmodern penality has emerged. It is argued that rather than a replacement of the old penology with a new penology paradigm, contemporary practices are more characteristic of a hybridization of discourse, objectives, and practices. Utilizing Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) electronic monitoring as a referent, the tenets of the old and new penology are examined. Results indicate that GPS electronic monitoring operations represent an amalgamation of both old and new penology attributes. It is suggested that while there may be an attempt to implement a new penology at macro level practice, micro level public politics may exert sufficient political pressure to coerce an amalgamation of both old and new penology ideals.

However, supplementation with mechanically <b>delinted</b> cottonseed hulls (DCSH) and cottonseed linter residue (CLR) is uncommon. Cottonseed by-products, including LCSH, DCSH and CLR, were assessed by chemical analysis, an in situ nylon bag technique, an in vitro cumulative gas production technique and in vitro enzyme procedure. The crude protein (CP) content of CLR (302 g/kg dry matter (DM)) was approximately 3 times that of LCSH and 5 times that of DCSH. The crude fat content was approximately 3 times higher in CLR (269 g/kg DM) than in LCSH and 4 times higher than in DCSH. Neutral detergent fibre (311 g/kg DM) and acid detergent fibre (243 g/kg DM) contents of CLR were less than half those of DCSH or LCSH. Metabolisable energy, estimated by in vitro gas production and chemical analyses, ranked as follows: CLR (12. 69 kJ/kg DM) >LCSH (7. 32 kJ/kg DM) >DCSH (5. 82 kJ/kg DM).

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This study was initiated to develop a fiberless mutant of Gossypium arboreum L. in order to identify genes that code for cellulose fiber production in cotton. The biosynthetic pathways to fiber cellulose production are still not known despite many attempts to find the precursors and enzymes involved. If these pathways were identified then they could provide useful tools for manipulating the amount and quality of cotton fibers. Gossypium arboreum, n= 13, 2 n= 26, is a diploid Gossypium species that produces spinnable fibers and is grown commercially in parts of India today. Understanding the complex biochemical pathways of fiber production in this diploid cultivar should be directly applicable to understanding fiber production in the cultivars grown in the U. S., G. hirsutum L. and G. barbadense L., x= 13, n= 26, 2 n= 52. Gossypium arboreum seed (MO) were chemically treated with diepoxybutane (DEB) and planted as the MI generation in the field at the Texas A&M University Research Farm, College Station, Texas in 1994. Three DEB treatments were used; 5. 0 mM, 7. 4 MM, and 10. 0 mM. Flowers were forced to self pollinate on the MI plants and the resulting bolls were hand harvested from individual plants. Seed (M 2) from each plant were maintained as independent lines and planted into progeny rows in 1995. Boll samples harvested from each M 2 progeny row were ginned and the seeds were acid <b>delinted.</b> Data collected included weight of seed cotton/M 2 row, seed cotton weight/row, lint weight/row, and the weight of 100 fuzzy seed (seed index). Fiber samples of each M 2 row were forwarded to the International Center for Textile Research and Development in Lubbock, Texas for high volume instrument (HVI) fiber analysis. Fiber quality parameters included: upper half mean fiber length (UBM), fiber bundle strength, micronaire, and uniformity index. Lint yield components, using the ontogenetic yield model proposed by Worley et al. included: lint percentage (LP), seeds per boll (S/BOLL), seed cotton per seed (SC/S), lint per seed (L/S), and fibers per seed (F/S). Although a completely fiberless M 2 plant, which was our original goal, was not found among the 1995 progeny, M 2 progeny were evaluated for variation in fiber quality and within-boll yield components. M 2 lines within each treatment were classed as a putative mutant if it's individual value for any component was less than or greater than 3 standard deviation units from the mean value of the population being considered.
