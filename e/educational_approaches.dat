2500|$|The {{variations}} in <b>educational</b> <b>approaches</b> and standards required for paramedics {{has led to}} large differences in the required qualifications between locations—both within individual countries and from country to country. Within the UK training is a two-year course equivalent to a foundation degree. Comparisons have been made between Paramedics and nurses; with nurses now requiring degree entry (BSc) the knowledge deficit is large between the two fields. This has led to many countries passing laws to protect the title of [...] "paramedic" [...] (or its local equivalent) from use by anyone except those qualified and experienced to a defined standard. This usually means that paramedics must be registered with the appropriate body in their country; for example all paramedics in the United Kingdom must by registered with the Health Professions Council in order to call themselves a paramedic. In the United States, a similar system is operated by the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT), although this is only accepted by forty of the fifty states.|$|E

Children with those disabilities were excluded from the governmental educational system. The social movement to guarantee the educational right of those disabled children strongly tried to protect their life, living and health. As a result, in 1979 all Japanese children were legally included in the Scool Education Act, guaranteering compulsory education to {{children with}} those disabilities. Since 1979, there has been <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> to those children in hospitals, institutions and so on, although educational conditions are poor. Special School teachers devoted to such <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> have been facing to new conditions including the handicapping conditions of students. New approach is needed to the teachers for the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> to students with profound and multiple disabilities, for example, approach to special health needs. This study examines the conditions of the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> for children with profound and multiple disabilities in the hospital in Kyoto prefecture until mid- 1980 s. There are many difficult problems and issues in the field of the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> to those students as follows, 1) New concepts and strategies for the education have been needed to fit the new <b>educational</b> <b>approach.</b> 2) New aproach has needed to overcome the poor educational conditions. 3) Although the teachers have been needed to suitable action from interpersonal interaction point of view, teachers action becomes complex motion for such <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> and care. It is obvious that the teachers have been fsaced to their task and stree in relation to <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> to students with profound and multiple disabilities in the early 1980 's...|$|R

The effect of mythos, which in fact give ideal education of the period, with the expressions they made about Gods’ and heroes’ education, on the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> of Plato, known to be intensely against the mythos, is rather surprising...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{was inspired by}} recent reports in the news that Prince George would be attending a Montessori nursery, and to continue my own personal study conducted last year into the Montessori <b>educational</b> <b>approach.</b> It is estimated that there are 700 Montessori nurseries, preschools and schools within the United Kingdom, {{all of which have}} to comply with the requirements set by the Department for Education, in the statutory framework the Early Years Foundation Stage. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} find out the effectiveness of the Montessori <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> within one UK early years provision. In order to research this question, a review of the literature was undertaken, which included the history of Maria Montessori and other educational pioneers who influenced her studies, how the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> has been adapted within the United Kingdom, the training requirements needed to work within a UK Montessori early years setting and how the <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> incorporates play to comply with the requirements set by the Early Years Foundation Stage. To discover the effectiveness of the Montessori <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> the staff at one UK Montessori preschool were interviewed, to discover their thoughts and feelings on the <b>educational</b> <b>approach.</b> The data was gathered and analysed thematically, key themes were found around the training, play opportunities and the Early Years Foundation Stage. It was also found that the use of technology supports Montessori practitioners deliver the Montessori <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> while meeting the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage. Therefore this study concluded that the Montessori <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> has been adapted in the United Kingdom, to meet the requirements of the Early Years Foundation Stage. The practitioners are given technology to help assist with delivering the Early Years Foundation Stage, and Montessori practitioners within the United Kingdom are not required to hold an official Montessori qualification...|$|R
2500|$|Montessori {{continued}} to develop her pedagogy and her model {{of human development}} as she expanded her work and extended it to older children. She saw human behavior as guided by universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as [...] "human tendencies" [...] in 1957. In addition, she observed four distinct periods, or [...] "planes", in human development, extending from birth to six years, from six to twelve, from twelve to eighteen, and from eighteen to twenty-four. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active {{in each of these}} planes, and called for <b>educational</b> <b>approaches</b> specific to each period. Over the course of her lifetime, Montessori developed pedagogical methods and materials for the first two planes, from birth to age twelve, and wrote and lectured about the third and fourth planes. Maria created over 4,000 Montessori classrooms across the world and her books were translated into many different languages for the training of new educators. Her methods are installed in hundreds of public and private schools across the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In the U.S., the {{community}} college training model remains the most common, although some university-based paramedic education models exist. These variations in both <b>educational</b> <b>approaches</b> and standards has led to tremendous differences from one location to another. There may be situations in which {{a group of people}} with 120 hours of training, and another group (in another jurisdiction) with university degrees, were both calling themselves 'paramedics'. There were some efforts made to resolve these discrepancies. The National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) along with National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) attempted to create a national standard by means of a common licensing examination, but to this day, this has never been universally accepted by U.S. States, and issues of licensing reciprocity for paramedics continue, although if an EMT obtains certification through NREMT (NREMT-P, NREMT-I, NREMT-B), this is accepted by 40 of the 50 states in the United States. This confusion was further complicated by the introduction of complex systems of gradation of certification, reflecting levels of training and skill, but these too were, for the most part, purely local. To clarify, at least at a national level, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is the federal organization with authority to administer the EMS system, defines the various titles given to prehospital medical workers based on the level of care they provide. They are EMT-P (Paramedic), EMT-I (Intermediate), EMT-B (Basic), and First Responders. While providers at all levels are considered emergency medical technicians, the term [...] "paramedic" [...] is most properly used in the United States to refer only to those providers who are EMT-P's. Apart from this distinction, the only truly common trend that would evolve was the relatively universal acceptance of the term 'emergency medical technician' being used to denote a lower level of training and skill than a 'paramedic'.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{analyzes}} one {{the existing}} experience of “school – enterprise – higher technical educational institution” educational line by using multiple case studies method which allows revealing conditions for {{efficient use of}} this <b>educational</b> <b>approach.</b> By comparing “school – enterprise – higher technical <b>educational</b> institution” <b>approach</b> to traditional <b>educational</b> <b>approach</b> used by classical universities both {{advantages and disadvantages of}} both are revealed. Then by means of correlation analysis of two sets of data concerning “school – enterprise – higher technical <b>educational</b> institution” <b>approach</b> and traditional higher education the main factors defining the success of each of these methods are defined, and the model situation for implementation of “school – enterprise – higher technical <b>educational</b> institution” <b>approach</b> is created. The limitations of using educational model in question are defined as well, and include certain fields of knowledge, approach to course design, methods to be implemented. The paper also defines the possibility of using “school – enterprise – higher technical <b>educational</b> institution” <b>approach</b> within Bologna process, limitations and possibilities provided by this approach within bachelor-master two stage education. The paper suggests an algorithm for implementation of “school – enterprise – higher technical <b>educational</b> institution” <b>approach</b> for contemporary universities, which was implemented at Kazan federal university for applied sciences education. The paper also reveals that development of above mentioned interrelation has to be created within the entrepreneurial environment developed by the universities...|$|R
