500|$|Cosby {{continued}} to be a Jell-O spokesman through the 1990s. He was present for the lighting of the brand's first billboard in New York's Times Square in 1998. In 1999, Cosby's 25th year as spokesman for Jell-O, was also the final year he appeared in its advertising. The company distributed 120,000 copies of his picture book series, Little Bill, into American public libraries. [...] Despite the transitions of advertising agencies and the 1989 merger of General Foods into Kraft, Cosby remained with Jell-O. [...] He appeared at the Utah State Senate in 2001 to designate Jell-O the official state snack, and made a promotional visit to the Jell-O Gallery in 2004. In 2010, Cosby returned to Jell-O as executive producer for the company's [...] "Hello Jell-O" [...] campaign. In return, the brand sponsored his weekly web show OBKB, a children's interview series similar to <b>Kids</b> <b>Say</b> the Darndest Things.

500|$|<b>Kids</b> Can <b>Say</b> No! resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecently assaulting young girls.

5|$|Harris {{said that}} {{he came up with}} the idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. <b>Kids</b> Can <b>Say</b> No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using <b>Kids</b> Can <b>Say</b> No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of <b>Kids</b> Can <b>Say</b> No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of <b>Kids</b> Can <b>Say</b> No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|R
