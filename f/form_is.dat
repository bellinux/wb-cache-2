5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed to dry. More mud is added and allowed to dry to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud <b>form</b> <b>is</b> filled with wetter mud and allowed to dry.|$|E

5000|$|Comparison <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> usual {{only for}} {{qualitative}} adjectives and adverbs. Comparative and superlative synthetic <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> {{not part of}} the paradigm of original adjective but are different lexical items, since not all qualitative adjectives have them. Few adjectives have irregular <b>forms</b> which <b>are</b> declined as usual adjectives: [...] 'big' — [...] 'bigger', [...] 'good' — [...] 'better'. Most synthetically derived comparative <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> derived by adding [...] or [...] to adjective stem: [...] 'red' — [...] 'more red'; these <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> difficult to distinguish from adverbs, and probably they are adverbs. Superlative synthetic <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> derived by adding suffix [...] or [...] and additionally sometimes prefix , or using special comparative form with наи-: [...] 'kind' — [...] 'the kindest', [...] 'big' — [...] 'the biggest'.|$|R
