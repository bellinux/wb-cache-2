5000|$|Regardless of the {{anatomical}} {{position of the}} star as a distal (protruding or <b>extending)</b> <b>portion</b> of the nose, {{this is not an}} olfactory structure nor an extra hand. The appendages do not contain muscles or bones and are not used to manipulate objects or capture prey. They are controlled by tendons by a complex series of muscles that are attached to the skull in order to perform a role that seems to be purely mechanical. For this purpose, the star also contains a remarkably specialized epidermis covered entirely by 25,000 small raised domes or papillae of approximately [...] in diameter. These domes, known as Eimer’s organs, are the only type of receptor organs found in the star of the star-nosed mole which proves that the star-like structure has clearly a mechanical functioning.|$|E
40|$|In a {{very high}} or very low {{temperature}} duct system in which duct insulation is terminated at selected locations {{so as to be}} not coextensive with the duct, an annular metal perforated or mesh screen support flange is used, as a low conductor of heat or cold, between the duct and an outer insulation cover to retain the end of the insulation and to support its usually very thin cover. The screen may be Z-shaped in cross section having a small diameter annular portion to surround and be secured to the duct adjacent the end of the insulation. A generally radially <b>extending</b> <b>portion</b> of the screen extends outwardly from the small diameter portion and adjacent the end of the insulation. The periphery of the radially <b>extending</b> <b>portion</b> is in alignment with the outer peripheral surface of the insulation and the outer peripheral surface of the insulation cover. A large diameter annular portion of the screen extends longitudinally from the periphery in the direction opposite the small diameter portion, and is adapted to surround the insulation and its cover and be secured thereto. The screen may also be U or channel-shaped with one longitudinally directed leg secured to the insulation cover and the other leg secured to the duct under the insulation...|$|E

500|$|With this {{extension}} the Utah {{definition of}} US163 conflicted with the AASHTO definition. UDOT resolved this discrepancy by signing the <b>extended</b> <b>portion</b> as State Route 163.

[...] Although the state changed the definition of US163 back to match the national definition in 2004, the portion north of Bluff remained unsigned. In October 2008, UDOT requested and obtained approval to truncate US163 to the junction with US191 resolving the discrepancy.|$|R
