The main method used for this research work is interview. Data were collected from 5 heterogeneous supermarkets and used {{as a tool for}} obtaining facts. When the goods were supplied the update of the stocks were being taken from time to time. The finding shows the challenges facing the manual system of inventory management system; the manual system requires everyday counting of items in the inventory, human errors are very prevalent during counting and recording and in case of disaster like fire or flood or poor communication, all the manual inventory records will be damaged and irretrievable. Based on the findings this paper highlights the possible solutions to the above problems; a computerized inventory management system to order and update the stocks was designed and goods were supplied to implement the possible solutions...|$|R

Gathered information was then distributed by the SD through secret internal political reports entitled Meldungen aus dem Reich (reports from the Reich) to the upper echelons of the Nazi Party, enabling Hitler's regime to evaluate the general morale and attitude of the German people so it could be timely manipulated by the Nazi propaganda machine.

40|$|Abstract. In edge orientations, {{the goal}} is usually to orient (direct) the edges of an undirected network (modeled by a graph) such that all outdegrees are bounded. When the network is fully dynamic, i. e., admits edge insertions and deletions, we wish to {{maintain}} such an orientation while <b>keeping</b> a <b>tab</b> on the update time. Low out-degree orientations {{turned out to be}} a surprisingly useful tool for managing networks. Brodal and Fagerberg (1999) initiated the study of the edge orientation problem in terms of the graph’s arboricity, which is very natural in this context. Their solution achieves a constant out-degree and a logarithmic amortized update time for all graphs with constant arboricity, which include all planar and excluded-minor graphs. It remained an open question – first proposed by Brodal and Fagerberg, later by Erickson and others – to obtain similar bounds with worst-case update time. We address this 15 year old question by providing a simple algorithm with worst-case bounds that nearly match the previous amortized bounds. Our algorithm is based on a new approach of maintaining a combinatorial invariant, and achieves a logarithmic out-degree with logarithmic worst-case update times. This result has applications to various dynamic network problems such as maintaining a maximal matching, where we obtain logarithmic worst-case update time compared to a similar amortized update time of Neiman and Solomon (2013). ...|$|R

50|$|Home {{security}} {{involves the}} security hardware {{in place on}} a property, and personal security practices. The hardware would be the doors, locks, alarm systems, lighting, motion detectors, security camera systems, etc. that are installed on a property. Personal security practices would be ensuring doors are locked, alarms activated, windows closed, extra keys not hidden outside and many other routine tasks which act to prevent a burglary. According to an FBI report, 58.3 percent of burglaries involved forcible entry. A typical burglary lasts for about 8 to 12 minutes and, on average, a burglar will break into a home within 60 seconds. Home security can be strengthened by adding a first line of defence like a thorny shrub or bush to give the burglar a hard time. A motion activated bright light can play a psychological role in deterring a burglar, also acting as a second line of defence along with outdoor security cameras. In {{order to protect the}} entry points, we need to have window and door sensors. Once a burglar gets past the second line of defence, motion detectors kick in. A motion detector can raise an alarm or send a security footage to the homeowner if it's linked to a camera system. Storing valuables like passports, jewelry, important documents, etc. might also be considered a home security precaution. Common security methods include never hiding extra keys outside, never turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and <b>keeping</b> good <b>tabs</b> with neighbours.|$|R

40|$|State legislatures enacted sex {{offender}} registration and notification (SORN) laws with the explicit and exclusive aim of reducing {{sex offender}} recidivism. The general {{idea that we}} ought to “regulate” released offenders — of any type — to reduce the likelihood of their returning to crime is an attractive one, at least in theory. Criminal recidivism generates significant social harm. Nevertheless, despite their now-widespread use, SORN laws became the norm without any systematic study of their consequences. Admittedly, the logic underlying these laws seems at first difficult to gainsay: if a known sex offender poses even a small risk to a potential new victim, how can it hurt if the police are <b>keeping</b> better <b>tabs</b> on that offender or if the offender’s neighbors are made aware that he is a threat so they can take measures to reduce their own risk of victimization? But this question and its implied answer presume that SORN laws have no influence whatever on whether released sex offenders opt to pursue new victims in the first place. If the enforcement of notification laws imposes significant financial, social, and psychological costs on released sex offenders, as an avalanche of evidence suggests it does, then notification may in fact be criminogenic. The result may well be many more attempted attacks by convicted sex offenders and therefore higher recidivism rates on the whole, even if every individual attack attempted becomes somewhat less likely to succeed...|$|R
