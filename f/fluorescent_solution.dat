This article reports a study investigating hand and environmental contamination levels when health care workers (HCWs) followed two different methods of removing gloves at two distances from the rubbish bin.

40|$|Fluorescence {{confocal}} microscopy {{represents one}} of the central tools in modern sciences. Correspondingly, a growing amount of research relies on the development of novel microscopic methods. During the last decade numerous microscopic approaches were developed for the investigation of various scientific questions. Thereby, the former qualitative imaging methods became replaced by advanced quantitative methods to gain more and more information from a given sample. However, modern microscope systems being as complex as they are, require very precise and appropriate calibration routines, in particular when quantitative measurements should be compared over longer time scales or between different setups. Multispectral beads with sub-resolution size are often used to describe the point spread function and thus the optical properties of the microscope. More recently, a fluorescent layer was utilized to describe the axial profile for each pixel, which allows a spatially resolved characterization. However, fabrication of a thin fluorescent layer with matching refractive index is technically not solved yet. Therefore, we propose a novel type of calibration concept for sectioned image property (SIP) measurements which is based on <b>fluorescent</b> <b>solution</b> and makes the calibration concept available for a broader number of users. Compared to the previous approach, additional information can be obtained by application of this extended SIP chart approach, including penetration depth, detected number of photons, and illumination profile shape. Furthermore, due to the fit of the complete profile, our method is less susceptible to noise. Generally, the extended SIP approach represents a simple and highly reproducible method, allowing setup independent calibration and alignment procedures, which is mandatory for advanced quantitative microscopy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Shake flasks {{have been}} used for {{screening}} process in fermentations for a long time. The oxygen transfer rates of the fermentation media change with viscosity. The liquid distribution in hydrophilic shake flask becomes asymmetrical as the viscosity of the liquid increases. Therefore, a non-invasive optical technique has been developed to collect angular information on the shape of the liquid at different operating conditions like shaking frequency, shaking diameter, and filling volume. This technique uses light emitting diodes, a photomultiplier tube and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>solution.</b> 16 sets of optical fibers with each set comprises of 2 optical fibers arranged in certain angle of incident light between the fibers are attached at different heights of the outside wall of a shake flask. Blue lights from the light emitting diodes are switched alternately at different heights and excite the fluorescent molecules in the flask. The emission lights are then sent through the optical fibers back to the head-on photomultiplier tube. With LabVIEW program, automatic and manual mode of signal data collections from the photomultiplier tubes are available. The digital signals received and saved indicating the liquid distribution are then analyzed in MATHLAB for the shape. However, prior to the identification of the shape of the liquid distribution in shake flask, the optimizations of the signal parameters are investigated. The influences of the intensity of the light emitting diodes and the photomultiplier tube’s sensitivity level to the liquid distribution’s signal at a certain shaking frequency and at each height at a fixed filling volume are observed. Varying these parameters change the output voltages from the photomultiplier tube. However, the shapes of the liquid distributions remain the same. The varying numbers of rotations collected in reference to the mean show acceptable percentage deviations but slight sharp increases of the percentage are shown especially {{at the start of the}} bulk liquid.

Such integrated approach has many advantages over traditional free-space optical sensing, such as compactness and portability, enhanced sensitivity {{and the possibility of}} parallel excitation at multiple points in the channel. Femtosecond laser pulses allow the microfabrication of optical waveguides into glass substrates, by exploiting nonlinear absorption in the focal volume, to induce a local refractive index modification.
