5|$|Model {{believed}} that the situation represented not just a threat, but also an opportunity to counter-attack and possibly clear the Allies out of the Southern Netherlands. Towards this end, he forbade SS General Willi Bittrich and SS Lieutenant General Heinz <b>Harmel,</b> commanding II SS Panzer Corps and 10th SS Panzer respectively, from destroying the Nijmegen bridge. With the exception of this tactical error, Model is considered to have fought an outstanding battle and handed the Allies a sharp defeat. The bridge at Arnhem was held and the 1st Airborne Division destroyed, dashing the Allies' hopes for a foothold over the Rhine {{before the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945, the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then {{deployed}} to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In {{danger of being}} cut off by Allied forces, the brigade soon returned to the Julian Alps, having to fight {{its way through the}} Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at Pottenstein, Bavaria, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) commanded by SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Heinz <b>Harmel,</b> which was ordered to keep the Karawanks passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task, {{and was one of the}} last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E

25|$|On 6 October, the Rivonia Trialists were {{formally}} charged. On 13 June 1964, Mbeki organised a {{march from}} Brighton to London, after the Rivonia Trialists {{were found guilty}} of high treason. They {{were expected to be}} sentenced to death. The students held a night march to 10 Downing Street and handed a petition, signed by 664 staff and students at Sussex University, to the Prime Minister. Thereafter, they held a demonstration outside South Africa House in Trafalgar Square. The next day, London television showed Mbeki leading the march. This kind of lobbying helped the Trialists, who were spared the hangman's noose. For the next three decades, Mbeki would take up the job of rallying support against apartheid. Mbeki completed his bachelor's degree in economics at Sussex University in May 1965. With his own parents unable to attend his graduation ceremony, Adelaide Tambo and Michael <b>Harmel</b> took their place at the event. While in London, Mbeki spent all of his summers with the Tambo family.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, in his {{assessment}} of the German perspective at Arnhem, Robert Kershaw concluded that [...] "the battle on the Waal at Nijmegen {{proved to be the}} decisive event" [...] and that Arnhem became a simple matter of containment after the British had retreated into the Oosterbeek perimeter. After that, it was merely [...] "a side-show to the crisis being enacted on the Waal". Heinz <b>Harmel</b> asserted that [...] "The Allies were stopped in the south just north of Nijmegen– that is why Arnhem turned out as it did." [...] Gavin himself commented that [...] "there was no failure at Arnhem. If, historically, there remains an implication of failure it was the failure of the ground forces to arrive in time to exploit the initial gains of the [...] Airborne Division".|$|E
500|$|The Germans were {{unprepared}} for the landings and initially thrown into confusion. Model—erroneously assuming that the paratroopers had come to capture him—fled his headquarters at the Tafelberg hotel in Oosterbeek and went to Bittrich's headquarters east of Arnhem at Doetinchem where he took personal control of the battle. The 10th SS Division was sent south {{to respond to the}} American landings at Nijmegen and to defend the [...] "island" [...] (the polder between the Lower Rhine and Waal rivers), while the 9th would defend Arnhem. The 9th SS was at that point making preparations to return to Germany and <b>Harmel</b> was in Berlin trying to secure more men and supplies for his unit. He was instantly ordered to return to Arnhem whilst his division began to prepare its forces for battle. Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Spindler—commander of the 9th SS Armoured Artillery Regiment—quickly organised a small battlegroup (Kampfgruppe Spindler was initially only 120 men but would incorporate 16 separate units {{over the course of the}} battle). In the late afternoon, he was ordered to advance west to Oosterbeek and establish a blocking line to prevent the British from reaching Arnhem centre. Meanwhile, the Division's Reconnaissance Battalion under the command of Hauptsturmführer Viktor Gräbner was ordered south to Nijmegen, crossing the Arnhem bridge at dusk. Initially, however, no units were ordered to secure the bridge itself. Arnhem Garrison commander Major-General Friedrich Kussin was killed by men of the 3rd Parachute Battalion as he sped towards his headquarters, and his death led to a breakdown in command and responsibilities. It was not until late in the afternoon that the Reconnaissance Battalion of 10th SS Division were ordered to secure the bridge. At the time of the landings, only one organised unit was in place to oppose the allied advance toward the bridges (the 16 SS Training Battalion camped in Wolfheze) and their commander—Sepp Krafft—acted quickly to establish a blocking screen west of Oosterbeek.|$|E

2500|$|They {{concluded}} that it was [...] "therefore neither likely that Ephedra was a substitute for *sauma nor that it was *sauma itself" [...] and that the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine alkaloids extracted from Ephedra had to be mixed with the extract from some other plant to achieve the described effects. Flattery proposed the second plant was Peganum harmala (harmal, <b>harmel,</b> Syrian rue, see also harmaline), known in Iranian languages as esfand, sepand or other similar terms related to Avestan word spenta ('sacred', 'holy'). Flattery considered <b>harmel</b> {{to be the real}} haoma, with ephedra only being the secondary ingredient in the parahaoma mixture. Other reasons for preferring Peganum harmala as the identity of soma-haoma include its use as an entheogen in some South American cultures, mirroring its role in Indo-Iranian religion, and its being the only incense plant with hallucinogenic properties in Iran.|$|E

40|$|It may be {{worthwhile}} {{to build up}} the discussion of this example from the simplest case, showing how Bayesian methods lead to useful solutions at each stage. As we complicate the model, pitfalls for Bayesian inference will arise: naively extending Bayesian priors that seem reasonable for simple versions of the model to more complicated ones can inadvertently imply prior certainty or near-certainty about exactly the parameter that we are trying to estimate (and thus presumably are uncertain about). The lesson here is that in complex problems, prior distributions should always be assessed for their implications about data behavior and parameters of interest, to be sure that they are not putting too much probability on data behavior we actually believe highly unlikely or too little probability on parameter values or data behavior we actually consider plausible. Very similar examples, making similar points, appear in the paper by <b>Harmeling</b> and Toussaint (2007), which I read only after much of this comment was written.

40|$|This paper tackles the {{question}} of regionalist parties, a quite underdeveloped aspect of the literature, even if the phenomenon is of increasing importance in European democracies. In that sense, Belgian regionalist parties (VU, FDF and RW) are an interesting case study. They recorded significant success in the 1960 s– 1970 s. Yet, three decades later, they disappeared or declined severely. This paper shows how this ‘Icarus’ fate’ is {{explained by the fact}} that Belgian regionalist parties were victims of their own success.

30|$|Stimulated by {{the online}} blind {{deconvolution}} algorithm proposed by Stefan <b>Harmeling</b> et al. [17], we propose a multi-frame super-resolution algorithm operating in online mode which we name as online SR (OSR). Different from the OBDSR, the different {{information provided by}} different LR images in our algorithm results from relative motion between each other instead of different blur kernels. Another difference is that we employ a modified steepest gradient optimization method to estimate the HR image instead of an auxiliary function, which is {{proved to be more}} robust to noise. In this paper, the LR images are assumed to be obtained in a streaming fashion with a common space-invariant blur, and the relative motion between each other can be modeled as translation. At each time, we get an LR image, and we immediately use it to improve the current HR image estimate.|$|R
30|$|Stefan <b>Harmeling</b> et al. [17] are {{the first}} to propose a blind {{deconvolution}} algorithm for astronomical imaging working in online mode. Instead of minimizing the total overall cost function for all blurry images, they just minimized the cost function for one image at each time and the current deblurred image was used as the initial estimate for the next time recursively. Thus, the deblurred image was refined gradually along with the image capturing. Hirsch et al. [18] extended the online blind deconvolution algorithm by incorporating super-resolution. The different information contained in different LR images results from blurring with different blur kernels. Both online blind deconvolution (OBD) and its SR extension (OBDSR) get the HR image estimate by minimizing an auxiliary function rather than minimizing the cost function directly to avoid image overfitting, while sometimes the strategy failed, especially when the noise of LR images is large.|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{incremental}} generalized expectation maximization (GEM) framework {{to model the}} multiframe blind deconvolution problem.

These features are seamlessly integrated into our incremental GEM framework to yield simple but efficient multiframe blind deconvolution algorithms. We present technical details concerning critical steps of our algorithms, especially to highlight how all operations can be written using matrix-vector multiplications. We apply our algorithm to real-world images from astronomy and super resolution tasks. Our experimental results show that our methods yield improved resolution and deconvolution at the same time. 1...|$|R
