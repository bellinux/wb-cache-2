25|$|Almost 60 years later, in 1937, the iconostasis was renovated again {{although}} but the re-painting {{work was}} considered to be of really low artistic quality. This time the icons were not removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> and only a thick layer of varnish was applied to them. This layer made the icons lose their original colors and become even darker. The wooden structure of the iconostasis was painted with light green oil paint.|$|E
25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> extensions by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|E

In 1997 Daniel and Fergus are arguing because Daniel has his real dad with him and Fergus doesn't. Fergus throws a {{baseball}} at Daniel, he ducks and goes through the mirror, at the same time Constance argues with her father not to sell the crown and grabbed it from his hands and races through the mirror. As Constance and Daniel are travelling through the mirror, the baseball hits it and it shatters into thousands of pieces.

25|$|The Model 1910 fires from {{a locked}} breech. When fired, the barrel and bolt recoil together. The barrel will stop in a {{rearward}} position. The bolt, unlocking itself, will then continue forward, stripping the chamber and driving the barrel forward again. After this action, a wedge will rise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> and lock the entire frame back into position. This firing system wasn't strong {{and had to}} fire cartridges weaker than the comparable 9×19 Parabellum caliber. The screw {{at the front of}} the frame, when undone will allow the removal of a plate on the left side of the pistol granting access to the moving parts within the pistol. This design was not stiff enough to sufficiently support the left side of the barrel extension and after prolonged firing, the left plate was prone to loosening. The only safety on the pistol was a small lever set in front of the grip.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{windows on}} the south, east, north wing of the east wall, the west wall, and all walls in the north wing are similar. They consist of two rectangular, facing guillotine sashed windows covered by heavy wooden shutters painted dark green and fixed with wrought iron H or H-L hinges. The shutters are not of colonial origin. The east façade had two window openings: a large rectangular one that is 9 feet wide and 8’ 2” high with 16 over 16 glass panes and a circular window above it with an inner section in quarters and an outer section in eighths. The circular window, in particular, is of uncertain authenticity as it is claimed that until restorations in 1930 it contained not the present type of window but either plastered over stone and rubble or a millstone. All of the other windows have 12 over 12 glass panes. The single south window is 7’ 2” wide and 8 feet high white the north wing has two smaller windows on its east and west walls and another on its north face. The frames for all the windows are flat with painted wood. The wooden, bottom sill projects slightly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> All have brick sills with ovolo cast bricks marking them.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} an aspectual frame is the unrealized inceptive aspect ('just about to X'), {{illustrated}} here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward {{to point out the}} recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, catching her breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E
25|$|The iconostasis {{underwent}} {{its first}} renovation {{when the church}} building was extended in 1868. According to the restorers' report, only the icons of the first tier and the holy doors were repainted at the time. The heavier use of this tier and the doors might have influenced the repainting but during the renovation signs of fire damage were also discovered. The first restoration therefore probably aimed to conceal the damage. A few years later, in the mid 1870s the entire iconostasis was renovated. After the lateral aisles {{were added to the}} church, the parish decided to reshape the interior of the building. For this purpose they had to dismount the icons <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> The icons and their framework were renewed under the supervision of György Révész. Gyula Petrovics, a painter, and Károly Müller, a gilder, worked in his restoration team. They did not change the composition of the icons or paint them over. Minor modifications were found only on some of the images of the first, so-called Feasts tier. Révész's team worked with oil paint which was covered by a layer of varnish. The varnish first turned yellow, and later giving the original colors a darker, matte appearance. The framework of the iconostasis was marbleized. The coloring of the molding and the fundamental elements of the wooden frame resembled gray marble, while the pilasters and the columns were painted to resemble blue marble. This pattern was also adopted {{for the rest of the}} church's furniture, except for the red-ocher altar table.|$|E

500|$|The main {{structural}} {{components of}} the Patrie, like those of its predecessor, were the envelope (or [...] "gas-bag"), a nickel-steel frame or keel, and a gondola suspended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a ballonet, the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective {{of the degree of}} expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. Attached to both the gas-bag and the gondola were active and passive control surfaces to provide lateral and vertical stability and to give the pilot directional control over the airship.|$|E
500|$|Parts of the Air Tractor {{are already}} known to exist: The Australian Antarctic Division has one wheel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> and its ice-rudder – {{both of which}} were found in the harbour.

On 1 January 2010, a day of unusually low tide, 4 small capping pieces from the end section of the tail were found by the edge of the harbour. The tail and a section of fuselage had been removed {{from the rest of the}} air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore this discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but it suggests that [...] "the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100years in this environment".|$|E

[...] Batman was doing better, but his comics were [...] "lackluster" [...] in comparison to his earlier [...] "atmospheric adventures" [...] of the 1940s, and Wonder Woman, having lost her original writer and artist, was no longer [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] or [...] "interesting." [...] Jacobs describes the arrival of Showcase #4 on the newsstands as [...] "begging to be bought," [...] the cover featured an undulating film strip depicting the Flash running so fast that he had escaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> Editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox, and artist Carmine Infantino were some of the people behind the Flash's revitalization. Robert Kanigher wrote the first stories of the revived Flash, and John Broome was the writer of many of the earliest stories.|$|E
500|$|On 9 June 1928, Harry Bull {{died and}} the rectory again became vacant. In the {{following}} year, on 2 October, the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the house. Soon after moving in, Smith's wife, while cleaning out a cupboard, came across a brown paper package containing the skull of a young woman. Shortly after, the family reported a variety of incidents including the sounds of servant bells ringing despite their being disconnected, lights appearing in windows and unexplained footsteps. In addition, Smith's wife believed she saw a horse-drawn carriage at night. The Smiths contacted the Daily Mirror asking {{to be put in}} touch with the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). On 10 June 1929 the newspaper sent a reporter, who promptly wrote {{the first in a series}} of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley. The paper also arranged for Harry Price, a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the house. He arrived on 12 June and immediately phenomena of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. [...] "Spirit messages" [...] were tapped out <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of a mirror. As soon as Price left, these ceased. Smith's wife later maintained that she already suspected Price, an expert conjurer, of falsifying the phenomena.|$|E
500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom.

Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|E
