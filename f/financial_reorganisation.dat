Barnato had incorporated Baromans Ltd in 1922, which existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of £100,000, saving the business and its workforce. A <b>financial</b> <b>reorganisation</b> of the original Bentley company was carried out and all existing creditors paid off for £75,000. Existing shares were devalued from £1 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares giving him {{control of the company}} and he became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 secured by debenture in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929. With renewed financial input, W. O.

50|$|The {{property}} of the Westfalenstadion, originally belonging {{to the city of}} Dortmund and later sold to the club Borussia Dortmund, was sold to a real estate trust in 2002 when the club was facing serious financial problems. Following that, Westfalenstadion was in the possession of Florian Homm for about two years, it was sold back to a real estate trust with Borussia Dortmund intending to repurchase the stadium gradually up to 2017. However the club was not able to pay the regular rates in spring 2005 and the holders of the trust agreed in cutting back the asset's interest rates and allowed the club to pay the rates after <b>financial</b> <b>reorganisation.</b> Because of these measures, bankruptcy of the club was avoided {{and the future of the}} facility was secured. In 2006 Borussia Dortmund became the new owner by buying the stadium back with the help of a loan from Morgan Stanley.|$|E

Last but not least, topics such as asset & liability management and risk management should be reviewed with great significance...|$|R

Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152. There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of Laudabiliter, and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1873, Robert Fleming cofounded the Scottish American Investment Company for {{the purpose}} of {{investing}} in high risk, high return American railroad bonds. [...] The Scottish Widows was a significant early investor. In 1876, Flemings represented the bondholders' committee of the Erie Railway, then under the control of Jay Gould, and saw its plan for the <b>financial</b> <b>reorganisation</b> of the railroad largely adopted. Due to the successful Erie experience, and in its role as a significant railroad investor, Flemings was involved in the successful restructuring of numerous other North American railroads in the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s. Each restructuring produced significant gains for the Fleming investment trusts and drew more investors. Flemings assumed {{a central role in the}} 1886 battle with Jay Gould for control of the Texas & Pacific Railway, in which the Flemings bondholder group ultimately triumphed. Overall, Flemings claimed to have made a 40% return on investments in US railroads.|$|E
50|$|Pocklington died in 1817, {{the house}} {{remained}} a private dwelling {{until the early}} 1900s when it was converted into a hotel, it became a youth hostel in 1931 and reverted to being a hotel in 1950. The Youth Hostels Association purchased the building in 1961 and it remained a YHA hostel until 2011 {{when it was announced}} that the house would be sold as part of the YHA's <b>financial</b> <b>reorganisation.</b> The house was advertised for sale at a price of £1,250,000 in late 2011 and was described as having “spacious accommodation totalling 947 square metres (10,190 square feet) set in 6 hectares (14.8 acres) of grounds including woodlands, grassland and a waterfall.” In November 2011 Barrow House was purchased by local businessman John Snyder who has set up a charitable organisation (Derwentwater Youth Hostel Ltd.) to keep the house running as an independent hostel with the YHA agreeing to the proposal that it should retain the name of Derwentwater Youth Hostel.

40|$|An empty stage. Two performers. They apologise for {{the fact}} that the show cannot take place. Due to the <b>financial</b> <b>reorganisation</b> of the Netherland’s {{cultural}} sector they had to spend all resources on subsidy applications so that there was no time and energy left for rehearsals. They describe what should have been on stage tonight. As they get more and more carried away by their own imagination the acting becomes more complex and the picture becomes more vivid. The performance “San Francisco” by the Dutch theatre company De warme Winkel is closely connected with the political and economic climate in which it takes place: In 2013 Dutch government cut subsidies for cultural organisations by 50 percent. As a result, many dance and theatre companies, orchestras, and galleries disappeared. “San Franscisco” reflects the political and economic climate in the Netherlands and its effects on theatre-making. By analysing the performance the paper discusses three hypotheses: 1. “San Francisco” presents theatre in the nude. It shows that it is in fact pure acting that is left when everything that costs money is taken 2. Acting is presented as a practice of resistance. 3. Acting appears as movens of theatre, its driving force, keeping theatre alive in changing political, economic and social environments and climates...|$|E
