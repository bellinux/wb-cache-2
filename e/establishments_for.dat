5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol at a {{time when}} the British were {{examining}} and exploring Christmas traditions from the past, such as carols, as well as new customs such as Christmas trees. He was influenced by experiences from his own past, and from the Christmas stories of other authors, including Washington Irving and Douglas Jerrold. Dickens had written three Christmas stories prior to the novella, and was inspired to write the story following a visit to the Field Lane Ragged school, one of several <b>establishments</b> <b>for</b> London's half-starved, illiterate street children. The treatment of the poor and the ability of a self-interested man redeeming himself by transforming into a more sympathetic character are the key themes of the story. There is discussion among academics as to whether this was a fully secular story, or if it is a Christian allegory.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} an <b>establishment</b> <b>for</b> direct sales and to gather information abut planning "a marketing strategy". The main research results were as follows. Firstly, the majority of visitors are repeater. They come to the <b>establishment</b> <b>for</b> direct sales once a week. The main store where they purchase vegetables and fruits is the nearest supermarket. Secondly, customer set a high valuation on vegetables and fruit that are sold at <b>establishment</b> <b>for</b> direct sale (price, taste, safety etc.). But the convenience(display, interior,advertisements etc.) is low compared with nearest supermarket. Thirdly, with the applied quantification method, we proved a relationship between the valuations of the <b>establishment</b> <b>for</b> direct sales and visitor members. The comprehensive assessment is affected by price, taste, and safety...|$|R

5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of <b>establishments</b> <b>for</b> the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E

25|$|In June 1777, Necker {{was made}} Director-General of Finance – {{he could not}} be named {{controller}} because of his Protestant faith.

His greatest financial measures were his use of loans to help fund the French debt and his use of high interest rates rather than raising taxes. He also advocated loans to finance French involvement in the American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the main}} causes of the spread of this disease were the {{insufficient}} supply of drinking water, pollution of ground water by human waste, the warm and humid climate in summer, the overcrowding suffered by the black people and, since 1871, the overcrowding of the European immigrants who entered the country incessantly and without sanitary measures. Also, the saladeros (manufacturing <b>establishments</b> <b>for</b> producing salted and dried meat) polluted the Matanza River (south of the city limits), and the infected ditches full of debris which ran through the city encouraged {{the spread of the}} mosquito Aedes aegypti, which was responsible of transmitting Yellow Fever.|$|E

25|$|Restrictions upon {{smoking in}} bars and {{restaurants}} can substantially improve the air quality in such <b>establishments.</b> <b>For</b> example, one study listed on the website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that New York's statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable suspended particles) levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only second-hand smoke from an adjacent room was observed at baseline. The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved indoor air quality after smoking bans were instituted.|$|E

25|$|The {{administration}} of the mint was at first entrusted to the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church; direct supervision, however, was exercised by the senate, from the time at least when that body took possession of the mint, until the reign of Pope Martin V. The sindaco and the conservators of the Camera Capitolina appointed the masters of the mint, while the minting was witnessed by {{the heads of the}} guild of goldsmiths and silversmiths. In 1322 John XXII created the office of treasurer for the mint of Avignon, and its incumbent, little by little, made himself independent of the Camerlengo. Later, the office of prelate president of the mint was created.

25|$|The Current Population Survey (aka Household Survey) {{measures}} {{the percentage of}} the population that is employed and unemployed. The result can be multiplied by population estimates to get total employment estimates. This survey has the advantage over the payroll survey in that it includes self-employed. The Household Survey is less accurate in producing total numbers since it requires population estimates and in that it samples many fewer people (60,000 households versus 400,000 business <b>establishments).</b> <b>For</b> better or worse, the Household Survey counts multiple jobs held by one person only once, and it includes government workers, farm workers, unpaid family workers, and workers absent without pay. The Household Survey indicates that {{the percentage of the}} population employed decreased from 64.4% in December 2000 and January 2001 to 62.1% in August and September 2003. By August 2005, it had recovered only to 62.9%. In absolute numbers, this corresponds to a drop of 1.6 million jobs but an eventual net gain of 4.7 million jobs during the Bush administration.|$|E

25|$|On 13 May 1916, {{originating}} from BEF GHQ, orders were issued for {{the reorganization of}} Royal and Imperial Divisional Artillery <b>establishments,</b> <b>for</b> reasons of operational effectiveness, to be restructured having four generic ‘mixed’ Artillery Brigades, to a standardized: universal establishment, each Divisional Artillery Brigade was to be allocated three Field Artillery Batteries and one Howitzer Battery. The new organized Divisional Brigades neatly matched the emerging tactic of the creeping barrage, for one 18-pounder Field Battery would be superimposed over the other two firing batteries (waiting for targets of opportunity), while the 4.5-inch Howitzer Battery spread its fire ahead of the rest. This ‘operational decision’ additionally saw {{the abolition of the}} four integral ‘Brigade Ammunition Columns’ and their being broken up or absorbed into their supporting ‘Divisional Ammunition Column’. Consequently, while still in England, on 25 May 1916, the 11th (Howitzer) Brigade Ammunition Column was 'officially' absorbed into the 3rd Canadian Divisional Ammunition Column (DAC).|$|E
25|$|Between 1918 and 1974, {{some older}} {{schools that are}} today {{integrated}} into the polytechnic subsector were industrial and commercial schools of vocational education, as well as intermediate schools for primary-education-teacher training, schools of agriculture, or nursing schools. Current <b>establishments</b> <b>for</b> polytechnic studies in engineering such as the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra, the nursing schools, and the current polytechnic schools of education (Escolas Superiores de Educação) during that period had no relation with higher education, and were known by other names. Admission to these schools was open to people with no complete secondary education, with universities reserved for secondary school graduates. For decades, these vocational schools of intermediate education (known as ensino médio) {{did not have the}} higher education status or credentials they have now. However, the majority of current polytechnical institutes was fully created in the 1980s and 1990s. It must be remembered that the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa and the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, both born from the earlier industrial institutes (Instituto Industrial), were higher education degree-conferring institutions in engineering during a short period before 1919, and were known by other institutional names in their long histories.|$|E
