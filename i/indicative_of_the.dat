5|$|After making landfall, Nida {{weakened}} {{and then}} turned more northward and slowed down. Re-entering the warmer waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, Nida's winds restrengthened to 150 mph (250km/h). During the night of May 18, the typhoon began to weaken. Infrared satellite imagery showed the eye being obscured by high cirrostratus clouds, <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakening typhoon. The eyewall became significantly disorganized as Nida continued to recurve to the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Aquemini is {{the third}} studio album by American hip hop duo Outkast. It was {{released}} on September 29, 1998, by LaFace Records. The title is a portmanteau of the two performers' Zodiac signs: Aquarius (Big Boi) and Gemini (André 3000), which is <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's recurring theme of the differing personalities of the two members. The group recorded {{the majority of the}} album in Bobby Brown's Bosstown Recording Studios and Doppler Studios, both in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E

5|$|By this time, the {{neighboring}} and more populous Massachusetts Bay Colony had been established. Bradford appealed to {{leaders of the}} colony in Boston for help in reclaiming the trading post, but the Bay Colony refused. The incident was <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rivalry which persisted between Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies. In 1691, the two colonies merged to become the royal Province of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two major newspapers. The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that {{it was up to}} the city's merchants to decide whether to desegregate. This was largely <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 2015, {{the first}} image capture {{from the film}} was released, {{featuring}} Andrea, Ranjith and Mohanlal on location in Calicut.

The first poster showed an ensemble cast with Mohanlal in the centre; their facial expressions <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's thriller genre. Other posters showed Mohanlal wearing army-style camouflage pants.|$|E

5|$|The {{classical}} {{version of}} the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barriers to cyclization; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and protonation of the intermediate.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after also resulted in no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E

5|$|Between 1945 and 1955, {{the number}} of day schools run by Indian Affairs {{expanded}} from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by {{an amendment to the}} Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education {{as a result of their}} transition into the public school system.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{matters in}} Khurasan, Harun {{returned}} to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt. According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters. These numbers—and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor of 300,000 men—are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era and {{far more than the}} estimated strength of the entire Byzantine army. Although they are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size of the Abbasid force. At the same time, a naval force under his admiral Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri was prepared to raid Cyprus.|$|E
5|$|Seneb was a dwarf {{who served}} as a {{high-ranking}} court official in the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, circa 2520 BC. Seneb was a person of considerable importance and wealth who owned thousands of cattle, held twenty palaces and religious titles and was married to a high-ranking priestess of average size with whom he had three children. His successful career and the lavishness of his burial arrangements are <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acceptance given to dwarfs in ancient Egyptian society, whose texts advocated the acceptance and integration of those with physical disabilities.|$|E

5|$|St Andrew's Anglican Church {{has three}} {{distinctive}} internal transept arches, and {{was designed by}} a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, {{and the top of}} the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area's affluence. Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s. The same building was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the Taoist deity of Wong Tai Sin, and the upper floor houses the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Kwan Yin.|$|E
5|$|The Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo {{seems to}} have had a similar {{projecting}} entrance to the Great Mosque of Mahdiya. The original building had an open central courtyard with three arcades. Its layout was similar to the Kairouan and Samarra mosques. These had round arches on pre-Islamic columns with Corinthian capitals. There were three domes (<b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location of the prayer hall), two at the corners of the qibla wall and one over the prayer niche, and a small brick minaret over the main entrance. The gallery around the courtyard had series of columns and the prayer hall, which had the domes built over it, had five more rows of five pillars.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, polyuria, and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E

5|$|The rise of {{successful}} freedmen—through either political influence in imperial service, or wealth—is {{a characteristic of}} early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by , and by their ownership {{of some of the}} most lavish houses at Pompeii, such as the House of the Vettii. The excesses of nouveau riche freedmen were satirized in the character of Trimalchio in the Satyricon by Petronius, who wrote in the time of Nero. Such individuals, while exceptional, are <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upward social mobility possible in the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} of Limusaurus show morphological traits associated with herbivory that are shared {{with other groups}} of herbivorous theropods, including the Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, Oviraptorosauria, and Alvarezsauroidea, along with the troodontid Jinfengopteryx. In particular, adult specimens are characterized {{by the presence of}} stomach stones (gastroliths), with older adults having gastroliths that are larger and more numerous than those of younger adults; the size and quantity of these gastroliths are comparable to those of birds in young adults, and those of ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs in old adults. These groups of theropods all used gastroliths in processing plant matter, suggesting that Limusaurus did the same; the increased amount of gastroliths in older adults may be <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gut's ability to finely process plant matter increasing with age. An isotope analysis of the available {{specimens of}} Limusaurus specimens likewise showed that adults consistently match the isotope signatures of other herbivorous dinosaurs; however, in the same analysis, juveniles and subadults were found to vary greatly in their isotopic signatures. This indicates that juveniles were likely omnivorous, but switched to strict herbivory as they aged. This is comparable to the diet shift experienced by the aforementioned mullets and armored catfish.|$|E
5|$|An initial {{photo shoot}} with the band's long-time {{photographer}} Anton Corbijn was done near U2's Berlin hotel in late 1990. Most {{of the photos}} were black-and-white, and the group felt they were not <b>indicative</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the new album. They re-commissioned Corbijn for an additional two-week photo shoot in Tenerife in February 1991, for which they dressed up and mingled with the crowds of the annual Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, presenting a more playful side of themselves. It was during the group's time in Tenerife and during a four-day shoot in Morocco in July that they were photographed in drag. Additional photos were taken in Dublin in June, including a shot of a naked Clayton. The images were intended to confound expectations of U2, and their full colour contrasted with the monochromatic imagery on past sleeves.|$|E
