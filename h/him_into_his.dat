5|$|During Bieksa's tenure {{with both}} the Manitoba Moose and Vancouver Canucks, he became close friends with {{teammate}} Rick Rypien, who committed suicide in August 2011 after years of clinical depression. Bieksa was the first Canucks teammate that Rypien confided in regarding his mental health; when Rypien took his first personal {{leave of absence from}} the Canucks in the 2008–09 NHL season, Bieksa took <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> home to live with his family. Having a close relationship with Rypien, Bieksa was involved in many of the ceremonies following his death. He was a pall bearer for Rypien's casket at his funeral in Alberta and he later presented Rypien's family with one of the forward's game-worn Canucks jerseys during the team's pre-game ceremony in Rypien's honour in October 2011.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ilford, Essex, Grant {{developed}} {{an interest in}} occultism and Asian religion during his teenage years. After several months serving in India with the British Army amid the Second World War, he returned to Britain and became the personal secretary of Aleister Crowley, the ceremonial magician who had founded Thelema in 1904. Crowley instructed Grant in his esoteric practices, initiating <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own occult order, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). When Crowley died in 1947, Grant was seen as his heir apparent in Britain, and was appointed as such by the American head of the O.T.O., Karl Germer. Founding the London-based New Isis Lodge in 1954, Grant added to many of Crowley's Thelemite teachings, bringing in extraterrestrial themes and influences {{from the work of}} H.P. Lovecraft. This was anathema to Germer, who expelled Grant from the O.T.O. in 1955, although the latter continued to operate his Lodge regardless until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Derek Charles (Idris Elba) {{works for}} a finance company and is married to Sharon (Beyoncé). While Derek is at work, he greets {{temporary}} worker Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, attempts to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party {{and at one point}} she follows him to his car in the parking garage and attempts to seduce him with revealing lingerie and fishnet stockings but Derek refuses again and forces her out of his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide by drug overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E

5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy toxic waste dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after being}} hired {{he was taken}} aside by the news {{producer}} and asked to read the on-air bulletin for the nightly broadcast. He read the news for three months until one night when he condensed a six-minute bulletin into three minutes. He attributed this to stage fright, which caused him to speak too fast. The rest of the production crew were not {{ready to move on}} to the next news items, leaving Harries standing in silence for several minutes. Harries recalled in a 2007 interview that Steve Morrison, the producer of the bulletin, called <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> office and berated him, telling him he did not deserve to be on television and that he would no longer be reading the news. Morrison's remarks angered Harries to such a point that he assaulted the man. Aware that he was going to lose his job, he contacted a Granada colleague who got him a new job at Granada's London centre, which he took up at the age of 23.|$|E
5|$|Veronica and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) watch a {{movie at}} her house. She {{questions}} him about Piz’s mood, while Keith enters and says he is currently unopposed in the Sheriff election. Piz runs up to Veronica and states {{that he has been}} chosen to be a guide for a rock star named Desmond Fellows. However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find a flyer for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E

5|$|As the Canucks {{opened the}} 1992 playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets, Bure {{recorded}} his first NHL hat trick in game six to help force a seventh and deciding game. Vancouver won the series {{to advance to}} the second round, but were eliminated by the Edmonton Oilers. Bure finished his first Stanley Cup playoffs with six goals and 10 points in 13 games. At the end of the season, he was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. His 60 points were second among first-year players to Tony Amonte's 69 points with the Rangers, although Bure played in 14 fewer games. When accepting the award, Bure thanked Canucks linemate Igor Larionov for his guidance. On arriving in Vancouver, his former Red Army teammate took <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> home for two weeks before Bure moved into his own apartment; the two also roomed together on the road. Bure's Calder Trophy, along with head coach Pat Quinn's Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach, marked the first major individual NHL awards in Canucks' team history. However, despite being named the league's top rookie, Bure was left off the NHL All-Rookie Team, making him the only Calder recipient not to be named to the lineup. This was because he split his time playing both left and right wing. When it came to voting for the players, Bure had the most total votes, but not enough at either position to claim a spot.|$|E
5|$|The Messians {{instruct}} the hero {{to use the}} Seven Pillars of Solomon, collected during his travels, at ground zero of the missile attacks in order to open a gateway to the demon world of Atziluth and defeat the demons once and for all. Once in the demon world, the heroes travel through several areas and defeat the ruling demon overlords. If the heroes are carrying Bael with them, they can choose to restore <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> true form, the god Baal. The god Izanagi also asks the heroes to rescue the goddess Izanami, who has been killed by the demons. After defeating all the overlords and managing to revive Izanami, the gods help the heroes travel to Lucifer's castle. If Bael has been restored into Baal, Lucifer explains that the demons are actually ancient gods cast into hell by the One True God, who is using the party to defeat his enemies, destroy both worlds and create a paradise where mankind will be under his rule forever. Lucifer offers to help the player prevent God's plans, and claims that Satan, {{who was responsible for}} the nuclear war, must be dealt with. The heroes then travel back to the human world to confront Satan. If they did not accept Lucifer's help and killed him instead, they defeat Satan and are then transported before God, who turns them into new deities and creates the Millennial Kingdom. If Lucifer is in their party, they have the chance to do battle with God. After defeating the god, he warns them that he will revive in time, and that without his help they have chosen a difficult path. Lucifer then returns to Atziluth with all the demons, sealing the rift between worlds and leaving humans to rebuild and recover from the war on their own.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, Batistuta joined River Plate's arch rivals, Boca Juniors. He {{initially}} {{found it}} hard to find his best form, in part not playing in his position. However, at the beginning of 1991, Óscar Tabárez became Boca Juniors' new manager and he gave Batistuta the support and put <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> best place in the field, the centre of attack. Batistuta finished the season as the league's top scorer as Boca Juniors won the championship.|$|E
25|$|One {{week before}} Gacy's wedding, on June 22, {{he was arrested}} and charged with aggravated battery and {{reckless}} conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth named Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, impersonating a police officer, had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> car, and forced him to perform oral sex. These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.|$|E

25|$|They {{arrive in}} Gibeah just at nightfall. The Levite {{and his party}} wait in the public square, but no one offers to extend the {{customary}} hospitality. Eventually, an old man came in from {{working in the field}} and inquired as to their situation. He, too was from the mountains of Ephraim, but had lived among the Benjaminites for some time. He invited them to spend the night at his house rather than the open square. He brought <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> house, and gave fodder to the donkeys; they washed their feet, and ate and drank.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{took them}} up on their offer and soon began {{training}} at the Freetown facility. It was there that he met Nick Steel and Brian Brieger who, in addition to Evans and Lazon, became his principal trainers. One of his earliest matches was against his former trainer Bob Evans whom he defeated at a show in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He eventually made his debut in 1994, under the name Tully McShane, and {{spent some time in}} Coastal Pro Wrestling before meeting Tony Rumble who would bring <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> emerging Boston promotion, the Century Wrestling Alliance.|$|E
25|$|On February 12, 1971, Gacy {{was charged}} with sexually assaulting a teenage boy. The youth claimed that Gacy had lured <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> car at Chicago's Greyhound bus {{terminal}} and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended. The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently sealed.|$|E

25|$|Protagoras {{was born}} in Abdera, Thrace, {{opposite}} the island of Thasos (today part of the Xanthi regional unit). According to Aulus Gellius, he originally made his living as a porter, but one day he was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of small pieces of wood he had tied with a short cord. Democritus realized that Protagoras had tied the load together with such perfect geometric accuracy {{that he must be}} a mathematical prodigy. Democritus promptly took <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own household and taught him philosophy. Protagoras became well known in Athens and even became a friend of Pericles.|$|E
