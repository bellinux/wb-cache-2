40|$|The {{distributions}} of Glyphis and sawfishes are poorly known around {{most of the}} coast of the Northern Territory (NT). Previous studies have only found Glyphis in a few of the freshwater habitats around northern Australia and as such have been considered extremely rare. Our study has expanded what is known of the distribution of Glyphis and shown that these species may be more abundant than previously thought. Three species of <b>sawfish</b> (narrow, <b>green</b> and dwarf <b>sawfish)</b> were also found across large areas of the Northern Territory. The distribution of freshwater sawfish remains poorly understood. The analysis of different catch records from NT Fisheries and survey data indicate that a standard reporting and logbook scheme should be adopted by NT Fisheries that interact with these Threatened, Endangered and Protected (TEP) species. Of these, the NT Offshore Net and Line (NTONL) fishery provides the greatest level of detail in logbooks (catch and TEP reporting) and allows for species-specific estimates of catch. In addition, observer coverage is essential to verify catch records and collect biological information for these data-deficient species. We suggest that the reporting requirements for this fishery be adopted for all commercial fisheries in the Northern Territory. Local-scale information from catch records of TEP species and observer programmes has added to our knowledge of distributions identified from TEP catch and observer data. Furthermore, the presence of Glyphis garricki in the Daly River has been confirmed by our independent surveys. Spatial and temporal patterns in abundance of these species, however, are still unclear. The NT Barramundi Fishery (NTBarr) has the greatest interactions with these species: they represent about 12 % of the elasmobranch bycatch compared to only ~ 0. 2 % of the total shark catch of the NTONL fishery. This may represent a greater local abundance of these globally threatened species inshore, especially compared to other Glyphis and sawfishes populations in the region, but the biological consequence of this interaction is unclear and requires further investigation.

Catch per unit effort was greatest in the Ashburton Estuary in October, due to an influx of <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis zijsron pups, and was orders of magnitude higher than previously reported for any Pristidae; the study sites contained P. zijsron up to almost 3 m total length.

40|$|New {{characters}} {{based on}} the arrangement and morphology of dermal denticles show that sawfishes {{can be divided into}} two distinctive groups. The first group, comprising the knifetooth sawfish Anoxypristis cuspidata, is characterized by tricuspid denticles variably located on both dorsal and ventral parts of the body. The second group is represented by species of the genus Pristis, showing an uniform and homogenous dermal covering of monocuspidate denticles on both dorsal and ventral sides of the body and within the buccopharyngeal cavity. Pristis is further divided into two subgroups: the first comprises species with denticles lacking any keels and furrows (the smalltooth sawfish Pristis pectinata, the <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis zijsron and the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata); the second comprises species with denticles presenting keels and furrows well differentiated on their anterior part (the common sawfish Pristis pristis, the largetooth sawfish Pristis perotteti and the greattooth sawfish Pristis microdon). This investigation of the dermal covering provides results which agree with studies that separate the same two species groups of Pristis on the basis of other morphological data...|$|E
40|$|Assessments of {{incidental}} wildlife mortality {{resulting from}} fishing rarely account for unobserved by-catch. We assessed by-catch of protected and vulnerable wildlife species in an Australian trawl fishery by comparing in-trawl video footage with {{data collected by}} an on-board observer. Data were obtained from 44 commercial trawls with two different by-catch reduction devices (BRDs). Eighty-six individuals from six major taxa (dolphins, sharks, rays, sea snakes, turtles and sygnathids) were documented from video analysis, including the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) and the critically endangered <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron). On {{the basis of the}} 2008 – 2009 fishing effort of 4149 trawls and scaling from these results, we estimated the annual catch of protected and vulnerable species (± 1 s. e.) at 8109 ± 910 individuals. Only 34 % of by-catch was expelled through the BRDs. Independent observer data for the 44 trawls showed that 77 % of the landed by-catch from these taxa were dead when discarded. The results indicate that unaccounted by-catch in trawl fisheries can be substantial, and that current methods of recording by-catch on-board vessels are likely to underestimate total fishing mortality. We recommend gear modifications and their validation through dedicated observer coverage, combined with in-trawl video camera deployments to improve current approaches to by-catch mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Northern Australia {{has been}} {{identified}} as the last stronghold for the dwarf sawfish Pristis clavata, <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> P. zijsron, and largetooth sawfish P. pristis, making these populations key in global conservation efforts for each species. This research assesses the levels of genetic diversity in these 3 sawfishes in Australian waters, testing for the presence of population bottlenecks using data at microsatellite loci. Levels of observed heterozygosity in each species from the west coast of Australia and the north-eastern Gulf of Carpentaria were generally high. M ratio tests suggest that assemblages of P. zijsron and P. pristis on the west coast and P. clavata and P. zijsron in the Gulf of Carpentaria may have experienced population bottlenecks. The bottlenecks are especially pronounced in P. zijsron populations and in P. clavata from the Gulf of Carpentaria. Demographic analyses, based on mtDNA data, indicate relatively recent (evolutionarily) range expansions in Pristis sawfishes in northern Australian waters, which could account for the population bottlenecks. A more recent range expansion in each of P. clavata and P. zijsron, as evidenced by more recent population divergence and more recent/higher rates of historic maternal gene flow, could account for the more pronounced bottlenecks in these species when compared to P. pristis. Given that Pristis sawfishes in Australian waters have experienced population bottlenecks, whether they be historic, contemporary or both, the preservation of remaining genetic diversity should be a high conservation priority...|$|E
40|$|Effective {{management}} of critically endangered sawfishes {{can be a}} difficult task, {{in part due to}} interspecies misidentification. Current methods for identifying sawfishes can be impractical as they are based on morphological features that are often unobservable. Further exploration is required to develop a more reliable means of identification. This study explored the utility of sawfish rostra in determining the species, size and sex of sawfishes, as rostra are commonly the only feature of a sawfish observed by fishers or present in public and private collections. A morphometric and meristic database consisting of over 1100 narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata), dwarf sawfish (Pristis clavata), largetooth (or freshwater) sawfish (Pristis pristis; formerly Pristis microdon) and <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron) rostra from Australian waters, was statistically analysed. Identification of sawfishes was found to be possible through the use of the variables: inter-tooth spacing, standard rostrum width/standard rostrum length, standard rostrum length/total rostrum length, rostrum tip width/standard rostrum length, and/or rostral tooth count range, although the distinguishing variables were species-dependent. The relationship between standard rostrum length and total length was also observed to vary substantially between most species. Models for estimating total length from standard rostrum length are provided. This study has provided a tool {{that can be used to}} identify accurately the species and size of sawfishes by their rostra, and therefore can assist in clarifying historical and contemporary sawfish records, nomenclature and distributions. A better understanding of these issues should allow sawfish conservation strategies to become more focused, and thus more effective. 14 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{largest of}} the {{sawfishes}} is the Critically Endangered <b>green</b> <b>sawfish</b> Pristis zijsron, a species believed to have undergone a major decline (38 %) in extent of occurrence. Conservation efforts are hampered {{by the lack of}} information on the habitat requirements of this species. We used passive acoustic telemetry to document the movement patterns of 37 juvenile P. zijsron (< 3000 mm total length) in a recently discovered nursery area in a remote estuary and adjacent mangrove creeks in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. All age classes had a high site fidelity near the mouth of the Ashburton River (< 700 m upstream) or in the adjacent tidal mangrove creeks. Neonates stayed close to the river mouth for several months, with movement in creasing with growth. For larger individuals, movement between the river mouth or creeks and nearshore coastal habitats was largely tidally driven, with nearshore coastal habitats used during low tide and protected tidal waters (mangrove creeks) used during high tide. Emigration from the river estuary appeared to be influenced by increases in freshwater discharge and high turbidity brought on by cyclonic rainfall events. The high relative abundance and site fidelity of multiple age classes of P. zijsron over multiple years confirms that the study area provides important nursery habitats for the species. Additionally, the localised movements of juveniles suggest that this population may be sensitive to disturbances within these habitats. Given the significance of this region for P. zijsron, it is imperative to focus conservation efforts here to ensure that the population remains in a relatively healthy condition...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{targeted}} surveys, {{together with}} the collection of sawfish (Pristidae) rostra from the general public, have demonstrated that the Kimberley and northern Pilbara are important refuges for sawfish, with four of the world's seven species found here. These comprise all of Australia's known sawfish species, including the three species protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, i. e. Freshwater Sawfish (Pristis microdon), Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata) and <b>Green</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron). The Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki), which was only described in 2008, has only recently been discovered in the Kimberley and is listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act. These species are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and collectively represent ~ 45 % of Australia's elasmobranchs that are listed as Vulnerable or higher under the EPBC Act. There is, however, limited information on the spatial extent of these species throughout Western Australia, particularly as most sawfish surveys have targeted only a few specific areas over a vast coastline. We therefore encouraged public participation in providing Pristis rostra, taken from the fish as curios, in order to extend the known locations of the species and relate these to life history stages based on their size. Here {{we report on the}} published records and our unpublished catches (n = 376) across three Pristis spp., and collate this with data from donated rostra, 73 % (n = 283) of which were considered usable, in that catch locations were reliable and they were from Western Australian waters. We provide information on sawfish distributions in Western Australia and identify areas that are important as pupping grounds, nursery areas or harbour mature individuals. We also collate known records of G. garricki and provide information on the ecology of this and the EPBC listed sawfish species...|$|E
40|$|Sawfishes (Pristidae) were {{formerly}} {{abundant in}} the western Indian Ocean, but current data on sawfish presence and distribution are lacking {{for most of the}} region. This paper summarises historical records of sawfishes in Mozambican waters and presents the findings of the first assessment of the presence and status of sawfishes in Mozambique. A countrywide baseline assessment was undertaken between May and July 2014, using interviews with artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial fishers, fish traders and fisheries monitoring staff as the primary source of information on sawfish distribution, recent catches, socio-economic value and cultural importance. Additional interviews were conducted via email or telephone with individuals running sport fishing operations or who otherwise had considerable experience interacting with the fishing sectors or the marine environment in Mozambique. Where encountered, sawfish rostra were photographed and a series of measurements and associated data were collected. In total, 200 questionnaire surveys and seven interviews with recreational fishing and dive operators were conducted, and 19 rostra were documented from museum archives and private collections, belonging to two sawfish species, the Largetooth Sawfish (Pristis pristis) and <b>Green</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (P. zijsron). The most recent captures of sawfishes were reported to have occurred in 2014. Two key sites were identified where both recent encounters were reported and numerous Largetooth Sawfish rostra were documented. Gill nets were the fishing gear most commonly attributed to sawfish catches. Sawfishes did not hold any cultural importance in Mozambique, but they have at least some socio-economic importance to artisanal fishers, primarily through the sale of their fins. The meat {{did not appear to be}} held in high regard and was usually consumed locally. Sampling and further research is now required to confirm the presence of sawfishes and to assess the primary threats to sawfishes in those areas. At one site where a number of rostra were present and where fishers stated that they still catch sawfish, gill nets are being provided to fishers as an alternative to beach seining. This may have a serious impact on the local sawfish population and more broadly for other elasmobranchs in the area. Immediate action is required to develop a landings monitoring programme in this and other key habitats, and to encourage fishers to release sawfishes alive...|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal waters}} of the {{northern}} Pilbara and the western Kimberley are a global hotspot for sawfish (Pristidae) diversity, with four of the world’s seven 1 species found there; these four species comprise all of the known Australian species. This unique group of rays is readily identified {{by the presence of}} a blade like snout possessing enlarged tooth like denticles known as rostral teeth (Last and Stevens 2009). Globally, almost all sawfishes have undergone major declines in both range and abundance, {{largely as a result of}} their vulnerability to entanglement in fishing nets, but also through loss of habitat. It is only recently that information on the distribution, ecology, biology, population demographics and genetics and habitat utilization of the Australian sawfish fauna has started to become available, with much of this information restricted to grey literature or as unpublished work in progress. There is limited (or no) information on the size of the remaining populations, but many of the world’s sawfish populations are thought to survive in small fragmented areas (e. g. Simpfendorfer 2000). The four Australian species are from two genera, and are typically found throughout northern Australia, but accurate distributional descriptions are hindered by a lack of targeted surveying and are based on: limited surveys, from anecdotal reports or from collections of dried rostra. However, the Pilbara coast and west Kimberley are known to represent an important area for the four species, namely Freshwater Sawfish (Pristis microdon), Dwarf Sawfish (Pristis clavata), <b>Green</b> <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron) and the Narrow Sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata). The first three of these species are listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and these form the basis of this review; although all are protected species within Western Australia under the Fish Resource Management Act 1994 (FRMA Act). Pristis zijsron was also listed under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950 in Western Australia in 2006. Woodside Energy Ltd contracted the Centre for Fish & Fisheries Research (Murdoch University) to provide an overview of the current knowledge of the three EPBC Act listed pristids (P. microdon, P. clavata and P. zijsron) and also the Endangered (EPBC Act) Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki) in Western Australian waters. Glyphis garricki was discovered in Western Australia in 2002 (Thorburn and Morgan 2004) and its formal description is recent (Compagno et al. 2008). Collectively, these species represent 50...|$|E
40|$|Northern Australia is {{believed}} to contain the last ‘viable’ populations of the critically endangered Freshwater Sawfish, Pristis microdon, Dwarf Sawfish, Pristis clavata, and <b>Green</b> <b>Sawfish,</b> Pristis zijsron, making these populations of global significance. Mitochondrial and microsatellite markers were used to investigate the population structure, levels of genetic diversity, and evolutionary history {{of each of these}} species in northern Australian waters. Pristis microdon, which utilizes freshwater rivers as juveniles and marine waters as adults, has high levels of mtDNA heterogeneity and no nDNA heterogeneity; indicating that this species has female philopatry coupled with male-biased dispersal in northern Australian waters. The conservation plans for this species should, therefore, place a high priority on the protection of females, pupping grounds, and nursery areas to minimize the risk of extirpation. Conservation plans also need to consider the likelihood that a decline in the abundance of this species in one location could have an effect on its abundance and genetic ‘health’ in other locations via male gene flow. In contrast, P. clavata and P. zijsron, which spend their entire lives in marine and/or estuarine waters, each have heterogeneity in the mtDNA and nDNA markers, suggesting that gene flow in both males and females is restricted at large spatial scales in northern Australian waters. Consequently, the risk of extirpation for each of these species is relatively high since a decline in abundance is unlikely to be replenished by immigration from other locations. Therefore, conservation plans for P. clavata and P. zijsron should place a high priority on the protection of males and females, as well as pupping grounds and nursery areas. Most of the assemblages of each of the Pristis species contained moderate and high levels of diversity in mtDNA and nDNA markers, respectively. This suggests that the prognosis for the short and medium-term survival of each of these species in Australian waters is relatively good, providing that measures are put in place to curb any further declines in abundance. However, the levels of mtDNA diversity in the assemblage of each of P. clavata and P. zijsron in the Gulf of Carpentaria were reduced and, therefore, these assemblages may warrant special conservation status. Finally, the evolutionary histories of the Pristis species in Australian waters have most likely {{played an important role in}} shaping the observed patterns of population structure and levels of genetic diversity, however, the relative influence of contemporary versus historic factors on the amount and distribution of genetic variation in each of these species remains somewhat unresolved...|$|E
