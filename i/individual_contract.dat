5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own <b>individual</b> <b>contract</b> with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he bend down and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the claims}} about the {{benefits}} of <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> ride on the proposition that <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> deliver higher productivity (BCA 2005 : 12; ACCI 2004 : 1; Langoulant 2004; Andrews 2004 b; OEA 2004 a; Gollan & Hamberger 2003; Howard & Andrews 2005 : 3). When productivity is higher, the corporation can afford to pay more and is more than willing to do so. <b>Individual</b> <b>contracts,</b> therefore, are a 'win win' for both corporation and employee. It is on this basis that public policy changes since 1996 have sought to discourage union-related collective bargaining and promote <b>individual</b> <b>contracting.</b> This paper seeks to assess the claims of corporate lobbyists and the Federal government that <b>individual</b> <b>contracting</b> raises productivity. It compares the effects on productivity of <b>individual</b> <b>contracting</b> and union-related collective bargaining. It also refers to comparison between the effects of <b>individual</b> <b>contracting</b> and of awards on productivity growth. It starts by looking at national level evidence in New Zealand (where a system of <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> was abruptly introduced in 1991) and Australia (where <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> have been encouraged in the federal jurisdiction since 1997), then turns to closely examine the basis of the evidence put forward by the Business Council of Australia (BCA) and, more recently, the federal government. It also considers the argument that encouragement of <b>individual</b> <b>contracting</b> will help solve the current skills shortage, and the relationship between contracting and profitability.

The distribution of earnings under registered <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> was more unequal than under CAs. Average and median earnings under registered <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> were lower than under CAs. There was little evidence that <b>individual</b> <b>contracting</b> raised wages through raising productivity. The link between contracting and pay appears contingent, varying between occupations, industries, and firm size bands and dependent upon employees' position in the labour market and employers' use of union avoidance strategies.

25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an <b>individual</b> <b>contract</b> and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
500|$|The {{circuit court}} {{noted that this}} was an issue on how the statute was to be interpreted.

[...] This amount was insufficient to cover the contracts with all Indian tribes, but was sufficient to cover each <b>individual</b> <b>contract</b> that was entered into by BIA. [...] The court noted that when construing a statute dealing with Indian tribes, the statute is to be construed to the favor of the tribe over the more general canon requiring deference to agency determinations. [...] The court then held that since there were sufficient funds to pay each <b>individual</b> <b>contract</b> in full, the government was obligated to do so. [...] The circuit court reversed and remanded the decision of the district court, ruling in favor of the Chapter.|$|E

2500|$|When {{people start}} work, there will almost {{always be a}} {{contract}} of employment that governs the relationship of employee and the employing entity (usually a corporation, but occasionally a human being). A [...] "contract" [...] is an agreement enforceable in law. Very often it can be written down, or signed, but an oral agreement is also a fully enforceable contract. Because employees have unequal bargaining power to almost all employing entities, most employment contracts are [...] "standard form". Most terms and conditions are photocopied or reproduced for many people. Genuine negotiation is rare, unlike in commercial transactions between two business corporations. This has been the main justification for enactment of rights in federal and state law. The federal right to collective bargaining, by a labor union elected by its employees, is meant to reduce the inherently unequal bargaining power of individuals against organizations to make collective agreements. The federal right to a minimum wage, and increased overtime pay for working over 40 hours a week, was designed to ensure a [...] "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers", even when a person {{could not get a}} high enough wage by individual bargaining. These and other rights, including family leave, rights against discrimination, or basic job security standards, were designed by the United States Congress and state legislatures to replace <b>individual</b> <b>contract</b> provisions. Statutory rights override even an express written term of a contract, usually unless the contract is more beneficial to an employee. Some federal statutes also envisage that state law rights can improve upon minimum rights. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 entitles states and municipalities to set minimum wages beyond the federal minimum. By contrast, other statutes such as the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, have been interpreted in a series of contentious judgments by the US Supreme Court to [...] "preempt" [...] state law enactments. These interpretations have had the effect to [...] "stay experimentation in things social and economic" [...] and stop states wanting to [...] "serve as a laboratory" [...] by improving labor rights. Where minimum rights do not exist in federal or state statutes, principles of contract law, and potentially torts, will apply.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade or more, {{employer}} use of <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> to determine pay and conditions for employees increased in Australia and elsewhere, in no small part due to encouragement by governments, including through legislation promoting Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). This paper considers the evidence on the impact of individual contacts and collective bargaining on outcomes such as pay and conditions for employees and the implications for the distribution of power. Employees on AWAs receive higher pay on average than other employees, due to the overrepresentation of managerial and senior specialised skilled staff amongst AWA employees. For other employees, however, <b>individual</b> <b>contracts</b> appear to be more likely to be associated with lower wage increases and/or a reduction in other conditions of employment. This in turn reflects the impact that <b>individual</b> <b>contracting,</b> compared to collective bargaining, has on the power of employees. Collective bargaining increases the bargaining power of employees, is the mechanism by which unions achieve most gains for their members, and is strengthened when union density is high. However, not all employees receive lower wages if they shift from collective bargaining to AWAs: some receive a non-union premium, by which employers in effect purchase a transfer of power from employees. While the impact of <b>individual</b> <b>contracting,</b> by comparison with collective bargaining, on pay and conditions may vary, it is unambiguously associated with a transfer of power from employees to employers.
