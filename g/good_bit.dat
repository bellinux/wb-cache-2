25|$|Balls {{of solid}} glass {{occasionally}} {{were used in}} a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, {{there must be something}} about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work.|$|E

He implausibly cast this scenario as a spontaneous spiritual awakening, including heartfelt testimony, which Cotton Mather claims to faithfully transcribe [...] "without adding so much as one word unto it." [...] (Cotton Mather loved puns and inside jokes and this {{could be interpreted as}} his sly way of saying Phips wrote not a single word.) ...|$|E

500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] At first we tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{dominion}} government, {{in which}} Andros oversaw {{all of the}} colonies, there was a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of jealousy, border disputes, and jockeying for position between the new governors of the various colonies, and Phips seems to have done as much to inflame these jealousies as to work past them. Phips expressed outrage at the execution of Leisler and harbored enemies of Fletcher and the New York government that replaced Leisler. Phips' ongoing struggles with Usher in New Hampshire continued as before. (In 1695, following Phips' death, Bellomont was placed over Fletcher, Usher, and Stoughton, suggesting Whitehall was unimpressed by the bickering of the three provinces, and unswayed by the particular merits of any of their arguments. Bellomont ordered a posthumous pardon of Leisler.) ...|$|E
500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only {{a bit more of}} a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E

He said the anime has [...] "a healthy dose of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of silly fun". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives us something different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E
500|$|Potter {{borrowed}} a cat, {{and took a}} pet rabbit to Fawe Park as models. Her meticulous preparation before finalizing an illustration was noted {{in a letter to}} Warne: [...] "I think I have done every imaginable rabbit background and miscellaneous sketches as well – about seventy! [...] I hope you will like them, though rather scribbled." [...] Scribbled or not, the work is of the highest quality with the sketches of onions and red carnations (which were dropped as the frontispiece) being chief examples. The illustrations communicate her obvious appreciation and love for the humble pots, onions, and flowers of the garden. [...] Many of the objects in the illustrations [...] the gate, the potting shed, the wall [...] have changed little over the years and are recognizable today from her illustrations. Aware the type of story she was writing was set primarily in colours of fawn, brown, and soft green, Potter wrote that, [...] "the (red) handkerchief will make a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of colour all through the book." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. It gave us the scares, the humor, and the layered commentary that we had come to expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 to be giving the series a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E

It had sold a clothing manufacturer to Wensum in May 2009, {{in exchange for}} Wensum shares which became worthless after the prepack. Another Wensum shareholder compared the deal to a [...] "spider eviscerating a fly it has caught, taking all the <b>good</b> <b>bits,</b> then dropping the useless carcass, which is the creditors, the shareholders {{and of course the}} taxpayer".|$|R

500|$|Critics {{have given}} [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] {{generally}} positive reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "While this isn’t saying much, 'Nerdie' provides one of Season 12’s better shows. Both plots work well, though I prefer the childproofing side of things; it peters {{out at the}} end, but it has some <b>good</b> <b>bits.</b> The episode keeps us interested and entertained."

2500|$|Philip French, after {{describing}} the Vogons as [...] "a species resembling Laughton's version of Quasimodo" [...] and writing it is [...] "not, except in its financing, anything resembling a standard Hollywood production", called the film [...] "slightly old-fashioned (few things date {{as rapidly as}} science fiction and {{our view of the}} future) and somewhat commonplace through its embracing familiar special effects. The jokes have to compete with the hardware and the actors executing them often exude a feeling of desperation... It's funnier, and obviously cleverer, than Spaceballs, Mel Brooks's puerile spoof on Star Wars, but a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> less engaging than Galaxy Quest." ...|$|E

[...] He also stated that MIT's [...] "involvement in the [...] war effort is tragic and indefensible."

He eventually removes most of the swamp that is created within the school by Fred and George in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, though he previously leaves the swamp untouched to annoy Umbridge. He does however, choose to leave a small patch of it behind, because he thinks it is [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>bit</b> of magic" [...] and a tribute to the Weasley twins.

Mitchell (then of the Memphis Horns) and Earl Randle had both worked with Green a <b>good</b> <b>bit.</b> Simmons added some music and lyrics, co-writing the finished version with Mitchell and Randle; the song was later covered not just by the Pointer Sisters but by Lyn Paul, the ex-New Seekers vocalist. The album also featured the song [...] "You Belong To Me" [...] (co-written by McDonald and Carly Simon, who had a hit with her {{own version of the}} tune). To help promote Fault Line, the band performed live on the PBS show Soundstage. Jeff Baxter used an early type of guitar synthesizer (made by Roland) on many of the tracks (it is heavily featured in his solo on the title track, as well as on [...] "Chinatown"). The combination of McDonald's cerebral approach to harmony, funkier beats and R vocal flavor, along with Baxter's guitar pyrotechnics, pushed the band away from the more proletarian biker-bong-boogie style that made them popular originally. [...] The use of complex jazz chords, built on McDonald's thoroughly composed keyboard parts, tempered by strong pop hooks, resulted in an album that, though not really jazz, had a distinctly urban contemporary finish, adding the flavor of the [...] "cool jazz" [...] era to a pop setting.|$|E
