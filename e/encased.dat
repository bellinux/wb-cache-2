5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, <b>encased</b> in tough armor.

50|$|<b>EnCase</b> is {{the shared}} {{technology}} within {{a suite of}} digital investigations products by Guidance Software. The software comes in several products designed for forensic, cyber security, security analytics, and e-discovery use. <b>Encase</b> is traditionally used in forensics to recover evidence from seized hard drives. <b>Encase</b> allows the investigator to conduct in depth analysis of user files to collect evidence such as documents, pictures, internet history and Windows Registry information.|$|R

5|$|A {{century of}} storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, {{which are now}} <b>encased</b> in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 {{glaciologist}} Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75feet (23m) of ice and about 30miles (48km) from {{the point where they}} died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the castle}} was {{suffering}} badly {{from the effects}} of coastal erosion but remained in military use until 1863. The War Office then demolished the upper levels with explosives, carrying out a second wave of demolition work in 1882 and destroying most of the surviving stonework in 1893. The remains of Sandown were purchased by the town of Deal for £35 to form part of the local sea defences. The remaining masonry was <b>encased</b> in concrete in the late 1980s to form a sea wall but remains vulnerable to further erosion by the sea.|$|E
40|$|<b>EnCase</b> is an {{all-inclusive}} forensic {{tool that}} provides acquisition utilities, analysis tools, and reporting capabilities in one program. Each of these tools provide extensive capabilities into their digital forensics purpose. <b>EnCase</b> is very user friendly {{and allows for}} a quick analysis of evidence that is very graphically driven. This graphical user interface allows for less technical users to do forensic analysis. <b>EnCase</b> is used widely by law enforcement agencies, the federal government, military entities, and private consulting firms. It is a very expensive software suite and requires a use of a dongle for the all of the software’s capabilities to work. They are also many advanced features with <b>EnCase</b> that come standard and can be purchased as modules {{to help with the}} investigation. Research {{needs to be done to}} make <b>EnCase</b> a better software suite and to keep up with the current technology trends. Digital Forensic Purpose and Current State of Practice One of the first steps in any forensic investigation is to make a bit for bit image of the storage devices that are involved with the investigation. <b>EnCase</b> also provides a first response tool for incident response that provides acquisition tools for live analysis an...|$|R

Upon disembarking at midnight, a strange phenomenon grips the city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become <b>encased</b> in coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually {{makes his way to}} the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight.|$|E
5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically <b>encased</b> in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or <b>encased</b> in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mulder harasses Tooms at work as he stalks a would-be victim. Later that night, Mulder follows him when he tries to break into a man's house. Tooms flees without attacking anyone.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often <b>encased</b> in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was <b>encased</b> in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E

5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk <b>encased</b> in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates {{embedded in the}} dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|After the siege, Maltese {{military}} engineer Girolamo Cassar drew up {{plans to}} reduce Mdina's size by half {{and turning it}} into a fortress, but these were never implemented due to protests by the city's nobles. The city's main gate was reconstructed in the early 17th century, but the next major alterations were not made until the 1650s, when the large De Redin Bastion was built at the centre of the land front. Despite these modifications, by 1658 there were also proposals to abandon or demolish the entire fortress due to its state of disrepair, although these plans were opposed by the locals. In the late 17th century, some of Mdina's medieval double walls began to be <b>encased</b> in sloping ramparts.|$|E

It has also been reported that prototypes for the proposed Atari Mindlink controller system were disposed of at the site, which only further fuels speculation, since Atari Museum owner Curt Vendel actually currently owns the Mindlink prototypes. Writing for the Pacific Historical Review, John Wills speculated that location's place in the public psyche—its proximity to the sites of both the Trinity nuclear test and Roswell UFO incident—has aided the popularity of the story.|$|E

The Doctor informs Skaldak he was <b>encased</b> in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

Once there, they discover a human figure <b>encased</b> in a crystal-like substance, who they conclude must be Finn's father. Meanwhile, the Lich uses his malevolent magic to begin melting the Citadel and turning its prisoners to his will. Finn's father, Martin (voiced by Stephen Root), is eventually freed by the Lich's actions, and as the Citadel guardians battle the escaping prisoners he, Finn, and Jake try to escape. One of the Citadel guardians, however, uses its laser and melts away part of Martin's flesh on his leg. Finn retrieves some guardian blood, which repairs and heals Martin.
