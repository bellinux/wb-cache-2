5|$|During the Boshin War of 1868-69, the Nanbu clan {{fought on}} the site of the Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei, {{supporting}} the Tokugawa regime. After Meiji restoration, the Nanbu clan <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its land confiscated, and in 1871, the heads of its branches were relieved of office. In the Meiji period, the former daimyō became part of the kazoku peerage, with Nanbu Toshiyuki receiving the title of hakushaku (Count). The main Nanbu line survives to the present day; Toshiaki Nanbu served as the chief priest of Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E
5|$|In 59BC, when he {{was four}} years old, his father died. His mother married a former {{governor}} of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56BC. Philippus never <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E
5|$|The CCF was {{a socialist}} party, which <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its {{strength}} in Saskatchewan, though it ran candidates {{in several other}} provinces. At Parliament's dissolution in April 1957, it had 23 MPs, from five different provinces. Aside from the Liberals and the Tories, {{it was the only}} party to nominate a candidate in a majority of the ridings. In 1957, the party was led by Saskatchewan MP M.J. Coldwell.|$|E

5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the time. If Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|With {{this broad}} {{coalition}} of supporters, Gaius held his office {{for two years}} and <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his prepared legislation passed. This included winning an unconstitutional, although not necessarily illegal, re-election to the one year office of Tribune. However Gaius's plans to extend rights to non-Roman Italians were eventually vetoed by another Tribune. A substantial proportion of the Roman poor, protective of their privileged Roman citizenship, turned against Gaius. With Gaius's support from the people weakened, the consul Lucius Opimius was able to crush the Gracchan movement by force. A mob was raised to assassinate Gaius. Knowing his death was imminent he committed suicide on the Aventine hill in 121 BC. All of his reforms were undermined except for the grain laws. Three thousand supporters were subsequently arrested and put to death in the proscriptions that followed.|$|E
5|$|Ōkami {{was shown}} at the 2005 E3 Convention, {{approximately}} 30% complete, with a planned release in 2006. At this point, the game <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the core gameplay, including the Celestial Brush and the combat system in place. The game was released a year later, with its release in Japan on April 20, 2006, North Amercia on September 19, 2006, in Europe on February 9, 2007,, and in Australia on February 14, 2017. However, {{just a few weeks}} following its release in North America to strong critical reception, Capcom announced the closure of Clover Studio.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary of the virtual police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the odds}} against him, the Batavian captain engaged Stag, Yorke laying his ship {{alongside}} Alliantie and the frigates exchanging broadsides for {{an hour before the}} Batavian captain, his situation hopeless and his ship outnumbered and battered, surrendered at 17:15. While Stag and Alliantie fought their duel, the action continued elsewhere, with the remaining Batavian ships making progress eastwards along the Norwegian coastline with the British squadron attempting to cut them off from the channel between Eigerøya and the Norwegian mainland in which the Batavian ships could shelter, protected by Danish neutrality. Vlugheid rapidly outdistanced pursuit, but Argo was slower and came under heavy but distant fire from Reunion and Isis, replying in kind. Argo was subsequently found to have been hit thirty times by 24-pounder shot and <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its sails and rigging torn away, requiring extensive repairs. Eventually the Batavian persistence paid off, and Vlugheid and Argo successfully escaped into the neutral harbour of Eigerøya before Alms could intercept them.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rain and}} winds buffeted many parishes located {{east of the}} city of New Orleans. A small radius {{near the center of the}} storm <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been {{disastrous}} if it were widespread. Grand Isle and portions of the lower Plaquemines Parish were the worst hit in Louisiana. Additionally, Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a storm surge of 5.2 feet (1.6 m). At New Orleans International Airport, sustained winds of 28 mph (45 km/h) and gusts of 33 mph (53 km/h) were reported on July 19. A gauge reported a water level of 4.85 feet (1.5 m) in Venice. Storm tides were 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 meters) above normal on average. A Coast Guard helicopter had to evacuate 7 Texans who were on a yacht in the Gulf of Mexico forty miles offshore, since their radio was broken and they were therefore unaware they were sailing into the storm. After being rescued, they were treated for minor injuries at a suburban New Orleans hospital.|$|E

25|$|Anaerobic digesters were {{originally}} designed for operation using sewage sludge and manures. Sewage and manure are not, however, the material {{with the most}} potential for anaerobic digestion, as the biodegradable material has already <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the energy content taken out by the animals that produced it. Therefore, many digesters operate with codigestion {{of two or more}} types of feedstock. For example, in a farm-based digester that uses dairy manure as the primary feedstock, the gas production may be significantly increased by adding a second feedstock, e.g., grass and corn (typical on-farm feedstock), or various organic byproducts, such as slaughterhouse waste, fats, oils and grease from restaurants, organic household waste, etc. (typical off-site feedstock).|$|E

25|$|The Canadian weather {{proved to}} be uncooperative, Fontaine was ill {{for a period of}} time, and at one point Wilder {{underwent}} minor surgery. As a result, the film ran over schedule and budget, and Wilder ran into problems during post-production. It was his first color film, and he was dissatisfied with the way the exteriors had been photographed in Technicolor. He <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the flora native to the area hand-painted to give it a more authentic look. Although principal photography was completed in September 1946, it wasn't until April 30, 1948 that the film premiered in London. It opened in Los Angeles on May 26, at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 17, and went into wide theatrical release in the United States on July 2.|$|E
25|$|Shugo Tokumaru {{was born}} and raised in Tokyo. His first {{instrument}} was the piano, which he started between 5–6 years old after seeing a friend playing it. Much later on in junior high school, Tokumaru started playing the electric guitar, originally only playing songs by The Clash. He joined a band called Gellers, made up of people he had known throughout his childhood. The band formed around 1994 and at the very beginning, Tokumaru was not a member. He started writing songs at 17 for the band, however had not <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a need to earlier, as the other guitarist of the band was the chief songwriter. At this point, Tokumaru developed an interest with multi-instrumentalization, thinking that just the guitar/bass/drum set of a standard band wasn't enough.|$|E
25|$|The tornado reached EF3 {{strength}} {{just past}} the Liberty Expressway as it impacted a one-story brick home, removing the roof and collapsing several exterior walls, snapping or uprooting almost all surrounding mature trees, and tossing a vehicle in the area. A few other homes in this area also sustained significant structural damage. It then quickly weakened back to EF2 intensity as it completely destroyed the canopy of a service station, snapped large trees, tore the entire roof off of a restaurant, and severely damaged a large Procter & Gamble plant in Albany. Multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, and concrete light poles were snapped. Several semi-trailers were tossed and piled atop each other, and multiple other large metal industrial buildings sustained heavy damage in this area as well. A house also <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its roof ripped off.|$|E

25|$|Twin Otters {{could be}} {{delivered}} {{directly from the}} factory with floats, skis, or tricycle landing gear fittings, making them adaptable bush planes for remote and northern areas. Areas including Canada and the United States, (specifically Alaska) <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the demand. Many Twin Otters still serve in the far north, {{but they can also}} be found in Africa, Australia, Asia, Antarctica, and other regions where bush planes are the optimum means of travel. Their versatility and maneuverability have made them popular in areas with difficult flying environments such as Papua New Guinea. In Norway, the Twin Otter {{paved the way for the}} network of short-field airports, connecting rural areas with larger towns. The Twin Otter showed outstanding reliability, and remained in service until 2000 on certain routes. Widerøe of Norway was, at one time, the world's largest operator of Twin Otters. During one period of its tenure in Norway, the Twin Otter fleet achieved over 96,000 cycles (take-off, flight, and landing) per year.|$|E
25|$|After an {{international}} break which saw Sebastian Giovinco further cement {{his place in}} Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's plans for Euro 2012 the following summer, Parma travelled to Champions League side Napoli, who had beaten giants Internazionale in their previous game by three goals to nil. Napoli <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the ball in the}} early stages, but failed {{to make the most of}} their control of the ball, while Parma looked dangerous on the counter. This pattern continued into the second half before a Massimo Gobbi goal give Parma an unexpected lead just before an hour had passed. The left-back surged forward through Napoli's pedestrian midfield and laid the ball off to Sergio Floccari, who flicked the ball back into Gobbi's path, allowing Gobbi to slot home from point blank range. Napoli continued to press and eventually found an equaliser in a similar fashion to Parma's opener, Ezequiel Lavezzi supplying the backheel flick and playing the one-two with substitute Giuseppe Mascara. The sides were level for five minutes before Parma once again proved to have the more clinical instinct in front of goal. Francesco Valiani worked the ball out wide to Giovinco, who found Francesco Modesto sliding in at the back post to give Parma a 2–1 in the 82nd minute to momentarily put Parma seventh.|$|E
25|$|By 3:26p.m. EST (20:26UTC), {{the large}} and {{destructive}} tornado continued through southeastern portions of Albany, prompting a Tornado Emergency for Dougherty County. It re-attained EF3 as it caused significant damage to multiple structures in Albany. A well-constructed cement block church with hurricane straps and rebar reinforcement, {{as well as a}} well-constructed frame home, both had their exterior walls collapsed; damage at these locations was consistent with winds of approximately 150mph (240km/h), marking the tornado's peak strength. EF2 damage was inflicted to a small residence farther northeast, where large sections of the roof was ripped off. Near the intersection of N County Line Road and Harris Road, the wedge tornado once again regained EF3 intensity as it moved through several mobile home parks, destroying numerous manufactured houses; associated debris was tossed approximately 35yd (32m) downwind, and four fatalities were observed. A well-anchored triple-wide mobile home was completely swept away in this area, and a cinder block business was almost entirely flattened. A small church was leveled as well. In Worth County, north of Jewell Crowe Road, several homes sustained significant damage and many large trees were twisted and snapped. A large, well-built brick home sustained low-end EF3 damage in damage in this area as it <b>had</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> its roof ripped off and sustained some failure of exterior walls.|$|E
