50|$|A menstrual cup {{is a type}} of <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product</b> {{which is}} made of {{flexible}} medical grade silicone, worn inside the vagina during menstruation to catch menstrual fluid (blood containing uterine lining).

Once a month menstrual cups should be sterilized, usually by boiling in water.|$|E

50|$|A tampon tax {{refers to}} a {{condition}} in sales tax law under which tampons—and other <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> used to absorb menstrual flow—are not tax exempt like some other medical necessities. Proponents argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, and comparable products form basic, unavoidable necessities for women and thus should be made tax exempt. The tax in Canada was removed in mid-2015 and women protested in the United Kingdom later that year. Other countries later followed suit.The BBC estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use tampons or other <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>products</b> to absorb menstrual flow for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed {{at the same rate as}} non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products.

5000|$|A tampon is {{a mass of}} {{absorbent}} material, primarily used as a <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product.</b> Historically, {{the word}} [...] "tampon" [...] originated from the medieval French word [...] "tampion", meaning a piece of cloth to stop a hole, a stamp, plug, or stopper.

However, using tampons may be difficult or impossible for those with untreated vaginismus or an untreated imperforate hymen. Several countries regulate tampons as medical devices. In the United States, they are considered to be a Class II medical device by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are sometimes used for hemostasis in surgery.|$|E

50|$|After the Eagles let him go, he {{returned}} to his home town as head coach of the New York Jets, who had just fired Pete Carroll after one losing season (6-10). Owner Leon Hess named Kotite general manager as well. But under his leadership, the Jets suffered what are still the two worst seasons in franchise history. Kotite won only four games in two seasons, falling to 3-13 in 1995 and 1-15 in 1996 for the worst record in the league both years. Poorly handled drafts contributed to the disappointing seasons, most notably Kotite's first round selection of tight end Kyle Brady over the heavily favored Warren Sapp in 1995. The losing seasons and inept drafts led to mockery; Jets fans started calling him Rich Kotex, a crude reference to a popular <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product.</b> Two days before the last game of the 1996 season, Kotite announced he was stepping down as head coach and has not coached in the NFL again in any capacity.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Lysol {{disinfectant}} began being marketed by maker Lysol, Incorporated and distributor Lehn & Fink, Inc. as a <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product.</b> It was claimed vaginal douching with a diluted Lysol solution prevented infections and vaginal odor, and thereby preserved youth and marital bliss. This Lysol solution {{was also used}} as a birth control agent, as post-coital douching was a popular method of preventing pregnancy at that time. The use of Lysol was later discouraged by the medical community as it tended to eliminate the bacteria normal to the healthy vagina, thus allowing more robust, health-threatening bacteria to thrive, and may have masked more serious problems that certain odors indicated in the first place. All the same, Joseph De Lee, a prominent American obstetrician who held great sway over American obstetric practice through his writings, encouraged the use of Lysol during labor. He writes in 1938, [...] "...Just before introducing the hand, the vagina is liberally flushed with 1 per cent lysol solution squeezed from pledgets of cotton, the idea being {{to reduce the amount}} of infectious matter unavoidably carried into the puerperal wounds and up into the uterus by the manipulations." ...|$|E
40|$|Kenaf {{has been}} {{discovered}} for its potential in different kinds of industrials such as paper making, manufacturing materials, sanitary products and tissues. Kenaf {{is known as the}} most economical crop. The present exist of <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product</b> are produced by high cost chemicals. This may cause to increase the price. Lots of women in the developing countries still do not have enough supply of cheap <b>feminine</b> <b>hygiene</b> <b>product</b> and this force them use unhygienic materials such as rags, barks and even mud. So there is a need in invention and manufacturing of low cost sanitary product. This research is to analyse the best method for the production of low cost feminine hygiene from kenaf by using suitable mechanical and chemical method. Application of acidic, alkaline and hypochlorite treatment in the pulping process will increase the quality of fluff pulp without affect its basic fibre properties. The raw material of kenaf is supply by National Kenaf and Tobacco Board, Kuantan Branch. Mechanical separation was done to remove the outer bast fiber of kenaf manually. In this study, Sodium Sulphite, Glacial Acetic acid and sodium hypochlorite was used in the production of pulp as it is low cost and suitable for treating core fibres. All the samples were sent for FESEM and SEM scanning to investigate the morphological condition of the pores of the fibres for the sample. Absorbency test was carried out for each sample. The absorbency of each sample includes untreated and treated samples are higher than 1. 00 g of ink/g of ink/g of sample as shown in table 1. Samples treated with 20 % Glacier Acidic acid show lowest absorbency with 1. 08 g of ink/g of sample. Samples treated with 1 g of sodium sulphite showed quite high absorbency at 1. 836 g of ink/g of sample. The treated sodium sulphite kenaf core pores are porous and there is increasing in the absorbency characteristics. Furthermore, EDS FESEM analysis shown elementary composition contains inside samples without any sulphur remained in sodium sulphite treated sampl...|$|E
