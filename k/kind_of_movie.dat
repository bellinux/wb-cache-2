500|$|Sternberg concludes: [...] "This thought-provoking thriller is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> {{that keeps}} reverberating in the viewer's mind, and each {{iteration}} makes one examine preconceived notions {{in a different}} light. Memento is a movie for anyone interested in the workings of memory and, indeed, in {{what it is that}} makes our own reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Spielberg {{also wanted}} to create a film that sympathized with a crook. He explained, [...] "Frank was a 21st century genius working within the innocence of the mid '60s, when people were more trusting than they are now. I don't think this is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> where {{somebody}} could say, 'I have a career plan.|$|E

500|$|The Village Voice {{gave the}} film a mixed review, saying that [...] "Contemporary Japanese pop culture makes the hophead {{nonsense}} of House look quaint by comparison... though it plays like a retarded hybrid of Rocky Horror and Whispering Corridors, it is, moment to moment, its own <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> hijinks." [...] The Boston Globe gave the film two stars out of four, opining that films by Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson had attempted similar styled films with better success.|$|E
500|$|The film's soundtrack {{and score}} were {{composed}} by Ilaiyaraaja, this being his 100th film. It {{was also the}} first film in which he collaborated with Mahendra; Ilaiyaraaja would later compose for all of Mahendra's films until Thalaimuraigal (2013), the director's last film before his death in February 2014. Mahendra recalled in 2007, [...] "When I first met [...] I explained him what my <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> is and what I expect from him. The background score should allow meaningful silences in my films. I believe silence conveys more than words or music".|$|E
500|$|... "it [...] was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> I {{would have}} gone to see when I was a kid" [...] further {{clarifying}} [...] " [...] I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of ‘Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this?’ and ‘It’s lowbrow.’ It’s a movie. People go to movies on Saturday {{to get away from the}} war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and just go and have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun.” ...|$|E
50|$|Sombabu (Ali), {{the only}} son of well-to-do farmers, is a pampered {{guy and a}} wastrel. His laziness is {{the talk of the}} town; though, as is usual with this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies,</b> the village folk are equally eloquent about his good nature.|$|R
25|$|Hollywood {{has been}} hitting two {{extremes}} – either a Biblical de Mille spectacular or a Baby Doll. Britain does two other <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> {{as well as}} anyone – a certain type of high comedy and a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> semi-documentary. I believe we (the British film industry) should hit these hard.|$|R
2500|$|Film critic Pauline Kael credits Mankiewicz {{with having}} written, {{alone or with}} others, [...] "about forty of the films I {{remember}} best from the twenties and thirties[...] [...] [...] he was a key linking figure in just the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> my friends and I loved best." ...|$|R
500|$|Initial {{mainstream}} critical {{response to}} But I'm a Cheerleader was mostly negative. Rotten Tomatoes {{gave it a}} score of 34% based on 47 reviews, and Metacritic gave it a score of 39% based on 30 reviews. The overall theme of reviews {{is that it is}} a heartfelt film with good intentions, but that it is flawed. Some reviewers found it funny and enjoyable with [...] "genuine laughs", however. Roger Ebert rated it three stars (of four) and wrote, it [...] "is not a great, breakout comedy, but more the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> that might eventually become a regular on the midnight cult circuit." [...] Others found it obvious, leaden, and heavy handed.|$|E
500|$|Larry Cohen {{continued}} to twist genre conventions in pictures such as Q (aka Q: The Winged Serpent; 1982), described by critic Chris Petit as [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> {{that used to}} be indispensable to the market: an imaginative, popular, low-budget picture that makes the most of its limited resources, and in which people get on with the job instead of standing around talking about it." [...] In 1981, New Line put out Polyester, a John Waters movie with a small budget and an old-school exploitation gimmick: Odorama. That October The Book of the Dead, a gore-filled yet stylish horror movie made for less than $400,000, debuted in Detroit. Its writer, director, and co-executive producer, Sam Raimi, was a week shy of his twenty-second birthday; star and co-executive producer Bruce Campbell was twenty-three. It was picked up for distribution by New Line, retitled The Evil Dead, and became a hit. In the words of one newspaper critic, it was a [...] "shoestring tour de force." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{enjoyed the}} film, noting its homages {{to the film}} serials of the 1930s–1950s. Although Ebert cited the visual effects as being state of the art, he {{described}} them [...] "as charmingly direct as those rockets in the Flash Gordon serials—the ones with sparklers hidden inside of them, which were pulled on wires in front of papier-mâché mountains." [...] Leonard Maltin wrote that the [...] "film captures {{the look of the}} '30s, as well as the gee-whiz innocence of Saturday matinée serials, but it's talky and takes too much time to get where it's going. Dalton has fun as a villain patterned after Errol Flynn." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine also gave a positive review. [...] "The Rocketeer is more than one of the best films of the summer; it's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> magic that we don't see much anymore", he continued, [...] "the kind that charms us, rather than bullying us, into suspending disbelief." ...|$|E

In some countries, most notably in Eastern Europe, Vietnam and Cambodia, {{it is commonly used}} to translate all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the film}} has been negative. Indiaglitz and IBN Live both panned the film, with the former stating that [...] "In the age of stiff competition and speedy generation the snail pace films with lackluster approach is seen in Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Only Rama and Krishna should save this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> in the box office." ...|$|R
50|$|Coming to {{the story}} Rajeev Mohan takes the lead role as Sreenu, who is {{basically}} frightened college student. Like other such <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies,</b> everyone in the college tease and starts hitting Sreenu but other heroine Disha Pandey who plays role of second heroine Nisha loves Sreenu. But Sreenu doesn’t like her much. In the mean time Moksha our lead heroine Meera Jasmine comes into picture.|$|R
500|$|Conran and Avnet {{were able}} to cut costs {{considerably}} by shooting the entire movie in 26 days (not the usual {{three to four months}} that this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> normally takes) on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900 and working entirely on three different blue screen soundstages in London, England with one notable exception. Conran wrote a scene that was added later in which Polly talks to her editor in his office that was shot on a physical set because {{there was no time to}} shoot it on a blue screen soundstage. The footage from the HD camera was run through a switcher and then through a Macintosh computer running Final Cut Pro that allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. Conran said, [...] "I don't know how we would have made this movie. It's really what allowed us to line up everything, given there was nothing there." [...] After each day of shooting, footage was edited and sent overnight to editors in L.A. who added CG and sent it back.|$|E
500|$|Deadpool {{held its}} world premiere at the Grand Rex in Paris on February 8, 2016, before {{beginning}} its release in Hong Kong the next day. This {{was followed by}} 49 other markets {{over the next few}} days, including North America on February 12. It was released in several formats, including IMAX, DLP, premium large formats and D-Box. Kinberg explained that unlike the previous X-Men films, Deadpool is [...] "a hard R. It’s graphic. Nothing is taboo. You either commit to a truly outrageous boundary-pushing <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> or you don’t." [...] The film was denied a China release due to this, and though R-rated American films are often [...] "cleaned-up" [...] for release in the country, it was decided that [...] "it wasn't possible to excise the offending material without causing plot problems." [...] It was also not released in Uzbekistan, after the theater owners in the country decided against showing the film because [...] "it has an age restriction and is not in line with ethical norms in our society." [...] Deadpool received seven [...] "general cuts" [...] to get approval for release in India.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{felt that}} the story and {{dialogue}} were weak, while the visuals were spectacular. Kenneth Turan's review in the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, [...] "What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> is within his abilities. Not only is it not, {{it is not even}} close.", and later claimed that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total. Barbara Shulgasser of The San Francisco Examiner gave Titanic one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, [...] "The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [...] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say." [...] Also, filmmaker Robert Altman called it [...] "the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life". In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the Titanic, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, [...] "Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered".|$|E
2500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} of Alone in the Dark, Boll {{explains how}} he funds his films: [...] "Maybe {{you know it}} but it's {{not so easy to}} finance movies in total. And the reason I am able to do these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> is I have a tax shelter fund in Germany, and if you invest in a movie in Germany you get basically fifty percent back from the government." ...|$|R
50|$|In general, {{the films}} {{presented}} are comedy, adventure and action. At one point session had all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies,</b> {{but with the}} emergence of classifications indicating the session has lost much of its heritage as it can not display them on time. The classic <b>movies</b> <b>of</b> the Afternoon Session are various, such as The Blue Lagoon, Home Alone, La misma luna, Matilda, Edward Scissorhands, Police Academy, Barbie as Rapunzel, Dirty Dancing, and Ghost, among many others.|$|R
50|$|Back at {{the precinct}} Mike {{addresses}} his fellow inspectors. He tells them that {{to catch the}} killer they must look at and obey the formula that most cop movies go by {{even though it is}} a British movie and there won't be any car chases. Barry points out that the partner usually dies in these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> but Mike says he is thinking more {{along the lines of the}} Lethal Weapon films.|$|R
500|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars and called it [...] "a {{wonderful}} film." [...] The Hollywood Reporter lauded the film as [...] "Winsome, touching and arguably the funniest Pixar effort ever, this gorgeously rendered, high-flying adventure is a tidy 90-minute distillation of all the signature touches that came before it." [...] Although the San Francisco Chronicle noted that the film [...] "contains many boring stretches of mindless freneticism and bland character interaction," [...] it also declared that there are scenes in Up of [...] "such beauty, economy and poetic wisdom that they belong in any anthology of great movie moments...to watch Up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout ..." [...] Variety enthused that [...] "Up is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume...Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances...exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michel Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative..." [...] The Globe and Mail stated that Up is [...] "the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> that leaves you asking 'How do people {{come up with this}} stuff?'" [...] along with an overall positive review on the film, despite it being predictable.|$|E
500|$|Production for {{the film}} began in February 2006, with a budget of $20–25 million. Principal {{photography}} {{for the film}} was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew [...] "had to rush" [...] to meet the February 16 deadline. The film was directed by Nickelodeon's Rugrats co-creator and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gábor Csupó, who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it [...] "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó stated that {{he was interested in}} making the film because he [...] "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he [...] "didn't like anything until I read this book". He described the book as [...] "beautiful" [...] and said that it [...] "moved [...] ". Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman's final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; [...] "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> I want to do at this time in my life".|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This is the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie</b> we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him to start making films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies {{were going to be}} big religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I know right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movie,</b> but I could be totally wrong about that. I don't know." ...|$|E

But this is Murphy's movie. Donkey gets most of the good lines, and Murphy hits every one." [...] Jay Carr of The Boston Globe wrote [...] "In an era when much on film seems old, Shrek seems new and fresh and clever." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "Despite all its high-tech weirdness, it is really that most perdurable of human constructions, a tale told well and true." [...] Joe Baltake of The Sacramento Bee wrote that it [...] "isn't so much a fractured spoof of everything Disney, but actually a Monty Python flick for kids – kids of all ages". Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote [...] "What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies." [...] Lisa Alspector of the Chicago Reader wrote [...] "This romantic fantasy complicates the roles of beauty and beast, making it hard to guess what form a sensitive resolution will take." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal wrote [...] "The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults." ...|$|E

500|$|Film {{director}} Tim Burton—who {{had directed}} the 1989 Batman film—felt Nolan [...] "captured the real spirit that these <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> {{are supposed to}} have nowadays. When I did Batman twenty years ago, in 1988 or something, it was a different time in comic book movies. You couldn't go into that dark side of comics yet.

[...] "The movies tend to be serious and depressing, and audiences don't like that, so making Oscar-y movies is a riskier strategy than the average moviegoer might appreciate." [...] As for the payoff a movie gets when it receives nominations, [...] "audiences don't like the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>movies</b> that get Oscars, but they do like the Oscars," [...] he said. It was the economic bonus from getting nominations or winning that made the losses of not doing so worth it.|$|R
