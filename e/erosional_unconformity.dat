40|$|The {{sedimentary}} {{architecture of}} polar gravel-beach ridges is presented {{and it is}} shown that ridge internal geometries reflect past wave-climate conditions. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data obtained along the coasts of Potter Peninsula (King George Island) show that beach ridges unconformably overlie the prograding strand plain. Development of individual ridges is seen to result from multiple storms in periods of increased stormwave impact on the coast. Strand-plain progradation, by contrast, {{is the result of}} swash sedimentation at the beach-face under persistent calm conditions. The sedimentary architecture of beach ridges in sheltered parts of the coast is characterized by seaward-dipping prograding beds, being the result of swash deposition under stormy conditions, or aggrading beds formed by wave overtopping. By contrast, ridges exposed to high-energy waves are composed of seaward- as well as landward-dipping strata, bundled by numerous <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities.</b> These <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities</b> are the result of sediment starvation or partial reworking of ridge material during exceptional strong storms. The number of individual ridges which are preserved from a given time interval varies along the coast depending on the morphodynamic setting: sheltered coasts are characterized by numerous small ridges, whereas fewer but larger ridges develop on exposed beaches. The frequency of ridge building ranges from decades in the low-energy settings up to 1600 years under high-energy conditions. Beach ridges in the study area cluster at 9. 5, 7. 5, 5. 5, and below 3. 5 m above the present-day storm beach. Based on radiocarbon data, this is interpreted to reflect distinct periods of increased storminess and/or shortened annual sea-ice coverage {{in the area of the}} South Shetland Islands for the times around 4. 3, c. 3. 1, 1. 9 ka cal BP, and after 0. 65 ka cal BP. Ages further indicate that even ridges at higher elevations can be subject to later reactivation and reworking. A careful investigation of the stratigraphic architecture is therefore essential prior to sampling for dating purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Rift basins provide {{important}} sedimentary archives to reconstruct past tectonic and climatic conditions. Understanding their sedimentary history is, however, largely {{hampered by the}} competing influence of tectonic versus climatic forcing. The {{aim of this study}} is to comprehend the effects of local to regional tectonic and global climatic/eustatic changes on shallow marine depositional systems in the Sardinia Rift (Western Mediterranean Sea). For this purpose the stratigraphic and depositional relations of a mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp at the Porto Torres Basin margin were studied along extensive proximal to distal transects. Three depositional sequences (DS 1 to DS 3) of late Burdigalian to early Serravallian age have been identified, which are separated by <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities.</b> Each contains a lower trans- gressive part and an upper regressive part. The former includes shoreface sandstone (DS 2) or coral reef (DS 3) deposits on the proximal ramp and channelized sheet sandstone (DS 1) or basinal mudstone (DS 2, DS 3) deposits on the distal ramp, typically recording an upsection trend of sediment starvation. The latter is represented by basinward-prograding coralline red algal carbonate wedges due to enhanced shallow water carbonate production rates. In the long term, the depositional evolution from DS 1 to DS 3 reveals basin margin progradation associated with decreasing siliciclastic supply. Integrated calcareous nannoplankton-foraminiferal-pectinid biostratigraphy links the depositional sequences to third-order sea-level cycles and allows to correlate the <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities</b> at the top of DS 1 and DS 2 with the Bur 5 /Lan 1 and Lan 2 /Ser 1 sequence boundaries. The improved sequence stratigraphic framework enables better regional and global correlations. This shows that rhodalgal carbonate slopes started prograding in the western branch of the Sardinia Rift during the late Burdigalian because (1) of a worldwide bloom of rhodalgal facies, and (2) decreasing tectonic activity at the transition from the syn- rift to the post-rift stage caused a continuous reduction of the siliciclastic sediment input...|$|R
5000|$|Muddy Sandstone Member—This {{member of}} the Thermopolis Shale was first briefly {{described}} by Darton in 1904, and much more completely by Hintze in 1914. Hintze {{described it as a}} widespread almost white sandstone member, 25 to 40 ft thick, with small, uniform, poorly cemented grains. Hintze called this member the [...] "Muddy sand", after the terminology used by oil and gas drillers in Wyoming. It remained informally known as the [...] "Muddy sand" [...] into the 1960s, despite widespread acknowledgement among geologists that it was significant and widely occurring and worthy of a formal name. By 1972, the member had received the formal name [...] "Muddy Sandstone Member". The Muddy Sandstone began to be laid down during a period when water levels in the Western Interior Seaway dropped, and this deposition continued once sea levels rose again. An <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformity</b> occurred while the sea receded, over which estuarine and fluvial deposits were laid down as the Muddy Sandstone. Thus, in some areas contact with the overlying Muddy Sandstone is sharp and unconformable, while in others it is conformable and gradational. Deposition of the Muddy Sandstone continued around the foreland basin's margins, while the Upper Thermopolis Member was laid down conformably above the Muddy Sandstone in the basin's interior. The Muddy Sandstone consists of a number of thin beds of fine-grained, silty sandstone of buff, brownish-grey, or grey color. It is shaly, contains carbon flecks and pyrite crystals, and when weathered is either buff or grey. Some beds exhibit ripple marks. The sandstone is interbedded with thin beds of shale, siltstone, and (occasionally) bentonite. Lupton estimated the Muddy Sandstone's thickness at 10 to 55 ft in thickness, although Porter et al. have pointed out that it varies widely in thickness from place to place. David Seeland and Early Brauch have concluded that is because pre-Laramide geologic structures or topography probably governed the distribution of Muddy Sandstone deposits. The Muddy Sandstone Member is geologically equivalent to the Birdhead Sandstone.|$|E

More recently, on 16 May 2012, Mount Sharp was officially named Aeolis Mons by the USGS and IAU. [...] The mound extends higher than {{the rim of the}} crater, so perhaps the layering covered an area much larger than the crater. These layers are a complex record of the past. The rock layers probably took millions of years to be laid down within the crater, then more time to be eroded to make them visible. [...] The 5 km high mound is probably the thickest single succession of sedimentary rocks on Mars. [...] The lower formation may date from near the Noachian age, while the upper layer, separated by an <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformity,</b> may be as young as the Amazonian period. The lower formation may have formed the same time as parts of Sinus Meridiani and Mawrth Vallis. The upper layer may be similar to layers in Arabia Terra.

These cores span multiple glacial-interglacial {{cycles and}} are anticipated {{to provide the}} longest independently-dated record of hydroclimate, glacier variability, and paleomagnetic variation for the tropical Andes. To aid in accurate interpretation of the drill core stratigraphy, we investigated spatial variations in sediment composition by collecting 9 cores (1 - 9 m length) from Lake Junín across a paleoglacier proximal-distal (NE-SW) transect. Each core extends into glacigenic sediments, indicating recovery of the complete postglacial sequence (past ~ 22. 5 ka). Most cores exhibit a four-component stratigraphy: a lower unit of gray glacial flour and minerogenic material sourced from glacial outwash fans to the NE, a lower-middle unit of organic-rich sediments with abundant grass, an upper-middle unit of transitional organic to carbonate sediments, and an upper unit of non-glacial sediments composed primarily of beige marl. We interpret these facies changes to reflect major changes in depositional environment and hydrologic conditions. Spatial variations in the age, thickness, and transition character among these units reflect the complex stratigraphy of a lake with such shallow water depth and high sensitivity to regional changes in hydrologic balance. Additionally, we identified at least four <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities</b> in the shallow-water cores to the NE, indicating substantial changes in lake level. These unconformities were radiocarbon dated to provide “benchmarks” constraining past lake level.

The mounds in the Magellan Province were studied by means of high-resolution 2 D and industrial 3 D seismic data. The 3 D data set consisted of the upper 400 ms TWT of a 830 km 2 industrial data block, provided by Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Ltd., and its partners, Conoco (U. K.) Ltd., Enterprise Energy Ireland Ltd. and Dana Petroleum plc. Time structure maps of key reflections and horizon slices were further processed in a GIS-system using mathematical morphology and geostatistical toolsThe resulting images revealed 305 mounds (> 30 m) within an area of 350 km 2. They all are rooted on the same reflection. Smaller buildups {{can be seen in the}} seismic profiles too, but were excluded from the statistical analyses. The mounds are significantly elongated in a N/S direction, and are associated with moat structures containing the same - even stronger- elongation. A N/S directed current influence seems to have played an important role in the mound history. The location and spatial pattern of the mounds however, is different. Investigations showed that mound positions are not linked to any fault information present in the shallow 3 D data block. A possible relationship with the depth contours of key horizons or <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities,</b> or with the morphology of an underlying enigmatic slope failure seems more promising. According to spatial trend analysis, the mounds are larger on the western edge of the province, while the burying sediment packages are thicker towards the (S) E. Sedimentation rates hence seem to have influenced the mound growth and vitality as well. From the 2 and 3 D seismic analysis of the Magellan Mound Province, one learns that the mounds started to grow at 1 confined moment in time and space. Their positioning does not seem to be influenced by shallow faults, but rather by the location of <b>erosional</b> <b>unconformities</b> and a deeper lying slope failure. Currents and sedimentation patterns on their turn clearly played a role in the mound development...|$|R
