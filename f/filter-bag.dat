50|$|A {{central vacuum}} {{typically}} produces greater suction than common portable vacuum cleaners because a larger fan {{and more powerful}} motor can be used {{when they are not}} required to be portable. A cyclonic separation system, if used, does not lose suction as the collection container fills up, until the container is nearly full. This is in marked contrast to <b>filter-bag</b> designs, which start losing suction immediately as pores in the filter become clogged by accumulated dirt and dust.|$|E

These minerals are poorly soluble salts at neutral and alkaline pH {{and they can be}} recovered by alkaline precipitation (Mekmene et al. 2012). However, the exact nature of these precipitates is not well known. These isolated precipitates can be used as Ca enrichment or for their functional properties (anti-caking agent, stabilizing agent…) in food products. The present work has been undertaken in order to study the influence of different parameters on calcium phosphate precipitation (pH, alkalizing agent, temperature). The final aim was to show if the nature and structure of recovered calcium phosphate from acidified milk ultrafiltrate (pH 4. 6 obtained with lactic acid) were dependent on the physicochemical parameters. The calcium phosphate precipitates were obtained by alkalization at pH 7, 8 or 9 and at 4 or 50 °C and with four different alkalizing agents authorized as additive by codex alimentarius (NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH) 2, MgO). Materials and methods : Preparation of milk ultrafiltrate: Raw skimmed milk (Entremont Alliance, Montauban de Bretagne, France) was acidified at 4 °C by lactic acid (90 %) under stirring in 45 minutes in order to solubilize completely Ca and Pi from caseins. Then the follow up of the pH under stirring were conducted during 2 hours. This acidified skimmed milk (ASM) was kept at 4 °C in cold room during one night. Then, ASM was heated at 25 °C under stirring during 30 minutes, the curd thus formed was separated from the serum on a <b>filter-bag.</b> The liquid was ultrafiltrated at 25 °C using pilot (TAMI/Tech Sep) equipped with 6. 65 * 2 m 2 of membrane (molecular weight cut-off = 8 kDa) (Tami Industries, Nyons, France). The ultrafiltrate was recovered and stored at 4 °C in sterile bottles before the alkalization. It contained 1200 and 480 mg of Ca and inorganic phosphate (Pi) respectively. Precipitation of milk derived calcium phosphates (MDCP) : The calcium phosphate precipitations from ultrafiltrates (800 mL) were performed in a FC 6 s flocculator from Velp Scientifica by adding alkalizing reagents (MgO, Ca(OH) 2, NaOH and KOH, 2 M). The addition was carried out under continuous stirring at 90 rpm and at 4 or 50 °C. The increased pH values were recorded using a Multi pH Meter Cinac (Alliance Instruments, Frepillon, France). After two hours of precipitation, about 200 mL of the suspensions were filtered (Whatman 42 filters papers). The different MDCP precipitates were recovered on the filter and dried in an oven at 30 °C for 4 - 6 days. The different solids were stored in flasks in a desiccator provided with drying agent (silica gel with hygroscopic indicator) before physico-chemical characterization. The filtrates were centrifuged to 1800 g for 30 min at 20 °C using vivaspin TM for mineral analyses. Physico-chemical analyses of MDCP precipitates : Ionic concentration : Anions contents were measured in ultrafiltrate and filtrates by ionic chromatography (Dionex ICS 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Villebon sur Yvette, France). Cations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Varian, 220 FS spectrometer, Les Ulis, France). Granulometric and zeta potential analysis : The particles analyses were carried out with a Master sizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK) to determine the size distributions by laser light scattering. The zeta potentials of the particles were measured by using a Zetasizer 3000 HS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). FTIR and XRD analysis of solids : The FTIR spectra were obtained using a FTIR Bruker Vertex 70 spectrometer (400 - 4000 cm- 1 spectral range) using the KBr pellet technique (1 mg of sample in 300 mg of KBr). The XRD patterns were recorded using a diffractometer Bruker D 8 Advance equipped with a K 780 generator and a 1 -D Si detector (LynxEye) ...|$|E
