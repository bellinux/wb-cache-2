5000|$|The {{nature of}} art is a motif in the novel and is often {{explored}} at great length. Proust sets forth a theory of art {{in which we are}} all capable of producing art, if by this we mean taking the experiences of life and transforming {{them in a way that}} shows understanding and maturity. Writing, painting, and music are also discussed at <b>great</b> length. <b>Morel</b> the violinist is examined to give an example of a certain type of [...] "artistic" [...] character, along with other fictional artists like the novelist Bergotte, the composer Vinteuil, and the painter Elstir.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing {{public outcry}} over the atrocities in the CFS moved the British {{government}} {{to launch an}} official investigation. In 1903, Morel and those who agreed {{with him in the}} House of Commons succeeded in passing a resolution calling on the British government to conduct an inquiry into alleged violations of the Berlin Agreement. Roger Casement, then the British Consul at Boma (at the mouth of the Congo River), was sent to the Congo Free State to investigate. Reporting back to the Foreign Office in 1900, Casement wrote"The root of the evil {{lies in the fact that}} the government of the Congo is above all a commercial trust, that everything else is orientated towards commercial gain..." [...] The Congo Reform Association (CRA) was established in <b>Great</b> Britain by <b>Morel</b> as a direct result of Casementâ€™s 1904 detailed, eyewitness Congo report, known as the Casement Report. The Congo Reform movement's members included Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, Booker T. Washington, and Bertrand Russell.|$|R
