40|$|Many governments {{throughout}} the world rely heavily on traffic law enforcement programs to modify driver behaviour and enhance road safety. There are two related functions of traffic law enforcement, apprehension and deterrence, and these are achieved through three processes: the establishment of traffic laws, the policing of those laws, {{and the application of}} penalties and sanctions to offenders. Traffic policing programs can vary by visibility (overt or covert) and deployment methods (scheduled and non-scheduled), while sanctions can serve to constrain, deter or reform offending behaviour. This chapter will review the effectiveness of traffic law enforcement strategies {{from the perspective of a}} range of <b>high-risk,</b> illegal <b>driving</b> behaviours including drink/drug driving, speeding, seat belt use and red light running. Additionally, this chapter discusses how traffic police are increasingly using technology to enforce traffic laws and thus reduce crashes. The chapter concludes that effective traffic policing involves a range of both overt and covert operations and includes a mix of automatic and more traditional manual enforcement methods. It is important to increase both the perceived and actual risk of detection by ensuring that traffic law enforcement operations are sufficiently intensive, unpredictable in nature and conducted as widely as possible across the road network. A key means of maintaining the unpredictability of operations is through the random deployment of enforcement and/or the random checking of drivers. The impact of traffic enforcement is also heightened when it is supported by public education campaigns. In the future, technological improvements will allow the use of more innovative enforcement strategies. Finally, further research is needed to continue the development of traffic policing approaches and address emerging road safety issues...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In 2013, 2, 163 {{teens in}} the United States ages 16 – 19 {{were killed and}} 243, 243 were treated in {{emergency}} departments for injuries from motor vehicle crashes. distracted driving (i. e. texting, loud music, or phone conversations) and impaired driving (driving under the influence) {{play a role in}} these motor vehicle crashes. Prevention efforts aimed at <b>high-risk</b> teenager <b>driving</b> behavior may encourage safe driving habits. Methods: The Teen D. R. I. V. E. program is a mobile driving simulator that provides teenagers with distracted and impaired driving scenarios. We administered anonymous surveys from April 2015 -April 2016 to obtain demographic data and evaluate the program’s impact on their driving behavior. We retrospectively analyzed survey responses using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Results: A total of 1374 participants in the survey, however, 50 did not respond to the driving experience portion of the survey. Most participants (70 %) were between 16 - 17 years of age years old and 51 % were males. A majority (76 %) of respondents had driving experience (26 % permit, and 46 % license) or had attended a driver’s education course (67 %). After experiencing the simulation respondents felt that the consequences of driving distracted (53 %) and driving impaired (61 %) were worse than previously expected. In addition, participants said that they would never drive distracted (70 %) or drive impaired (90 %). A majority of participants (72 %) feel that simulation is {{the most effective way to}} teach driving related topics. Conclusion: Teen D. R. I. V. E. offers a valuable experience to teenagers, teaching them about the dangers of driving distracted and impaired. Participants are likely to never drive impaired compared or distracted. Most teenagers feel simulation teaches these driving lessons most effectively...|$|R
40|$|A recent {{national}} investigation of Indigenous road safety in Australia conducted by CARRS-Q and ARRB Transport Ltd identified unlicensed driving {{as a major}} social and road safety problem facing this <b>high-risk</b> population. Unlicensed <b>driving</b> offences greatly contribute to Indigenous Australians being over-represented in incarceration figures by fifteen-fold. The national review highlighted a need {{to better understand the}} factors contributing to unlicensed driving among this population in order to develop and implement more effective licensing regimes and countermeasures. This paper discusses the methodology used in the “problem identification” phase of a larger four-year collaborative project aiming to increase Indigenous licensing and retention rates by improving all aspects of the licensing process – from entry into the system to offender management. The multi-faceted research design involves: (i) focus groups in 13 Queensland Indigenous communities to identify perceptions of the current licensing system and sanctions, unmet licensing needs and cultural, attitudinal and access barriers [community perspective]; (ii) semi-structured interviews with 50 Indigenous licensing offenders to examine factors contributing to higher incarceration rates [offender perspective]; and (iii) interagency focus groups to identify priority directions and establish roles to address unmet licensing needs [government perspective]. The paper stresses the importance of using appropriate research protocols when working with Indigenous communities and provides advice for researchers and policy-makers faced with this challenge. While not the focus of the paper, there is some discussion of the preliminary findings of the "problem identification" phase of the research and how these results will inform the continuation of the research as it moves toward intervention development and evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Problem: To {{determine}} {{patterns of}} risk among teenage drivers. Method: Review and {{synthesis of the}} literature. Results: On most measures, crash rates during the teenage years are higher {{than at any other}} age, for both males and females. Risk among teenagers varies greatly by driving situation; it is particularly low in some situations (e. g., the learner period) and particularly high in others (e. g., right after licensure, late at night, with passengers present). In some of these <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> situations, risk is elevated for drivers of all ages (e. g., late night driving), in others risk is elevated more for teens than adults (e. g., driving after consuming alcohol), and in others the risk is unique to teen drivers (e. g., having passengers).

40|$|Objectives We {{examined}} {{road safety}} policies and trends in road traffic injuries (RTIs) in Japan between 1970 and 2008 from the viewpoints of population and high-risk-individual approaches {{to see what}} lessons {{can be learned from}} the example of a country that experienced a decline in RTIs following comprehensive road safety policies. Methods We reviewed research papers and policy documents, obtained from relevant ministries, decade by decade. We obtained data on RTIs from police and from vital statistics. Results Japan started the Fundamental Traffic Safety Program to combat the increase in RTIs, and succeeded in reducing both RTI mortality and morbidity rates in the 1970 s by implementing vast road safety improvements, using population approaches with a particular focus on protecting the most vulnerable population groups at that time. However, RTIs increased again in the 1980 s because of increasing traffic volume. In the 1990 s and 2000 s, safety policies targeted at <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> behaviors succeeded in reducing RTI mortality rates but failed to change morbidity rates. Conclusions To achieve a safer road environment, more emphasis is required on population approaches that reduce risk among the whole population, with a balance between population and high-risk-individual approaches.

This study was conducted with the aim to determine frequency of high school adolescents ’ high-risk behaviors. This is a descriptive study conducted on 510 public high school students using multi-stage random sampling method. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and a researcher-made questionnaire of “high school adolescents ’ high-risk behaviors”. Descriptive statistics were used to describe data, and t-test to analyze them. Study results showed that 19. 4 % of adolescents always drove dangerously, 18. 8 % always had aggressive behaviors, 19. 4 % often used drugs, 17. 1 % always drank alcohol, and 15. 1 % always had high-risk sexual behaviors, 12. 5 % always had suicidal ideations and 14. 7 % always had improper nutrition.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to identify, {{in a large}} Italian sample of young, novice drivers, {{specific}} subtypes of drivers {{on the basis of}} combinations of self-reported personality traits (i. e., driving anger, anxiety, angry hostility, excitement-seeking, altruism, normlessness and driving locus of control) and to evaluate their <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> behaviors {{not only in terms of}} traffic rule violations and risk-taking behaviors, but also in terms of driving errors and lapses as measured by the Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire. Participants were 1008 high school students between the ages of 18 and 23 years, with valid driver's licenses. On the basis of a cluster analysis of the personality variables, three easily interpretable driver subgroups were identified (risky drivers, worried drivers and careful drivers) that differed on self-reported accident involvement, attitudes toward traffic safety and risk perception, as well as on driving violations, errors, and lapses. The inclusion of internal and external driving locus of control, variables not previously considered in similar cluster studies, provided a relevant contribution to the final cluster solution. Further, the use of the Driving Behavior Questionnaire permitted the differentiation between deliberate deviations from safe driving practices and mistakes due to misjudgments or lapses in attention. This distinction was critical for understanding the behavior of each of the three identified subgroups of drivers, and for planning interventions to promote safe driving. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} reported driving patterns of older emergency department (ED) drivers and the factors that might lead them to enroll in a safe driving program. Methods: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of ED patients 65 -years-old and up regarding their driving patterns, behaviors and willingness to enroll in a safe driving program. Results: We surveyed 138 patients. Most (73 %) reported driving within the last year, and 88 % of these believe they could not manage without driving. Eleven percent of ED older drivers have been in a motor vehicle crash (MVC) in the past year (95 % CI 6 - 20 %), compared to 2. 5 % of all seniors. Our survey findings suggest that 88 % of older ED drivers avoid at least some <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> situations and 65 % are unwilling to enroll in a safe driver program unless it lowers their automobile insurance rates. At the same time, most older ED drivers underestimate their risk of being involved in (75 %) or dying from (74 %) a MVC. Conclusion: Overall, there are a significant number of older people for whom driving remains a vital yet risky daily function. Most of these drivers have little interest in information regarding safe driving programs while in the ED. Those willing to learn about such programs would prefer to take home the information regarding the program rather than have any staff member discuss it while in the ED.

40|$|For decades {{there have}} been two young driver concepts: the ‘young driver problem’ where the driver cohort {{represents}} a key problem for road safety; and the ‘problem young driver’ where a sub-sample of drivers represents the greatest road safety problem. Given difficulties associated with identifying and then modifying the behaviour of the latter group, broad countermeasures such as graduated driver licensing (GDL) have generally been relied upon to address the young driver problem. GDL evaluations reveal general road safety benefits for young drivers, yet they continue to be overrepresented in fatality and injury statistics. Therefore it is timely for researchers to revisit the ‘problem young driver’ concept to assess its potential countermeasure implications. This is particularly relevant within the context of broader countermeasures that have been designed to address the ‘young driver problem’. Personal characteristics, behaviours and attitudes of 378 Queensland novice drivers aged 17 - 25 years were explored during their pre-, Learner and Provisional 1 (intermediate) licence {{as part of a larger}} longitudinal project. Self-reported risky driving was measured by the Behaviour of Young Novice Drivers Scale (BYNDS), and five subscale scores were used to cluster the drivers into three groups (high risk n= 49, medium risk n= 163, low risk n= 166). High risk ‘problem young drivers’ were characterised by greater self-reported pre-Licence driving, unsupervised Learner driving, and speeding, driving errors, risky driving exposure, crash involvement, and offence detection during the Provisional period. Medium risk drivers were also characterised by more risky road use than the low risk group. Interestingly problem young drivers appear to have some insight into their <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving,</b> since they report significantly greater intentions to bend road rules in future driving. The results suggest that tailored intervention efforts may need to target problem young drivers within the context of broad countermeasures such as GDL which address the young driver problem in general. Experiences such as crash-involvement could be used to identify these drivers as a preintervention screening measure...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Motor vehicle crashes are a huge {{public health}} problem. Identifying area {{characteristics}} (or {{aspects of the}} physical and social environment) and how these area characteristics are associated with driving behaviors and driving outcomes may provide insights into possible prevention strategies. Methods: Quantitative methods were used to analyze survey data collected from Michigan young adults and state driver records. Area-level data {{were obtained from the}} Michigan Geographic Data Library road network, Michigan Liquor Control Commission, and U. S. Census Bureau. Area characteristics were conceptualized and operationalized for each study by creating a circular buffer (with a 12. 1 mile radius) around each respondent’s geocoded residence to estimate each individual’s area exposure. The first study examined whether roadway characteristics were associated with individual driving behaviors and the likelihood of a crash (casualty or non-casualty). Results: Roadway characteristics were not associated with driving behaviors for either men or women. There was no direct relationship between roadway characteristics and the likelihood of crash. For men, but not for women, the results suggested that the association between the likelihood of casualty crash involvement and <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> was higher with rural roads than urban roads, OR = 1. 42, 95 % CI [1. 08, 1. 86]. The second study examined whether area characteristics (alcohol establishment density and proportion of rural population) were associated with drinking behaviors and alcohol-related crashes. Results: There was an inverse relationship between alcohol establishment density and drinking behaviors, which was stronger in women than in men. The results indicated that higher density of alcohol establishments decreased the likelihood of men being involved in an alcohol-related crash OR = 0. 014 [95 % CI: < 0. 001, 0. 576]. The last study examined the potential role of social influences (i. e., social approval for drink/driving) in explaining the relationship between area characteristics and participant perceptions of drink/driving as dangerous. Results: For both men and women there was a positive relationship between alcohol establishment density and perceptions of drink/driving as dangerous. Social approval for drink/driving was a potential mediator for women, but not for men.

40|$|Road safety policies, {{strategies}} and action plans, along with trends in road traffic injuries (RTIs) in the oil-rich Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) countries were examined to appraise their road safety {{work with an}} overall objective of identifying key measures and initiatives that would reduce RTA and their resulting consequences in these countries. Data on RTIs was obtained from police and from vital statistics and was analyzed. Research papers, policy documents, and strategies, obtained from relevant stakeholders in the six GCC countries, were reviewed and discussed. Traffic Safety Programs and action plans, which were the most fundamental documents {{in the development of}} the GCC countries’ road safety policies and strategies, were reviewed. Policy documents on road safety and traffic related issues were searched on the websites of related authorities. Published research on road safety in GCC countries was searched using available databases. Analysis of accident data shows that the fatality rates in all the GCC countries are much higher than developed countries with good safety records. The six administrations started the fundamental traffic safety programs to combat the increase in RTIs, with some succeeding in reducing RTI rates by implementing vast road safety improvements. However, RTIs increased again mainly because of increasing traffic volume and <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> behavior. Developing and implementing national road safety strategies in some GCC countries was successful in reducing the RTI rates. The road safety situation in the six GCC countries was assessed showing high crash and fatality rates compared to developed countries. Most GCC countries still suffer from sustainable increase in traffic crashes despite the efforts to reduce their magnitude and severity. Some of these countries have developed and implemented national road safety strategies, while countries like Oman still need to develop such a long-term strategy. Following the review of the current progress in road safety initiatives developed or implemented, it is apparent that there is still considerable room for improvement.

40|$|In an Australian context, {{the term}} hooning refers to risky driving {{behaviours}} such as illegal street racing and speed trials, {{as well as}} behaviours that involve unnecessary noise and smoke, which include burn outs, donuts, fish tails, drifting and other skids. Hooning receives considerable negative media attention in Australia, and since the 1990 s all Australian jurisdictions have implemented vehicle impoundment programs {{to deal with the}} problem. However, there is limited objective evidence of the road safety risk associated with hooning behaviours. Attempts to estimate the risk associated with hooning are limited by official data collection and storage practices, and the willingness of drivers to admit to their illegal behaviour {{in the event of a}} crash. International evidence suggests that illegal street racing is associated with only a small proportion of fatal crashes; however, hooning in an Australian context encompasses a broader group of driving behaviours than illegal street racing alone, and it is possible that the road safety risks will differ with these behaviours. There is evidence from North American jurisdictions that vehicle impoundment programs are effective for managing drink driving offenders, and drivers who continue to drive while disqualified or suspended both during and post-impoundment. However, these programs used impoundment periods of 30 – 180 days (depending on the number of previous offences). In Queensland the penalty for a first hooning offence is 48 hours, while the vehicle can be impounded for up to 3 months for a second offence, or permanently for a third or subsequent offence within three years. Thus, it remains unclear whether similar effects will be seen for hooning offenders in Australia, as no evaluations of vehicle impoundment programs for hooning have been published. To address these research needs, this program of research consisted of three complementary studies designed to: (1) investigate the road safety implications of hooning behaviours in terms of the risks associated with the specific behaviours, and the drivers who engage in these behaviours; and (2) assess the effectiveness of current approaches to dealing with the problem; in order to (3) inform policy and practice in the area of hooning behaviour. Study 1 involved qualitative (N = 22) and quantitative (N = 290) research with drivers who admitted engaging in hooning behaviours on Queensland roads. Study 2 involved a systematic profile of a large sample of drivers (N = 834) detected and punished for a hooning offence in Queensland, and a comparison of their driving and crash histories with a randomly sampled group of Queensland drivers with the same gender and age distribution. Study 3 examined the post-impoundment driving behaviour of hooning offenders (N = 610) to examine the effects of vehicle impoundment on driving behaviour. The theoretical framework used to guide the research incorporated expanded deterrence theory, social learning theory, and driver thrill-seeking perspectives. This framework was used to explore factors contributing to hooning behaviours, and interpret the results of the aspects of the research designed to explore the effectiveness of vehicle impoundment as a countermeasure for hooning. Variables from each of the perspectives were related to hooning measures, highlighting the complexity of the behaviour. This research found that the road safety risk of hooning behaviours appears low, as only a small proportion of the hooning offences in Study 2 resulted in a crash. However, Study 1 found that hooning-related crashes are less likely to be reported than general crashes, particularly when they do not involve an injury, and that higher frequencies of hooning behaviours are associated with hooning-related crash involvement. Further, approximately one fifth of drivers in Study 1 reported being involved in a hooning-related crash in the previous three years, which is comparable to general crash involvement among the general population of drivers in Queensland. Given that hooning-related crashes represented only a sub-set of crash involvement for this sample, this suggests that there are risks associated with hooning behaviour that are not apparent in official data sources. Further, the main evidence of risk associated with the behaviour appears to relate to the hooning driver, as Study 2 found that these drivers are likely to engage in other risky driving behaviours (particularly speeding and driving vehicles with defects or illegal modifications), and have significantly more traffic infringements, licence sanctions and crashes than drivers of a similar (i. e., young) age. Self-report data from the Study 1 samples indicated that Queensland’s vehicle impoundment and forfeiture laws are perceived as severe, and that many drivers have reduced their hooning behaviour to avoid detection. However, it appears that it is more common for drivers to have simply changed the location of their hooning behaviour to avoid detection. When the post-impoundment driving behaviour of the sample of hooning offenders was compared to their pre-impoundment behaviour to examine the effectiveness of vehicle impoundment in Study 3, it was found that there was a small but significant reduction in hooning offences, and also for other traffic infringements generally. As Study 3 was observational, it was not possible to control for extraneous variables, and is, therefore, possible that some of this reduction was due to other factors, such as a reduction in driving exposure, the effects of changes to Queensland’s Graduated Driver Licensing scheme that were implemented during the study period and affected many drivers in the offender sample due to their age, or the extension of vehicle impoundment to other types of offences in Queensland during the post-impoundment period. However, there was a protective effect observed, in that hooning offenders did not show the increase in traffic infringements in the post period that occurred within the comparison sample. This suggests that there may be some effect of vehicle impoundment on the driving behaviour of hooning offenders, and that this effect is not limited to their hooning driving behaviour. To be more confident in these results, it is necessary to measure driving exposure during the post periods to control for issues such as offenders being denied access to vehicles. While it was not the primary aim of this program of research to compare the utility of different theoretical perspectives, the findings of the research have a number of theoretical implications. For example, it was found that only some of the deterrence variables were related to hooning behaviours, and sometimes in the opposite direction to predictions. Further, social learning theory variables had stronger associations with hooning. These results suggest that a purely legal approach to understanding hooning behaviours, and designing and implementing countermeasures designed to reduce these behaviours, are unlikely to be successful. This research also had implications for policy and practice, and a number of recommendations were made throughout the thesis to improve the quality of relevant data collection practices. Some of these changes have already occurred since the expansion of the application of vehicle impoundment programs to other offences in Queensland. It was also recommended that the operational and resource costs of these laws should be compared to the road safety benefits in ongoing evaluations of effectiveness to ensure that finite traffic policing resources are allocated in a way that produces maximum road safety benefits. However, as the evidence of risk associated with the hooning driver is more compelling than that associated with hooning behaviour, it was argued that the hooning driver may represent the better target for intervention. Suggestions for future research include ongoing evaluations of the effectiveness of vehicle impoundment programs for hooning and other <b>high-risk</b> <b>driving</b> behaviours, and the exploration of additional potential targets for intervention to reduce hooning behaviour. As the body of knowledge regarding the factors contributing to hooning increases, along with the identification of potential barriers to the effectiveness of current countermeasures, recommendations for changes in policy and practice for hooning behaviours can be made...|$|E
