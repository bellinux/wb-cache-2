40|$|A {{number of}} {{technical}} challenges have often hindered the economical application of refrigeration cycles using water (R 718) as refrigerant. The novel concept of condensing wave rotor provides {{a solution for}} performance improvement of R 718 refrigeration cycles. The wave rotor implementation can increase efficiency and reduce size and cost of R 718 units. The condensing wave rotor employs pressurized water to pressurize, <b>desuperheat,</b> and condense the refrigerant vapor- all in one dynamic process. In this study, the underlying phenomena of flash evaporation, shock wave compression, desuperheating, and condensation inside the wave rotor channels are described in a wave and phase-change diagram. A computer program based on a thermodynamic model is generated to evaluate the performance of R 718 baseline and wave-rotor enhanced cycles. The detailed thermodynamic approach for the baseline and the modified cycle is described. A generated performance map summarizes the findings. I...|$|E
40|$|Steam {{condensation}} {{plays an}} essential role in supplying and removing heat in many industrial applications, including the energy sector. It therefore is a phenomena of significance that requires deep understanding. This thesis presents effective vacuum steam condensation on the shell-side of vertical shell and tube condenser (VSTC) accompanying steam <b>desuperheating.</b> It describes a fundamental study of heat transfer in VSTC with considerations of several factors; explicitly degree of superheat related with each vacuum steam pressure, temperature waviness in <b>desuperheating</b> section, and steam condensation in absence of non-condensable gas (NCG). Experiments performed on the VSTC are: Steam <b>desuperheating</b> and condensation in the shell-side VSTC at a variety of vacuum steam pressures and respective steam flowrates, vacuum steam <b>desuperheating</b> and condensation in the shell-side of VSTC at reduced steam flowrates, and vacuum steam <b>desuperheating</b> and condensation at tube wall temperatures up to steam saturation temperature (T₂ ≥ Tsat) to analyse dry heat transfer in the <b>desuperheating</b> section. To examine the stated aim, test facility was built in the laboratory of the University of Waikato. By generating <b>desuperheating</b> and condensation models for each test pressure, this investigation proves that vacuum steam condensation best occurs without involvement of superheat. About 60 % of the VSTC occupied with <b>desuperheating,</b> and the heat transfer involved in <b>desuperheating</b> is minor approximately 1 kW, whereas, the condensation section of VSTC has heat transfer about 10 kW. By reducing the steam flowrate, 10 % reduction in the <b>desuperheating</b> section and 20 % to 50 % reduction in the Reynolds number was observed. After raising the tube wall temperature up to the steam saturation temperature, a smooth temperature profile across the <b>desuperheating</b> the section was seen with significant sensible heat transfer. Obstruction linked with superheated steam condensation in the dairy industrial leads to poor heat transfer area utilization by the <b>desuperheating</b> section and therefore, reduction of the evaporator rating or oversizing of the heat exchangers to attain appropriate duty...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{modeling}} of condensers always assumes three zones: <b>desuperheating,</b> condensation and subcooling even condensation occurs in <b>desuperheating</b> zone at some conditions and that subcooling occurs during condensation. This paper discusses the actual situation and provides experimental {{validation of the}} hypothesis. The experimental results show heat transfer coefficients of CO 2 and R 410 A at mass fluxes 100 to 240 kg m- 2 s- 1 and reduced pressures from 68 % to 100 % in a horizontal smooth tube of 6. 1 mm inner diameter. Data are compared to correlations proposed for other working fluids or other conditions. Results show much higher values of HTC than correlation proposed for single-phase turbulent flow in superheated zone. The occurrence of condensation in superheat zone is evident when tube wall temperature is below saturation temperature. The results suggest that simplified calculations of heat rejection in superheated zone significantly oversize the condenser. The semiempirical correlation, which is here proposed as the combination of existing correlations for single-phase turbulent and saturated condensation, satisfactorily predicts the heat transfer coefficient of the superheat zone condensation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} of superheated vapor in {{condenser heat exchanger}} is common in many applications, as heat pump or organic Rankine cycle. Rarely taken into consideration {{in the literature of}} plate heat exchangers, the present article focuses on the influence of the superheated vapor on the condensation characteristics of an organic fluid (pentane) in a brazed plate heat exchanger (BPHE). A specific experimental approach has been developed for this objective. The tested BPHE prototype consists of 2 channels with chevron angle of 55 degrees, and a hydraulic diameter equal to 4. 4 mm. The effect of the pentane mass flux, 9 - 30 kg m(- 2) s(- 1), and the vapor superheat, 5 - 25 K, at a mean constant saturation temperature of 36. 5 degrees C (1. 029 bars), on the global and local thermo-hydraulic characteristics has been identified. An infrared (IR) metrology is used to distinguish the different fluid state distributions, which are representative of various heat transfers along the BPHE. The IR thermography shows a significant impact of the vapor superheat, on the fluid distribution at the channel inlet depending on the mass flux. Comparing the results with vapor superheat going from 5 to 25 K, we note: 1 /an increase of the heat transfer coefficient reaching 70 % for the lowest mass flux; 2 /an increase of the pressure drop, whose rate (18 %) is equivalent to the increase of the heat transfer coefficient for the larger mass fluxes. Superheated vapor is therefore very favorable to heat transfer for condensation in the gravity mode compared to the convective one. Based on experimental measurements and observations, various vapor <b>desuperheating</b> scenarios are tested. The analysis justifies that the suitable <b>desuperheating</b> scenario involves condensation from superheated vapor directly from the channel inlet with liquid vaporization from the condensate film.

The paper describes the investigations of this R 718 refrigerating cycle. The limitations of the R 718 centrifugal compressor stage pressure ratio are discussed, and possibilities for introduction of two-phase ejectors in the R 718 refrigerating systems with direct evaporation and condensation are analyzed.

40|$|Traditionally, {{condensation}} {{is characterized}} by three zones: <b>desuperheating,</b> condensation and subcooling. It was shown that condensation starts even {{in the presence of}} superheated vapor, when the wall temperature reaches saturation. Heat transfer effects of that process were described earlier but not pressure drop that was found to indicate the presence of condensate, the same as shown by heat transfer results. Pressure drop in condensers has traditionally been modeled separately for single-phase and two-phase regions. When plotted as a function of enthalpy, the correlations show a discontinuity between the single-phase and two-phase zones because the models typically assume thermodynamic equilibrium during condensation. This assumption indicates that the first drop of condensate would form when the bulk refrigerant enthalpy reached the saturated vapor enthalpy. The zone beginning when the wall temperature reaches the saturation temperature and ending when the bulk enthalpy reaches saturated vapor is classified as the condensing superheated zone. In this condensing superheated zone, the interaction between the condensate film and vapor increases the pressure drop compared to vapor alone. This paper presents experimental results for pressure drop in that zone of the condenser for R 32, R 134 a and R 1234 ze(E). The pressure drop was found to be higher than predicted by single-phase correlations such as Colburn (1933) ...|$|R

The model was intended for a liquid-to-liquid heat pump, with reciprocating compressor, thermostatic expansion valve and counter-flow double-tube condenser and evaporator. The compressor is characterized (input data) by its swept volume, shaft speed and isentropic and volumetric efficiencies curves, and the expansion device, by the evaporator superheat. The condenser {{is divided into three}} zones, <b>desuperheating,</b> condensing and subcooling. Likewise, the evaporator is divided into the boiling and superheating zones.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model for prediction {{of the amount}} of refrigerant in condenser and evaporator of a 5 kW capacity heat pump is developed. Condenser and evaporator of the experimental test rig are SWEP Brazed Plate Heat Exchangers (BPHE). Plate heat exchangers are widely used in refrigeration and heat pump applications today. However, the mechanisms of boiling and condensation in BPHE represent a difficult issue, for which only few models are developed and presented in published literature. The model presented in this article is developed using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software program (Alvarado, Klein). Input values for the calculations are the inlet/outlet temperature, mass flow rate and pressure readings taken on the test facility. For modelling, evaporator is conventionally divided in two parts: boiling part and superheating part, for which heat transfer calculations are performed in order to find the respective heat transfer areas. For the boiling part of evaporator, void fraction is predicted and mass of liquid and vapour in the whole evaporator is calculated. Condenser is divided in <b>desuperheating,</b> condensing and subcooling parts and heat transfer calculations are performed in order to define heat transfer areas for each of them. In the condensing part, a film thickness based on the Nusselt theory is assumed and, afterwards, total mass of liquid and vapour in the whole condenser is calculated. The obtained results are compared to the measured amount of refrigerant in evaporator and condenser and interpreted. QC 20120228 </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the passage}} of the {{refrigerant}} through the condenser of a refrigerator, it generally undergoes the processes of <b>desuperheating,</b> condensation and sub-cooling. One of the important criteria in condenser design is to locate the points where superheated refrigerant vapour changes to saturated vapour and subsequently from wet vapour to saturated liquid. The present paper discusses the analysis of wire-and-tube condenser under normal operating conditions of free convection using FEM where Galerkin’s weighted residual method is used to minimise the errors. Refrigerant R- 134 a is considered for the study and the condenser components are divided into several elements where the state of refrigerant is predicted. The effects of ambient temperature and mass flow rates of the refrigerant are also determined. This is used to find out the length of tube required for phase change for its initiation and completion. The methodology adopted is validated against the simulation data available in the literature for both sensible and latent heat transfer. The analysis also leads to the information about the adequacy of the number of tubes for complete condensation of the refrigerant vapour under given operating conditions. It is found that for a certain mass flow rate of refrigerant, sub-cooling does not occur at some higher ambient temperatures, thus showing the inefficiencies of the heat exchanger. The methodology {{can be used as a}} design tool for the design of wire-and-tube condenser of a small refrigerator. The derating of condenser under abnormal ambient conditions can also be predicted...|$|R
40|$|Tube-tube heat {{exchanger}} (TTHE) {{is a low}} cost, vented double wall {{heat exchanger}} which increases reliability by avoiding mixing of fluids exchanging heat. It can be potentially used for heat recovery from engine cooling circuit, oil cooling, <b>desuperheating</b> in refrigeration and air conditioning, dairy, and pharmaceutical industry, chemical industry, refinery, etc. These tube-tube heat exchangers are successfully demonstrated for superheat recovery water heating applications, condenser and evaporator in heat pumps, lube oil cooler for shipboard gas turbines, milk chilling and pasteurizing application. This paper presents an experimental study on various layouts of TTHE for water-to-water heat transfer. The theoretical and experimental results on this type of heat exchanger configuration could not be located in literature. Overall heat transfer coefficient and pumping power were experimentally determined for a fixed tube length and surface area of serpentine layouts with different number of bends and results are compared with straight tube TTHE. In the case investigated, serpentine layout TTHE with seven bends has shown optimum performance, with {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} 17 % higher than straight tube TTHE.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} and computer modelling {{studies have been}} made on the refrigerant-water counterflow condenser section of a small air to water heat pump. The main object of the investigation was a comparative study between the computer modelling predictions and the experimental observations {{for a range of}} operating conditions but other characteristics of a counterflow heat exchanger are also discussed. The counterflow condenser consisted of 15 metres of a thermally coupled pair of copper pipes, one containing the R 12 working fluid and the other water flowing in the opposite direction. This condenser was mounted horizontally and folded into 0. 5 metre straight sections. Thermocouples were inserted in both pipes at one metre intervals and transducers for pressure and flow measurement were also included. Data acquisition, storage and analysis was carried out by a micro-computer suitably interfaced with the transducers and thermocouples. Many sets of readings were taken under a variety of conditions, with air temperature ranging from 18 to 26 degrees Celsius, water inlet from 13. 5 to 21. 7 degrees, R 12 inlet temperature from 61. 2 to 81. 7 degrees and water mass flow rate from 6. 7 to 32. 9 grammes per second. A Fortran computer model of the condenser (originally prepared by Carrington[1]) has been modified to match the information available from experimental work. This program uses iterative segmental integration over the <b>desuperheating,</b> mixed phase and subcooled regions for the R 12 working fluid, the water always being in the liquid phase. Methods of estimating the inlet and exit fluid conditions from the available experimental data have been developed for application to the model.
