5|$|Prior to Chief Justice Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> two {{criminal}} casesboth by prerogative writ. First, in United States v. Hamilton (1795), the Court granted bail to {{a capital}} defendant charged with treasonas it was authorized {{to do by}} § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793on an original writ of habeas corpus. The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court, as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793. Second, in United States v. Lawrence (1795), the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy, as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

25|$|Although modern {{headphones}} {{have been}} particularly widely sold and used for listening to stereo recordings since {{the release of the}} Walkman, there is subjective debate regarding the nature of their reproduction of stereo sound. Stereo recordings represent the position of horizontal depth cues (stereo separation) via volume and phase differences of the sound in question between the two channels. When the sounds from two speakers mix, they create the phase difference the brain uses to locate direction. Through most headphones, because the right and left channels do not combine in this manner, the illusion of the phantom center can be perceived as lost. Hard panned sounds will also only be <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> in one ear rather than from one side.|$|E

Although <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> in Washington DC, Ron and Fez chose to remain in New York until June 2003, when they finally relocated to the WJFK studios in Fairfax, Virginia. During the following year, several memorable characters, listeners and staff gave the show a fresh identity. While the WNEW show had been heavily influenced by a dedicated and funny core group of callers, WJFK proved to be fertile ground for eccentric visitors who each brought their own unique humor to the show. Perrynoid, Cherrynoid, Mikeyboy, David Lee Kinison (aka Elfish), Cigar Sid (aka Sidcada) and Crazy Jen became call-in and studio regulars.

25|$|He {{was born}} on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken {{in the area and}} this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been {{familiar}} with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. Literary Latin must have sounded to him like a semi-foreign language, <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> at school. One of the works he probably studied in school was the Odyssia of Livius Andronicus, crammed into Italian boys with threats and floggings by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. School was made particularly irksome by a number of his fellow pupils, the overgrown sons of beefy centurions. The army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.|$|E

500|$|Instrumentation is an {{integral}} part of all facets of Italian folk music. There are several instruments that retain older forms even while newer models have become widespread elsewhere in Europe. Many Italian instruments are tied to certain rituals or occasions, such as the zampogna bagpipe, typically <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> at Christmas. Italian folk instruments can be divided into string, wind and percussion categories. [...] Common instruments include the organetto, an accordion most closely associated with the saltarello; the diatonic button organetto is most common in central Italy, while chromatic accordions prevail in the north. Many municipalities are home to brass bands, which perform with roots revival groups; these ensembles are based around the clarinet, accordion, violin and small drums, adorned with bells.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} break from recording, the band {{returned}} to [...] "Something" [...] on 11 July, when Harrison overdubbed what {{would turn out to be}} a temporary vocal.

The piano can be <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> in the middle eight, specifically during the descending run that follows each pair of [...] "I don't know" [...] vocal lines. Lennon later reprised the piano chords from the discarded coda in his 1970 song [...] "Remember". On 16 July, Harrison recorded a new vocal, with McCartney overdubbing his harmony vocal over the middle eight and Starr adding both a second hi-hat part and a cymbal.|$|E
500|$|The last of {{the first}} group is A Pastoral Symphony (1921). The first three {{movements}} are for orchestra alone; a wordless solo soprano or tenor voice is added in the finale. Despite the title the symphony draws little on the folk-songs beloved of the composer, and the pastoral landscape evoked is not a tranquil English scene, but the French countryside ravaged by war. Some English musicians who had not fought in the First World War misunderstood the work and <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> the slow tempi and quiet tone, failing to notice {{the character of a}} requiem in the music and mistaking the piece for a rustic idyll.

Cid is revealed during the game to be Balthier's father, whose ambitions drove Balthier away; this incident was the result of Cid going to Giruvegan to study more of the nethicite, only to return as a maniacal shell of his former self. During the game, Cid seems to talk to himself multiple times, but it is revealed that he is instead talking to Venat, a renegade Occurian; Occurians have the ability to make themselves seen and <b>heard</b> <b>only</b> by whom they wish. Under Venat's guidance, Cid helped Vayne encourage the war to gain shards of the Sun-Cryst in order to help him create manufacted nethicite.|$|E
