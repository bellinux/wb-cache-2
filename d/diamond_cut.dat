5|$|The luster of {{a diamond}} is {{described}} as 'adamantine', which simply means diamond-like. Reflections on a properly cut diamond's facets are undistorted, due to their flatness. The refractive index of diamond (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is 2.417. Because it is cubic in structure, diamond is also isotropic. Its high dispersion of 0.044 (variation of refractive index across the visible spectrum) manifests in the perceptible fire of cut diamonds. This fire—flashes of prismatic colors seen in transparent stones—is perhaps diamond's most important optical property from a jewelry perspective. The prominence or amount of fire seen in a stone is heavily influenced by the choice of <b>diamond</b> <b>cut</b> and its associated proportions (particularly crown height), although the body color of fancy (i.e., unusual) diamonds may hide their fire to some degree.|$|E

25|$|A <b>diamond</b> <b>cut</b> is a {{style or}} design guide used when shaping a diamond for {{polishing}} {{such as the}} brilliant cut. Cut does not refer to shape (pear, oval), but the symmetry, proportioning and polish of a diamond. The cut of a diamond greatly affects a diamond's brilliance; this means if it is cut poorly, it will be less luminous.|$|E

A Heart cut diamond has romantic symbolism so it is a common gift for Valentine's Day or wedding anniversary. The pear-shaped diamonds look like a drop of water and the shape is suitable for diamond earrings. The most famous shapes are: Princess, Cushion, Heart, Pear, Marquise, Radiant, Asscher cut, Emerald, Oval.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} best use a diamond gemstone's {{material}} properties, {{a number of}} different diamond cuts have been developed. A <b>diamond</b> <b>cut</b> constitutes a more or less symmetrical arrangement of facets, which together modify the shape and appearance of a diamond crystal. Diamond cutters must consider several factors, such as the shape and size of the crystal, when choosing a cut. The practical history of diamond cuts {{can be traced back to}} the Middle Ages, while their theoretical basis was not developed until the turn of the 20th century. Design creation and innovation continue to the present day: new technology—notably laser cutting and computer-aided design—has enabled the development of cuts whose complexity, optical performance, and waste reduction were hitherto unthinkable.|$|E
25|$|In their {{theoretical}} rules, the Cubist architects {{expressed the}} requirement of dynamism, which would surmount the matter and calm contained in it, through a creative idea, so that the result would evoke feelings of dynamism and expressive plasticity in the viewer. This should be achieved by shapes derived from pyramids, cubes and prisms, by arrangements and compositions of oblique surfaces, mainly triangular, sculpted facades in protruding crystal-like units, reminiscent of the so-called <b>diamond</b> <b>cut,</b> or even cavernous that are reminiscent of the late Gothic architecture. In this way, the entire surfaces of the facades including even the gables and dormers are sculpted. The grilles {{as well as other}} architectural ornaments attain a three-dimensional form. Thus, new forms of windows and doors were also created, e. g. hexagonal windows. Czech Cubist architects also designed Cubist furniture.|$|E
500|$|Solid foreign {{crystals}} {{are commonly}} present in diamond. They are mostly minerals, such as olivine, garnets, ruby, and many others.

The brooch was designed to show off Cullinan V and is pavé-set with a border of smaller diamonds. It can be suspended from the VIII brooch and can be used to suspend the VII pendant. It was often worn like this by Mary who left all the brooches to Elizabeth when she died in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the outcome}} of the lawsuit, the insured diamond was valued between US$400,000 and $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $ and $).

However, artistic antiquities produced more than one hundred years prior to the date of importation could be imported into the United States duty-free; that is to say, without having to pay a 20% tax.

In that decision, the court determined that the unset [...] Nassak Diamond was not an artistic antiquity and was suitable for use in manufacture of jewellery. In particular, the court said that the 1930 Nassak Diamond was nothing more than [...] "a large <b>diamond,</b> <b>cut</b> in an ordinary way." [...] As a result, the importer owed an ad valorem tax of 20% of the diamond's value under US Tariff Act of 1922.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Cut" [...] of the [...] "4 Cs" [...] is {{the most}} {{difficult}} part for a consumer to judge when selecting a good diamond. This is because some certificates will not show the important measurements influencing cut (such as the pavilion angle and crown angle) and will not provide a subjective ranking of how good the cut was. The other 3 Cs can be ranked simply by the rating in each category. It requires a trained eye to judge the quality of a <b>diamond</b> <b>cut,</b> and the task is {{complicated by the fact that}} different standards are used in different countries (see proportions of the round brilliant).|$|E
2500|$|When {{designing}} a <b>diamond</b> <b>cut,</b> two primary factors are considered. Foremost is the refractive index (RI) of a diamond, which, at 2.417 (as measured by sodium light, 589.3 nm), is fairly high {{compared with that}} of most other gems. Diamond's RI is responsible for its brilliance—the amount of [...] light reflected back to the viewer. Also important is a diamond's dispersive power—the ability of the material to split white light into its component spectral colors—which is also relatively high, at 0.044 (as measured from the B-G interval). The flashes of spectral colors—known as fire—are a function of this dispersion, but are, like brilliance, only apparent after cutting.|$|E

50|$|The {{quality of}} a <b>diamond's</b> <b>cut</b> is widely {{considered}} {{the most important of}} the four Cs in determining the beauty of a diamond; indeed, it is commonly acknowledged that a well-cut diamond can appear to be of greater carat weight, and have clarity and color appear to be of better grade than they actually are.
