25|$|The goal of DoS L2 (possibly DDoS) {{attack is}} {{to cause a}} {{launching}} of a defense mechanism which blocks the network segment from which the attack originated.

25|$|One of {{the fields}} in an <b>IP</b> <b>header</b> is the “fragment offset” field, {{indicating}} the starting position, or offset, of the data contained in a fragmented packet relative to the data in the original packet. If {{the sum of the}} offset and size of one fragmented packet differs from that of the next fragmented packet, the packets overlap. When this happens, a server vulnerable to teardrop attacks is unable to reassemble the packets - resulting in a denial-of-service condition.|$|E

50|$|Two {{different}} versions of <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> have been defined, IPv4 and IPv6. The IPv6 header uses IPv6 addresses and thus offers a much bigger address space, but is not backwards compatible with IPv4.|$|R
50|$|As {{defined in}} RFC 791, the maximum packet length of an IPv4 packet {{including}} the <b>IP</b> <b>header</b> is 65,535 (216 &minus; 1) bytes, a limitation {{presented by the}} use of a 16-bit wide <b>IP</b> <b>header</b> field that describes the total packet length.|$|E

5000|$|TCP {{provides}} a checksum {{for protecting the}} payload and addressing information from the TCP and <b>IP</b> <b>headers.</b> Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded within the network stack, and eventually get retransmitted using ARQ, either explicitly (such as through triple-ack) or implicitly due to a timeout.|$|R
50|$|IAX {{supports}} trunking, multiplexing channels over {{a single}} link. When trunking, data from multiple sessions are merged {{into a single}} stream of packets between two endpoints, reducing the IP overhead without creating additional latency. This is advantageous in VoIP transmissions, in which <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> use {{a large percentage of}} bandwidth.|$|R
5000|$|UDP has an {{optional}} checksum covering the payload and addressing {{information from the}} UDP and <b>IP</b> <b>headers.</b> Packets with incorrect checksums are discarded by the operating system network stack. The checksum is optional under IPv4, only, because the Data-Link layer checksum may already provide the desired level of error protection.|$|R
50|$|The {{data section}} follows the header. Its {{contents}} are the payload data carried for the application. The {{length of the}} data section is not specified in the TCP segment header.

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (1999). All Rights Reserved. This document describes how to compress multiple <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> and TCP and UDP headers per hop over point to point links. The methods {{can be applied to}} of IPv 6 base and extension headers, IPv 4 headers, TCP and UDP headers, and encapsulated IPv 6 and IPv 4 headers. Headers of typical UDP or TCP packets can be compressed down to 4 - 7 octets including the 2 octet UDP or TCP checksum. This largely removes the negative impact of large <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> and allows efficient use of bandwidth on low and medium speed links. The compression algorithms are specifically designed to work well over links with nontrivial packet-loss rates. Several wireless and modem technologies result in such links...|$|R
50|$|For IPv4 packets, Path MTU Discovery {{works by}} setting the Don't Fragment (DF) flag {{bit in the}} <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> of {{outgoing}} packets. Then, any device along the path whose MTU is smaller than the packet will drop it, and send back an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Fragmentation Needed (Type 3, Code 4) message containing its MTU, allowing the source host to reduce its Path MTU appropriately. The process is repeated until the MTU is small enough to traverse the entire path without fragmentation.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{bandwidth}} constrained {{links in}} wireless networks necessitates {{the use of}} bandwidth saving header compression schemes. In these schemes, a compressor and a decompressor collaborate to encode bulky <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> into streamlined compressed headers. Intuitively, the gain from compression is the average compressed header length divided by the uncompressed header size. In this paper, we show {{that this is not}} true in many situations: this does not account for the cost introduced by the variability of the header sizes during compression context initialization...|$|R

40|$|The MEHARI system {{provides}} a low-cost programmable and scalable {{tool for the}} analysis of IP/ATM traffic. The system runs on one or several PCs, thus allowing increasing the processing capacity as required. The tool can be configured to capture either <b>IP</b> <b>headers</b> or whole <b>IP</b> packets, being possible to concentrate the analysis on specific traffic flows by using VPI/VCI or IP address filters.

40|$|Abstract IP {{networks}} transfer {{huge amounts}} of data and information all over the word. The operator maintains the network and monitors it continuously to detect and eliminate any disturbances as soon as possible. Features and parameters included in the <b>IP</b> packet <b>headers</b> enable the operator to identify lots {{of information about the}} IP traffic and network users. The goal {{of this study is to}} analyze the measurements about the <b>IP</b> packet <b>header</b> information to support the operators in network management and optimiza-tion, trouble shooting, service creation and marketing. In this paper we propose multi-layer clustering that can reveal detailed description of traffic patterns and behaviour profiles of the network addresses. These descriptions can be en-hanced by identifying abnormal traffic and analysing the reasons for such behaviour. Utilizing the measurement information included in the <b>IP</b> packet <b>headers</b> enables all these analysis tasks without violating privacy of the con-sumers...|$|R
