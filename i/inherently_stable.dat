Bone and ivory was desalinated to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a sodium sesquicarbonate solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the chlorides that had penetrated the surface.

Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.|$|E

Just south of Crewe, the train (disputably) achieved a speed of , narrowly beating the previous British record for a steam locomotive (held by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER)). The brakes were applied far too late at such a speed and the result was that the train entered a series of crossover points at Crewe much too fast.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 48 - 50) The {{hypothesis that}} economic diversity promotes economic stability {{has always been}} attractive to planners and economic development officials. However, research has failed to prove that a clear relationship exists. This research tests the hypothesis that diversity promotes stability at the county level across the nine census regions of the United States. The analysis uses county employment data from isolated counties of 5, 000 to 461, 000 population for years 1977 to 1985. An intercept-shift model is used {{to determine if the}} diversity/stability relationship exists. The regression model is also used to determine if individual census regions are <b>inherently</b> more <b>stable</b> and whether certain regions are more stable over time. An Adjusted Minimum Requirements index was used to measure diversity while stability was measured with the Regional Economic Instability index.

2500|$|The B.E.2c {{was a major}} redesign, {{the result}} of {{research}} by E.T. Busk intended to provide an <b>inherently</b> <b>stable</b> aeroplane. This was considered desirable to allow the crew's full attention to be devoted to reconnaissance duties. The first example, a converted B.E.2b, flew on 30 May 1914 and the type went into squadron service just before the outbreak of war. Relatively large orders were placed for the new version, with deliveries of production aircraft starting in December 1914. During 1915 this model replaced the early B.E.2s in the squadrons in France. The B.E.2c used the same fuselage as the B.E.2b, but was otherwise really a new type, being fitted with new wings of different plan form, increased dihedral, and forward stagger, ailerons replacing the wing warping of the earlier models. The tailplane was also completely new, and a triangular fin was fitted to the rudder. On later machines this fin was enlarged, to reduce a tendency to swing on takeoff, and to improve spin recovery.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rational}} {{system of}} aircraft procurement {{was to be}} exemplified by the Military Aircraft Competition held on Salisbury Plain at Larkhill, announced late in 1911. [...] The rules called for two-seater aircraft capable of various speed, climb, endurance and field operation conditions. O'Gorman was on the judging committee, so the B.E.1 {{was not allowed to}} compete; nevertheless it put in regular appearances at the trials, where its performance was clearly superior to most of the competing aircraft. [...] The B.E.1 was followed by the almost identical B.E.2 design, mass-produced with minor changes as the B.E.2a and later developed into the B.E.2c by E. T. Busk. Busk's objective was to create an <b>inherently</b> <b>stable</b> aircraft for military observation purposes. [...] Unfortunately the aircraft's stability resulted in a loss of manoeverability, and when German aircraft fitted with synchronised guns appeared in 1915 the large-scale losses of B.E.2c during the Fokker Scourge of 1915 led to a parliamentry inquiry. [...] Although this did not find O'Gorman at fault it led to O'Gorman's departure from the Factory: his contract, which was to expire in October, was not renewed. [...] O'Gorman, now holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Flying Corps, remained as a consulting engineer to the Director-General of Military Aeronautics from 1916 to 1919.|$|E
