40|$|We {{investigate}} spectral {{behavior of}} phonon spectral functions in an interacting multi-component hot carrier plasma. Dielectric polarization functions are formulated {{so that they}} satisfy Dyson equations of the effective interactions among plasma components. We find a useful sum rule giving simple relation between plasma-species resolved dielectric functions. Spectral analysis of various phonon spectral functions is performed considering carrier-phonon channels of polar and nonpolar optical phonons, acoustic deformation-potential, and piezoelectric Coulomb couplings. Effects of phonon self-energy corrections are examined at finite temperature within a random phase approximation extended to include the effects of dynamic screening, plasmon [...] phonon coupling, and local-field corrections of the plasma species.

40|$|Based on the {{macroscopic}} dielectric continuum model, the interface-optical-propagating (IO-PR) mixing phonon {{modes of}} a quasi-zero-dimensional (Q 0 D) wurtzite cylindrical quantum dot (QD) structure are derived and studied. The analytical phonon states of IO-PR mixing modes are given. It is {{found that there}} are two types of IO-PR mixing phonon modes, i. e. ρ-IO/z-PR mixing modes and the z-IO/ρ-PR mixing modes existing in Q 0 D wurtzite QDs. Each IO-PR mixing mode also has symmetrical and antisymmetrical forms. Via a standard procedure of field quantization, the Fröhlich Hamiltonians of electron-(IO-PR) mixing phonons interaction are obtained. The orthogonal relations of polarization eigenvectors for these IO-PR mixing modes are also displayed. Numerical calculations for a wurtzite GaN cylindrical QD are focused on the quantum size effect on the dispersive properties of IO-PR mixing modes. The results reveal that both the radial-direction size and the axial-direction size have great effect on the dispersive frequencies of the IO-PR mixing phonon modes. The limiting features of dispersive curves of these phonon modes are discussed in depth. The phonon modes "reducing" the behavior of wurtzite quantum confined structures have been explicitly observed in the systems. Moreover, the behaviors that the IO-PR mixing phonon modes <b>in</b> <b>wurtzite</b> Q 0 D QDs reduce to the IO modes and PR modes <b>in</b> <b>wurtzite</b> Q 2 D QW and Q 1 D QWR systems are profoundly analyzed both from the viewpoint of physics and mathematics.

40|$|Abstract. The {{energy levels}} of polaron <b>in</b> a <b>wurtzite</b> InxGa 1 -xN/GaN {{parabolic}} quantum well are investigated by adopting a modified Lee-Low-Pines variational method. The ground state energy, the transition {{energy and the}} contributions of different branches of optical phonon modes to the ground state energy as functions of the well width are given. The effects of the anisotropy of optical phonon modes and the spatial dependence effective mass, dielectric constant, phonon frequency on energy levels are considered in calculation. In order to compare, the corresponding results in zinc-blende parabolic quantum well are given. The {{results indicate that the}} contributions of the electron-optical phonon interaction to ground state energy of polaron in InxGa 1 -xN/GaN is very large, and make the energy of polaron reduces. For a narrower quantum well, the contributions of half-space optical phonon modes is large, while for a wider one, the contributions of the confined optical phonon modes are larger. The ground state energy and the transition energy of polaron <b>in</b> <b>wurtzite</b> InxGa 1 -xN/GaN are smaller than that of zinc-blende InxGa 1 -xN/GaN, and the contributions of the electron-optical phonon interaction to ground state energy of polaron <b>in</b> <b>wurtzite</b> InxGa 1 -xN/GaN are greater than that of zinc-blende InxGa 1 -xN/GaN.
