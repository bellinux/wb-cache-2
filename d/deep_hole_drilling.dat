A finite element analysis of the validation test specimen was performed in order to provide a reference solution for comparison to the <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drill</b> experimental results.

The upper part of the crust is found to support the non steady-state models of crustal accretion developed from seafloor observations (Kappel and Ryan, 1986; Gente, 1987). The continuous and vertical nature of borehole measurements provides stratigraphic and structural data that cannot be obtained solely from seafloor studies and, in turn, these models define a framework to analyze the structural, hydrological, and mineralogical observations made in the hole over the past decade...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} stress measurements at Stripa, compares the results obtained by different techniques, and recommends a stress measurement program for a hard rock repository site. The state of stress at the Stripa Mine has been measured both in a 381 -m-deep <b>hole</b> <b>drilled</b> from the surface and in <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> from the drifts underground. Hydraulic fracturing and several overcoring methods have been used (Lulea triaxial gauge, CSIRO gauge, USBM gauge, Swedish State Power Board deep-hole Leeman triaxial gauge). The results of overcoring and hydraulic fracturing agree well, particularly for the magnitude and orientation of the greatest stress. A recommended program for stress measurement at a repository site would include hydraulic fracturing and deep-hole overcoring in a <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilled</b> from surface, and overcoring (Lulea gauge and USBM gauge) and hydraulic fracturing from <b>holes</b> <b>drilled</b> from underground openings when access is available.

This decline does not only increase year by year, there were over a thousand foggaras in the early 1960 s, but today only 915 foggaras have been listed for all those regions.

Muehlenbachs, 1977, 1980; Hoernes et al., 1978; Friedrichsen and Hoernes, 1980).

50|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> (DHD) is a {{residual}} stress measurement technique {{used to measure}} locked-in and applied stresses in engineering materials and components.

The process is unique {{in its ability to}} measure residual stresses at a microscopic level with a penetration of over 750 mm, without total destruction of the original component. DHD is considered deep in comparison to other hole drilling techniques such as centre hole drilling.|$|E

50|$|The {{pressure}} size of {{the pump}} depends on {{the depth of the}} <b>drilling</b> <b>hole,</b> the resistance of flushing fluid (drilling fluid) through the channel, as well as the nature of the conveying drilling fluid. The <b>deeper</b> the <b>drilling</b> <b>hole</b> and the greater the pipeline resistance, the higher the pressure needed.|$|R
50|$|DHD {{involves}} drilling a {{hole through}} {{the thickness of the}} component, measuring the diameter of the hole, trepanning (cutting a circular slot around the hole) a core of material from around the hole and finally re-measuring the diameter of the hole. For engineering metals, the trepanning process is typically performed using electrical discharge machining (EDM) to minimise the introduction of further stresses during the cutting. The differences between the measured diameters before and after stress release enables the original residual stresses to be calculated using elasticity theory. An animated YouTube video explaining the DHD technique can be viewed here: YouTube: <b>Deep</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>Drilling</b> Technique.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilling</b> is {{generally}} achievable {{with a few}} tooling methods, usually gun drilling or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external). Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common techniques to achieve required straightness tolerances. Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally {{a new kind of}} drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{investigations}} and testing standards normally use standard surface pre-treatments, e. g. ground samples. This {{is in order}} to be able to determine the impact of various elements. The end users of materials therefore generally have access to good data regarding the impact of the alloy composition. The problem is that alloys are almost never used in a ground condition, as the surface condition strongly depends on the production route used. This study addresses this problem. The metal dusting resistance of wrought and spun cast 20 Cr 32 NiFe with different surface states has been investigated. The samples came from commercially available tubes with their standard surface condition; the wrought alloys in a pickled state and the spun cast <b>deep</b> <b>hole</b> <b>drilled.</b> Samples with the original and ground surfaces were exposed for 300 h at 600 °C in a CO/CO 2 /H 2 /H 2 O mixture, P tot= 5. 5 bar (ac: Boudouard/COred/Water-Gas- Shift: 558 / 232 / 379), corresponding to conditions in some furnaces used for the direct reduction of iron ore. The results clearly show that that 20 Cr 32 NiFe is not suitable for high carbon activities. However, the pickled surface was sensitive toward metal dusting attack while the drilled and the ground samples had better resistance. This shows that the surface pre-treatment plays a crucial role. © 2011 by NACE International...|$|R
