50|$|From the IBM Archives http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html:The IBM Card-Programmed Electronic Calculator was {{announced}} in May 1949 as a versatile general purpose computer designed to perform any predetermined sequence of arithmetical operations coded on standard 80-column punched cards. It was also capable of selecting and following one of several sequences of instructions {{as a result of}} operations already performed, and it could store instructions for self-programmed operation. The Calculator consisted of a Type 605 Electronic Calculating Punch and a Type 412 or 418 Accounting Machine. A Type 941 Auxiliary Storage Unit was available as an optional feature. All units composing the Calculator were interconnected by flexible cables. If desired, the Type 412 or 418, with or without the Type 941, could be operated independently of the other machines. The Type 605 {{could be used as a}} Calculating Punch and the punch unit (Type 527) could be operated as an independent <b>gang</b> <b>punch.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Lydon criticised the {{paramilitary}} organisations {{involved in the}} Northern Ireland conflict, remarking that both the Irish Republican Army and the Ulster Defence Association were [...] "like two mafia <b>gangs</b> <b>punching</b> each other out… They both run their extortion rackets and plague people to no end." [...] He remarked that [...] "The Northern Ireland problem is a terrible thing, and it's only the ignorance of the people living outside of it that keeps it going", but that ultimately the British government's exploitative attitude to the problem was in his opinion the main cause.|$|R

5000|$|The Wo Shing Wo gang, {{which was}} mainly Filipino, {{aspired to be}} a junior version of the Triads. Twelve of the gang's members, led by 15-year-old Learco Chindamo, who was a pupil at another school and {{claimed to be a}} Triad member, went to St. George's school on 8 December 1995, to [...] "punish" [...] 13-year-old black pupil William Njoh, who had earlier quarrelled with a Filipino pupil. Lawrence saw them attack the boy with an iron bar and went outside to remonstrate with the <b>gang.</b> Chindamo <b>punched</b> Lawrence, then stabbed him in the chest; he died in {{hospital}} that evening. Chindamo was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey in October 1996, after a unanimous decision by the jury, and jailed indefinitely (as he was a juvenile at the time). The trial judge recommended that a minimum of 12 years should be served.|$|R
5000|$|Jeffrey said {{although}} Finn {{appeared to}} be a [...] "demented kidnapper", it [...] "eventually transpires that, thank goodness, Finn is not a terrifying freak". He {{went on to say that}} his efforts to escape Sadie's influence [...] "may have been a little extreme to say the least, but you can't help but sympathise with the poor lad's plight once you learn the truth and his bizarro relationship starts to unravel". Jeffrey commented that Finn begins to [...] "feel a little more real" [...] during the second episode of the fourth series which allows [...] "McMullen's cheeky Scouser ... more room to breath". Jeffrey added that the [...] "new group dynamic also feels like it's taking shape, with Finn in particular having already found his role as the <b>gang's</b> new <b>punching</b> bag". Debnath said she felt [...] "initial sympathy towards Finn but when he continuously showed how immature he was, the sympathy began to recede and he just came across as pathetic and annoying without being particularly funny". She criticised the episode's attempts to [...] "pull at the audience’s heartstrings" [...] by using Finn's relationship with Sadie as she felt it [...] "just fell flat". Farley opined that [...] "Finn isn’t a creepy Buffalo-Bill-wannabe after all. Not the greatest surprise, admittedly, but a welcome one. He may get off the hook for kidnap and false imprisonment, but the episode still paints a dubious picture of the shifty scouser". He added that Finn's reasoning for keeping Sadie captive [...] "is a tad disappointing".|$|R
50|$|That evening, Charlie and Andrews {{meet with}} Col. Watkins. Diana Woodland arrives and asks to see Nash; her request is granted. But Diana sneaks Nash a pistol, {{and the two}} escape. Later that day, Andrews and Charlie return to the house where Charlie was held. The gang has left, but Charlie finds an ink pad in the {{fireplace}} and takes it as evidence. Lee shows up dressed as a beggar, and Charlie sends him home. Oddly, Charlie arrives at the hotel first. Lee shows up later, and reveals that he saw their kidnapper in a taxi {{on the street and}} followed him to the Cafe Versailles. Moments later, Andrews calls and summons Charlie to his apartment. Before he leaves, Charlie sends Lee off on a secret mission. Charlie arrives at Andrews' apartment, where the FBI agent has caught a gangster involved with the Marloff <b>gang.</b> After a <b>punch</b> to the jaw, the gangster reveals that the Cafe Versailles is where the opium gang is hiding out. Andrews calls the police, and asks them to meet them at the club. Charlie and Andrews leave for Cafe Versailles. After Charlie and Andrews depart, Andrews' valet, Forrest, frees the gangster and the two leave. At the club, Nash (disguised as an able seaman) sees some of the Marloff gang heading toward the basement and follows, but is captured. Charlie and Andrews arrive moments later, and follow a gang member into the basement as well. The basement is where opium is being shipped out via riverboat, reached by a trap door. Andrews urges Charlie to go first, but Charlie hesitates when his flashlight mysteriously refuses to work. The police arrive by boat, and after a brief shootout capture the gang.|$|R
