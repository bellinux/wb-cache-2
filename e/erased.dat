5|$|After the Colts {{left the}} AFC East in 2002, {{they first met}} on November 30, 2003, in a 38–34 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots. The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005, then won twice in 2006; in the AFC Championship Game the Colts <b>erased</b> a 21–6 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times {{in the second half}} before a late {{touchdown}} led to a 38–34 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8–0 Patriots and the 7–0 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24–20. The Colts won again in 2008 and then <b>erased</b> a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31–28 Patriots win.|$|E
5|$|As part of Apollo 11's 40th {{anniversary in}} 2009, NASA spearheaded {{an effort to}} {{digitally}} restore the existing videotapes of the mission's live televised moonwalk. After an exhaustive three-year search for missing tapes of the original video of the Apollo 11 moonwalk, NASA concluded the data tapes had more than likely been accidentally <b>erased.</b>|$|E
5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up of {{multiple}} cells). However, the memory can be <b>erased</b> only in larger units called blocks (made up of multiple pages). If the data {{in some of the}} pages of the block are no longer needed (also called stale pages), only the pages with good data in that block are read and rewritten into another previously <b>erased</b> empty block. Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E

5|$|The Engineering Department had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders, which were <b>erased</b> on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master videotape of the programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be <b>erased</b> were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E

They can be pulled into a point for <b>erasing</b> small areas and tight detail <b>erasing,</b> molded into a textured surface and used like a reverse stamp to give texture, or used in a [...] "blotting" [...] manner to lighten lines or shading without completely <b>erasing</b> them. They gradually lose their efficacy and resilience as they become infused with particles picked up from <b>erasing</b> and from their environment. They are not suited to <b>erase</b> large areas because of their tendency to deform under vigorous <b>erasing.</b>|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{homogeneity}} of ancient Egyptian art, the styles of particular {{times and places}} sometimes reflected changing cultural or political attitudes. After {{the invasion of the}} Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris. The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas. This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly and thoroughly <b>erased</b> after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms.|$|E

Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively.|$|E

30|$|NOR Flash is slower in <b>erase</b> {{operation}} and write operation compared to NAND Flash [52]. This means that NAND Flash has faster <b>erase</b> and write times. Moreover, NAND Flash has smaller <b>erase</b> units, so fewer <b>erases</b> are needed. NOR Flash can read data slightly faster than NAND Flash. NOR Flash offers complete address and data buses to randomly access {{any of its}} memory locations (addressable to every byte). This makes it a suitable replacement for older ROM BIOS/firmware chips, which rarely needs to be updated. Its endurance is 10, 000 to 1, 000, 000 <b>erase</b> cycles. NOR Flash is highly suitable for storing codes in embedded systems. Most of today's microcontrollers come with built-in Flash memory [53].|$|R
