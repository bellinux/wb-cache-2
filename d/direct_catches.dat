40|$|Upstream {{oviposition}} {{flights of}} several Plecoptera {{species of the}} genera Leuctra, Nemoura, Isoperla and Siphonoperla along the Breitenbach, Hesse, Germany are inferred from 1) oviposition occurring upstream from emergence areas; 2) size differences and size-shifts between emerging and egg-laying females; 3) concentration of oviposition in upstream sections of the emergence area. The last point relies on <b>direct</b> <b>catches</b> of egg-laying females with sticky traps, and on over-representation of old, mature females in upstream emergence traps towards the end of, or even after actual emergence periods. Criteria for age class discrimination of the respective taxa are described. The validity of the present and of other indirect evidence for directed adult flights and the significance of adult upstream displacement are discussed. Optical orientation cues are suggested. Females of Leuctra prima and Siphonoperla torrentium are shown to gain 25 - 50 % dry weight by feeding in the terrestrial environment; general information indicates many other Plecoptera may be similar in this respect. Terrestrial adult life is shown to last for 3 - 8 weeks. This long time, evidence of important flight activity and feeding together suggest that the terrestrial phase is spent as an active adult, the inevitable risks of which may form an important control of population dynamics.

40|$|Three {{sightings}} totalling five small-sized {{beaked whales}} recorded off north-central Chile (ca. 29 °S) in February 1998, two between Punta Zorros and Damas Island and one south of Choros Island, {{were attributed to}} Mesoplodon peruvianus. A	ca. 1 m neonate was observed for the first time. The occurrence of lesser beaked whales in shallow water habitat (20 - 70 m depth) is unusual in the Family Ziphiidae. On 17 December 1997, during the IWC 3 rd Blue Whale Survey off Chile, researchers (including two of the authors) assigned another beaked whale sighting at 20 º 26 ’S, 70 º 44 ’W, in deeper water (878 - 1245 m), as a probable M. peruvianus. All individuals shared the following characteristics: small body size, short snout, nondescript dark colouration dorsally and a low, markedly triangular dorsal fin. An adult beaked whale skull (specimen GPS 004) was collected at Los Choros beach (29 º 17. 04 ’S, 71 º 23. 54 ’W) in May 1995.

A significant decrease was recorded especially in diadromous fish species such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and eel (Anquilla anquilla).

Transverse barrier which prevents fish migration in rivers and impaired water quality are considered as the main causes of this situation. At present there is being improved a surface water quality, habitat rehabilitation and restoration of the possibility of free migration of aquatic animals. Design and construction of fish ladders are the most important factors to improve conditions of the fish migration. Closely related to this is a migration permeability testing of these fish ladders while the biological function and the activity of a single technical solution is evaluated.

Most information on distribution {{is derived from}} historical catch data {{with a total of}} about 100, 000 animals taken in Little Belt alone and 40, 000 from Isefjord area during the 19 th century. Recent sightings surveys and tagging indicate extensive movements of animals within and between Inner Danish Waters and the Skagerrak / North Sea. Biological information is reviewed for the region, drawing on <b>directed</b> <b>catches,</b> bycatches and strandings from a databasecomprising nearly 1, 900 records from 1834 through 1998. Diet, parasites, pollutants, biological parameters (age and reproduction) and body condition are reported, focusing mainly on the period 1996 - 98 when comprehensive data were collected. In 1980 s samples, gadoids were the most important prey items (found in 62 % of stomachs) followed by clupeoids (35 %), gobiids (30 %), and ammodytids (30 %). Some dietary differences were observed between North Sea and Inner Danish waters. Pollutant analyses indicated a decline in sumDDT concentrations yet an increase in sumPCB and HCH levels in Danish porpoises, with comparatively higher levels here than in Baltic and Norwegian waters. Heavy metal concentrations appear higher than in Baltic porpoises. Biological parameters indicate a longevity of up to 23 years in both sexes but with fewer than 5 % living beyond 12 years. Sexual maturity occurred at slightly over age 3 years in both females and males, with corresponding lengths of about 135 cm in males and 143 cm in females. The dataindicate a size range at birth of 65 - 75 cm (weight 4. 5 – 6. 7 kg), with a minimum of 60 cm and 3. 4 kg, and a likely gestation time of 10 months. Conception most likely occurs during August, with peak births in June. <b>Directed</b> <b>catches</b> comprised adult animals whereas bycaught and stranded porpoises comprised predominantly juveniles.

The Cape horse {{mackerel}} (Trachurus trachurus capensis) has traditionally made {{an important contribution}} to the South African fishing industry and is a key component of the Benguela ecosystem. This thesis concerns the assessment and management of the South African {{horse mackerel}} resource. It starts with a brief review of the biology of the Cape horse mackerel and the history of the fishery, {{as well as of the}} Management Strategy Evaluation approach, which was applied in this work. Assessments of the horse mackerel resource are currently undertaken through the combined efforts of the Demersal and Pelagic Scientific Working Groups (SWGs) of the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF). A joint effort is required because the resource is available to multiple fisheries: as <b>directed</b> <b>catch</b> to the midwater trawl fishery and as bycatch to the demersal trawl and pelagic purse-seine fisheries. Management of the resources complicated by differences in the age-structures of the horse mackerel caught in each of these three fisheries. The data available for the assessments are described, including the details of their collection and processing. Four age-structured production models (each reflecting different assumptions about the horse mackerel resource) are fitted to those data using the maximum-likelihood estimation method, and are used to provide assessments. Estimates of the current status of the stock indicate that it is healthy, putting it well above its Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) level. For the directed midwater fishery, MSY is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 - 100 000 tonnes per annum. However, the results of constant catch projections suggest that there is a pronounced yield-per-recruit effect, with even small bycatches of juvenile horse mackerel in the pelagic fishery having a pronounced negative effect on the level of a catches in the midwater fishery that can be sustained...|$|R

For this purpose, the expert opinions of 133 local fishers were collected during in-person interviews, distilled using categorical data analysis, and checked against scientific literature. The five main results are as follows: manatees were sighted averagely {{once a week}} in lakes, rivers, and the coast & estuaries, mostly in group sizes of 2 - 3; the odds of sighting live manatees (respectively dead manatees) decreased (respectively increased) from inland lakes to estuaries and the coast, via rivers; manatee carcasses were reported in all habitats, albeit more frequently in rivers; a distribution map based on fishers' reports show two manatee concentration areas: Lake Ossa and the Malimba-Mbiako section of River Sanaga; the number of manatees was perceived as increasing despite incidental and <b>directed</b> <b>catches.</b> Thus, our findings corroborate earlier assessments of the Lower Sanaga Basin as being a major manatee conservation area. Additionally, from these results and the literature, we identified three hypotheses about local manatee persistence: deep pools such as lakes offer year round sanctuaries, not just dry-season refugia; seasonality of specific habitat variables determine manatee occurrence patterns; and local variability in habitat encroachment mediate the meta-population dynamics of manatee in the Lower Sanaga Basin. Finally, we examine the implications for data requirements {{in light of the}} small ecological scale at which the surveyed fishers ply their trade. Thus, consonant with the Malawi principles for the ecosystem approach to management (www. cbd. int/ecosystem), we recommend collecting data preferably at landscape scale, through a participatory monitoring program that fully integrates scientific and traditional knowledge systems. This program should include, amongst others, a standardised necropsy protocol for collecting mortality and biological data together with sonar and radio-telemetry technology to discern manatee use and movements between critical habitat components...|$|R

They are addressed primarily to the decision-makers within fisheries management authorities and other interest groups, including fishing companies, fishers' organizations, concerned non-governmental organizations and others. The Guidelines provide a background {{to the need for}} fisheries management and an introduction to the activities encompassed by fisheries management. They introduce the major constraints experienced in fisheries and fisheries management and some of the fundamental concepts related to these. Biological, environmental, technological, socio-cultural and economic constraints and concepts are examined. Information is fundamental to responsible fisheries management and these Guidelines put emphasis on the range of data required for informed decisionmaking and examine aspects of the collection and interpretation of these data. Data are discussed in terms of three suggested scales in fisheries management: fisheries policy and development planning, formulation of management plans and implementation of management action. The range of possible management actions is outlined. This includes technical measures, such as gear restrictions, and more direct approaches in the form of <b>direct</b> <b>catch</b> limitation or effort limitation. The problems associated with open access fisheries are explained and comments made on the means to limit access and obstacles which may be encountered in this process. Finally, the Guidelines examine the management process. This section covers the process of agreeing on a management plan for a fishery, including the need for consultation and, where appropriate, cooperative decision-making. The need for periodic review of management plans is stressed. The importance of an effective legal framework, institutional and administrative structures and monitoring control and surveillance are described. (PDF contains 91 pages...|$|R
