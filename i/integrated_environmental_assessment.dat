A mixed record of notable accomplishments and modest progress is detected in surveying examples in four large areas of concern to the integrated assessment community: modeling, participatory techniques, mega-assessments involving hundreds of people for several years, and organizational and community issues. Plausible reasons for slow progress in participatory assessments are sketched and possible remedies are suggested.

However, some micropollutants tend to appear in more than one environmental medium (air, water, sediment, soil, groundwater, etc.). In this work, a multimedia fate and transport model (MFTM) is 'wrapped around' a dynamic IUWS model for organic micropollutants to enable <b>integrated</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment.</b> The combined model was tested on a hypothetical catchment using two scenarios: on the one hand a reference scenario with a combined sewerage system {{and on the other hand}} a stormwater infiltration pond scenario, as an example of a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS).

However, the model also showed that this was at the expense of increased fluxes to air, groundwater and infiltration pond soil.

40|$|Abstract. Resources {{localization}} {{is one of}} {{the unique}} concerns of Appropriate Technology (AT) development. It has become a thought-provoking driver to related studies, meaning that there are wide-ranging opportunities to conduct researches, including ones on materials-related issues. Also, following the global concerns on environmental issues, assessment on environmental impacts imposed in AT life-cycle is interesting to be studied. Particularly, this study attempts to investigate potential impacts imposed by materials usage in AT. It is conducted by comparing and contrasting common approach in doing cleaner production to the implication of AT in providing cleaner application. This study aims to provide an integrated assessment framework for calculating environmental impacts from materials usage by incorporating the characteristics of AT life-cycle into account. The first finding points out the interdependency of cleaner production and cleaner application, meaning {{that there is a need}} of cleaner production in the manufacturing and construction process of any material/component/assembling in an AT; besides, the AT has to be designed to perform cleaner application, yet without reducing its performance and intention in localizing materials. Furthermore, the second finding pushes the first finding forward through an <b>integrated</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> diagram that covers materials production and application until the end of AT life-cycle, including disposal phase and predicted degradability of materials. By looking at common approaches that focused on the assessment of only cleaner production, this study is moving toward an <b>integrated</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> on an AT by covering both cleaner production and application to form a complete AT life-cycle assessment...|$|E

That is in fact a great advantage since mechanism-specific toxicity methods with zebrafish are broadly developed, as for AhR-mediated toxicity [72], genotoxicity [73] and neurotoxicity [74]. Furthermore, EDA guided by such zebrafish bioassays could <b>integrate</b> broader <b>environmental</b> <b>assessment</b> strategies, complementing effect-based approaches [7] and weight-of-evidence frameworks [30]. In this way, EDA would support the identification of contaminants causing bioassay and ecological effects, and the clarification of links between ecosystem functioning and the responses at different biological levels [30, 62]. Finally, the evaluation of toxic aquatic contaminants through EDA guided by zebrafish bioassays might improve the protection of water bodies {{in the context of the}} European WFD and MSFD [7, 27].
