500|$|... "Death" [...] also touches {{upon the}} issue of euthanasia, and whether it is morally or {{ethically}} wrong to commit suicide. The episode's script indicates it is wrong for someone wishing to kill oneself to place the burden of that decision on a loved one: in this case, Grandpa Marvin demanding that Stan kill him, without considering how traumatizing an experience {{it would be for}} Stan. This is most strongly illustrated {{at the end of the}} episode, in which the ghost of Marvin's grandfather (who had Marvin kill him long ago) tells Marvin he must not force Stan to commit such a traumatizing act. Although the ghost tells Grandpa Marvin he must die of [...] "natural causes", Marvin nevertheless continues seeking ways to kill himself, but without involving other people. Parker said this reflects his opinion that, [...] "Basically, it is OK to <b>kill</b> <b>yourself,</b> but you shouldn't ask someone else to do it and put someone else through the trip." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heinberg gave {{evidence}} {{that on a}} separate occasion at the restaurant in Regent Street she had seen Chang give Kempton a small coloured bottle containing powder. Kempton had asked Chang [...] "Can you die while sniffing cocaine?" [...] and Chang had replied, [...] "No, {{the only way you}} can <b>kill</b> <b>yourself</b> is by putting cocaine in water." [...] According to Heinberg, Kempton had said that she would kill herself by doing just that, adding [...] "Wouldn't it be funny if I, an important witness in Audrey Harrison's case, were to commit suicide?" [...] Kempton had been a witness in the suicide due to insanity of Audrey Knowles-Harrison just over a month earlier in the same court in which her own inquest was later held. In addition, she had recently broken up with her boyfriend.|$|E

2500|$|A Senate {{report on}} {{intelligence}} failures would later detail the intense debate {{that went on}} behind the scenes on what to include in Powell's speech. State Department analysts had found dozens of factual problems in drafts of the speech. Some of the claims were taken out, but others were left in, such as claims based on the yellowcake forgery. The administration came under fire for having acted on faulty intelligence, particularly what was single-sourced to the informant known as Curveball. Powell later recounted how Vice President Dick Cheney had joked with him before he gave the speech, telling him, [...] "You've got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points." [...] Powell's longtime aide-de-camp and Chief of Staff from 1989–2003, Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, later characterized Cheney's view of Powell's mission as to [...] "go up there and sell it, and we'll have moved forward a peg or two.

2500|$|A {{day after}} the Columbine High School {{massacre}} in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999, Stern's comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners. [...] "There were some really good looking girls running out with their hands over their heads...Did [...] try {{to have sex with}} any of the good looking girls?...At least {{if you are going to}} <b>kill</b> <b>yourself</b> and kill all the kids, why wouldn't you have some sex?...If I was going to kill some people, I'd take them out with sex." [...] Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show's affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. [...] "I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That's how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn't know anything about motives [...] and were trying to consider all possibilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|This time Hennessy and Chang {{were both}} {{represented}} by lawyers.

He stated that he imported silks, tea and other goods but not cocaine. He denied giving Kempton any drugs, bottles or powders but acknowledged that he had given her sums of money on several occasions. He said that he had never seen cocaine and denied that he knew what the word [...] "dope" [...] meant. He denied discussing with Kempton whether you could <b>kill</b> <b>yourself</b> with cocaine. He acknowledged that he had seen people smoke opium. Asked what he had done after learning of Kempton's death, Chang replied that he had gone to the Forty Three Club to dance.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} split with Erica, Armstrong {{met a woman}} he has {{identified}} only as [...] "Amanda" [...] at Gilman, and they started dating. Amanda produced and distributed her own zine and was an iron-willed feminist, which enthralled Armstrong. Amanda, however, was unimpressed with Armstrong and though the couple dated for some time she ultimately dumped him in 1994 and joined the Peace Corps leaving Armstrong feeling suicidal. Armstrong stated {{in an interview with}} Spin about the inspiration behind the Insomniac song Armitage Shanks in 1995, [...] "It was right before Dookie came out and I was really at odds with myself. I was like man do I really want to do this? A lot of time I was thinking about suicide, how it's so easy to <b>kill</b> <b>yourself,</b> but it's so hard to stay alive. I was in a break-up with my then girlfriend, a total, raving punk rocker who didn't approve of me being on a major label. She moved down to Ecuador saying she couldn't live in a world with McDonald's and such. It was fucking me up pretty bad." [...] Armstrong has written many songs about Amanda, both during their relationship and afterwards, including [...] "She", [...] "Good Riddance", [...] "Stuart And The Ave", [...] "Sassafrass Roots", [...] "Amanda", [...] "She's A Rebel", [...] "Extraordinary Girl" [...] and [...] "Whatsername".
