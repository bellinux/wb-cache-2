We do so by estimating VAR/VEC Models to uncover the transmission mechanisms of China's monetary policy. Also we identify the cointegrating vectors to establish the long-run relationship between these variables. By using monthly aggregate bank data and disaggregated data on bank and loan types from 1996 to 2006, our study suggests the existence of a bank lending channel, an interest rate channel and an asset price channel. Furthermore, we discuss and explore the distribution and growth effects of China's monetary policy on China's real economy. In addition, we investigate the effects of China's monetary policy on China's international trade. Finally, we identify the cointegrating vectors among these variables and set up VEC Models to uncover the long-run relationships that connect the indicators of monetary policy, bank balance sheet variables and the macroeconomic variables in China.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} exports and productivity in the Turkish apparel and motor vehicle and parts industries from 1990 - 1996, using two different models for plant-level panel data. In the first model, we {{examine the effect of}} past export status on current productivity both with and without controlling for the export history of plants. Our results show that the plants' prior market experience is a factor in their current productivity. The learning effects are evident among continuing exporters and entrants. This model, however, neither controls for the endogeneity of the explanatory variables nor for the unobserved plant-specific effects that persist over time. Moreover, it does not distinguish between the long- and short-run relationships between exports and productivity. Thus, a second model, an Error- Correction specification for panel data, is estimated to address these three issues. Our findings suggest that there is a bidirectional relationship between exports and productivity both in the short- and long-run. The effect of productivity on exporting is much stronger than the effect of exporting on productivity, suggesting that more productive firms enter the export market, then they experience a productivity enhancement due to their participation in the export marketProductivity, Multilateral <b>Index,</b> <b>Exports,</b> Causality, Error-Correction Model, Dynamic Panel Data Estimator, System GMM. ...|$|E
40|$|Importance {{of stock}} {{market in the}} {{economic}} development of a country cannot be denied, and macroeconomic variables are important indicators that affect stock market of a country. Present study provides a great contribution to understand the association of these variables with stock market. This paper deals with the causal relationship among KSE 100 index and interest rate, exchange rate, consumer price index, imports and exports. For this purpose data of nineteen years has been collected from 1992 to 2010. Techniques of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, regression analysis and Granger Causality test have been applied to examine the causal relationship of selected macroeconomic variables with KSE 100 index. Results of regression analysis indicate the presence of strong positive relation between IMP and KSEI. Furthermore, interest rate, exchange rate, consumer price index and exports have no relationship with KSE 100 index. Results of Granger Causality test demonstrate that bi-directional relationship exists between interest rate and KSE 100 index. Exchange rate and imports have uni-directional relationship with KSE 100 index and no causal relationship exists between consumer price <b>index,</b> <b>exports</b> and KSE 100 index.

In addition to this, we also use a weighted GDP <b>index</b> of <b>export</b> destination countries to capture demand shocks in partner countries using the export shares as weights. To be included in the calculation of the real exchange rate index and the GDP index, a destination country should account for at least 2.5  % of an industry’s exports from a sample country.
