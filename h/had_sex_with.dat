5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{men and women who are}} HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only, and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women are less than half as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men to always use condoms when <b>having</b> anal <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that ‘use a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship status’. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men. Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men were identified. These are as follows: ‘Safer sex is good sex’, ‘Condom use is good but …’ and ‘I use condoms sometimes’. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women. Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women. Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women <b>have</b> been an obscure group.
