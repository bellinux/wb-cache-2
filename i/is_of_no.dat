5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a year. After a gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interesting}} {{example that}} does not involve any luring is the zone-tailed hawk, which resembles the turkey vulture. It flies amongst the vultures, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively.|$|E
5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

5|$|In many {{recreational}} diving {{settings where}} air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are {{identified with a}} green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.|$|E
5|$|In mimesis (also called masquerade), the camouflaged object {{looks like}} {{something}} else which <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> special interest to the observer. Mimesis is common in prey animals, for example when a peppered moth caterpillar mimics a twig, or a grasshopper mimics a dry leaf. It {{is also found in}} nest structures; some eusocial wasps, such as Leipomeles dorsata, build a nest envelope in patterns that mimic the leaves surrounding the nest.|$|E
5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While it reduces LDL cholesterol, {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness. Whether this means that ezetimibe <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> overall benefit in FH is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The Church of St Nicholas lies in {{the centre}} of Sapareva Banya. Its {{architecture}} is rather simple, with a single nave, a single apse and no narthex present. The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design, with unusually short arms of equal size. The dome has twelve sides and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> particular height, though it is rather large for the church's size. The apse is situated on the church's eastern side; its shape is semicircular and it features a window. The entrance {{is located on the}} west wall.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other but not with others) <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> help here because archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a good reason to wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give themselves up, swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis or cryptic {{aggressive}} mimicry {{is where}} the predator mimics an organism that its prey is indifferent to. Unlike in all cases above, the predator is ignored by the prey, allowing it to avoid detection until the prey are close enough for the predator to strike. This is effectively a form of camouflage. The zone-tailed hawk (Buteo albonotatus), which resembles the turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), may provide one such example. It flies amongst them, suddenly breaking from the formation and ambushing its prey. Here the hawk's presence <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> evident significance to the vultures, affecting them neither negatively or positively. There is some controversy over {{whether this is a}} true case of mimicry.|$|E

5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
