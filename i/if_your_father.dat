2500|$|Wang Yi {{was spared}} from {{disaster}} when Liang Shuang reconciled {{with the authorities}} in Qiangdao County. Zhao Ang sent his men to fetch his wife and daughter. When they were about 30 li away from their destination, Wang Yi suddenly stopped and said to Zhao Ying, [...] "I'd have never left that place <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> didn't send someone to fetch us. Whenever I read the stories of Lady Jiang and Lady Bo, I feel inspired by their devotions and convictions. However, I'm still alive after having gone through similar experiences as them, so wouldn't I feel ashamed when I face those ladies after I die? I didn't choose death then because of you. Now, since we're close to safety and within {{the protection of the}} authorities, I can leave you and die." [...] Having said that, she attempted suicide by consuming poison but luckily for her, an antidote was available, so she received medical treatment quickly and survived.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{it would}} seem, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> {{is telling you}} secrets {{all the time you}} are smoking together. But where is this land, Dirck?" ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. A turnspit. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> hadnt made a {{roasting}} jack {{for you to}} turn, youd be earning twenty-four shillings a week behind a counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "One thing only--Thomas must be saved. A {{bold face}} and stand to it. Is it our fault <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> ghost should haunt this chapel? Remember, <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> ghost, no other. Ah! here they come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't insinivate too much, sir, though I {{have got}} my suspicions," [...] said Redhair blandly; [...] "but of course that's easy settled, for <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> 'ouse is anyw'ere hereabouts, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> won't object to {{identify}} his son." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strong bodied if ye be to bear [...] Intemperance {{with less}} harm, beware! [...] But <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>Father's</b> wit ye share, [...] Then, then indeed, [...] Ye Sons of Burns! for watchful care [...] 1807.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! you {{are going}} to Cambridge again, are you? Well, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> wishes it;--though very little is ever gained now by a {{university}} connexion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blood and fire, madam," [...] roared Galliard, [...] "it is {{precisely}} {{for that reason}} that I am exercised. What <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> came upon us here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] you answer, [...] "perhaps you will, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> ever invites an {{irritable}} man to {{come and}} sleep here, and doesn't warn him beforehand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know any}} good reason <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> {{willing to take}} you, but the country's in a rather {{unsettled}} state just now." [...] Grahame {{paused for a moment}} and added earnestly: [...] "Don't trust Gomez." ...|$|R
6000|$|Martin's face did not flush. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> ship sailed {{on a long}} voyage," [...] he said, with a {{suspicion}} of apprehension, [...] "he would not sail with her; he would send her under the charge of others." ...|$|R
6000|$|Strong bodied if ye be to bear [...] Intemperance {{with less}} harm, beware! [...] But <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>Father's</b> wit ye share, [...] Then, then indeed, [...] 10 [...] Ye Sons of Burns! for watchful care [...] There will be need.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Nothing of {{that kind}} could anger him. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> were to cringe or to flatter him then he would be disgusted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then Susan gave up. 'We cannot save him! Oh, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> was here--look at him, {{the poor}} little fellow! I know not what to do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, hush, Peregrine! I cannot {{have you}} talk thus. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> had such designs, {{it would be}} unworthy of us to favour you in {{crossing}} them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} her Lady Hampstead, {{and demand that}} she shall be {{received}} at Court. You can deck her with diamonds, and cause her to be seated high in honour according to your own rank. But could you induce <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> wife to smile on her?" [...] In answer to this he was dumb. [...] "Do you think she would be contented <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> wife were to frown on her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about you, Ernest," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "You're only sixteen, {{and you may not}} have an ounce of real grit or worth in you. But it will be a queer thing <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> son hasn't. I knew him all his life. A better man never lived nor, before his accident, a smarter one. I'll give his son a chance, anyhow. If you take after your dad you'll get on all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear Edward," [...] inquired Mrs. Temple, [...] "is {{your chair}} quite comfortable? and has your little nurse {{provided}} for all <b>your</b> wants? <b>If</b> so, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> {{is ready to}} begin his stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I suppose, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> and {{you boys}} were to ride over to Holderness's newest stand, {{and tell him}} to get off there would be a fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He and you {{are happy}} to be so placed together. But <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> can spare me five minutes, I will take it from him as a favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> and Mr. Webster {{will go down}} to Seattle with me, we'll get the {{transfer}} made and a deed drawn up to fix the thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's the machine," [...] Dr. Kennedy said, rising. [...] "I've got to run. I'm sorry I've shaken you up, and at {{the same}} time I'm glad. And know one thing, Isaac Ford's dab of unruly blood was remarkably small, and Joe Garland got it all. And one other thing. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> left hand offend you, don't smite it off. Besides, Joe is all right. Frankly, if I could choose between you and him to live with me on a desert isle, I'd choose Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, I'm so glad!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I often think, <b>if</b> only <b>your</b> <b>father</b> were alive, {{how happy}} he would be, and how proud of you. I wish he could know. Perhaps he does know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{that we are}} to have a wolf-hunt in {{the plains}} tomorrow; and <b>if</b> you've aggravated <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> he'll be taking you home to-night, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, then, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> is made angry, {{you know}} what sort of a man he is; and how could I {{stand in the way}} of all your prospects?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say, captain. My {{wife will}} be here directly; she is sure to know. It {{must have been some}} time ago, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> knew this Mr. Vanstone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{can prove}} that you are so, sir," [...] Mr. Tufton said, wearily, [...] "you are the Marquis of Langdale--that is to say, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> is deceased.|$|E
5000|$|Ibn Khafif {{reported}} from his teacher Ibn Surayj that the proof that love of Allah was a categorical obligation (fard) {{was in the}} verses: [...] "Say: <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>fathers,</b> and <b>your</b> sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your tribe, and the wealth you have acquired, and merchandise for which you fear {{that there will be}} no sale, and dwellings you desire are dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and striving in His way: then wait till Allah brings His command to pass. Allah guides not wrongdoing folk." [...] (9:24) For punishment is not threatened except due to a categorical obligation.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} {{described}} the wound correctly, I should say there was every danger. I have written, however, to your mother, so that she {{may be able to}} decide if anything of the kind is probable, and then you may be obliged to make another journey up here. At all events, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> life should be in danger, you may depend upon it I will come to the camp; although I am free to admit that a ride across Smoke Creek Desert isn't one that I hanker for, although you seem to have made the journey on foot and thought little of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you don't}} love me--not as I love you. <b>If</b> you fear <b>your</b> <b>father</b> {{more than you}} love me, then your love is not what I hoped it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it must be}} {{a matter}} of course," [...] said Bertie; [...] "that is, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> wishes it. Who else on earth could hold it after what has occurred?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give up this {{adventure}} to-night!" [...] I begged. [...] "I hate {{to mention}} it, Eve, but if money--I put my checkbook {{in my pocket}} to-day. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> would only--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That {{is not for}} sale, {{my little}} man. That is engaged. But I can make you one, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father</b> likes. I ask three {{quarters}} of a dollar for them.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'S a bad business," [...] moaned Uncle Donald, {{having gone}} through the {{movements}} once more. [...] "Shocking bad business. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> poor <b>father</b> were alive, whatch think he'd say to your tearing across the world after this girl? I'll tell you what he'd say. He'd say... What kind of whisky's this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam, run {{round and}} see <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> in the office. He'll {{be home to}} dinner, I know. Molly, do be quiet with your sister. I never see such a girl as you are for bothering. You didn't come down about business, did you, John?" [...] And then Kenneby {{explained}} {{to her that he}} had been summoned by Dockwrath as to the matter of this Orley Farm trial. While he was doing so, Sam returned to say that his father had stepped out, but would be back in half an hour, and Mrs. Dockwrath, finding it impossible to make use of her company sitting-room, took her old lover into the family apartment which they all ordinarily occupied.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{as great}} a shame as ever I heard!" [...] cried Ethel, {{recovering}} her utterance. [...] "Who would you trust, <b>if</b> not <b>your</b> own <b>father</b> and brother?" ...|$|R
