25|$|The Internet {{maintains}} {{two principal}} namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>IP)</b> address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services {{between it and}} the address spaces.

A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.|$|E

25|$|When {{the term}} Internet {{is used to}} refer to the {{specific}} global system of interconnected <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>IP)</b> networks, the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter.

Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. The Internet is also {{often referred to as the}} Net, as a short form of network. Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or internetworking, meaning interconnecting computer networks.|$|E

The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and wireless access (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E

Last, {{at the bottom of}} the architecture is the link layer, which provides logical connectivity between hosts on the same network link, such as a local area network (LAN) or a dial-up connection. The model, also known as TCP/IP, is designed to be independent of the underlying hardware used for the physical connections, which the model does not concern itself with in any detail. Other models have been developed, such as the OSI model, that attempt to be comprehensive in every aspect of communications.

However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. [...] A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic.

Malicious activity is not necessarily to be uniformly distributed across the Internet: some networks may occupy lax security, resulting in large populations of compromised machines, while others may secure the network from deleterious attacks.
