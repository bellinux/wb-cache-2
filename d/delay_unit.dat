50|$|To filter these returns out, two pulses were compared, {{and returns}} with common timing are removed. To do this, the signal sent from the {{receiver}} to the display was split in two, with one path leading directly to the display, and the second leading to a <b>delay</b> <b>unit.</b> The delay was carefully tuned to delay the signals some multiple of the time between pulses (the pulse repetition frequency), as that way the delayed signal from an earlier pulse would exit the <b>delay</b> <b>unit</b> {{at the same time}} as a newer pulse was being received from the antenna. One of the signals was then inverted, typically the one from the delay, and the two signals were then combined and sent to the display. Any signal that was at the same location was nullified by the inverted signal from a previous pulse, leaving only the moving objects on the display.|$|E

5000|$|A {{better and}} more {{widespread}} use of piezoelectric delays was in European television sets. The European PAL standard for color broadcasts compares the signal from two successive lines of the image {{in order to avoid}} color shifting due to small phase shifts. By comparing two lines, one of which is inverted, the shifting is averaged and the resulting signal more closely matches the original signal, even in the presence of interference. In order to compare the two lines, a piezoelectric <b>delay</b> <b>unit</b> which delays the signal by a time that is equal to the duration of each line, 64 µs, is inserted in one of the two signal paths that are compared. [...] In order to produce the required delay in a crystal of convenient size, the <b>delay</b> <b>unit</b> is shaped to reflect the signal multiple times through the crystal, thereby greatly reducing the required size of the crystal and thus producing a small, cube-shaped device.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A clock {{generation}} circuit having {{the function of}} multiphase locking was designed using the synchronous mirror delay (SMD) scheme. The internal clock can be synchronized to the external clock with intended phase difference. The synchro-nizing error of the clock {{generation circuit}} is reduced below the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage by compensation characteristics of detecting circuit in SMD. A 32 -M double data rate (DDR) SRAM including the clock generation circuit is fabricated using 0. 13 - m CMOS technology. To measure the synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit, the test elements group (TEG) system is designed and fabricated with the main system. The synchronizing error of the clock generation circuit is far smaller than the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at zero phase locking and similar to the <b>delay</b> time of <b>unit</b> <b>delay</b> stage at multiphase locking.

40|$|Some {{applications}} {{require a}} highly-directive antenna array {{which has to}} scan the main beam over a limited-field-of-view (LFOV) angular sector. The phase control over the radiating aperture can be achieved with phase-shifters or time <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> (TDUs). Due to their cost and bulkiness time <b>delay</b> <b>units</b> can be hardly employed at element level and their number needs to be minimized as much as possible. On the other hand, the use of phase shifters may cause a beam squint or a narrow band operation if compared to employing TDUs. A quite common solution adopted to overcome the aforementioned issues for such radiating structures relies on the employment of time-delayed subarrays for reducing the costs and allowing an easier practical realization. The present work investigates on the possible performance improvements provided by arrays organized into randomly-overlapped subarrays with respect to other subarray arrangements such as contiguous and uniformly-overlapped lattices...|$|R
