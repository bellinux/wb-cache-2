5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes {{it was a combination of}} an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was <b>electrically</b> <b>insulated</b> from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} requirement for optimum biofouling resistance {{is that the}} copper alloys should be freely exposed or <b>electrically</b> <b>insulated</b> from less noble alloys and from cathodic protection. Galvanic coupling to less noble alloys and cathodic protection prevent copper ion releases from surface films and therefore reduce biofouling resistance.|$|E

A cheater cord was a power cord ending in the special socket used by the safety interlock; servicers could then power the device with the hazardous voltages exposed.|$|E

25|$|If {{used in a}} {{location}} with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be <b>electrically</b> <b>insulated</b> {{because of the high}} voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.|$|E
25|$|Pope's group {{reported}} in 1965 {{that in the}} absence of an external electric field, the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level. Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing electroluminescent cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) <b>electrically</b> <b>insulated</b> one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder.

25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube. Electrically, {{this is similar to}} the two cavity oscillator klystron with a lot of feedback between the two cavities. Electrons exiting the source cavity are velocity modulated by the electric field as they travel through the drift tube and emerge at the destination chamber in bunches, delivering power to the oscillation in the cavity. This type of oscillator klystron has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is <b>electrically</b> <b>insulated</b> from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|E

Here, an in situ grafting approach is designed to fabricate thermally conductive, <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> and post-melt processable polystyrene (PS) /BN nanosphere (BNNS) nanocomposites by initiating styrene (St) on the surface functionalized BNNSs via reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The nanocomposites exhibit significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. For example, at a St/BN feeding ratio of 5 : 1, an enhancement ratio of 1375 % is achieved in comparison with pure PS. Moreover, the dielectric properties of the nanocomposites show a desirable weak dependence on frequency, and the dielectric loss tangent of the nanocomposites remains at a very low level. More importantly, the nanocomposites can be subjected to multiple melt processing to form different shapes. Our method can become a universal approach to prepare thermally conductive, <b>electrically</b> <b>insulating</b> and melt-processable polymer nanocomposites with diverse monomers and nanofillers...|$|R
