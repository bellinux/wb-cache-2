5|$|Contemporaries {{regarded}} Organt {{as something}} of a salacious novelty and it was quickly banned, but censors who tried to confiscate it discovered that few copies were available anywhere. It did not sell well and resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> loss for its author. The public's taste for literature had changed in the prelude to the Revolution, and Saint-Just's taste changed with it: aside from a few pages of an unfinished novel found amidst his papers {{at the end of his}} life, Saint-Just devoted his future writing entirely to undecorated essays of social and political theory. With his previous ambitions of literary and lawyerly fame unfulfilled, Saint-Just directed his focus on the single goal of revolutionary command.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{promotion}} it received, upon release the game only reached #18 in the Dengeki charts with initial sales of 14,000 units. Its sales continued {{to fall and}} within three weeks the game {{had dropped out of}} the Dengeki Top 50. By the end of the year, Nine had sold just over 30,000. According to Atlus, the game's sales {{by the end of the}} 2002-2003 fiscal year had reached 45,000 units: this fell below their planned sales number of 67,000 units. In May, Atlus announced that the development costs and poor sales of Xbox games, including Nine, had resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> loss for that year.|$|E
5|$|Brodie joined League Two club Morecambe on 19 July 2012 on {{a six-month}} loan. He made his debut in Morecambe's 2012–13 opener as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Jordan Burrow in their 2–1 away victory over Championship team Blackpool on 12 August 2012 in the League Cup first round. His first start came on 18 August 2012 in Morecambe's 3–0 win away to Exeter City on 18 August 2012. Having scored six goals in 27 appearances, {{he returned to}} Crawley on 2 January 2013 as Morecambe were not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> position to extend his loan. On 4 January 2013, Brodie joined Conference Premier team Grimsby Town on loan {{until the end of}} 2012–13. He made his debut the following day, starting Grimsby's 1–1 home draw with Hereford United, before scoring his first goal in a 4–2 win at home to Alfreton Town on 2 February 2013. Brodie was released from his loan spell on 25 March 2013, the day after he missed a penalty in the 4–1 penalty shoot-out defeat against Wrexham in the 2013 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium. He had scored two goals in 15 appearances for Grimsby.|$|E

5|$|Tucker's law {{practice}} could {{not support the}} expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits, which included gambling at cards and races, and he proceeded to waste the capital from Mary Tucker's estate. He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery {{to raise funds for}} the Richmond Academy. He allegedly bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner. He held the winning stub when his ticket was purportedly found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum.|$|E
5|$|While neo-Keynesians {{integrated}} Keynes's {{ideas with}} neoclassical theory, post-Keynesians went in other directions. Post-Keynesians opposed the neoclassical synthesis and shared a fundamentalist interpretation of Keynes {{that sought to}} develop economic theories without classical elements. The core of post-Keynesian belief is the rejection of three axioms that are central to classical and mainstream Keynesian views: the neutrality of money, gross substitution, and the ergodic axiom. Post-Keynesians not only reject the neutrality {{of money in the}} short-run, they also see money as an important factor in the long-run, a view other Keynesians dropped in the 1970s. Gross substitution implies that goods are interchangeable. Relative price changes cause people to shift their consumption in proportion to the change. The ergodic axiom asserts that the future of the economy can be predicted based on the past and present market conditions. Without the ergodic assumption, agents are unable to form rational expectations, undermining new classical theory. In a non-ergodic economy, predictions are very hard to make and decision-making is hampered by uncertainty. Partly because of uncertainty, post-Keynesians take a different stance on sticky prices and wages than new Keynesians. They do not see nominal rigidities as an explanation for the failure of markets to clear. They instead think sticky prices and long-term contracts anchor expectations and alleviate uncertainty that hinders efficient markets. Post Keynesian economic policies emphasize the need to reduce uncertainty in the economy including safety nets and price stability. Hyman Minsky applied post-Keynesian notions of uncertainty and instability to a theory of financial crisis where investors increasingly take on debt until their returns can no longer pay the interest on leveraged assets, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>financial</b> crisis. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 brought mainstream attention to Minsky's work.|$|E
