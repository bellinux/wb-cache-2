5000|$|So {{named because}} {{the shaft of}} the bar has threads at both ends to allow beads with {{receiving}} threads to be attached. Due to the potential damage or irritation to the piercing when the threads pass through when the jewelry is inserted or removed, this type of barbell has become less common, due to {{the popularity of the}} <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> barbell. This type of barbell is usually only used when the gauge of the bar is too small to allow it to be <b>internally</b> <b>threaded,</b> or in cheap, mass-produced body jewelry. Some higher-end manufacturers make externally threaded barbells with [...] "step-down threading", where the threaded section has a smaller diameter than the wearable section; these are fairly uncommon and usually <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> barbells are used in their place. Step-down threaded jewelry ends can be inserted into the blunt end of a hollow piercing needle, allowing for less irritation during initial placement than regular external barbells or even <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> barbells.|$|R

5000|$|Named {{because the}} bar has smooth ends with {{receiving}} threads tapped {{into the end}} of the bar. In <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> jewelry, the bead has a receiving tube machined into it (this is referred to as [...] "countersunk"), with a threaded post extending from the center, which mates with the threaded receiving tube on the bar. Being much less likely to cause damage and irritation, especially at the time of piercing, <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> jewelry is considered superior to externally threaded jewelry. It is usually slightly more expensive than externally threaded jewelry, due to the extra machining and labor involved.|$|R

50|$|Round {{slightly}} spiral threaded {{connections are}} possible on tubular ends of glass items. Such glass threading can face the inside or the outside. In use, glass threading is screwed into or onto non-glass threaded material such as plastic. Glass vials typically have outer <b>threaded</b> glass <b>openings</b> onto which caps can be screwed on.

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|R

50|$|A {{blind hole}} {{refers to a}} hole that is reamed, drilled, or milled to a {{specified}} depth without breaking through {{to the other side}} of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a blind hole. Other types of holes also include through holes, and clearance holes. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> hole (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind hole, conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.|$|R

50|$|Flesh tunnels are {{fashioned}} {{from a broad}} range of materials, including surgical steel, titanium, Pyrex glass, silicone, acrylic glass, bone, horn, amber, bamboo, stone, and wood. Flesh tunnels, like flesh plugs, may feature a decorative inlay or semi-precious stones. Some flesh tunnels have flares to keep the jewellery from falling out. If there are no flares, grooves may be cut near the edges to allow rubber or silicone o-rings to hold the jewellery in place. The back of the flesh tunnel may also screw off. A flesh tunnel may also have an <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> backing, as externally threaded pieces can rip freshly stretched ears.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a navel curve or curve, so named because of their curvature. A curved barbell is {{mechanically}} identical to a straight barbell, except for being curved. Curvature on a curved barbell can range from almost straight to circular, with some barbells actually being spiral, with the ends overlapping but separated to allow the insertion of the jewelry. A variation on this design is a J-bar, a slightly curved barbell (sometimes {{referred to as a}} bananabell or banana barbell) with a 90 degree bend near one end, used in vertical navel piercings to position the decorative end of the jewelry more appropriately. They can be either <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> or externally threaded.|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{is a small}} cover used on {{the valve}} stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small {{particles}} from entering the valve and damaging it. The dustcap also forms a pressure seal, helping to prevent deflation of the tire due to slight gas seepage past the tire valve. Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> and is secured by screwing it onto {{the end of the}} stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal valve caps without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tire valve stems.|$|R

50|$|A sex bolt, (also {{known as}} a barrel nut, barrel bolt, Chicago screw, post and screw or {{connector}} bolt), {{is a type of}} fastener (nut) which has a barrel-shaped flange and protruding boss that is <b>internally</b> <b>threaded.</b> The boss sits within the components being fastened, the flange provides the bearing surface. The sex bolt and accompanying machine screw sit flush {{on either side of the}} surfaces being fastened. It is normally chosen because of its low profile compared to other nuts. The sex bolt often has a built-in feature, such as a slot, to aid in tightening the fastener. Some sex bolts, more commonly known as 'architectural bolts', have knurled barrels to allow one-sided assembly. 'Binding posts' are similar to architectural bolts in that they are designed to be assembled from one side, but they have teeth on the flanged surface to keep them fixed.|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} nut {{is shown}} which permits a fastener to be inserted or removed {{from either side}} with an indicator of fastener engagement. The nut has a plurality of segments, preferably at least three segments, which are <b>internally</b> <b>threaded,</b> spring loaded apart by an internal spring, and has detents on opposite sides which force the nut segments into operative engagements with a threaded member when pushed in and release the segments for quick insertion or removal of the nut when moved out. When the nut is installed, end pressure {{on one of the}} detents presses the nut segments into operative engagement with a threaded member where continued rotation locks the structure together with the detents depressed to indicate positive locking engagement of the nut. On removal, counterclockwise rotation of the nut relieves the endwise pressure on the detents, permitting internal springs to force the detents outward and allowing the nut segments to move outward and separate to permit quick removal of the fastener...|$|R
50|$|A plate nut, {{also known}} as a nut plate, anchor nut or anchor plate, is a stamped sheet metal nut that is usually riveted to a workpiece. They have a long tube that is <b>internally</b> <b>threaded</b> and a plate with two {{clearance}} holes for rivets. The most popular versions have two lugs and they exist as fixed anchor nuts and as floating anchor nuts. The latter allows the nut to move slightly and so enlarges the positioning tolerances of the mounted parts. They were originally developed for the aerospace industry, but are now also common in automotive racing.These nuts are made up of variety of soft and hard materials. The choice of material depends on environment to which nut is subjected. Soft materials like copper or brass are used when nut is used in electrical application. Hard materials are used when nut is subjected to high stress environment. Sometimes stainless steel or nickel-plated nuts are used in order to increase corrosion resistance.|$|R
