50|$|Although modern {{operating}} systems include extensive programming libraries to ease development and promote standardization, home computer {{operating systems}} provided little support to application programs. Professionally written software often switched out the ROM based OS anyway {{to free the}} address space it occupied and maximize RAM capacity. This gave the program full control of the hardware and allowed the programmer to optimize performance for a specific task. Games would often turn off unused I/O ports, {{as well as the}} interrupts that served them. As multitasking was never common on home computers, this practice went largely unnoticed by users. Most software even lacked an <b>exit</b> <b>command,</b> requiring a reboot to use the system for something else.|$|E

50|$|Later BASIC {{versions}} on Commodore {{and other}} platforms included a DELETE and RENUMBER command, {{as well as}} an AUTO line numbering command that would automatically select and insert line numbers according to a selected increment. In addition, all variables are treated as global variables. Clearly defined loops are hard to create, often causing the programmer to rely on the GOTO command (this was later rectified in BASIC 3.5 with the addition of the DO, LOOP, WHILE, UNTIL, and <b>EXIT</b> <b>commands).</b> Flag variables often needed to be created to perform certain tasks. Earlier BASICs from Commodore also lack debugging commands, meaning that bugs and unused variables are hard to trap.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} to render a Sartrean existentialistic analysis of No Exit. Although drama {{was only a}} small part of Jean Paul Sartre’s remarkable oeuvre that included the central texts of French existentialism- the philosophical movement that he named and spearheaded- in the forms of novels, essays, and an almost continual stream of articles, Sartre is unique among philosophers in illustrating his ideas in literary works. Of his nine plays No Exit is centrally important both as a crucial text applying the philosophical precepts that dominated the post World War II era and as a formulation of a new kind of drama that significantly influenced the theater in the second half of the 20 th century. No Exit is one of philosophy’s most profound contributions to the theater and all of Samuel Beckett’s major plays, and by extension the theater of the absurd, ultimately derive from it. No <b>Exit</b> therefore <b>commands</b> attention as a vehicle for its influential ideas and its dramatic methods that established possibilities for the drama. No Exit and the ideas that gave birth to it derived from Sartre’s attempt to make sense of the moral and metaphysical implications of the German occupation of France during World War II. Although Sartre is most well known for his straightforward philosophical analysis in Being and Nothingness, his arguments and theories are conveniently summarized in his novels, short stories, and plays. No Exit was written one year after Being and Nothingness. As a result, many of the themes and symbolism in the play support Sartre’s arguments in the larger and longer philosophical work...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{multiple}} windows, command-line systems might offer a menu system involving the modification of a running command script. Suppose a DOS script (or [...] "batch") file Menu.bat contains the following: :StartAfresh [...] <-A line starting with a colon marks a label. ShowMenu.exeUpon initiation of Menu.bat from the command line, ShowMenu presents an on-screen menu, with possible help information, example usages and so forth. Eventually the user makes a selection that requires a command somename to be performed: ShowMenu exits after rewriting the file Menu.bat to contain :StartAfresh ShowMenu.exe CALL C:\Commands\somename.bat GOTO StartAfreshBecause the DOS command interpreter does not compile a script file and then execute it, nor does it read the entire file into memory before starting execution, nor yet rely {{on the content of}} a record buffer, when ShowMenu <b>exits,</b> the <b>command</b> interpreter finds a new command to execute (it is to invoke the script file somename, in a directory location and via a protocol known to ShowMenu), and after that command completes, {{it goes back to the}} start of the script file and reactivates ShowMenu ready for the next selection. Should the menu choice be to quit, the file would be rewritten back to its original state. Although this starting state has no use for the label, it, or an equivalent amount of text is required, because the DOS command interpreter recalls the byte position of the next command when it is to start the next command, thus the re-written file must maintain alignment for the next command start point to indeed be the start of the next command.|$|R
5000|$|Creating {{an object}} usually (but not always) {{involves}} a command {{that begins with}} the mnemonic [...] "CRT". So, to create a job description you would prompt the CRTJOBD command. User profiles would be created with the CRTUSRPRF command. Similarly changing objects is done by prompting commands preceded by [...] "CHG" [...] (CHGJOBD, CHGUSRPRF, etc.), deleting an object uses [...] "DLT" [...] (DLTJOBD, DLTUSRPRF, etc.), displaying an object uses [...] "DSP" [...] (DSPJOBD, DSPUSRPRF, etc.), and working {{with a set of}} objects uses [...] "WRK" [...] (WRKJOBD, WRKUSRPRF, etc.). To view a generic set of objects in a library use the DSPOBJD command. WRKOBJ can be used to view objects in multiple libraries. The AS/400 command structure focuses on ease of use. In order to view all the objects that the verb portion of an AS/400 command can work ("WRK") upon the [...] "go cmdWRK" [...] where [...] "WRK" [...] may be any of the verbs current and future [...] "CHG","DLT","DSP","EDT","INZ","PRT" [...] etc. Parameters for the command can be displayed by simply typing the command name and pressing F4 or by typing the command name on an AS/400 command line. This will prompt a standard SAA panel providing prompt information for each parameter the command can accept. The command string can be displayed at any point during prompting by pressing F1u2, which if used to <b>exit</b> from the <b>command</b> prompting can be utilized by the F9=Retrieve previous command. A help summary for the command and its parameters can be obtained by pressing F1.|$|R
25|$|Mata Nui learns of Bara Magna's past, his creators the Great Beings, and {{his destiny}} to reunite the planet with its moons Aqua Magna and Bota Magna to {{recreate}} the once-plentiful Spherus Magna. He begins his quest by travelling through a maze occupied with booby-traps (using the map he found as a guide), where he uncovers an unstable power source. After convincing the Glatorian and Agori to let him use the prototype robot that they use as their Mega-Village, Mata Nui places the power source, the Mask of Life and his spirit inside it, and as the vessel, begins the process of reuniting Bara Magna with its satellites. Later, Makuta Teridax - in Mata Nui's old body - touches down on Bara Magna after sensing Mata Nui's presence. Planning to conquer the planet and eventually {{the rest of the}} universe, he offers Mata Nui the chance to join him. He refuses, and the two robots do battle. On the ground, several Rahkshi and Skakdi under Teridax's <b>command</b> <b>exit</b> the Matoran Universe via his heel, followed by Tahu, Takanuva and other Toa. The Makuta's forces are soon joined by the Skrall, who together, battle the Glatorian and Agori. Meanwhile, the Mask of Life reduces Tahu into his original Toa Mata form so he can don the Golden Armor; a weapon originally devised to destroy the Makuta species if they were to ever betray Mata Nui. Teridax notices and scatters the armor across the desert with an energy blast. With help from the Glatorian Gresh, Tahu and Takanuva retrieve the armor back from their enemies. When Tahu bestows it, a wave of energy is unleashed that incinerates all the Kraata powering the Rahkshi armor, leaving the Skakdi and Skrall greatly outnumbered. Mata Nui notices Teridax's hesitation in sensing the loss of his Rahkshi and sees a chance to swing his body into the oncoming path of a rock fragment from Aqua Magna. It crashes into the Makuta's head and damages the robot's core processor, killing the tyrant for good. Mata Nui completes his destiny of reforming Spherus Magna, but the strain is too great as his body plummets to the ground. The Toa and Glatorian arrive at the crash-site to find Mata Nui speaking from inside the undamaged Mask of Life. He asks them to seek out the Great Beings as his final wish before deciding to stay dormant within the mask. The Toa, Matoran, Glatorian, Agori and all other beings from both worlds now begin a new life on Spherus Magna.|$|R
