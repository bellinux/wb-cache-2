25|$|Rather's {{reporting}} {{during the}} national mourning period following the Kennedy assassination and subsequent events {{brought him to}} the attention of CBS News management, which rewarded him in 1964 with the network's White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> position.|$|E
25|$|On March 10, 2005, Rather was succeeded on {{an interim}} basis by Face the Nation host and CBS News {{correspondent}} Bob Schieffer. At the time Schieffer took over, it was uncertain {{how long he}} would host the broadcast, whether it would retain its current structure, or instead adopt some kind of multiple host or alternative format. Under Rather in the {{years leading up to}} his retirement, the CBS Evening News trailed its rivals at ABC and NBC by a fairly large margin. White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> John Roberts, and Scott Pelley, his predecessor in that position, were often mentioned as possible successors to Rather when he retired. Jim Axelrod became White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> when Roberts later left for CNN.|$|E

25|$|According to NBC’s Tom Brokaw, {{the network}} {{considered}} hiring him to replace Rather as its White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent,</b> but these plans were scrapped after word was {{leaked to the}} press.

25|$|He founded Toffler Associates, a {{management}} consulting company, {{and was a}} visiting scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation, visiting professor at Cornell University, faculty member of the New School for Social Research, a White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent,</b> and a business consultant.

5000|$|President Obama also {{joked about}} this subject. In his speech for the White <b>House</b> <b>Correspondents</b> Association Dinner on May 9, 2009, he said Mr Cheney was very busy {{working on his}} memoirs, {{tentatively}} titled, How to Shoot Friends and Interrogate People, [...] a humorous allusion to the self-help classic How to Win Friends and Influence People. [...] President Obama also joked about the incident in his final White <b>House</b> <b>Correspondents</b> Association Dinner as President, in 2016, when he thanked his Vice President Joe Biden [...] "for not shooting anybody in the face".|$|R
25|$|Wallace {{began his}} network journalism career with NBC in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years, as a {{reporter}} with WNBC-TV in New York City. Wallace then transferred to NBC's Washington bureau as a political correspondent for NBC News, and later served as Washington co-anchor and news reader for the Today show in 1982. He also served as chief White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> (1982–89), anchor of the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News (1982-1984, 1986-1987), and moderator of Meet the Press (1987–88).|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Hume would retire as anchor of Special Report {{at the end of the}} year, but he would remain on Fox News in a different role. On December 23, 2008, he hosted his final episode as anchor of Special Report, announcing that Bret Baier, then the chief White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> for Fox News, would be his replacement. Hume also announced that he would remain with Fox News as a senior political analyst and regular panelist for the program Fox News Sunday.|$|E
25|$|This move, and the {{addition}} of then-White <b>House</b> <b>correspondent</b> Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, 60 Minutes became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.|$|E
50|$|He was posthumously {{honored by}} the White <b>House</b> <b>Correspondents</b> Association at their May 3, 2014 dinner. The WHCA created a {{scholarship}} in his memory, and President Barack Obama noted his pioneering journalism.|$|R
