Optimal hedging and firm value are explicitly linked to firm risk, the type of debt covenants and the relative priority of the <b>hedging</b> <b>contract.</b> It is shown that in some cases hedging is possible only if the counterparty to the forward contract also holds {{a significant portion of the}} debt. Also, the spread in the <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> reduces the optimal amount of hedging to less than the minimum-variance hedge ratio. Among other results this article elucidates why some firms <b>hedge</b> using forward <b>contracts</b> while other firms hedge in the futures markets, as well as why higher priority forward contracts are more efficient hedging vehicles.

50|$|Prices in {{the spot}} market are highly {{volatile}} and the spot price can spike {{to several hundred}} times the average price for short periods. Therefore, buyers and sellers wish to lock in energy prices through financial <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts.</b> Under a “contract for differences” the purchaser (typically an electricity retailer) agrees to purchase a specified physical quantity of energy from the spot market at a set price (the “strike price”). If the actual price paid in the spot market by the purchaser {{is higher than the}} strike price, the counterparty to the contract (typically an electricity generator or a financial institution) pays the purchaser the difference in cost. Conversely, if the price paid is lower than the strike price, the purchaser pays the counterparty the difference.|$|E
50|$|Fuel hedging is a {{contractual}} tool {{some large}} fuel consuming companies, such as airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies, use {{to reduce their}} exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. A fuel hedge contract is a futures contract that allows a fuel-consuming company to establish a fixed or capped cost, via a commodity swap or option. The companies enter into <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> to mitigate their exposure to future fuel prices that may be higher than current prices and/or to establish a known fuel cost for budgeting purposes. If such a company buys a fuel swap {{and the price of}} fuel declines, the company will effectively be forced to pay an above-market rate for fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then-lower cost.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal bidding {{strategy}} (supply function) for a generator offering power into a wholesale electricity market. The model has three characteristics: the uncertainties facing the generator are {{described by a}} single probability function, namely the market distribution function; the supply function to be chosen is nondecreasing but need not be smooth; the objective function is the expected profit which can be formulated as a Stieltjes integral along the generator's supply curve. In previous work the market distribution function has been assumed smooth, but in practice this assumption may not be satisfied. This paper focuses on {{the case that the}} market distribution function is not continuous, and hence an optimal supply function may not exist. We consider a modified optimization problem and show the existence of an optimal solution for this problem. Then we show constructively how such an optimum can be approximated with an epsilon-optimal supply function by undercutting when the generator does not hold a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> (and possibly overcutting when the generator has a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract).</b> Our results substantially extend previous work on the market distribution model...|$|R

When a seller observes that the hedge {{is likely to}} become a liability for her, it reduces her incentives to exert unobservable risk-prevention effort. Hedging can thus generate endogenous counterparty risk. To avoid such risk, the protection buyer may prefer to give up some insurance to maintain the seller’s incentives. Variation margins, compelling the protection seller to liquidate some of her risky positions after bad news, relax the incentive problem.

40|$|We analyze optimal <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> {{and show}} that {{although}} hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the protection seller. This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking.

40|$|Abstract: Risk {{management}} {{is a central}} function of banks. Our model examines how banks use this ability to shift risk away from entrepreneurs. To create incentive compatibility, banks must assume some of the entrepreneurial risks, e. g. by underwriting OTC <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> or granting loans. The arising bankruptcy risk causes potential contagion. A conflict of interest emerges because banks prefer a diversified customer portfolio, whereas customers attach more importance to getting adequate contracts from the bank. We show that this conflict cannot be overcome by contractual arrangements between customer and bank. Therefore, banking regulation is desirable to reduce welfare losses. We identify three fundamental instruments for regulation...|$|E

40|$|I model an {{entangled}} {{financial system}} in which banks hedge their portfolio risks using over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. However, banks choose not to hedge counterparty risk, and thus the idiosyncratic failure of a bank {{can lead to a}} systemic run of lenders. An inefficiency arises because banks engage in a version of risk shifting through the network externalities created by OTC contracts. Banks do not take into account that the costly hedging of low-probability counterparty risk also benefits other banks. In the model, it is welfare improving to tax OTC contracts to finance a bailout fund. (JEL G 22, G 28) Modern financial institutions are entangled in a network of bilateral <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts,</b> such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.

40|$|Regardless of {{the form}} of restructuring, {{deregulated}} electricity industries share one common feature: {{the absence of any}} significant, rapid demand-side response to the wholesale (or, spot market) price. For a variety of reasons, electricity industries continue to charge most consumers an average cost based on regulated retail tariff from the era of vertical integration, even as the retailers themselves are forced to purchase electricity at volatile wholesale prices set in open markets. This results in considerable price risk for retailers, who are sometimes forbidden by regulators from signing <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts.</b> More importantly, because end-users do not perceive real-time (or even hourly or daily) fluctuations in the wholesale price of electricity, they have no incentive to adjust their consumption in response to price signals. Consequently, demand for electricity is highly inelastic, and electricity generation resources can be stretched to the point where system stability is threatened. This, then, facilitates many other problems associated with electricity markets, such as market power and price volatility. Indeed, economic theory suggests that even modestly price-responsive demand can remove the stress on generation resources and decrease spot prices. To test this theory, we use actual generator bid data from the New York control area to construct supply stacks, and intersect them with demand curves of various slopes to approximate different levels of demand elasticity. We then estimate the potential impact of real-time pricing on the equilibrium spot price and quantity. These results indicate the immediate benefits that could be derived from a more price-elastic demand. Such analysis can provide policymakers with a measure of how effective price-elastic demand can potentially reduce prices and maintain consumption within the capability of generation resources...|$|E
