5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire {{was about to make}} its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated by <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had seen and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> asked for; he wanted a status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E
5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

25|$|DeWyze, who had {{released}} {{two independent}} albums before winning the ninth season of American Idol, made his major-label debut with Live It Up in 2010. Released under RCA Records, {{it went on}} to become the worst-selling and lowest-charting debut album by a winner of the series. DeWyze has since expressed dissatisfaction with the album and said that winning American Idol did not turn out to be <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had thought it would be.|$|E
25|$|Novalis, who {{was deeply}} read in science, law, philosophy, {{politics}} and political economy, started writing quite early. He left {{an abundance of}} notes on these fields and his early work displays his ease and familiarity with them. His later works are closely connected to his studies and his profession. Novalis collected <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had learned, reflected upon it and drew connections {{in the sense of}} an encyclopaedic overview on art, religion and science. These notes from the years 1798 and 1799 are called Das allgemeine Brouillon, now available in English under the title Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia.|$|E

25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suspected he ought to be.|$|E
25|$|It {{was about}} this time that his wife's {{property}} had to be separately secured to her, and he seems by degrees to have had to sell <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owned; but, as he never lacked powerful and generous patrons, this was of small importance to him. In the same year he wrote a ballad, Les Rieurs du Beau-Richard, and {{this was followed by}} many small pieces of occasional poetry addressed to various personages from the king downwards. Fouquet fell out of favour with the king and was arrested. La Fontaine, like most of Fouquet's literary protégés, showed some fidelity to him by writing the elegy Pleurez, Nymphes de Vaux.|$|E
25|$|In Cassius Dio’s account Caesar, who was {{governor}} in Hispania in 60 BC, considered his governorship as stepping-stone to the consulship. He left Hispania in a hurry, {{even before his}} successor arrived, to get to Rome {{in time for the}} elections. He sought the office before holding his triumph as {{it was too late to}} celebrate this before the elections. He was refused the triumph though Cato’s opposition. Caesar gave up the triumph, thinking that he could celebrate greater exploits if he was elected consul. He entered the city to canvass for office. He courted Crassus and Pompey so skilfully that he won them over, even though they were still hostile to each other, had their political clubs and ‘each opposed <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw the other wished’.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to Kantakouzenos' {{proclamation}} {{caused a}} rift in Byzantine society, {{with the rich}} and powerful land-holding magnates (traditionally called the dynatoi, the [...] "powerful ones") who dominated the countryside quickly rallying to support him, while the ordinary population, often living in abject conditions and suffering under oppressive taxation, supported the Empress-dowager and the Patriarch. Apokaukos was especially quick to capitalize upon this division and foment popular dislike for the aristocracy, by widely publicizing the immense wealth confiscated from Kantakouzenos' and his supporters' houses and estates. In the words of Donald Nicol, [...] "it was against him [...] and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stood for as a millionaire and landowning aristocrat that the people rose up. 'Kantakouzenism' became their war cry, the slogan of their discontent".|$|E
500|$|After Congress suspends the Public Land Act bill to {{investigate}} Long's profiteering ethics and sending {{the animals to}} return to their natural habitats, Evan is finally reinstated as a congressman and celebrates this event by shaving his beard, changing back into his regular clothes, and going on a long-promised hiking trip to Prestige Crest, which was finally restored to its original creation with its abundant in trees and lush fields. When God reappears once again during the hike, Evan is initially disappointed as he realizes he should never have needed to build the ark since the flood had only happened due to the ill-fated dam. However, God reassures Evan that he now has a perfect life as well as <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had originally prayed for and that this would not have happened otherwise in the future. Evan is happy to realize this, as God informs him that the right way to change the world is by doing one Act of Random Kindness (ARK) at a time. During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: [...] "Thou shalt do the dance." [...] This is later followed by footage depicting the film's cast and crew members dancing to C+C Music Factory's hit song [...] "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)." ...|$|E

5000|$|Seattle Reign FC and U.S. women's {{national}} {{soccer team}} player Megan Rapinoe knelt during {{the national anthem}} in a game on September 5, explaining that her decision was a [...] "nod to Kaepernick and <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> standing for right now". In a subsequent match at the Washington Spirit, Spirit owner Bill Lynch — anticipating Rapinoe's protest — moved the national anthem's performance without warning or notice to occur before the players' appearances on the pitch. Jeff Plush, the league's commissioner, {{was present at the}} game and told reporters <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unaware of Lynch's plans and disagreed with the act of moving the anthem's performance. The Spirit's players issued a joint statement also disagreeing with Lynch's decision to move the anthem without first consulting the team's players or coaches.|$|R

Visibly upset by this, Tess places a jamming device into her necklace to disrupt the signal, but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owns. In the episode [...] "Requiem", it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries. In [...] "Turbulence", Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she read one of Lionel Luthor's journals that identified Clark as [...] "The Traveler", but her effort failed. In the episode [...] "Eternal", it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude, and in [...] "Injustice" [...] a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because the voice was instructing her to do so. In the season eight finale, the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville.|$|E
500|$|The third {{attempt to}} poison Litvinenko {{took place at}} around 5pm of 1 November in the Millennium Hotel in Grosvenor Square. The bus he {{travelled}} in to the hotel had no signs of radioactivity – but large amounts had been detected at the hotel. Polonium was subsequently found in a fourth-floor room and in a cup in the Pine Bar at the hotel. After the Millennium bar, Litvinenko stopped {{at the office of}} Boris Berezovsky. He used a fax machine, where radioactive contamination was found later. At 6pm, Akhmed Zakayev picked Litvinenko up and brought him home to Muswell Hill. The amount of radioactivity left by Litvinenko in the car was so significant that the car was rendered unusable. <b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> touched at home during the next three days [...] was contaminated. His family was unable to return to the house even six months later. His wife tested positive for ingesting polonium, but did not leave a secondary trail behind her. This suggested that anyone who left a trail could not have picked up the polonium from Litvinenko (possibly, including Lugovoy and Kovtun). The patterns and levels of radioactivity the assassins left behind suggested that Litvinenko ingested polonium, whereas Lugovoy and Kovtun handled it directly. The human body dilutes polonium before excreting it in sweat, which results in a reduced radioactivity level. There were also traces of Po-210 found at the Hey Jo/Abracadabra bar, Dar Marrakesh restaurant, and Lambeth-Mercedes taxis.|$|E
500|$|Rutherford's {{confrontation}} with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness {{of his personality}} and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played [...] "hard-fisted church politics" [...] and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At {{the heart of his}} opponents' complaints was his [...] "autocratic" [...] behavior as he strove to [...] "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs." [...] Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, [...] "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested in the Truth throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord." [...] Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and [...] "did <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter".|$|E

500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. <b>Everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E
