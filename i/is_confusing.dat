25|$|Suzuki {{reportedly}} {{was involved}} with some anti-war activities during World War II, but according to David Chadwick, the record <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> and, at most, his actions were low-key. However, considering the wholesale enthusiastic {{support for the war}} expressed by the entire religious establishment in Japan at the time, this fact is significant in showing something of the character of the man.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the current}} systems have three {{different}} formations in each third, defending, middle, and attacking. The goal is to outnumber the other team {{in all parts of}} the field but to not completely wear out all the players on the team using it before the full ninety minutes are up. So the one single number <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> as it may not actually look like a 4–2–1–3 when a team is defending or trying to gain possession. In a positive attack it may look exactly like a 4–2–1–3.|$|E
25|$|The term heterophobia <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> {{for some}} people for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of {{victimology}} in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E

25|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} Pelorosaurus and Cetiosaurus, {{as noted by}} reviewers {{including}} Taylor and Naish, <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> to the extreme. In 1842 Owen named several species of Cetiosaurus. Among them was Cetiosaurus brevis, based on several specimens from the early Cretaceous Period. Some of these, four caudal vertebrae, BMNH R2544–2547, and three chevrons, BMNH R2548–2550, found around 1825 by John Kingdon near Cuckfield in the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation of the Hastings Beds, belonged to sauropods. Others however, among them perhaps the present specimen BMNH R10390 found near Sandown Bay on the Isle of Wight and BMNH R2133 and R2115 found near Hastings, actually belonged to some member of the Iguanodontidae. Noticing Owen's mistake in assigning iguanodont bones to Cetiosaurus, in 1849 comparative anatomist Alexander Melville renamed the sauropod bones Cetiosaurus conybeari.|$|E
25|$|Scotland under King James V (reigned 1513–1542) {{was in a}} {{state of}} unrest. Amongst the rebels were Douglas (Elena's father), Rodrigo (to whom she has been betrothed) and Malcolm (whom she loves). The King is in the habit of going about his lands {{disguised}} as Uberto. Seeing Elena he instantly falls in love with her, but she repels his advances stating that he <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> hospitality and friendship for romantic interest. In the meantime he has realised that she is related to his enemies. The clans gather to overthrow the king, and Rodrigo and Douglas discover Elena's secret love for Malcolm. She tries to keep the peace, but the call to arms diverts the soldiers. The battle does not go well, and Rodrigo is killed. Again the king in disguise encounters Elena and gives her a ring to take to the king if she is ever in trouble. She decides to use it and goes to Stirling Castle where she finds that both Malcolm and Douglas are prisoners. She pleads their cases, and the king magnanimously pardons them and blesses the union, now unimpeded by Rodrigo, between Elena and Malcolm.|$|E
25|$|During the 1050s and 1060s, {{there were}} two centres of Norman power in {{southern}} Italy: one at Melfi (under the Hautevilles) and another at Aversa (under the Drengots). Richard Drengot became ruler of the County of Aversa in 1049, beginning a policy of territorial aggrandisement to compete with his Hauteville rivals. At first he warred with his Lombard neighbours, who included Pandulf VI of Capua, Atenulf I of Gaeta and Gisulf II of Salerno. Richard pushed back the borders of Salerno until there was little left of the once-great principality but the city of Salerno itself. Although he tried to extend his influence peacefully by betrothing his daughter to the oldest son of Atenulf of Gaeta, when the boy died before the marriage he still demanded the Lombard dower from the boy's parents. When the duke refused, Richard seized Aquino (one of Gaeta's few remaining fiefs) in 1058. However, the chronology of his conquest of Gaeta <b>is</b> <b>confusing.</b> Documents from 1058 and 1060 refer to Jordan (Richard's oldest son) as Duke of Gaeta, but these have been disputed as forgeries (since Atenulf was still duke {{when he died in}} 1062). After Atenulf's death, Richard and Jordan took over the rule of the duchy and allowed Atenulf's heir—Atenulf II—to rule as their subject until 1064 (when Gaeta was fully incorporated into the Drengot principality). Richard and Jordan appointed puppet, usually Norman, dukes.|$|E

500|$|The {{common use}} of [...] "dwarf" [...] to mean main {{sequence}} <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> in another way, {{because there are}} dwarf stars which are not main-sequence stars. For example, a white dwarf is the dead core of a star that is left after the star has shed its outer layers, that is much smaller than a main-sequence star, {{roughly the size of}} Earth. These represent the final evolutionary stage of many main-sequence stars.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the FMCSA {{changed the}} rules again, {{practically}} eliminating the split sleeper berth provision. Drivers are now required to take a full 8hours of rest, with 2hours allowed for off-duty periods, {{for a total of}} 10hours off-duty. This provision forced drivers to take one longer uninterrupted period of rest, but eliminated the flexibility of allowing drivers to take naps during the day without jeopardizing their driving time. Today's rule still allows them to [...] "split" [...] the sleeper berth period, but one of the splits must be 8hours long and the remaining 2hours do not stop the 14-hour on-duty period. This rule <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> and impractical for most drivers, resulting in the majority of drivers taking the full 10-hour break.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{cites the}} lyrics to the first bridge – [...] "But if I seem to act unkind / It's only me, it's not my mind / That <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> things" [...] – {{as an example of}} Harrison {{applying}} an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as [...] "contradictions between different levels of being". In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind is the thing that hops about telling us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E

500|$|Sukumar {{then began}} working on the script of Jagadam (2007), a crime film {{starring}} Ram Pothineni and Isha Sahni. Unlike Arya, Jagadam focused more on violence and {{in an interview with}} South Scope, Sukumar called the film an [...] "act of bravado", adding that he [...] "made it with an innocent passion", without thinking about the audience's response. Jagadam received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure. While Sify called the film a [...] "not so much a plot-driven film" [...] albeit praising the work of its technical crew, Rediff called it a [...] "good effort". He then wrote and directed Arya 2 (2009), which was promoted as the namesake sequel of his debut Arya. It featured Allu Arjun, Kajal Aggarwal, and Navdeep in the lead roles and narrated the story of Arya, a psychotic orphan whose love for his friend Ajay and his colleague Geetha is never reciprocated. Sify called it Sukumar's [...] "another celluloid misadventure" [...] after Jagadam and stated that he [...] "fails both as a writer and director as his plotline <b>is</b> <b>confusing</b> and his hero's characterization is negative". However, Arya 2 became one of the few successful Telugu films of the year, and was praised for its style quotient and music. Sukumar received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Director– Telugu at the 57th Filmfare Awards South ceremony, but lost it to S. S. Rajamouli for Magadheera. Rajamouli stated that he regards Sukumar as the best of the lot after watching Arya 2, which was Sukumar's [...] "most precious and sweetest thing I have heard about myself".|$|E

2500|$|From {{the outset}} the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant {{specifically}} prejudice against Jews.
