2500|$|One issue {{related to}} the shift of {{employment}} to countries with an overall younger population {{has to do with}} the dependency ratio in differing countries. The dependency ratio is an age-population ratio of those typically not in the labor force (the <b>dependent</b> <b>part)</b> and those typically in the labor force (the productive part). [...] A high dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country if a large proportion of a government's expenditure is on health, social security & education, which are most used by the youngest and the oldest in a population. [...] The fewer people of working age, the fewer the people who can support schools, retirement pensions, disability pensions and other assistances to the youngest and oldest members of a population, often considered the most vulnerable members of society.|$|E

Furthermore, we give a simple calculational method for evaluating the temperature <b>dependent</b> <b>parts</b> of the retarded vertex functions, to one loop, by identifying them with the forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal particles. As an application of the method, we calculate and show that the temperature <b>dependent</b> <b>parts</b> of all the retarded functions vanish at one loop order for 1 + 1 dimensional massless QED.

If he does, and if fatally, by his temerity and our weakness, he should succeed; then I say he will throw the whole empire {{from one end}} of it to the other into mortal convulsions.

He has however a douceur for Ireland in his pocket; benefits in trade, by opening the woollen manufacture to that nation. A very right idea in my opinion; but not more strong in reason, than likely to be opposed by the most powerful and most violent of all local prejudices and popular passions. First, a fire is already kindled by his schemes of taxation in America; he then proposes one which will set all Ireland in a blaze; and his way of quenching both is by a plan which may kindle perhaps ten times a greater flame in Britain.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hough voting methods {{efficiently}} {{handle the}} high complexity of multiscale, category-level object detection in cluttered scenes. The primary weakness {{of this approach}} is however that mutually dependent local observations are independently voting for intrinsically global object properties such as object scale. All the votes are added up to obtain object hypotheses. The assumption is thus that object hypotheses are a sum of independent part votes. Popular representation schemes are, however, based on an overlapping sampling of semi-local image features with large spatial support (e. g. SIFT or geometric blur). Features are thus mutually dependent and we incorporate these dependences into probabilistic Hough voting by presenting an objective function that combines three intimately related problems: i) grouping of mutually <b>dependent</b> <b>parts,</b> ii) solving the correspondence problem conjointly for <b>dependent</b> <b>parts,</b> and iii) finding concerted object hypotheses using extended groups rather than based on local observations alone. Experiments successfully demonstrate that state-of-the-art Hough voting and even sliding windows are significantly improved by utilizing part dependences and jointly optimizing groups, correspondences, and votes. ...|$|R
