25|$|Feynman was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> {{that all}} of quantum {{mechanics}} can be gleaned from carefully thinking through {{the implications of this}} single experiment. He also proposed (as a thought experiment) that if detectors were placed before each slit, the interference pattern would disappear.|$|E
25|$|He was {{conservative}} by nature, and {{his life}} was spent in defending the Reformed theology as {{set forth in the}} Westminster Confession of Faith and Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechisms. He was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that Princeton had never originated a new idea; but this meant no more than that Princeton was the advocate of historical Calvinism in opposition to the modified and provincial Calvinism of a later day. And it is true that Hodge must be classed among the great defenders of the faith, rather than among the great constructive minds of the Church. He had no ambition to be epoch-making by marking the era of a new departure. But he earned a higher title to fame in that he was the champion of his Church's faith during a long and active life, her trusted leader in time of trial, and {{for more than half a}} century the most conspicuous teacher of her ministry. Hodges' understanding of the Christian faith and of historical Protestantism is given in his Systematic Theology.|$|E
500|$|He was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that [...] proofs [...] "really aren't {{there to}} {{convince}} you that something is truethey're there to show you why it is true." [...] The Notices of the American Mathematical Society called him [...] "one of the quiet giants of twentieth-century mathematics, the consummate professor dedicated to scholarship, teaching, and service in equal measure." ...|$|E
60|$|MISS BEECH. And suppose--only suppose--she's <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> you, and <b>says</b> she'll never change.|$|R
60|$|And last, not least, good-by to Tommie? No. The writer gave Tommie {{his dinner}} not {{half an hour}} since, and is too <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him to <b>say</b> good-by.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>fond</b> you are <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> {{dangerous}} things, Harry! In {{the present}} instance you are quite astray. I like the Duchess very much, but I don't love her." ...|$|R
500|$|She was {{attached}} to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, {{she said she did}} not believe in extramarital sex and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying [...] "I wasn't a wild woman". However, she was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> she used the emotion and energy instead on her work. [...] "People don't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways", she wrote in her autobiography.|$|E
500|$|Bush was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that [...] "if he {{made any}} {{important}} contribution {{to the war effort}} at all, it would be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." [...] He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush [...] "impatient" [...] and [...] "vain", but said he was [...] "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.|$|E
500|$|Peckinpah's {{intake of}} alcohol {{increased}} dramatically while making The Getaway, {{and he was}} <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He and McQueen got into occasional heated arguments during filming. The director recalled one such incident {{on the first day}} of rehearsal in San Marcos: [...] "Steve and I had been discussing some point on which we disagreed, so he picked up this bottle of champagne and threw it at me. I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns." [...] It was McQueen's idea to have his character shoot and blow up a squad car in the scene where Doc holds two police officers at gunpoint.|$|E
5000|$|... "Listen to the Mocking Bird" [...] {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular ballads of the era and sold more than twenty million copies of sheet music. It was popular during the American Civil War and was used as marching music. Abraham Lincoln was {{especially}} <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>saying,</b> [...] "It is as sincere as the laughter of a little girl at play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was always}} the same with Patty Comfort," [...] said Mrs. Ray. [...] "She had a way <b>of</b> making people <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her. They <b>say</b> that she can do just what she likes with the old gentleman at the Grange." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it not?' said Charlotte. 'But I am {{sure you}} don't like Guy. And I can't think why not, unless it is the deadly feud, for we are all so <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him. Laura <b>says</b> it is a {{different}} house since he came.' ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{attending}} {{grade school}} in Los Angeles during the 1930s, Teague built model airplanes {{before turning to}} hot rods, since his schoolmates included Ed Iskendarian (who became a drag racer), and land speed racer Stuart Hilborn, {{as well as other}} car enthusiasts. He participated in time trials on a dry lake northeast of Los Angeles and was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that he [...] "had a little gasoline in his blood." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the great}} {{biological}} controversies {{of the day was}} [...] "what is life?" [...] One school of thought was mechanism, which believed that there is no essential difference {{between a rock and a}} human life—it's simply a matter of the chemistry involved. If all the chemical reactions were known, we would understand what makes life. The mechanists were <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> things like, [...] "the brain secretes thoughts in the same way that the kidneys secrete urine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though small, {{the lake}} was a {{permanent}} source of water which was a rarity on the porous Kaibab Limestone. Known to some as the [...] "waterless mountain," [...] in pioneer days the Kaibab was called the [...] "Buckskin Mountain," [...] but the name itself is a Paiute word meaning [...] "mountain inside out," [...] or [...] "mountain lying down." [...] However, Jacob Lake's situation and permanent water made it an important stopping place for travelers moving from Utah into Arizona. Despite its diminutive size, locals are <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that Jacob Lake [...] "waters more deer than the entire Pacific Ocean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like Tom. He {{gave me my}} Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him: he <b>says</b> Tom has {{excellent}} principles. It {{was through}} him {{that his father was}} able to pay all his debts before he died." ...|$|R
5000|$|Albert has {{a love of}} fishing, and has {{travelled}} {{around the}} world to pursue his hobby, but is particularly <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> Scotland, <b>saying,</b> [...] "For me, the Highlands and islands of Scotland are paradise. I can have whole days where I catch nothing, but I still enjoy every second. I am a lover of nature and fishing allows me access {{to some of the most}} beautiful and secluded spots in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, is not it, Laura? {{and he says}} he is so grieved to see us {{turned against}} Philip, after being so <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> him; he <b>says</b> it makes him feel as if he had supplanted him, and that he is quite thankful to you for taking his part still.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Buckland {{developed}} {{a reputation as one}} of the infant film industry's great artists, as reflected in the following 1918 newspaper report:"Among the producing firms who belong to the class where imagination is based upon culture, are those associated with Paramount. [...] For a long time, now, picture play reviewers have been <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> 'up to the usual Paramount standard.' That standard to [...] a large extent has been raised higher and higher by the Wilfred Buckland whose name appears in front of all the Lasky pictures. Such men as Cecil DeMille, William DeMille, J. Searle Dawley, Maurice Tourneur, Joseph Kaufman, Robert Vignola, Robert Thorley, Marshal Neilan, Thomas H. Ince, J. Stuart Blackton and the others who produce for Paramount have added their very considerable bit to spelling Art with a capital A in motion pictures, but that is Wilfred Buckland's business exclusively." ...|$|E
2500|$|The year 1973 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the most difficult period of Peckinpah's life and career. While still filming The Getaway in El Paso, Texas, Peckinpah sneaked across the border into Juarez in April 1972 and married Joie Gould. He had met Gould in England while filming Straw Dogs, and she had since been his companion and a part-time crew member. Peckinpah's intake of alcohol had increased dramatically while making The Getaway, and he became <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I can't direct when I'm sober." [...] He began to have violent mood swings and explosions of rage, at one point assaulting Gould. After four months, she returned to England and filed for divorce. Devastated by the breakup, Peckinpah fell into a self-destructive pattern of almost continuous alcohol consumption, and his health was unstable for the remainder of his life.|$|E
2500|$|Before Manilow's {{association}} with Bette Midler {{began at the}} Continental Baths in New York City in 1971, he recorded four tracks as Featherbed, leading a group of session musicians produced by Tony Orlando. Three of the tracks—"Morning," [...] a ballad; [...] "Amy," [...] a psychedelic-influenced pop song; and {{an early version of}} his own composition [...] "Could It Be Magic"—all flopped on the charts, a fact for which Manilow himself is <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> he is eternally grateful, {{especially in the case of}} the last. That was because the arrangement of [...] "Could It Be Magic" [...] was an uptempo pop tune. Manilow had arranged the tune as a classical piece that slowly built. The fourth tune recorded was [...] "Rosalie Rosie," [...] which was to be the flip side of [...] "Could It Be Magic," [...] but Bell Records went with [...] "Morning" [...] as the flip for Featherbed's second release instead.|$|E
5000|$|In the TV series Ruby Gloom, the {{character}} Poe, a poet crow, {{and his brothers}} Edgar & Allan; if their names are unite, form the name of Edgar Allan Poe; In some occasions, Poe is also <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> claiming, he <b>says</b> be a descendant of Paco, Edgar Allan Poe's pet budgie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' said Merton, 'we must be rapid. These {{children}} are being cruelly ill-treated and deny it. Will you get into talk with the boy, and {{ask him if he}} is <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> his governess, <b>say</b> [...] "Miss Limmer," [...] and notice what he says and how he says it? Then we must pack them away.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mountjoy was too <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her to <b>say</b> more <b>of</b> Lord Harry, {{for that}} day. He {{was careful to}} lead the talk to a topic which might be trusted to provoke no {{agitating}} thoughts. Finding Iris to all appearance established in the doctor's house, he was naturally anxious to know something {{of the person who}} must have invited her--the doctor's wife.|$|R
6000|$|A {{sportive}} {{friend of}} mine, a mighty golfer, is <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "You Radicals {{want to play}} the game without the rules." [...] To which I am accustomed mildly to retort, [...] "Not at all; but we think the rules unfair, and so we want to see them altered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Lind, smiling, [...] "I {{believe she}} is still disengaged; and she professes to be fancy free. She is <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> generally, that she will never marry, and so forth. That is the new fashion with young women--if saying what they dont mean can be called a new fashion." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Duchess of Orleans relates {{that the}} irreverent old calumniator, Marshal Villeroi, {{who in his}} youth had known St. Francis de Sales, said, on hearing him called saint: [...] "I am delighted to hear that Monsieur de Sales is a saint. He was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> indelicate things, and used to cheat at cards. In other respects he was a perfect gentleman, though a fool." ...|$|E
6000|$|VOLTAIRE. [...] "'When I see an Englishman {{subtle and}} <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> lawsuits, I <b>say,</b> [...] "There is a Norman, {{who came in}} with William the Conqueror." [...] When I see a man good-natured and polite, [...] "That is one who came with the Plantagenets;" [...] a brutal character, [...] "That is a Dane:"--for your Nation, Monsieur, {{as well as your}} Language, is a medley of many others.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{he was an}} only child. She is dear mamma's sister. I don't {{remember}} her, for {{she went}} out when I was a baby, but Richard and Margaret were so <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her. They <b>say</b> she used to play with them, and tell them stories, and sing Scotch songs to them. Margaret says the first sorrow of her life was Aunt Flora's going away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have," [...] the {{sergeant}} answered quietly. [...] "I don't {{know whether it}} would suit you, squire, or whether it could be managed; but it does seem, to me, that you have got the very woman close at hand. Aggie has been for two years with Mrs. Walsham, who is a lady in every way. She is very <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the child, and the child is very <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> her. Everyone <b>says</b> she is an excellent teacher. She would be the very woman {{to take charge of}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} that I would tell you a {{falsehood}} about it? What I meant was {{that it is a}} kind of thing one doesn't like talking about, merely because stories are bandied about. People are so <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that this man is engaged to that woman, and of making up tales; and it seems to be so foolish to contradict such things." ...|$|E
60|$|Emily's {{mother had}} died at her birth, but Amelia Phillips, twenty years older than the baby sister, had filled the vacant place so well and with such {{intuitive}} tenderness that Emily had never been conscious of missing a mother. John Phillips, too, the grave, silent, elder brother, loved and petted the child. Woodford people were <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> that John and Amelia spoiled Emily shamefully.|$|E
6000|$|As for Uncle Abimelech's mind, I {{knew that}} he never had been known to change it. But, as he himself was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying,</b> {{there has to be}} a first time for everything, and I had {{determined}} that this was to be the first time for him. I hadn't any idea how I was going to bring it about; but it just had to be done, and I'm not [...] "all Foster" [...] for nothing.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{favourite}} {{place was}} [...] "Orchis Bank," [...] above the quiet Cudham valley, where fly- and musk-orchis grew among the junipers, and Cephalanthera and Neottia under the beech boughs; the little wood [...] "Hangrove," [...] just above this, {{he was also}} <b>fond</b> <b>of,</b> and here I remember his collecting grasses, {{when he took a}} fancy to make out the names of all the common kinds. He was <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> quoting the <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> one of his little boys, who, having found a grass that his father had not seen before, had it laid by his own plate during dinner, remarking, [...] "I are an extraordinary grass-finder!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{your own}} composin', I'll be bound," [...] said Krake, [...] "an' sure it's not bad. It's Scotland you mean, no doubt, by the land across the sea. Ah! I've heard {{much of that}} land. The natives are very <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> it, they <b>say.</b> It must be a fine country. I've heard Irishmen, who have been there, say that if it wasn't for Ireland they'd think it the finest country in the world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Retrospectively, NME {{cited the}} record {{as when the}} band [...] "rediscovered their sense of purpose and ushered in their third great phase" [...] with the {{critically}} acclaimed Journal for Plague Lovers and Postcards from a Young Man following. Bassist Nicky Wire remains <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the album, <b>saying</b> <b>of</b> the pre-Send Away the Tigers period: [...] "It didn't feel like we were a band just before that. We {{were on the verge}} of nothingness and to dig that out of ourselves made us fall in love with music again." ...|$|R
