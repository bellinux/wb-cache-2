5|$|The primary {{determinant}} of infection for any virus {{is its ability}} to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys.

5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown P.semilanceata to {{suppress}} {{the growth of the}} soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, P.semilanceata significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, Psilocybe semilanceata was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the <b>human</b> <b>pathogen</b> methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.|$|E
25|$|Diernhofer {{first used}} the name Streptococcus dysgalactiae in 1932, {{describing}} a streptococcus of veterinary origin. Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the <b>human</b> <b>pathogen</b> Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. Contemporarily, though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory identification method for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus of human origin, and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of animal origin. Accordingly, they were fused to one species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae. However, subsequent molecular investigations indicated heterogeneity within this new species, and in 1996 it was divided into S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae.|$|E

Phytopathogens utilize specific determinants {{that help to}} breach reinforced cell walls and manipulate plant physiology to facilitate the disease process, while <b>human</b> <b>pathogens</b> use determinants for exploiting mammalian physiology and overcoming highly developed adaptive immune responses. Emerging research, however, has highlighted the ability of seemingly dedicated <b>human</b> <b>pathogens</b> to cause plant disease, and specialized plant <b>pathogens</b> to cause <b>human</b> disease. Such microbes represent interesting systems for studying the evolution of cross-kingdom pathogenicity, and the benefits and tradeoffs of exploiting multiple hosts with drastically different morphologies and physiologies. This review will explore cross-kingdom pathogenicity, where plants and humans are common hosts. We illustrate that while cross-kingdom pathogenicity appears to be maintained, the directionality of host association (plant to human, or human to plant) is difficult to determine.

Plectasin, found in Pseudoplectania nigrella, {{is the first}} defensin to be isolated from a fungus. Plectasin has a chemical structure resembling defensins found in spiders, scorpions, dragonflies and mussels. In general, defensins have commonalities in their molecular structure, such as cysteines in the peptide stabilized with disulfide bonds. In particular, defensins from P.nigrella, invertebrates, and plants and share a conformation that has been named the CSαβ motif.

Plectasin has a low toxicity in mice, and cured them of peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S.pneumoniae as efficiently as vancomycin and penicillin, suggesting that it may have therapeutic potential.

2500|$|Pneumocystis was redescribed as a <b>human</b> <b>pathogen</b> in 1942 by two Dutch investigators, van der Meer and Brug, {{who found}} it in three new cases: a 3-month-old infant with {{congenital}} heart disease and in two of 104 autopsy cases - a 4-month-old infant and a 21-year-old adult. There being only one described species in the genus, they considered the human parasite to be P. carinii. Nine years later (1951), Dr. Josef Vanek at Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia, showed {{in a study of}} lung sections from 16 children that the organism labelled [...] "P. carinii" [...] was the causative agent of pneumonia in these children. The following year, Jírovec reported [...] "P. carinii" [...] as the cause of interstitial pneumonia in neonates. Following the realization that Pneumocystis from humans could not infect experimental animals such as rats, and that the rat form of Pneumocystis differed physiologically and had different antigenic properties, Frenkel was the first to recognize the <b>human</b> <b>pathogen</b> as a distinct species. He named it [...] "Pneumocystis jiroveci" [...] (corrected to P. jirovecii - see nomenclature above). Controversy existed over the relabeling of P. carinii in humans as P. jirovecii, which is why both names still appear in publications. However, only the name P. jirovecii is used exclusively for the <b>human</b> <b>pathogen,</b> whereas the name P. carinii has had a broader application to many species. Frenkel and those before him believed that all Pneumocystis were protozoans, but soon afterwards evidence began accumulating that Pneumocystis was a fungal genus. Recent studies show it to be an unusual, in some ways a primitive genus of Ascomycota, related to a group of yeasts. Every tested primate, including humans, appears to have its own type of Pneumocystis that is incapable of cross-infecting other host species and has co-evolved with each species. Currently, only five species have been formally named: P. jirovecii from humans, P. carinii as originally named from rats, P. murina from mice, P. wakefieldiae also from rats, and P. oryctolagi from rabbits.|$|E

The genus Apophysomyces {{was first published in}} 1979 by Misra et al. who isolated A. elegans from soil in northern India. Apophysomyces variabilis was considered to be the same species as Apophysomyces elegans until September 2012 when Alvarez et al. determined that 16 strains of A. elegans were actually a complex of species in the genus Apophysomyces. Based on genetic, physiological, and morphological analyses, the authors concluded that the sixteen environmental and clinical strains of A. elegans could be divided in four clades corresponding to the species; A. elegans, A. trapeziformis, A. ossiformis, and A. variabilis. The species were differentiated based on the sporangiospore shape, [...] type, and apophyseal shape. As well, carbon fixation ability aided in species differentiation with only A. elegans strains being able to assimilate the glycoside esculin. Alvarez et al. analysed three loci: the H3 gene, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear rRNA gene, and the D1 and D2 domains of the 28S rRNA gene. This analysis resulted in a phylogeny containing the four clades. Interestingly, not one of the disease strains that had been identified as [...] "A. elegans" [...] clustered with taxonomically important strains of A. elegans in molecular phylogenetic analyses.
