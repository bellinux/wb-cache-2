He starred as a fullback for the Washington Huskies football team, forming a prolific offensive duo with quarterback Don Heinrich in 1950. <b>He</b> <b>rushed</b> for over 1,000 yards that season, and was the last Huskies player to eclipse that mark until 1977. In a game against rival Washington State, he set school records with 296 rushing yards and five touchdowns. The 296 yards remains a school record as of 2016.|$|E

5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the profusion of passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. <b>He</b> <b>rushed</b> six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage.

When as-Salih Ayyub, who was in Syria at the time, heard of this, <b>he</b> <b>rushed</b> back to Egypt, avoiding Damietta, instead reaching Mansurah. There, he organized an army and raised a commando force which harassed the Crusaders.|$|E

5|$|Payton {{was eager}} to improve his performance. During the 1976 NFL season, Payton rushed for 1,390 yards and scored 13 touchdowns. After the season, he was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} 1977 Pro Bowl, where he was declared the Pro Bowl MVP. The next year, <b>he</b> <b>rushed</b> for 1,852 yards and scored 16 touchdowns, becoming the league’s leading scorer for the season.

Simpson. In that record-setting game against the Vikings, Payton was suffering with a 101-degree fever and intense flu. His longest run was for 58 yards, and he caught one pass for 6 yards. His record stood for 23 years until Corey Dillon of the Cincinnati Bengals ran for 278 yards on October 22, 2000. (Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings set the current record of 296 rushing yards in 2007.) By the end of the decade, Payton had received additional accolades for his exploits as a blocker, receiver, emergency punter, and quarterback.|$|E

His best performance of the season was the final game against the New Orleans Saints, where <b>he</b> <b>rushed</b> for 134 yards on 20 carries. Payton finished the season with only 679 yards and seven touchdowns. However, Payton led the league in yards per kickoff return.|$|E

5|$|Harold {{had spent}} mid-1066 {{on the south}} coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September Harold {{dismissed}} the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion <b>he</b> <b>rushed</b> north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold's army was left in a battered and weakened state.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Eskimos {{utilized}} {{a committee}} of running backs, with McCarty, Daniel Porter, and Jerome Messam all receiving significant playing time.
