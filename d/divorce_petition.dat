5|$|Farmer's wife Rebecca {{filed for}} divorce on April 5, 2011, {{claiming}} in court documents {{that she had no}} access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's <b>divorce</b> <b>petition,</b> contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife asked that the judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E

When the case was {{assigned to one of}} Stephens' former political opponents, his lawyer, State Senator Michael Maloney, withdrew the <b>divorce</b> <b>petition</b> and re-filed it the next day. When the second petition was assigned to a different judge, Stephens' wife's lawyer accused Stephens of judge shopping, alleging the second judge had political connections to both Stephens and Maloney. On appeal, the Fayette County Domestic Relations Commissioner reinstated the original petition, saying Maloney should have asked the judge to recuse himself rather than withdrawing and re-filing the petition. Ultimately, both judges recused themselves from hearing the case, and it was randomly assigned to a third judge, who finalized the divorce on September 28, 1993.|$|E

On February 1, 2007, Houston {{asked the court}} to fast track their divorce. The divorce was finalized on April 24, 2007, with Houston granted custody of the couple's daughter. On May 4, Houston sold the suburban Atlanta home featured in Being Bobby Brown for $1.19 million. A few days later, Brown sued Houston in Orange County, California court in an attempt to change the terms of their custody agreement. Brown also sought child and spousal support from Houston.

In March 2007, Clive Davis of Arista Records announced that Houston would begin recording a new album. In October 2007, Arista released another compilation The Ultimate Collection outside the United States.|$|E

Early New England laws banning {{the sale of}} alcohol to Native Americans were criticised because it was [...] "not fit to deprive Indians of any lawfull comfort aloweth to all men {{by the use of}} wine." [...] Laws banned the practice of individuals toasting each other, with the explanation that it led to wasting God's gift of beer and wine, as well as being carnal. Bounds were not set on enjoying sexuality within the bounds of marriage, as a gift from God. In fact, spouses were disciplined if they did not perform their sexual marital duties, in accordance with 1 Corinthians 7 and other biblical passages. Women and men were equally expected to fulfill marital responsibilities. Women and men could file for divorce based on this issue alone.

40|$|Unbeknownst to soldiers, {{when they}} {{sign on the}} dotted line, {{pledging}} to defend the freedom America stands for, they also sign away their freedom to make decisions regarding their private sex life. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) mandates that a soldier be subject to prosecution for having sexual intercourse {{with someone who is}} not his or her spouse. Although a majority of states have done away with the historical norm of criminalizing adultery, choosing instead to simply use evidence of adultery to support <b>divorce</b> <b>petitions,</b> the military continues to vigorously prosecute adulterous acts. In this regard, the military sees itself as a separate entity from the government, capable of ignoring a soldier 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental right to procedural due process protection. However, as a separate entity, the military should provide greater protection rather than further deprivation. While the military may have justification to limit the fundamental rights of soldiers in some instances, such as freedom of speech, because of military necessity, the criminalization of adultery represents too great an allocation of power when balancing a governmental interest and the individual protections guaranteed by the Constitution...|$|R

40|$|From 1857 (the year of its foundation) to 1923 (the {{year of the}} Matrimonial Causes Act) the Divorce Court {{hosted a}} number of highly-gendered trials. Women <b>petitioning</b> for <b>divorce</b> were legally {{required}} to supply proof of their husband's adultery plus another marital crime (such as cruelty, desertion or bigamy); men had only to demonstrate their wives' sexual infidelity. Yet, despite the historical attention paid to this gendered legal disparity, {{little attention has been}} paid to date on the nature of the extra marital crimes alleged by wives, seeking to free themselves from unsatisfactory marriages. This paper considers women's treatment by the Divorce Court, through examining in detail case studies of allegations of extra marital crimes in <b>divorce</b> <b>petitions.</b> Showing the extent to which these extra marital crimes forced plaintiffs to open up their private lives to the public gaze of the Divorce Court., and subject themselves to the scrutiny, shame, and damage to their respectability that this entailed. This paper will present unique quantitative data surrounding the use of these extra marital crimes in wives’ <b>petitions</b> for <b>divorce</b> between 1909 and 1923, a period that has often been overlooked. This data will be used, alongside the detailed case studies, to argue that during this period, the way that wives navigated their way through the Divorce Court changed. Wives increasingly used the extra marital crime of desertion in their divorce petitions; which was less intrusive into the private realm of the marital home. And decreasingly used the extra marital crime of cruelty; in which the testimony often included more private and shameful details of physical, sexual or mental cruelty...|$|R

Cody filed two <b>divorce</b> <b>petitions,</b> with one newspaper claiming that the cause behind them was Louisa's [...] "nagging." [...] The first filing of divorce was withdrawn due to the death of Orra Cody in 1883. The second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1905, flooding headlines and tearing communities into the crossfire and demanding they pick sides.While the divorce scandal raged on between the two in the courtroom and in the papers, Louisa continued to maintain the house and her living children. When asked to put the suit on hold temporarily in order to attend the funeral of Arta, Louisa refused, demanding that she remain married and the suit be dropped.
