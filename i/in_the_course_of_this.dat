5|$|The Altes Stadthaus is {{arranged}} around two rectangular internal courtyards. The main section, which faces Mühlheimer Platz, has a mansard roof and is framed by four-storey turrets. The main entrance {{is at the}} southwest corner of Bottlerplatz, and the building bridges Windeckstraße, with two low arched openings. Bestelmayer's building was intended to be the nucleus of future development in the centre of Bonn. However, the only other construction there was the tax office on the corner of Mülheimer Platz and Münsterstraße, built in 1937, and some further building on Bottlerplatz. After the Neues Stadthaus—the new city administration building—was built, the main floor of the section of Altes Stadthaus facing Mühlheimer Platz was rebuilt to house the library. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> restructuring, the two courtyards were roofed over and several interior walls replaced with columns.

40|$|CONTEXT: Chronic {{exposure}} to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation {{can result in}} pneumoconiosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We present {{a case of a}} young carpet installer who was diagnosed with silicatosis of the lung. Review of occupational history revealed that the patient had been working as a carpet installer for approximately 15 years, since he was 15 years of age. The patient was exposed to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> his work. DISCUSSION: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation has not been reported as a possible cause of pneumoconiosis. In this article we review different causes of silicatosis and discuss chronic exposure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation and development of pneumoconiosis. In addition, we also review the relevance of mycobacterial infection in cases of silicosis and silicatosis. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL OR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: Exposure to talc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> carpet installation should be added to conditions that can cause pneumoconioses, specifically silicatosis of the lung...|$|R
5|$|The Venetians had a {{possible}} and willing {{ally in the}} person of Junayd, ruler of the Aydinid principality in central western Anatolia. Junayd was a capable and energetic ruler who tried to form a broader anti-Ottoman alliance including the Karamanids of central Anatolia, and to renew the Ottoman civil war by sending another Ottoman prince, Ismail, to Rumelia. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conflict, Murad allied himself with Venice's rival, the Republic of Genoa, to blockade the coasts of Junayd's domain and prevent Ismail from setting sail. Junayd was finally subdued in spring 1425, depriving Venice of any assistance. In February 1424, Murad also concluded a peace with the Byzantines, who returned almost all the lands they had gained in 1403 and, reduced to Constantinople and its environs, became tributary vassals to the Ottomans once more.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September, the {{commander}} of the 104th Brigade, Colonel Ivan Rukljić, took command of all Croatian forces in Varaždin. The Yugoslav Air Force attacked an airfield in Čakovec, mimicking the strike carried out in Varaždin a few days earlier. That evening, the heaviest fighting of the siege erupted in Varaždin, and the 104th Brigade reported it was uncertain how long it would be able to maintain the blockades. Croatian forces received additional weapons that day, after the JNA garrisons in Čakovec, Križevci and Virovitica surrendered to the ZNG. In Varaždin itself, corps-level units of the JNA 32nd Corps based at the 15. maj barracks also surrendered to the ZNG that day. The following day, fighting intensified again, as Croatian forces captured several minor JNA facilities in Varaždin itself—leaving the Corps headquarters, the Kalnički partizani barracks and the Jalkovečke žrtve barracks as the only JNA-held military bases in the city. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fighting, the ZNG suffered one fatality and captured nine JNA officers and 30 soldiers.|$|E
