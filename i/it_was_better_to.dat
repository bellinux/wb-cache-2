5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> mount an {{aggressive}} defence {{given the lack}} of any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option would be to attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> build fear.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were {{intended}} as improved {{versions of the}} s, but were recast as battlecruisers after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, saw no real need for more battleships. A number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to {{the bulk of the}} Grand Fleet's battlecruisers so the design was revised to counter these. The class was going to consist of , Anson, Howe, and Rodney—all names of famous Admirals—but the latter three ships were suspended as the material and labour required to complete them was needed for higher-priority merchantmen and escort vessels. Their designs were updated to incorporate the lessons from the Battle of Jutland, but the Admiralty eventually decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> begin again with a clean-slate design so they were cancelled in 1919.|$|E

5|$|The Admiral-class battlecruisers were to {{have been}} a class of four British Royal Navy battlecruisers {{designed}} near the end of World War I. Their design began as an improved version of the s, but it was recast as a battlecruiser after Admiral John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, pointed out that there was no real need for more battleships, but that a number of German battlecruisers had been laid down that were superior to the bulk of the Grand Fleet's battlecruisers and the design was revised to counter these.

No more battlecruisers would be built due to the arms limitations agreements of the interbellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt a crackdown by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Tory leaders {{scheduled}} a leadership convention for December. In early November, the Suez crisis erupted. Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson {{played a major}} part in the settlement of that dispute, and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role. Diefenbaker, as the Tories' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race, gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez. The Tories attacked Pearson for, as they said, being an errand boy for the United States government; he responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> be such a lackey than to be an obedient colonial doing Britain's will unquestioningly. While Suez would come to be regarded by many {{as one of the}} finest moments in Canadian foreign policy, at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, taking with them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E

25|$|Frederick the Great, king of Prussia 1740–86, modernized the Prussian army, {{introduced}} new tactical {{and strategic}} concepts, fought mostly successful wars and doubled {{the size of}} Prussia. Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> negotiate and make peace than to fight him.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{continuing}} the Amiens battle {{past the point}} of initial success, as had been done so many times in the past, the Allies shifted their attention elsewhere. Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.|$|E
25|$|The line {{originally}} {{opened to}} provide access from the centre for the new residential areas {{in the eastern part}} of city, along the right bank of the Neva River. However, delays in the construction of the future Frunzensko-Primorskaya Line (Line 5), compelled the metro officials to temporarily link the already completed northern part of the Line 5 (starting from Sadovaya) to Pravoberezhnaya Line, as they felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> have a single connected line rather than two unconnected ones. From that point on, the line expanded northward, as per original plans of Line 5 expansion.|$|E

Demare {{travelled}} to Salta to reconnoiter the area. Later, the crew and equipment moved to an old estate and big house. They worked on a big ballroom and had two small rooms; each crewman had a cot and an upside down beer wooden box as night-stand. The actresses and Enrique Muiño, due to his age, stayed in a hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build the}} Batillus class supertankers was signed on April 6, 1971, and the first sheet metal was cut in January 1975. Meanwhile, the oil shock caused by the Yom Kippur War in October 1973 resulted in higher oil prices and reduced imports by industrialized countries. The cancellation of the orders was seriously considered, but Shell concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> continue, mostly to not put the shipyard {{in a very difficult}} position by withdrawing such a huge, already initiated project (the work commitments were already well advanced, with extremely heavy cancellation charges). It was also hoped for an improvement in market conditions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{considerations}} that led the Swedish government to declare Sweden a non-belligerent state was concern that they might otherwise lose control of the internal situation in Sweden. The Soviet demands on Finland in the {{months prior to the}} outbreak of war had roused public opinion. While there had been large demonstrations in support of Finland, Russia was a traditional enemy, and fear of the Russians had {{been a part of the}} Swedish mindset since 1719, when Russian galleys burned Swedish coastal communities during the Great Northern War. Therefore, there was a strong feeling that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> defend Sweden on Finnish soil.|$|E

25|$|By 326BCE, Alexander the Great had conquered Asia Minor and the Achaemenid Empire and {{had reached}} the {{northwest}} frontiers of the Indian subcontinent. There he defeated King Porus in the Battle of the Hydaspes (near modern-day Jhelum, Pakistan) and conquered much of the Punjab. Alexander's march east put him in confrontation with the Nanda Empire of Magadha and the Gangaridai of Bengal. His army, exhausted and frightened {{by the prospect of}} facing larger Indian armies at the Ganges River, mutinied at the Hyphasis (modern Beas River) and refused to march further East. Alexander, after the meeting with his officer, Coenus, and after learning about the might of the Nanda Empire, was convinced that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> return.|$|E
25|$|Confusion, however, did {{not rest}} on the American side alone. The Filipinos also succumbed to indecision. Colonel Lucio Lucas, who was under Luna's direct command, had responded {{immediately}} after hearing the signal for attack. His objective was to march into the Meisic police station, which the Americans {{had turned into a}} barracks. However, en route Lucas' troops were met by a large American contingent at Azcarraga Street. Thinking of retreat, Lucas had reconsidered the belief that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> die fighting than die burning. The houses at their rear were already on fire, so he ordered his men to attack the Americans with only daggers in their hands. In the ensuing fight three Filipinos and eight Americans were killed.|$|E
25|$|Since the Tyrrell Street school {{originally}} opened as Newcastle Public School in 1878, it {{had endured}} {{over one hundred}} years of alterations and patchwork of different style that detracted from its original grandeur. The result was a building featuring many different architectural styles. Before it could be reopened as Newcastle East Public school in 1982, major renovations were conducted to restore the building to as near its original glory as money would allow. The architect {{in charge of the}} project was Mr. John Carr, who worked with the philosophy that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> repair than replace. A restoration project by the Public Works Department was conducted in mid-1981. Worth around $850,000, it saw the demolition of unsympathetic additions and the uncovering of the building’s fine brickwork.|$|E
