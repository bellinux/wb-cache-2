25|$|It is {{nonsensical}} and counter-intuitive {{to believe}} that Nature (or God) created human life only to allow <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> after a definite period of time. A human being {{must be able to}} live indefinitely, or to put it in another way, it {{should not be allowed to}} die through ageing. There must be something inside us, that can be modified (perhaps at conception) that will shift the entire death pathway into another, parallel pathway, that will have no predetermined end. This ‘something’ is in fact, the evolutionary impetus to achieve higher levels of complexity in the quickest way possible. There should be a way to enhance this process and accelerate our transition from the process of evolution by natural selection to a post-Darwinian, transhumanist domain where indefinite life-spans are the norm.|$|E

500|$|Barton Fink uses several stylistic {{conventions}} {{to accentuate}} the story's mood and give visual emphasis to particular themes.

His first experiences in the Hotel Earle continue this trope; the bellhop Chet emerges from beneath the floor, carrying a shoe (which he has presumably been polishing) suggesting the real activity is underground. Although Barton's floor is presumably six floors above the lobby, the interior of the elevator is shown only while it is descending. These elements– [...] combined with many dramatic pauses, surreal dialogue, and implied threats of violence– [...] create an atmosphere of extreme tension. The Coens explained that [...] "the whole movie was supposed to feel like impending doom or catastrophe. And we definitely wanted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> with an apocalyptic feeling".|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of Orochimaru {{to the series}} was first suggested by Masashi Kishimoto's superiors {{in order to improve}} the series' popularity. Kishimoto believed the series grew personality based on the Chunin Exams story arc and wanted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> normally with Shikamaru Nara's victory. However, he eventually accepted their advised and Orochimaru was set up to interrupt this arc. As one of the villains in the story, Kishimoto created Orochimaru as an antithesis to the protagonists' values. His snake-like appearance and related features were intended {{to make it easier for}} the reader to recognize that he is a villain. In an interview, Kishimoto asserted that making the villains [...] "flamboyant" [...] was one of his [...] "guiding principles," [...] and attributed this to his desire to have the villains have a [...] "powerful aura." [...] When asked if Orochimaru was still good, Kishimoto answered that Orochimaru is [...] "truly evil" [...] and that he is one of the several [...] "hopeless evil characters" [...] that appear in the series. Originally Kishimoto planned to make Orochimaru's look androgynous. However, because of the concept of him being a strong antagonist, he made him more creepy. Of most of the characters, Orochimaru was hardest one to write. Kishimoto wanted wanted him to be a terrifying opponent, so he wondered if that was really the way to go to make him sound strong. Then I started thinking it was good like that, he's strong and creepy, and the creepyness started increasing.|$|E

She impressed Wirkola with her performance in The Disappearance of Alice Creed, and, after they have met, with her [...] "really filthy sense of humour" [...] as [...] "the humour is essential to this film." [...] Arterton said she was attracted to Wirkola's [...] "strong vision" [...] for the film, calling it [...] "very, very dark, and bloodthirsty and there’s a lot of cursing. It’s kind of got a Tarantino feel, really." [...] Arterton described her character as [...] "much more in tune with her spiritual side. Hansel is a typical action hero, cheeky, funny, a womanizer. She’s much more of a thinker, intense, internal and bit more open-minded than he is." [...] She said that Gretel is [...] "a sexual character but she's not having sex with anybody, which is a change for me because usually in my films I'm sleeping with somebody!" [...] She further explained the characters: [...] "Hansel & Gretel have this unstoppable bond but they’re also so different from each other. She’s the brains of the operation. He’s the brawn. He’s the joker and the show-off. She’s more the watcher, the researcher, the one who tries to really understand witchcraft." [...] Arterton added, [...] "Jeremy [...] and I found within the script moments where we showed the vulnerable side of them. Often in action movies, people are scared to put that in. I think it was important."

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode, [...] ""No One" [...] may have given us a bloodless siege, but {{there were plenty of}} bloody moments, namely from the {{brothers}} Clegane, who were both awesomely brutal this week. Though not against one another, as it looks like, for now, the Cleganebowl's been canceled. I loved the end of Arya's arc along with Jaime's scheme to take Riverrun - though I'm curious to see what comes of the Tully angle. Brienne failed to get an army for Sansa and Jaime's just going to head back home now? It seems like there should be more to this that him just winning one for the Lannister name. Though regardless of what the payoff might be, it was still good to see how so much of this story tied back to the first three seasons and Jaime's time as Catelyn's prisoner." [...] He gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club criticized the episode's momentum within the season, writing [...] "The lack of momentum driving these stories is surprising to me given that the season has largely been doing a fine job with internal momentum." [...] McNutt continued, [...] "The show may have run into an unfortunate convergence of so many anti-climactic storylines in a single episode, but their very existence is a necessary byproduct of a narrative that is preparing to shed its skin and move forward with a new lease on life." [...] Despite this, he gave the episode a grade of B-. Erik Kain of Forbes wrote about the episode, [...] "Not the greatest episode of the season, but I still didn't want <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> Sometimes I realize that even an episode I have lots of complaints about manages to be some of the best television out there. Game of Thrones isn't always on the money, but even an off night can be surprisingly good." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly summarized the episode in his review by saying [...] "Cheers, chills, and the sound of online fan theories imploding. [...] "No One" [...] delivered Jaime Lannister's finest scene in years, a thrilling chase, and set one Stark on an exciting new path." ...|$|E

500|$|Crane and Kauffman {{strongly}} envisioned Friends as {{an ensemble}} comedy, and Warner Bros. initially marketed {{the show as}} such by having the cast appear in their entirety for all press, interviews and photo shoots. One of few sitcoms {{at the time to}} be neither a workplace comedy, family sitcom or star a famous comedian, Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show's main characters are [...] "of equal importance." [...] As a writer, Crane preferred it this way because [...] "utilizing six equal players, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for myriad story lines." [...] Kauffman echoed [...] "that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage." [...] The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically. The show's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast. Famously, the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries, refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three, which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten– approximately $25 million per year. Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Aniston became the highest-paid television actress of all time. By then, Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the [...] "Rachel" [...] and successfully transitioning into a film career, combined with her high-profile relationship with her then-husband, actor Brad Pitt, who had once guest starred in an episode of the show. At times the producers would use the actress' popularity to boost the show's ratings, notably her character's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc. Aniston had been telling the press that the show's ninth season would be her last, and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season. She explained to NBC's Matt Lauer, [...] "I wanted <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> when people still loved us and we were on a high. And then I was also feeling like, ‘How much more of Rachel do I have in me?’” However, the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends, which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston's busy film schedule.|$|E
