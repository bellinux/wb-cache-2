He also worked for the BBC and wrote for the publications Limite, Le Figaro, PEN Internationale and Repères (Paris); Dialog (Dietzenbach); Săptămâna müncheneză, Contrapunct and Curentul (Munich); <b>Jalons</b> (Chambourg-sur-Indre); Cuvântul românesc (Sweden); Uomini e libri (Milan); Izvoare and Revista mea (Israel); Gazette de Genève and [...] Tribune de Genève; Journal of the American Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences; Tribune-dimanche, Écriture and L’Echo sentimentale (Switzerland); Le journal des poètes (Belgium); Neue Europe (Luxembourg) and Grandive (New York City). While abroad, he wrote poetry in Romanian and French, essays, literary criticism and anti-totalitarian social-political pamphlets (Insectele tovarășului Hitler, 1982). In Romania, he was slandered and had invective directed at him (in Săptămâna magazine), while during the same period, his work was commented on and received praise from important contemporary poets. His verses were translated into French and English, and Caraion was paid a posthumous homage at the Sorbonne in 1988. After the Romanian Revolution, his exile work could again be published in his native country, and appeared as Apa de apoi in 1991.|$|E
