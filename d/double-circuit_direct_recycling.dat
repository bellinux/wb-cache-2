40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> {{process is}} an {{alternative}} method of recycling waste of chip aluminium without melting the materials as compared to conventional recycling technique (secondary production). The cold compaction stage is the most crucial process of the <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> process. The billets density, b achieved through the cold compaction stage significantly influences the hardness (mechanical properties) and chip boundaries (microstructural properties). The problem of conventional compaction (direct compaction) presents low of b. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop the Cyclic Extrusion Compression Back Pressure (CECBP) technique to improve the b which influences the hardness and chip boundaries of aluminium alloy 6061 and 7075 chips in the <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> process. Taguchi Method was used as a tool to analyse and optimise the CECBP factors namely the pressure, P back pressure, Pb cycle time, tc and holding time, th. Different lubricant strategy techniques (flood, dry and minimum quantity lubricant (MQL) were used to obtain different types of aluminium chips. Conventional compaction (direct compaction technique) was used to get b value. The MQL showed the highest b results compared to flood and dry technique. The experimental results suggested that the CECBP technique is able to improve cyclic billets density cyb to 12. 11 % (AA 6061) and 5. 45 % (AA 7075) compared to direct compaction technique. It is also established that the cyclic specimen hardness, Hcys and chip boundaries for both aluminium alloys improved when cyb value increased by using regression analysis. Pressure is identified to be the most significant factor in influencing the properties of cyb, cys and Hcys. In conclusion, CECBP technique had successfully improved the cold compaction stage for a <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> process and can used as <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> process of aluminium in industry...|$|R

A compaction stage is the most crucial stage of <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> that significantly affects mechanical properties and microstructure. One problem in direct compaction is low billet density. This study aims to introduce a cyclic extrusion compression back pressure technique for improving billet density, which affects the hardness, particle size and chip boundaries of aluminium alloy 6061 chips during <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> of the hot forging process. The experiment design {{was used as a}} tool to conduct experiments based on process parameters, such as pressure, back pressure, number of cycles and holding time. A normal compaction technique was used to compare the billet density with the current technique. After the hot forging process, the cyclic porosity and hardness were compared with the original billet material before machining, and the final chip size and boundaries were also analysed. Pressure was identified as the most significant factor affecting the properties of billet density and cyclic hardness. This shows that the current compaction technique can improve billet density by up to 12. 11 % compared with the direct compaction technique. Consequently, this technique can improve 7 % cyclic density and an almost similar hardness as the original billet before machining AA 6061. These results are represented by the fine particle size and grain boundaries to improve hardness when the densification is increased. In conclusion, the cyclic extrusion compression back pressure technique successfully improved the hot forging product in the <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> process of aluminium chip...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> of {{effluents}} {{on the quality}} of CrxCy coatings grown by MOCVD using direct liquid injection (DLI) of bis(ethylbenzene) chromium(0) in toluene was investigated. The results are compared with those obtained using non-recycled solutions of precursor. Both types of coatings exhibit the same features. They are amorphous in the temperature range 673 – 823 K. They exhibit a dense and glassy-like microstructure and a high hardness (> 23 GPa). Analyses at the nanoscale revealed a nanocomposite microstructure consisting of free-C domains embedded in an amorphous Cr 7 C 3 matrix characterized by strong interfaces and leading to an overall composition slightly higher than Cr 7 C 3. The stiffness and strength of these interfaces are mainly due to at least two types of chemical bonds between Cr atoms and free-C: (i) Cr intercalation between graphene sheets and (ii) hexahapto η 6 -Cr bonding on the external graphene sheets of the free-C domains. The density of these interactions was found increasing by decreasing the concentration of the injected solution, as this occurred using a recycled solution. As a result, “recycled” coatings exhibit a higher nanohardness (29 GPa) than “new” coatings (23 GPa).

Hot press forging has been identified as a sustainable <b>direct</b> <b>recycling</b> technique that has fewer steps and maintains excellent material performance. An experimental investigation was conducted to explore the hardness and density of a recycled aluminum-based metal matrix composite by varying operating temperature and holding time. A mixture of recycled aluminum, AA 6061, and aluminum oxide were simultaneously heated to 430, 480, and 530 °C and forged for 60, 90, and 120 min. We found a positive increase in microhardness and density for all composites. The hardness increased approximately 33. 85 %, while density improved by about 15. 25 % whenever the temperature or the holding time were increased. Based on qualitative analysis, the composite endures substantial plastic deformation due to the presence of hardness properties due to the aluminum oxide embedded in the aluminum matrix. These increases were significantly affected by the operating temperature; the holding time also had a subordinate role in enhancing the metal matrix composite properties. Furthermore, in an effort to curb the shortage of primary resources, this study reviewed the promising performance of secondary resources produced by using recycled aluminum and aluminum oxide as the base matrix and reinforcement constituent, respectively.

However, unlike HK2 and HK3, HK1 itself is not directly regulated by Pi, which better suits its ubiquitous catabolic role.

Actually, the acknowledged current methods to estimate the bio-degradability are mainly based on laboratory tests and measurements under controlled conditions, while scarce information {{are available on the}} effective transformation of bio-film derivatives in real composting facilities. The aim of this paper was to determine at molecular level the decomposition of specific starch-based thermoplastic mulching film for horticultural crops, in a real on-farm composting system for the attainment of mature compost for agricultural application. Results: The initial and final molecular composition of both bulk biomasses and bio-plastic composite were evaluated through 13 C solid-state CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy and off-line thermochemolysis—gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The effective decomposition of the bio-polymer was shown by mono-dimensional and pseudo- 2 D NMR experiments that revealed the alteration of the intermolecular linkages among the monomeric constituents, while the thermochemolysis confirmed the complete decomposition of starch components. Concomitantly, the molecular characterization of bulk compost indicated the typical selective preservation of hydrophobic components currently found in aerobic composting processes, with a significant increase (+ 50...|$|R
