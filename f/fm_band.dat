25|$|Note {{the above}} {{capacity}} improvement {{may not always}} be achieved at the L-band frequencies, since these are more sensitive to obstacles than the <b>FM</b> <b>band</b> frequencies, and may cause shadow fading for hilly terrain and for indoor communication. The number of transmitter sites or the transmission power required for full coverage of a country may be rather high at these frequencies, to avoid the system becoming noise limited rather than limited by co-channel interference.|$|E
25|$|As well, the {{publicly}} owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates four national radio networks, two each in English and French. The English Radio One and the French Première Chaîne provide {{news and information}} programming to most communities in Canada, regardless of size, on either the AM or <b>FM</b> <b>band.</b> The English Radio 2 and French Espace musique provide arts and culture programming, including classical music and opera, and are always on FM, generally serving larger communities only.|$|E

25|$|In 1943 NBC was {{compelled}} by the U.S. government to divest itself {{of one of}} its two networks, which resulted in it selling the Blue network (which became the American Broadcasting Company).

Also during this period, in 1942 it gained a sister station, W75P, on the then-new <b>FM</b> <b>band,</b> which later became KDKA-FM, changing to WPNT in 1979. This station was sold by Westinghouse in 1984, and is now WLTJ.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, colour {{television}} {{was introduced in}} Australia. Within a decade, the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ (Double Jay), which was eventually expanded into the national Triple J FM network. A classical music network was established a year later on the <b>FM</b> <b>band,</b> broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM - referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.|$|E

25|$|The university's student {{population}} operates {{a number of}} media outlets throughout the campus environment. The Quartier Libre, is university's main student newspaper. CISM-FM is an independently owned radio station, owned by the students of the Université de Montréal, and operated by the student union. The radio started in 1970, and received a permit from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on 10 July 1990 to transmit on an <b>FM</b> <b>band.</b> On 14 March 1991, CISM's broadcasting antenna was boosted to 10 000 watts. With a broadcasting radius of 70km, CISM is now the world's largest French-language university radio station. The CFTU-DT television station also receives its technical and administrative support from the student body.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a notable}} trend in Canadian radio {{has been the}} gradual {{abandonment}} of the AM band, with many AM stations applying for and receiving authorization from the CRTC to convert to the <b>FM</b> <b>band.</b> In some Canadian cities, in fact, the AM band is now either nearly or entirely vacant. Because Canada is more sparsely populated than the United States, the limitations of AM broadcasting (particularly at night, when the AM dial is often overwhelmed by distant signals) {{have a much more}} pronounced effect on Canadian broadcasters. AM radio stations have the additional protection that cable companies which offer cable FM services are required by the CRTC to distribute all locally available AM stations through conversion to a cable FM signal, but cable FM only accounts for a small percentage of radio listeners in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Alpine {{is home to}} {{the tower}} and {{laboratory}} built by Edwin Howard Armstrong after RCA evicted him from the Empire State Building. Armstrong's experimental FM station, W2XMN, used various frequencies to broadcast from the tower, first on 42.8 MHz; later on 44.1MHz; and finally on 93.1MHz in the modern <b>FM</b> <b>band.</b> The laboratory building and the tower still stand; the 400-foot (122-m) tower is home to many two-way radio users, one modern FM station (Fairleigh Dickinson University's WFDU), and backup transmitters for several of New York's television stations. The tower served as a primary tower for the stations after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks destroyed the World Trade Center. There was some local opposition to this scheme, but the move was temporary, as the stations affected moved their primary broadcast facilities to the Empire State Building. The original lab building is home to a static display of historic communications equipment and offices; the USA Network cable channel operated from this building in the late 1970s.|$|E
