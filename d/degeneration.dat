The minimal <b>degenerations</b> of modules for the exceptional class of representation-finite selfinjective algebras are studied by R.  Aehle [J.  London Math. Soc. 66 (2002)   73].

40|$|We {{consider}} finite-dimensional modules over tame path algebras {{and study}} the 'building blocks' of their <b>degenerations.</b> These are the minimal disjoint <b>degenerations</b> to the direct sum of two indecomposables U, V. For the building blocks, we derive a reduction theorem that holds if U or V are non-regular. Subsequently we focus on minimal <b>degenerations</b> to the direct sum of a preprojective and a preinjective indecomposable and use the reduction theorem to introduce a new method to analyze the codimensions {{of this sort of}} <b>degenerations.</b> We show that the codimensions are bounded. By means of computer calculations we determine this bound explicitly. The codimension is always one. Finally, this leads to a minimality preserving periodicity theorem, which reduces the classification of the building blocks to a finite problem...|$|R
