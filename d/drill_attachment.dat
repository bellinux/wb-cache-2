50|$|Power nibblers {{are often}} powered by {{compressed}} air, though electrical types also exist. A common DIY nibbler tool is an electric <b>drill</b> <b>attachment,</b> which converts the rotary {{motion of the}} drill into a reciprocating motion of the jaw.|$|E
5000|$|Stagger Tank (Sutaggā Tanku) is G-Stag's Beet Machine. It has a double-barreled cannon, the Stag Buster (Sutaggu Basutā). It {{uses the}} Stagger Cannons (Sutaggā Kyanon) and the Stagger Scissors (Sutaggā Shizāsu). It can attach the <b>Drill</b> <b>Attachment</b> (Doriru Atatchimento) {{stored in the}} Beetluder in Flap Formation onto its grabbers.|$|E
50|$|Bits and Bobs also is English {{slang for}} a {{collection}} of small items too numerous or varied to name individually. It originated from carpenters' tool kits containing parts for a drill, with bits used for making holes while bobs are routing or screwdriving <b>drill</b> <b>attachments.</b> Children laugh at the balls' mistakes at the end.|$|R

30|$|The third {{important}} {{feature is the}} reaction bar. All electric drills, engine drills, and chainsaws used in conventional mechanical boring systems have small reaction bars {{that are designed to}} be supported by the operator’s hand [5, 7, 9, 12]. For example, a gasoline-powered chainsaw fitted with small reaction bar and the Atom brand <b>drilling</b> <b>attachment</b> was developed to drive an increment borer [12]. With the small reaction bar, it was difficult for an operator to absorb the strong reaction force, and as we discuss later, it was even dangerous. Other previous devices use frames to absorb the reaction force, which are fastened either to the tree stem/ground or onto a carriage [8, 10, 11]. Frames can absorb the reaction force more effectively than arms. However, mounting/unmounting the frames at each coring is time consuming.|$|R

A simple two-wheel tractor (Chinese Dongfeng type) {{operated}} zero till {{seed and}} fertilizer <b>drill</b> <b>attachment</b> {{has been developed}} jointly by the Wheat Research Centre of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Without prior land preparation, this machine places seed and fertilizer directly into the soil in one operation. There is tremendous scope for such tools for conserving agriculture attachments as there are over 200, 000 Chinese two-wheel tractors currently in Bangladesh. This prototype version of the zero till seed drill {{is made up of}} four major components, namely, a toolbar frame, a furrow opener, a seed delivery unit and a fertilizer delivery unit. The performance of the machine has been tested in 180 farmers ’ fields in different parts of Bangladesh for wheat and maize in 1999 - 2004. The crop yields are similar compared to the conventional methods. The effective field capacity of the machine was found to be 0. 18 ha per hr for simultaneous seeding and fertilizer application. Planting cost of wheat and maize were 83 % and 89 % less than that of conventional method. The two-wheel tractor operated zero till seed drill, thus, has a good potential as a resource conserving crop establishment technology for the Bangladeshi farmers...|$|E

50|$|It formed part of {{a colossal}} acrolithic cult statue for the worship of Antinous as a god. 31 holes in 3 {{different}} sizes have been <b>drilled</b> for the <b>attachment</b> of a head-dress (possibly a lotus flower or uraeus) in metal; the sculpture has also lost eyes in metal, ivory or coloured stone.|$|R
50|$|Pressure is {{the force}} {{put on the}} patient's body. Those forces can stem from the surgery itself, instruments, <b>drills,</b> gravity, <b>attachments,</b> and bandages. The {{duration}} and intensity of the pressure is inversely correlated. The longer {{the duration of the}} pressure, the less pressure the body can endure. However, the body can endure a large amount of pressure for brief periods of time. The amount of pressure on the tissue is based {{on the size of the}} area of the contact: the smaller the point of pressure, the greater effect it will have on the tissue. The position of instruments can cause damage to the body if pressure is not relieved periodically.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} the other non-wood poles, FRC poles cannot be mounted with the {{traditional}} climbing hardware of hooks and gaffs. FRC poles can be pre-drilled by the manufacturer, or holes can be <b>drilled</b> on site. <b>Attachments</b> using lag bolts, teeth, nails, and staples are unacceptable for FRC poles. Through-bolts are used instead of lag bolts for maximum bonding to the pole and to avoid loosening of hardware.|$|R
40|$|Applying {{fertilizer}} {{with the}} seed at planting is one successful soil management practice {{that has long}} been recognized as a means to improve crop yields. Grain <b>drills</b> with fertilizer <b>attachments</b> eventually enabled the farmer to apply a small amount of fertilizer with the seed and plant in one operation. A common practice in the Northern Great Plains dryland small grain production area is to apply 50 pounds per acr...|$|R

40|$|The authors develop 3 -D {{models of}} the {{pediatric}} knee from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image files, {{with the goal of}} minimizing injury to the pediatric growth plate during surgery. Computerized tomography (CT) scans have better resolution and contrast between bone and soft tissue than MRI scans; however, surgeons rely upon MRI scans to plan knee-joint surgeries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Surgeons can use the virtual models to plan and verify surgical procedures such as hole <b>drilling</b> and ligament <b>attachments,</b> and to determine volume removed from a growth plate due to different drill-hole placements with various drill sizes...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the distal}} {{borders of the}} incision, the semitendinosus and {{gracilis}} tendons are found beneath the sartorius muscle fascia. The distal tibial attachment of the sMCL can be found under these identified tendons, making up {{the floor of the}} pes anserine bursa, 6 cm distal to the joint line. Once identified, the remaining soft tissue is removed from the attachment site. An eyelet pin is then <b>drilled</b> through <b>attachment</b> site transversely through the tibia, making sure the starting point is located at the posterior aspect of the site to ensure better biomechanical outcomes. Over the eyelet pin, a 7-mm reamer (6 mm considered in smaller patients) is reamed to a depth of 25 mm. Once prepared, attention is directed to preparing the reconstruction tunnel for the tibial attachment of the POL. Above the anterior arm attachment of the semimembranosus muscle tendon, the tibial attachment of the central arm of the POL is identified. This attachment is exposed by making a small incision parallel to the fibers along the posterior edge of the anterior arm of the semimembranosus tendon. Once exposed, an eyelet pin is drilled through the tibia toward Gerdy’s tubercle (anterolateral tibia). After verifying the correct anatomic eyelet pin placement, a 7-mm reamer is used over the pin to drill a tunnel depth of 25 mm.|$|R
