25|$|The {{roots of}} {{traditional}} Qajar painting {{can be found}} in the style of painting that arose during the preceding Safavid empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on Persian culture, especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. European art was undergoing a period of realism and this can be seen in the depiction of objects especially by Qajar artists. The European influence is very well evidenced in the preëminent position and prestige of oil painting. While oil paintings had been par for the course during previous periods of Persian art, it was the influence of the European masters, like Rubens and Rembrandt, the true masters of oil portraiture, that raised it to the highest level. <b>Heavy</b> <b>application</b> of paint and dark, rich, saturated colors are elements of Qajar painting that owe their influences directly to the European style.|$|E

The outfit she wore for the performance was described by Carol Clerk, author of Madonnastyle, [...] as the [...] "perfect visual combination of masculine and feminine".

Hence, more sustainable and environmental friendly method should be established and implemented, such as biological control. Several species of fungi from the genera of Trichoderma was identified to be a beneficial endophyte, to control black pod caused by Phytophthora spp. An isolate of Trichoderma asperellum from soil was observed as a potential mycoparasite for P. megakarya where this fungus {{has the potential to}} reduce black pod incident under field condition in Cameroon. It was reported that moderate black pod cases (47%) occurred in the T. asperellum treatment to control black pod disease compared to trees with untreated (71%) and chemical fungicide (1.73%). Another species, which is T. virens also has been documented to reduce some black pod incident in Peru. In Brazil, a new species known as Trichoderma martiale Samuels, sp. nov. was identified as an endophyte on cocoa, which has the ability to reduce black pod symptoms caused by P. megakarya. This endophyte species survives on cocoa pods, and has the ability to establish a long endophytic association with the host (about 3.5 months). Nevertheless, the protection against black pod via biological control is not as effective as the control using chemical fungicides ...|$|E
