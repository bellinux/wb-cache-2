25|$|For a solid to melt, heat is {{required}} to raise its temperature to the melting point. However, further heat needs to be supplied for the melting to take place: {{this is called the}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> and is an example of latent heat.|$|E
25|$|A high {{melting point}} results from a high <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> a low entropy of fusion, or a {{combination}} of both. In highly symmetrical molecules the crystal phase is densely packed with many efficient intermolecular interactions resulting in a higher enthalpy change on melting.|$|E
25|$|The {{high heat}} storage {{capacity}} in the phase change from solid to liquid, and the advantageous phase change temperature of 32°C (90°F) makes this material especially appropriate for storing low grade solar heat for later release in space heating applications. In some applications the material is incorporated into thermal tiles that are placed in an attic space while in other applications the salt is incorporated into cells surrounded by solar–heated water. The phase change allows a substantial reduction in {{the mass of the}} material required for effective heat storage (the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> of sodium sulfate decahydrate is 82 kJ/mol or 252 kJ/kg), with the further advantage of a consistency of temperature as long as sufficient material in the appropriate phase is available.|$|E
40|$|For many years, low {{temperature}} research has held a certain fascination for many workers. The results of investigation, however, {{have not been}} very plentiful, especially in the realm <b>of</b> latent <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion.</b> In reality {{there are very few}} substances whose latent <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> and specific <b>heats</b> at {{low temperature}}s are accurately known.

In this work, <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> new multicomponent eutectics and intermetallic phases are reported, {{some of which are}} competitive with molten salts in heat storage density at high temperatures. The method used to determine unknown eutectic compositions combined results of differential thermal analysis, metallography, and microprobe analysis. The method allows determination of eutectic compositions in no more than three steps. The <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> <b>of</b> the alloys were measured using commercial calorimeters, a differential thermal analyzer, and a differential scanning calorimeter...|$|R
40|$|Peltier-element-based {{adiabatic}} scanning calorimetry {{was used}} to obtain equilibrium enthalpy and heat capacity curves for pure water and water–NaCl mixtures, up to the eutectic mass concentration of 23. 2 %, in the temperature range from – 30 to 5 ∘C 5 ∘C,including both the eutectic and the ordinary ice melting. From these equilibrium data, information about the transition temperatures and the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> was extracted. The transition temperatures are consistent with literature data for the phase diagram. The <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> were rescaled {{with respect to the}} fraction of the sample that changes phase at each transition. These rescaled values for the eutectic transition are independent of the overall salt concentration, whereas for the ice melting there is an indication of slight decrease with increasing salt concentration. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E
25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling to room temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool to room temperature.|$|E

2500|$|Not all solids are {{crystals}}. For example, when {{liquid water}} starts freezing, the phase change begins with small ice crystals that grow until they fuse, forming a polycrystalline structure. In the final block of ice, {{each of the}} small crystals (called [...] "crystallites" [...] or [...] "grains") is a true crystal with a periodic arrangement of atoms, but the whole polycrystal {{does not have a}} periodic arrangement of atoms, because the periodic pattern is broken at the grain boundaries. Most macroscopic inorganic solids are polycrystalline, including almost all metals, ceramics, ice, rocks, etc. Solids that are neither crystalline nor polycrystalline, such as glass, are called amorphous solids, also called glassy, vitreous, or noncrystalline. These have no periodic order, even microscopically. There are distinct differences between crystalline solids and amorphous solids: most notably, the process of forming a glass does not release the latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> but forming a crystal does.|$|E
50|$|The 'enthalpy' of fusion is {{a latent}} heat, because during melting the {{introduction}} of heat cannot be observed as a temperature change, as the temperature remains constant during the process. The latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> is the enthalpy change of any amount of substance when it melts. When the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> is referenced to a unit of mass, it is usually called the specific <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion,</b> while the molar <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> refers to the enthalpy change per amount of substance in moles.|$|E

The zone of compositional transition across the interface is shown to be on the order of a few atomic layers in width, being moderately narrower for ideal solutions.
