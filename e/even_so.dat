5|$|A {{number of}} {{designs for the}} energy being were {{considered}} for this episode; however, the final version was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple. Shinagawa noted that <b>even</b> <b>so,</b> the final design for Melllvar is more sophisticated than some energy beings featured in the original series.|$|E
5000|$|Aref: Amani's cousin, {{he teaches}} Amani {{how to read}} and write in the <b>evening</b> <b>so</b> she can {{shepherd}} during the day ...|$|R

5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly {{understood}} that his military decisions {{would be more}} effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System {{as we know it}} today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Bogin {{observes that}} Thompson {{originated}} {{the use of}} transformational grids to measure growth in two dimensions, but that without modern computers the method was tedious to apply and was not often used. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> the book stimulated and lent intellectual validity to the new field of growth and development research.|$|E
50|$|On the weekend, {{there are}} a few buses in the <b>evening</b> <b>so</b> {{passengers}} have to use Nachtbusse or Anrufsammeltaxis which passengers have to call before travelling.|$|R

5|$|In 1826, Parliament finally {{voted to}} {{increase}} Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool Government {{argued that the}} Duke needed an increased allowance to pay for Prince George's education; <b>even</b> <b>so,</b> it was opposed by many Whigs. The bill, which passed the House of Commons 120–97, required Prince George to live in England if the Duke was to receive the money.|$|E
5|$|Juno {{is one of}} {{the larger}} asteroids, perhaps tenth by size and {{containing}} approximately 1% the mass of the entire asteroid belt. It is the second-most-massive S-type asteroid after 15 Eunomia. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> Juno has only 3% the mass of Ceres.|$|E
5|$|Lee's plan, however, {{was based}} on faulty intelligence, {{exacerbated}} by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{critical}} acclaim for this series, some PBS stations would double-run two Inside/Out episodes in a half-hour time slot in the <b>evening</b> <b>so</b> that parents could watch this series with their children.|$|R
5|$|Poe eschewed the {{scientific}} method in Eureka and instead wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he considered it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|After McKinley's inauguration, {{increases}} in gold availability from new discoveries and improved refining methods {{led to a}} considerable increase in the money supply. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> in 1900, Congress passed the Gold Standard Act, formally placing the United States on that standard. Although Bryan ran again on a silver platform in the 1900 presidential election, the issue failed to produce the same resonance with the voters. McKinley won more easily than in 1896, making inroads in the silver West.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional Oxbridge formal dinners are {{available}} for members, students and faculty every Wednesday <b>evening</b> (<b>so</b> called [...] "House Dinner") during semester time however the formality of dress is considerably relaxed to its least degree.|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the Cabinet War Rooms became {{redundant}} {{and were}} abandoned. Their maintenance became the responsibility of the Ministry of Works. In March 1948 the question of public access to the War Rooms was raised in Parliament and the Minister responsible, Charles Key MP, considered that 'it would not be practicable to throw open for inspection by the general public accommodation which forms part of an office where confidential work is carried on'. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay and shown around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{acquisition}} project organisers originally {{planned for the}} first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided {{as part of the}} project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home shipyard was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' shipyard in Malmo, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Archeologists {{believe the}} first humans to inhabit the Rogue River region were nomadic hunters and gatherers. Radiocarbon dating {{suggests}} that they arrived in southwestern Oregon at least 8,500 years ago. At least 1,500 years before the first contact with whites, the natives established permanent villages along streams. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> no evidence {{has been found to}} suggest that any of the native peoples, such as the Takelma who lived along the Rogue and Applegate rivers in the 19thcentury, used the cave.|$|E
50|$|It {{gives us}} a new and a {{delightful}} sensation to read the speech he made to his constituents at Woolston on Thursday <b>evening</b> <b>so</b> free it is from humbug or deception, and so vigorous with fearless candor.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} <b>evening,</b> <b>so</b> they drew their camp chairs in a circle before one of the tents and began to tell stories to amuse themselves and pass away the time before they went to bed.|$|R
60|$|Katie {{closed her}} eyes, and listened. It was very {{peaceful}} this <b>evening,</b> <b>so</b> peaceful that {{for an instant}} she forgot even to think of Ted. And it was just during this instant that she heard his voice.|$|R
5|$|At this point, the {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without the withdrawal of the unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1968 season, the MCC's public position followed the advice of Douglas-Home: it was unknown whether or not South Africa would accept D'Oliveira and it would be better not to press the issue. <b>Even</b> <b>so,</b> three key members of the MCC were aware of the reality of the situation. Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but <b>even</b> <b>so</b> it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
