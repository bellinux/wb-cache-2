5000|$|Heinrich Dreyer founded Amazone in 1883, {{though the}} Dreyer {{family had been}} {{involved}} in the manufacture of agricultural machines earlier. The first machines brought to production were grain cleaning machines, later plow cultivators, potato sorters and in 1915 the first <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader</b> was put on the market. Early on Dreyer began exporting of his machinery; in 1906 the first grain cleaning machines were sold in Valparaíso, Chile. He substantiated this with his slogan: [...] "We must go out to the world". In 1942, the first potato harvesters were introduced to the market and in 1949 the seed drill machines and 1959, a manure spreader. In the 1960s, the two-disc ZA fertilizer spreaders and D4 seed drills were very successful, which helped Amazone to reach market leadership at this time. In 1967 the company entered into tillage and there developed the first Amazone manufactured PTO driven tillage equipment that could be used with a drill. The harrow and rotary cultivator were also included into the product range. Later, after the German reunification, a variety of passive soil-working machines were added to the market.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, the {{performance}} of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreaders</b> is assessed using a row of collection trays aligned perpendicular to the driving direction of the tractor. For precise calibration of the spreader this technique, however, does not provide adequate insight into the spreading process since particle distributions are measured in only one spatial dimension. In this paper, two different two dimensional spread pattern determination techniques (SPDT) were tested, each consisting of a sampling method and a matching interpolation algorithm. Tests were executed under similar conditions with three commonly used types of fertilizer (CAN, NPK, KCl) with different physical properties. Results were compared with the traditional technique. The differences found illustrate the importance of using an adequate SPDT to compare spread patterns...|$|R
5000|$|Strip till warms the soil, {{it allows}} an aerobic condition, {{and it allows}} for a better seedbed than no-till. Strip-till allows the soil’s {{nutrients}} to be better adapted to the plant’s needs, while still giving residue cover to the soil between the rows. The system will still allow for some soil water contact that could cause erosion, however, the amount of erosion on a strip-tilled field would be light compared {{to the amount of}} erosion on an intensively tilled field. Furthermore, when liquid fertilizer is being applied, it can be directly applied in these rows where the seed is being planted, reducing the amount of fertilizer needed while improving proximity of the fertilizer to the roots. Compared to intensive tillage, strip tillage saves considerable time and money. Strip tillage can reduce the amount of trips through a field down to two or possibly one trip when using a strip till implement combined with other machinery such as a planter, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader,</b> and chemical sprayer. This can save the farmer a considerable amount of time and fuel, while reducing soil compaction due to few passes in a field. With the use of GPS-guided tractors, this precision farming can increase overall yields. [...] Strip-till conserves more soil moisture compared to intensive tillage systems. However, compared to no-till, strip-till may in some cases reduce soil moisture.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} method for fertilizer spread pattern determination was developed based on predicting where individual fertilizer particles {{land on the}} ground, {{in contrast to the}} traditional method of collecting the particles in bins (ASAE Standard S 341. 2). A small broadcast granular <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader</b> (Lowery 300) was equipped with an optical sensor designed to measure the velocity and diameter of individual fertilizer particles shortly after they leave the impeller disc. The measured velocity and diameter of individual particles were input into a ballistic model that predicted where particles land on the ground. A total of over 1000 landing spots revealed the spread pattern. The results have shown that the optical sensor is capable of automatically determining the spread pattern of a <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader</b> on the fly. The sensor could be a key component in the development of uniformity-controlled fertilizer application systems...|$|E
40|$|Particle {{dispersion}} in {{the vicinity}} of an agricultural <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader</b> is difficult to capture due to the rapid particle traveling motion. This paper introduced a granule impact indentation-based technique to simultaneously record the two-dimensional particle dispersion from a spinning concave disc type of spreader. A Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium (NPK) type of fertilizer was utilized to induce indentations on aluminum foils placed on the wall panels confining an experimental spreader system. Subsequently, an image processing technique which is comprised of the multicolor edge detection, the curve closing, and the region merging techniques was purposely developed to automatically identify and locate the granule impacts on the sampled foil digital images. Overlapping impacts were characterized based on the granulometry of the fertilizer sample. The reconstructed particle dispersion pattern using the image processing method showed good agreement with the experimental observations. The outcome of this research enabled a fast and effective method for quantitatively assessing the particle distribution for a specific <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} part of {{a project}} {{initiated}} by the Swedish Riksdag, TYP 93. The goal of this work is to find the influence of sloping ground on massflow and <b>spreader</b> pattern of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreaders.</b> If there is any influence, a proposal of testing method is to be given. The change in drop point area when inclining a centrifugal broadcaster was calculated in a computer. Two <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreaders</b> were used, Bogballe E 1000 and Amazone ZA-F 603. The drop point area was not changing when inclining the Bogballe E 1000. When Amazone ZA-F 603 was inclined sideways, the area changed with 3, 5 %/degree inclination. Experiments done by the National Machinery Testing Institute (NMTI) showed that the massflow were changing when inclining both Bogballe E 1000 and Amazone ZA-F 603 sideways. Further investigations are needed in this area. The change in massflow when inclining full-width spreaders is well-documented in the literature. The change in massflow when the studded roller feeder is inclined perpendicular to the roller axis is 0, 8 %/degree inclination. Experiments done by the NMTI supports the literature. A certification is therefore possible. The certification should preferably be done when inclining the full-width spreader 10 degrees perpendicular to the roller axis. The influence of inclination on the spreader pattern from the centrifugal distributor was studied with a computer simulation model and by experiments. The greatest change in spreader pattern was found for broadcasters inclining on horizontal ground. But there is also a big change in spreader pattern when the broadcaster is driven on sloping ground. Sideways inclination causes bigger variation coefficient in the spreader pattern than inclining the spreader forward/backwards. This points towards a possible certification in this area. The change in spreader pattern from full-width spreaders mainly comes from the change in massflow when inclining the studded roller feeder. There are no arguments for having a certification here...|$|R

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] modular discrete element framework is presented for large-scale simulations of industrial grain-handling systems. Our framework enables us to simulate a markedly larger number of particles than previous studies, thereby allowing for efficient and more realistic process simulations.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the field tests that evaluate a new centrifugal fertilizer distributor Vicon RS-EDW {{to be used}} in Precision Agriculture. The results of dynamic calibration tests show a significant and systematically difference between the application rates of the two discs (about 20 %).

The <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreader</b> had good distribution homogeneity, considering different working velocities and different positions in the parcel. The pattern distribution curve for 18 % Super phosphate fertilizer led to an effective working width of 28 meters, with a coefficient of variation of 15 %. The longitudinal test, under experimental working conditions led to a machine delay time of 6 - 7 seconds. The obtained results show an actual fertilization application density between 74 - 90 % of that determined for each location.

40|$|The {{mass flow}} of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreaders</b> must be {{calibrated}} {{for the different}} types of fertilizers used. To obtain accurate fertilizer application manual calibration of actual mass flow must be repeated frequently. Automatic calibration is possible by measurement of the actual mass flow, based on dynamic weighing of the spreader. This paper describes the design and test of a dynamic weighing system. Under field conditions, this system was able to provide force due to spreader weight readings that have a standard deviation of 20 N, over a measurement range of 6 - 20 kN, at a maximum time delay of 1 s. Time-stamped data logging of the spreader weight and the theoretical application rate combined with position information allows determination of the realized spatial application of fertilizer. A comparison can be made between realized and prescribed application rates. This information is necessary for evaluation of fertilizer management in a precision agriculture farming system and to accurately target fertilizer application to crop and soil status.

40|$|Modeling {{approaches}} for centrifugal <b>fertilizer</b> <b>spreaders</b> {{have so far}} been based on analytical expressions for single particle trajectories derived in the early 60 's. However elegant this approach was, it suffers from several disadvantages, {{the most important of}} which is failing to incorporate the interaction between the particles in the flow. This paper is {{the first in a series}} aiming at simulating the complete spreading process based on the laws of physics and a physically meaningful model for the interactions between the particles, c. q. the contact forces. The result is a model that allows the development of a deeper understanding of the physics underlying the spreading process and provides better predictions. In this paper the model is presented in detail and a series of simple computer experiments are analysed and compared to theoretical predictions. Also, single particle trajectories from DEM simulations are compared to experimental results. Further, some effects of the model parameters are analysed. This paper demonstrates that the model is not only capable of producing realistic simulations, but also provides detailed insight in the physics of the spreading process. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
