500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|On an {{exclusive}} interview with Access Hollywood, Cyrus spoke in regards to the music video for the song, directed by Marc Webb. She said, [...] "I wanted something crazy that no one else has done and like really random because this song is kinda random." [...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random. It's like everything is happening all at once." [...] The ending of the music video, she explained, was when she went back to [...] "where [...] belongs" [...] after a day of [...] "torture." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} in musical style and composition in Love Is Dead compared to Kerli's second album's material is significant. Love Is Dead being alternative rock {{and the new}} material being {{along the lines of}} synthpop. Kerli describes herself as being very depressed during the production of Love Is Dead and that she felt [...] "scattered" [...] and describes the transition to the new sound as an attempt to [...] "make it really radio friendly without losing what people already love about [...]" [...] In response to criticism concerning her sound compared to her older sound, Kerli said she was [...] "not the same person anymore", stating [...] "Maybe I will be [...] my third album. Maybe I'll be totally depressed and write another really dark album. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> I'm going to go. All I know is that I'm just always going to try to grow and do my best. And whatever comes out of me is just going to be a reflection of who I am at that moment." ...|$|E

He wrote to his family, [...] "I reported my flight, but it was hard lines for me because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> the German planes went down and therefore they can't be credited as official...

Murray’s agent, Dan Lloyd, told the BBC: [...] "it's definitely happening". The party's logo is an upside-down pound sign, not dissimilar to UKIP’s purple and gold pound sign.

5000|$|Van Horn was {{scheduled}} to face Nigel Benn for the WBC Super Middleweight Championship in England on September 10, 1994, but the fight was called off.

However, during an interview with Boxing News in 2015, Van Horn said: [...] "I never failed any scan, not ever. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>where</b> that came from. I fought a few times after the Barkley fight. Rumors and things come up, it's just ridiculous. I just became disenchanted with the sport.
