2500|$|On {{reaching}} Mulhouse, Seel {{realized that}} he would have to lie about his true story and, like all the others, lie about the reasons for his deportation. [...] "I was already starting to censor my memories, and I became aware that, in spite of my expectations, in spite of all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> of the long-awaited joy of returning, the true Liberation, was for other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the casting}} period, Moodysson {{and the crew}} interviewed [...] "something like 1000" [...] young {{applicants}} for the leading roles. The actors had to improvise on a scenario {{where they had been}} grounded and were trying to convince their mother to let them go out. While Artyom Bogucharsky had no previous acting experience, Oksana Akinshina had already starred in Sergei Bodrov, Jr.'s 2001 crime film Sisters. Moodysson has commented Akinshina as [...] " [...] exactly what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> She is better than I imagined but different, somehow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catherine also {{received}} Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun (formerly court painter to Marie Antoinette) at her Tsarskoye Selo residence in St Petersburg, by {{whom she was}} painted shortly before her death. Madame Vigée Le Brun vividly describes the empress in her memoirs: [...] "the sight of this famous woman so impressed me that I {{found it impossible to}} think of anything: I could only stare at her. Firstly I was very surprised at her small stature; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> her to be very tall, as great as her fame. She was also very fat, but her face was still beautiful, and she wore her white hair up, framing it perfectly. Her genius seemed to rest on her forehead, which was both high and wide. Her eyes were soft and sensitive, her nose quite Greek, her colour high and her features expressive. She addressed me immediately in a voice full of sweetness, if a little throaty: [...] "I am delighted to welcome you here, Madame, your reputation runs before you. I am very fond of the arts, especially painting. I am no connoisseur, but I am a great art lover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>imagined,</b> {{would rather}} disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> any thing but inviting." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> two {{or three}} {{pictures}} and concocted the accompanying remarks {{to see how the}} thing would go. I was charmed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go {{to him at}} once, {{and make}} sure of his presence. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> a plan to decoy him into the service of his lord; but I would now know the {{condition}} of his vessel." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> that my {{entrance}} into the room was unnoticed, but I found him suddenly bowing before my table.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is in {{a little}} village some five hundred miles across the frontier, in Siberia. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> {{that you might have}} known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wanted such charming {{children}}," [...] I explained--"my idea of charming children: {{the children}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> for myself. Even as babies you disappointed me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, {{as she sat}} there, it {{came into}} her head. That 's reason enough for her. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> she wishes me well, as they say here--though she has never {{distinguished}} me {{in such a way}} as that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> it. Good-night!" [...] They {{stood for}} a moment facing each other in the shadow of an acacia-tree with very moonlit blossoms, and the smoke from their {{cigarettes}} mingled in the air between them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My child! my child!' said Albinia, {{throwing}} her arms round her, expecting her to faint. 'Oh! could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> such treason?' Her eyes flashed, and her frame quivered with indignation. 'He shall never {{come into this}} house again!' ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{astonished}} {{to see that it}} made an opening into the shop below. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> that the floor or ceiling was of double thickness.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was a bit}} {{staggered}} at this, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> it {{was simply}} a new dress or something of the kind that she was after.|$|E
6000|$|... "Far from it. I was {{tormented by}} the {{contrast}} between my idea and my handiwork: in each case <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> something which I was quite powerless to realise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I {{told you}} it was a foolish fancy, but you asked for it. When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> yielded myself to it, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been alone, and then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> them the {{footsteps}} {{of the people who are}} to come into my life, and my father's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Dorrit,' {{returned}} Mrs General, 'is ever but too obliging, ever but too appreciative. If {{there have}} been moments when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that Miss Dorrit has indeed resented the favourable opinion Mr Dorrit has formed of my services, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found, in that only too high opinion, my consolation and recompense.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ter. Say {{rather that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> it [...] A {{possible}} thing; {{and it has}} sooth'd my soul [...] As other fancies have; but ne'er seduced me [...] To traffic with the black and frenzied hope, [...] That the dead {{hear the voice of}} witch or wizard.|$|R
6000|$|I {{began to}} think the affair might be more serious than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Six to one was heavy odds, and who could tell what these wild fellows would not do? ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she lifted}} her great earnest eyes fearlessly to my own. They were full of light and happiness. I doubted no longer that she was {{innocent}} of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b>|$|E
6000|$|My {{turn with}} the glasses {{revealed}} {{to me that}} what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> to be a cub was indeed a big bear. After Nielsen looked he said: [...] "Never saw one so big in Norway." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{assured her}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>imagined</b> such a thing possible.|$|R
60|$|I {{found it}} after {{wandering}} about {{for half a}} day, and never could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> anything so glorious. The gate led into a square court, into which opened a hundred doors, ninety-nine of them being of rare woods and one of gold. Through each of these doors I caught glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Brain. If <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> how base {{a fellow}} you had been, {{you should not}} then have been troubled with my company.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> {{that no one}} who {{had read}} my {{preceding}} papers, could entertain a doubt as to my position in respect of the main issue {{as it has been}} stated and restated by my opponent: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' cried Mrs. Beecher, 'with {{some sort}} of {{jewelling}} upon it. That was just what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Of course it should be cut classically and draped--my dressmaker is such a treasure--and I should have a gold embroidery upon the white silk.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, yes, thought I, it {{was this}} appeal to the æsthetic faculty which {{attracted}} me from the first, and not, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined,</b> the mere curiosity of the naturalist interested mainly and always in the habits of living things, plant or animal.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that more}} {{peaceful}} state, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> her, in the moonlight, {{coming to me}} and taking me out to show me that the home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active, cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot satisfy myself {{whether she}} told me that Mr. Micawber had been an officer in the Marines, or whether <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> it. <b>I</b> only know that I believe to this hour that he WAS in the Marines once upon a time, without knowing why. He was a sort of town {{traveller}} for a number of miscellaneous houses, now; but made little or nothing of it, I am afraid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know you}} cared for {{that sort of}} stuff," [...] he said. [...] "Knibbs writes man-verse. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that it would appeal to a young lady." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I had no {{idea that}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> {{anything}} so charming! If this critical bookstore doesn't succeed, it'll be because there are no critics. But what--what are these little things hung against the partitions of the shelves?" ...|$|E
60|$|I knew of them (by report), and was {{prepared}} for trouble, but their clanging cries, their cynical eyes, their clutching insolent hands were more terrifying than anything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined.</b> Their faces expressed something remorseless, inhuman and mocking. Their grins were like those of wolves.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Chris Holtzmann {{was very}} much {{the style of a}} man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>imagined</b> him to be. He was short and stout, with a thick neck and a double chin. He was loudly dressed, {{including}} several seal rings and a heavy gold watch chain.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} me in a most {{singular}} fashion. Had it not been too fiendish, <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> that the gleam of the fanlight showed exultation in his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Foster, [...] "I'll pay you a {{compliment}} {{by stating that}} <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> it; but <b>I</b> don't understand what the police {{have to do with}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Teresa. Say {{rather that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> it [...] A {{possible}} thing: {{and it has}} sooth'd my soul [...] As other fancies have; but ne'er seduced me [...] 25 [...] To traffic with the black and frenzied hope [...] That the dead {{hear the voice of}} witch or wizard. [...] [To ALVAR. [...] Stranger, I mourn and blush to see you here, [...] On such employment! With far other thoughts [...] I left you. [...] 30 ...|$|R
