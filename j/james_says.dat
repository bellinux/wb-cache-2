5|$|World in Action {{issued a}} press release {{the day before the}} broadcast, {{stimulating}} numerous phone calls to Pusztai and the Institute from government, industrial, non-governmental and media organisations. <b>James</b> <b>says</b> he was dismayed that unpublished data had been released and withdrew Pusztai from any further media commitments that morning. He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. <b>James</b> <b>says</b> that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
25|$|Bill <b>James</b> <b>says</b> that Wagner {{is easily}} the {{greatest}} shortstop of all time, {{noting that the}} difference between Wagner and the second greatest shortstop, in James's estimation Arky Vaughan, is roughly the same as the gulf between Vaughan and the 20th greatest shortstop.|$|E

50|$|He {{was ordained}} at Durham by Bishop Tunstall in 1539. After Elizabeth I's {{accession}} he never entered a church, but wandered about Durham and Yorkshire, with occasional visits to Lancashire.

25|$|In Unreliable Memoirs, <b>James</b> <b>says</b> an IQ test {{taken in}} {{childhood}} scored him at 140. He was educated at Sydney Technical High School (despite winning a bursary award to Sydney Boys High School) and the University of Sydney, {{where he studied}} English and Psychology from 1957 to 1960, and became associated with the Sydney Push, a libertarian, intellectual subculture. At the university, he edited the student newspaper, Honi Soit, and directed the annual Union Revue. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in English in 1961. After graduating, James worked for a year as an assistant editor for The Sydney Morning Herald.|$|E
25|$|Later at Steven's memorial, once Kathy and Ian {{are walking}} away, a man leaves flowers for Kathy. The man is {{revealed}} to be Willmott-Brown and that Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner), Luke Browning (Adam Astill) and Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) are his children. On Halloween, Michelle tells Kathy about her stalker, Tom Bailey (Daniel Casey) and she and Michelle give relationship advice to Shakil Kazemi (Shaheen Jafargholi) about Bex. When Kathy shuts up the café, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they are alike and <b>James</b> <b>says</b> {{the reason for his}} visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened {{on the night of the}} rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to know when he decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when he locked up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James.|$|E

'But I was always {{interested}} in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted {{to make him feel}} good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I {{was the only one who}} did this,' <b>James</b> <b>says.</b> 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.' 'This is not a fetish,' <b>James</b> <b>says</b> of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Elijah is {{mentioned}} four more {{times in the}} New Testament: in Luke, Romans, Hebrews, and James. In , Jesus uses Elijah {{as an example of}} rejected prophets. Jesus says, [...] "No prophet is accepted in his own country," [...] and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In , Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). [...] ("Women received their dead raised to life again...") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha raising the son of the woman of Shunem, citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith. In , <b>James</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much," [...] and then cites Elijah's prayers which started and ended the famine in Israel as examples.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Littlejohn Berwick had {{suffered}} minimal casualties, only four men wounded. This had {{been attributed to}} a French desire not to damage the ship too severely and thus only targeting the jury rigging {{during most of the}} engagement. In addition to Lejoille, seven were wounded on Alceste and there were no losses on any of the other French ships present. The crew were removed from Berwick and shared amongst the other ships of the pursuit squadron, forbidden to take any baggage with them except the clothes they wore; British historian William <b>James</b> <b>says</b> that they were [...] "shamefully treated". The officers were later exchanged and honourably acquitted at the subsequent court-martial into the loss of the ship. James and later historian William Laird Clowes both blame Hotham for the loss of the ship through his impatience in sailing for Leghorn and abandoning an obviously vulnerable and disabled member of his fleet.|$|E

5|$|Anna Louise Mohan {{was born}} in 1885 in San Francisco, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in Pennsylvania, became a {{journalist}} and stump speaker involved in labor issues and Democratic Party politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, {{who grew up on}} the ranch of her stepfather, <b>James</b> <b>Say,</b> near Humboldt Lake in Nevada. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, the family moved to Reno, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the Southern Pacific railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in Wadsworth, Nevada, Louise accepted an invitation from <b>James</b> <b>Say</b> to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never changed it legally from Mohan.|$|R

6000|$|There no grace thrives, neither faith, hope, love, nor any grace. This {{is evident}} from that general exhortation, [...] "Perfecting holiness in the fear of God" [...] (2 Cor 7:1). Perfecting holiness, what is that? but as <b>James</b> <b>says</b> of patience, let every grace have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing (James 1:4).|$|E
6000|$|And how comes it {{also that}} the New Testament says {{distinctly}} that man is still made in the likeness of God? For St. Paul speaks of man as 'the likeness and glory of God.' And St. <b>James</b> <b>says</b> of the tongue, 'Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith' (to our shame) 'curse we men, which {{are made in the}} likeness of God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{they get}} double-minded, unstable, inconsistent, as St. <b>James</b> <b>says,</b> {{in all their}} ways; trying to serve God and Mammon at once. Trying to do good--as long as doing good does not hurt them in the world's eyes; but longing oftener and oftener to do wrong, if only God would not be angry. Then comes on Balaam's frame of mind, 'If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Ruthven had tried, <b>James</b> <b>says,</b> {{to induce}} him to refuse {{the company of}} the courtiers. Three or four servants, he said, would be enough.

6000|$|... "James says so. He {{says it is}} abominable, and {{not like}} a gentleman. And {{there never was a}} better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon wanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr. Ladislaw--which is ridiculous. Only <b>James</b> <b>says</b> it was to hinder Mr. Ladislaw from wanting to marry you for your money--just as if he ever would think of making you an offer.

60|$|Oh! my friends, {{when people}} are talking about faith and works, and trying to {{reconcile}} St. Paul and St. James, as they call it, because St. Paul says Abraham was justified by faith, and St. <b>James</b> <b>says</b> Abraham was justified by works, if they would but pray for the simple, childlike heart, and the head of common sense, and look at their own children, who, every time they go on a message for them, settle, without knowing it, this mighty difference of man's making between faith and works. You tell a little child daily to do many things the meaning and use of which it cannot understand; and the child has faith in what you tell it; and, therefore, it does what you tell it, and so it shews its faith in you by obedience in working for you.|$|E
