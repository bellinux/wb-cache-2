40|$|Diatoms have ornate biosilica frustules {{that are}} species-specific and are formed under genetic control. We have {{observed}} interesting {{changes in the}} shape of diatoms both in laboratory cultures and in nature when they are exposed to different environmental conditions such as flow rate or UV radiation. It has been recently discovered that biosilica formation is facilitated by a variety of biological organic molecules. For example, it is proposed that silaffin proteins and ‘small' propylamines are involved in diatom biosilicification. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> help to understand the role(s) of organic biomolecules in vivo, model in vitro studies have been carried out where synthetic and biological molecules have been studied for their effects on silica formation. The study of silica formation using R 5 peptide which is derived from silaffin proteins is one such example. An interesting observation is that flow can change the structure of both synthetic and biological minerals...|$|E
