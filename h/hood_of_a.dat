5|$|The {{beginning}} of the video is shot in black-and-white, and shows Derulo sitting on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corvette outside a Malibu mansion dressed in 1920s attire. In another scene, Derulo is seen dancing at {{an area of the}} mansion which is surrounded by trees. The video then shows intercut scenes in full color of Derulo at the beach, on the mansion's balcony, and in the bedroom with his love interest (played by Tika Sumpter). More scenes in full color, show Derulo on the balcony interacting with her, and also shows him singing to her in the bedroom using a microphone. During another scene, Derulo is seen dressed in all white. The video ends with a kissing scene between the two which then fades away.|$|E
5|$|The healthy Joker that Talia impaled then reanimates {{into the}} shapeshifting Clayface, who is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. Batman defeats Clayface despite Joker blowing up the theater floor. Batman drinks {{a portion of the}} antidote, and destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it. As Batman debates curing his foe, Joker attacks him, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police car and leaves in silence.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} the Czech Republic later in May, {{scheduled}} for 12 weeks of shooting, which included a scene in Pernštejn Castle. Using a former sugar factory in Prague, production designer John Myhre constructed a large textile factory {{as part of an}} industrial world, the setting of a mythological environment in which looms create fabrics that weavers interpret as assassination orders. Afterward, filming moved to Budapest, then returned to Chicago in August. While the actors performed many of their own stunts, with free running and parkour in some of the action scenes, and Angelina Jolie being actually strapped to the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> moving Dodge Viper, some of the especially high-risk sequences required digital doubles instead. Two full-sized train cars were built, a Chicago 'L' for a training scene where Fox and Wesley run atop a train, and a Czech Pendolino for the derailment, which was stationed in a gimbal equipped with hydraulics to allow the car to tilt and roll as the train crashed. The film originally had both an alternate opening and an alternate ending. The alternate opening, a flashback to ancient times describing the history of the Fraternity and the Loom of Fate, is available on the special edition DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E

25|$|At 12:35a.m., at 2112 North Foster Drive in {{the parking}} lot of Triple S Food Mart, Sterling was {{detained}} by Baton Rouge Police Department officers. This came after an anonymous caller reported that a man was threatening him and waving a handgun while in the process of selling CDs. The officers tased Sterling for resisting several times, then forced the heavy-set man to the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sedan and then to the ground. Sterling was pinned to the ground by both officers; one kneeling on his chest and the other on his thigh, both attempting to control his arms.|$|E
25|$|Prazina {{was accused}} of {{committing}} various war crimes {{over the course of}} the war. An order from president Izetbegović placed Prazina beyond the control of the military police, and his men were known to take prisoners of war from government prisons for their own purposes. Many regular residents of Sarajevo were also treated harshly; members of his unit were involved in extortion, looting and rape, as well as various instances of violence against civilians. In one case, while on Mt. Igman, Prazina personally beat one fleeing civilian's head against the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car. Within the city, Prazina's Wolves were known for appropriating apartments and abducting and abusing their owners. Furthermore, as part of black market activities, Prazina's unit frequently raided the city's shops and warehouses.|$|E

25|$|The {{ordinary}} Bohra {{is highly}} conscious of his identity, {{and this is}} especially demonstrated at religious and traditional occasions by the appearance and attire of the participants. Dawoodi Bohra men wear a traditional white three-piece outfit, plus a white and gold cap (called a topi), and women wear the rida, a distinctive form of the commonly known burqa which is distinguished from other forms of the veil due to it often being in color and decorated with patterns and lace. The rida's difference from the burqa, however, is significant beyond just the colour, pattern and lace. The rida does not call for covering of women's faces like the traditional veil. It has a flap called the 'pardi' that usually hangs on the back like the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> jacket {{but it is not}} used to conceal the face. This is representative of the Dawoodi Bohra community's values of equality and justice for women, which they believe, is a tenet of the Fatimid Imamate's evolved understanding of Islam and the true meaning of women's chastity in Islam. The Dawoodi Bohra community also do not prevent their women from coming to mosques, attending religious gatherings or going to places of pilgrimage. It is often regarded as the most peaceful sect of Islam and an example of true Sufism; it has been critically acclaimed on several occasions even by Western governments such as those of the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and particularly the United States for its progressive outlook towards gender roles, adoption of technology, promotion of literature, crafts, business and secular values. However, the Dawoodi Bohras are highly single-minded about inter-caste or inter-faith marriage. They do not oppose it but do not encourage it either. If a Dawoodi Bohra member does marry into another caste or religion, he or she is usually advised to ask his or her spouse to convert to Islam and, specifically, into the community.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} also {{added to the}} setlist of The Monster Ball Tour. During the 2009 leg of the tour, she {{performed}} it as the second song of the list. After the opening song [...] "Dance in the Dark", she strapped on a portable silver jewelled keyboard and started performing [...] "Just Dance" [...] while inside a white cube from which she emerged from the top, and the video screen came up. She was raised on a platform with a keytar over her shoulder as eight dancers in white bodysuits locked into steps below her. During the revamped Monster Ball shows, in 2010-11, Gaga wore a futuristic [...] "glitter ball suit", and started the performance by playing on a keyboard hidden inside the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Rolls Royce. In May 2011, Gaga performed the song during Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, Cumbria. She also made her debut performance on Irish TV screens performing Just Dance, on the Irish talk show Tubridy Tonight in January 2009.|$|E
500|$|After revisions, {{the show}} was divided into four sections: City, Subway, Forest, Monster Ball and {{concluded}} with an encore. It began with a projected video onto a curtain—which contained images of Gaga smoking a cigarette—while a club remix of [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] played. Surrounded by violet light, her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed [...] "Dance in the Dark". Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached, the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed. Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a [...] "futuristic, angular, glitter ball suit". After descending from her fire escape, she poked around in the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dilapidated green Rolls Royce while performing [...] "Glitter and Grease". Upon checking under the vehicle's bonnet, Gaga revealed a keyboard and began to play the opening notes of [...] "Just Dance". Gaga then performed [...] "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" [...] while scaling various pieces of scaffolding and subsequently [...] "The Fame" [...] where she rose from beneath the stage and played her keytar Emma, wearing a giant red cape.|$|E

50|$|The reasons railroads ordered B units {{included}} {{the fact that}} a B unit was slightly cheaper. With no driving cab, B units lack windshields, crew seats, radios, heating, and air conditioning. There would also be no toilets, which were usually found in the short <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> A unit. Additionally, at first, railroads bought multiple-unit diesel locomotives as one-for-one replacements for steam locomotives; as a result, railroads could not take advantage of the flexibility afforded by interchangeable units, which could be assembled into any required power output. When a three- or four-unit locomotive was considered an indivisible unit, {{there was no point in}} the intermediate units having cabs. Finally, B units gave a smoother line to the train for passenger service.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My Immortal" [...] begins with Lee {{sitting on a}} fountain. Her legs and arms are covered with bandage as she puts them in the water. She is wearing a long white dress and is seen walking around the fountain, {{surrounded}} by children and other people {{that appear to be}} unaware or indifferent to her presence and wearabouts. Shots of Moody follow, who appears to be sullen and withdrawn. He is wearing a suit and his feet are bare. His shoulders sag and his head slumps forward as he delicately plays piano, and he later picks up his jacket as if he is about to leave. When the bridge starts, the band is shot performing in one room while Moody is in another, playing on the piano. Throughout the video, Lee is never filmed on ground level. She walks along the ledge of a fountain, sits in a tree and sings lying on top of a building. She also lies atop scaffolding and on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car surrounded with leaves.|$|E
500|$|Thousands {{of people}} had {{gathered}} {{in front of the}} Stonewall, which had opened again, choking Christopher Street until the crowd spilled into adjoining blocks. The throng surrounded buses and cars, harassing the occupants unless they either admitted they were gay or indicated their support for the demonstrators. Sylvia Rivera saw a friend of hers jump on a nearby car trying to drive through; the crowd rocked the car back and forth, terrifying its occupants. Another of Rivera's friends, Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American street queen, climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy bag onto the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> police car, shattering the windshield. As on the previous evening, fires were started in garbage cans throughout the neighborhood. More than a hundred police were present from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Precincts, but after 2:00a.m. the TPF arrived again. Kick lines and police chases waxed and waned; when police captured demonstrators, whom the majority of witnesses described as [...] "sissies" [...] or [...] "swishes", the crowd surged to recapture them. Street battling ensued again until 4:00a.m.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately I decided to take a break, and I’ve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to give a little wink toward the things that I’ve been doing, so that’s why I’m a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] of what she was doing right then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} started life as DA class, {{built by}} General Motors Canada between 1955 and 1967. Between 1978 and 1983, 85 of the later-build DAs were rebuilt as EMD model G22AR, {{designated as the}} DC class, with upgraded engines, new cabs and low short <b>hoods</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> style similar to the DX class introduced earlier in the 1970s and the DF class being introduced at the time. Five were rebuilt at the Hutt Workshops near Wellington and the other 80 at Clyde Engineering in Australia.|$|R
50|$|A bonnet/hood scoop, {{sometimes}} called bonnet airdam/air dam, is an upraised component on the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> motor vehicle that either allows <b>a</b> flow <b>of</b> air to directly enter the engine compartment, or appears to do so. It {{has only one}} opening and is closed on all other sides. Its main function is to allow <b>a</b> direct flow <b>of</b> air to the engine, hence the need {{for it to be}} upraised so as to effectively channel air to the engine compartment. It may be closed, and thus purely decorative, or serve to enhance performance in several possible ways.|$|R

2500|$|Hood or Parka hood (nacaq, uqurrsuk in Yup'ik, nacar in Cup'ig) is {{a common}} hat on the parka. The Greenlandic Inuit (Kalaallit, Tunumiit, and Inughuit), the Canadian Inuit, and the Alaskan Iñupiat and Yup’ik usually wear a parka style which has an {{attached}} hood with a fur ruff to protect the face. These hoods are usually trimmed with an Arctic fox tail, or a broad strip of wolf or wolverine fur. The tengqucuk is a tip of parka hood; the kak’acuk is a pompon on tip of parka hood or hat; the kakauyaq is a decoration at the crown of the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young woman’s traditional Yup’ik parka that consists of strands of red, black, and, white beads or strips of calfskin; the menglairun is a strip of fur between the ruff and <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> parka. The formation of the Eskimo Nebula resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. The emperor goose's Yup’ik name nacaullek literally means [...] "one having a parka hood".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the earlier}} names of Nagpur was [...] "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the 'Fana' or <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cobra.

It is this jewel that lights up the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper. The river Nag flows through the city. B. R. Ambedkar claimed that both the city and the river are named after [...] "Nag people". The word [...] "pur" [...] means [...] "city" [...] in many Indian languages.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{persistent}} challenge for developers who want to visualize the process that is executed under the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> application. Typically, such a process is initiated by an end-user via the user interface. It is quite natural that the execution steps in the process are not visible {{from the perspective of}} the user interface, except when an error occurs. Hence, the end-user is often unaware of the complexity or the distributed character of the executed process. And we want to keep it that way, except in the cases where we use the application for demonstration, instruction or scientific purposes, with the focus on what exactly happens under the <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> the application when we perform a particular action.

50|$|The red {{aspect is}} usually {{positioned}} {{at the bottom}} of pole and gantry mounted signals is so that snow does not build up on the lens <b>hood</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aspect placed below the red aspect, resulting in the aspect becoming obscured. Similarly it is placed at the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ground mounted signal to minimize the risk of the red aspect becoming obscured by snow build up on the ground. Signal alignment is generally aimed towards a distance 200 metres in rear of the signal and at <b>a</b> height <b>of</b> 2.5 to 3 m from the left hand rail. Ground mounted signals are rarely so critical for alignment (hence ground mounting) and are often used in tunnels where the relative luminosity of the aspects are much higher.|$|R
