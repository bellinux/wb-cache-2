5|$|Levin {{was interviewed}} by police in November 1985, when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete; he told the court in 2014 that that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> The court heard that, during Nove's 1992–1994 investigation, police offered Levin {{immunity}} from prosecution, gave him £5,000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday. They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Modi's {{relationship}} with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee (who asked Modi for tolerance {{in the aftermath}} of the 2002 Gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. After the elections Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to leave Modi in office after the riots.|$|E
5|$|Sinden {{had changed}} the lineup and the Canadian goals were all scored by players Sinden had {{inserted}} in place of players who had played in Winnipeg. Still, Sinden felt that changing the lineup <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> According to Sinden, Ken Dryden, who had replaced Tony Esposito, {{did not have a}} good game; he was shaky and Tretiak was great. According to Conacher, the Soviets used cross-ice passing in the attacking zone, a tactic that caused problems for Dryden. Serge Savard missed the game after fracturing his ankle in practice.|$|E

5|$|Back in New Zealand, Lynch {{did well}} in the premier women's road stage race in 1991 and 1992, and won bronze in the 1991 New Zealand National Road Race Championships, yet was not picked for the 1992 Olympic road cycling team. Her biographer speculates that the {{selectors}} were possibly influenced in their decision by Lynch's failure to get Harris into a medal position at the 1990 Commonwealth Games. She competed hard in the 1992 Tour Cycliste Féminin – the Tour de France for women. The ten-stage race was the most challenging event on the women's road racing calendar that year, and many big names entered. New Zealand had six competitors. Lynch {{set the tone for}} the team by coming fourth in the prologue in Paris. Jacqui Nelson and Lynch were the only New Zealanders remaining in the final stage, and Lynch came sixth ascending into Alpe d'Huez. Her biographer suggests that she made her point that her omission from the 1992 Olympic team <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Khan required five costumes, {{more than any}} other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Costume designer William Ware Theiss found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the decompression chamber in sickbay, and the set on board Botany Bay. A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.|$|E
5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. In addition to providing pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E
25|$|Journalist Peter Lewis {{would later}} cite that {{the removal of}} Beazley as ALP leader in 2006 may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in retrospect given the {{leadership}} crisis that would later ensue with the removal of Rudd as Prime Minister in 2010.|$|R
50|$|On 15 February 2013, the American Ornithologists' Union marked {{this species}} in their {{database}} as a taxonomic synonym to the incertae sedis family containing the bananaquit. No explanation was given, {{and it would}} seem this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R

5|$|Having been {{promoted}} {{weeks after the}} end of the previous season and not being granted an increased wage budget, Smith felt he had a tough job in keeping Sunderland in the top flight in 1990–91. He allowed Gates and MacPhail to leave on free transfers in order to free up money to bring in new players. He spent £350,000 on Portsmouth defender Kevin Ball and took midfielder Peter Davenport from rivals Middlesbrough; Ball would prove to be a success, though Smith admitted in his autobiography that signing Davenport <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that left him unable to bring in any further players, as his small budget was spent. He was given further funds in February 1991 as Sunderland were engaged in a relegation battle, and Smith spent £225,000 on midfielder Brian Mooney, who had a limited impact due to injuries. On the final day of the season Sunderland had to better Luton Town's result at home to Derby in their match against Manchester City at Maine Road, but they lost 3–2 and were relegated back into the Second Division.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s, traffic {{congestion}} worsened. By the mid-1980s, Istanbulians {{realized that the}} uncontrolled extension of motorization & closure of the tram network <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Other cities around the world, e.g. Tunis and Buenos Aires, also understood that error, and like them, Istanbul also planned the return of tramway.|$|E
25|$|After the {{war ended}} and {{first-class}} cricket resumed, the 35-year-old Oldfield could not agree terms with Lancashire and left. In later years, he reflected that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to leave Lancashire. In the 151 first-class matches he played for Lancashire, Oldfield scored 7,002 runs {{at an average of}} 35.72 with 12 centuries.|$|E
50|$|WAL = {{selected}} by W. A. Lambeth in Outing. The Vanderbilt Hustler reported his selection of Fitzgerald must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> for he <b>was</b> only <b>a</b> sub and in 1896 and 1897, while in 1898 {{he was no}} longer on the team.|$|R

25|$|The {{attack was}} {{attributed}} to the bandit and separatist leader Salvatore Giuliano. His aim had been to punish local leftists for the recent election results. In an open letter he took sole responsibility for the murders and claimed that he had only wanted his men to fire above {{the heads of the}} crowd; the deaths <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, the Leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, {{stated that}} he thought that the Labour government's {{decision}} to permit the unlimited immigration of eastern European migrants <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> arguing that they had underestimated the potential number of migrants and that the scale of migration had had a negative impact on wages.|$|E
25|$|In late 1940, {{following}} {{the campaign in}} France and Belgium in the spring, it was realised that there were insufficient infantry and support units, and mixing light and cruiser tanks in the same brigade <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> The armoured divisions' organisation was changed so that each armoured brigade now incorporated a motorised infantry battalion, and a third battalion was present within the Support Group.|$|E

25|$|Monkhouse <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vocal {{supporter}} of the Conservative Party for some years.

50|$|Since 1980, {{linguists}} studying children, such as Melissa Bowerman, {{and psychologists}} following Jean Piaget, like Elizabeth Bates and Jean Mandler, came {{to suspect that}} there may indeed be many learning processes involved in the acquisition process, and that ignoring the role of learning may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R
25|$|Both {{his mother}} and step-father died in 1989 and his {{marriage}} to Cathy ended by 1995. Young married Rose McKimmie on 24 December 1999 in Bali and {{they lived in a}} battery-operated rural cottage about an hour-and-half from Melbourne. In February 2014 he said the marriage to Rose <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and lasted only eighteen months. At that time he had been married to a Polish-born, Marisha, for 12 years.|$|E
25|$|After {{it became}} clear that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to ignore the issue of PC compatibility, Wang belatedly {{released}} an emulation board for Wang PC that enabled operation of many PC compatible software packages. The board accomplished this by monitoring all I/O and memory transactions (visible in those days before North/South bridge chips to any board plugged into a slot on the expansion bus) and generating a non-maskable interrupt (NMI) whenever an operation was deemed to involve an incompatible device, requiring emulation.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{reputation}} {{there were}} some incidents of indiscipline—particularly on New Britain during the raising of 2 NGIB—but these were usually related to pay and conditions or perhaps to perceived 'insensitivity' {{on the part of}} Australian officers. Regardless, in an expression of the colonial politics of the time some segments of the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU), which had opposed the raising of native units in the first place, used these incidents to 'prove' that their formation <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> all along.|$|E

25|$|Driven by live {{coverage}} of the year's US presidential election, 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history. Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the Trump campaign rallies. Aides for Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz accused CNN president Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the Republican primaries. Zucker acknowledged that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to air so many of the campaign rallies. CNN also drew criticism during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|By 1938, {{the only}} use the Germans {{had for the}} {{agreement}} was to threaten to renounce {{it as a way}} of pressuring London to accept Continental Europe as Germany's rightful sphere of influence. At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, and Hermann Göring, the latter stated it had never been valued in England, and he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> but Germany was nevertheless not going to remain in a state of inferiority in this respect vis-à-vis a hostile Britain, and would build up to a 100 per cent. basis.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2010, it was {{reported}} that payments worth €1,400 had been made from a credit card found on the body of historian Andrzej Przewoźnik, one of the victims of the crash. Credit cards belonging to the politician Aleksandra Natalli-Świat were also missing, but not used in transactions. On 8 June 2010, ITAR-TASS reported that four soldiers of Unit 06755 had been charged in connection with the theft, after being found in possession of three credit cards used to withdraw a total of 60,345 rubles. A Polish spokesperson said that the first withdrawals using the cards had been made around two hours after the crash. The Polish government admitted that the Russian soldiers involved in the theft were probably conscripts, and that earlier reports blaming members of Russia's OMON forces for the theft <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E

50|$|One subgenre of screwball {{is known}} as the comedy of remarriage, in which {{characters}} divorce and then remarry one another (The Awful Truth (1937), The Philadelphia Story (1940)).
