25|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>snowing</b> and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip only {{a few feet from the}} ground. As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E
500|$|Zero-Hour had {{originally}} been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours {{at the request of}} the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. Zero-Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>snowing</b> heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man's land were hindered by large drifts. It was still dark and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers' backs blowing [...] "a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans". The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dug-outs of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches.|$|E
500|$|Mary {{became a}} {{domiciliary}} health visitor and midwife, and was on-call day or night, [...] {{where she was}} needed as a midwife. Her eldest son, Paul, said his first memory was watching her cycling away when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>snowing</b> heavily. After she {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer, Mary still carried on cycling to work, but often doubled up in pain and had trouble breathing. The day Mary was due to have a mastectomy operation, she cleaned the McCartney house and laid her two sons' school clothes out, ready for the next day. She said to Dill Mohin, her sister-in-law, [...] "Now everything's ready for them in case I don't come back." [...] Mary died of an embolism on 31 October 1956, after an operation {{to stop the spread of}} breast cancer. Her last words to Dill Mohin were [...] "I would love to have seen the boys growing up." [...] Mary was buried on 3 November 1956 at Yew Tree Cemetery, Finch Lane, Liverpool. Paul later named his daughter Mary after his mother, and Michael released an album entitled Woman in 1972, including the song, [...] "Woman," [...] with a photo of Mary on the front cover.|$|E

2500|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{began its}} {{investigation}} at 2:30 P.M. on October 26, 1947, {{less than an}} hour after the last known communication with Flight 923.

2500|$|Jeckeln {{seems to}} have wanted to {{continue}} the murders on December 1, but did not. [...] Professor Ezergailis proposed that Jeckeln may have been bothered by problems such {{the resistance of the}} Jews in Riga. [...] In any case, the killing did not resume until Monday, December 8, 1941. [...] According to Professor Ezergailis, this time 300 Jews were murdered in forcing people out of the ghetto. (Another source reports that the brutality in the Ghetto was worse on December 8 than on November 30.). [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>snowing</b> that Monday, and the people may have believed that the worst had past. [...] Even so, the columns were formed up and marched out of the city just as on Sunday, November 30, but with some differences. [...] The 20 kilogram packs were not carried to the site, as they had been on November 30, but were left in the ghetto. [...] Their owners were told that their luggage would be carried on by truck to the fictitious point of departure for resettlement. [...] Mothers with small children and older people were told they could ride by sleigh, and sleighs were in fact available. At least two policemen who had played some role in the November 30 massacre refused to participate again on December 8. [...] These were the German Zimmermann and the Latvian Vilnis. [...] The march itself was fast-paced and brutal. [...] Many people were trampled to death.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 November 1966, Clipper München, a Pan Am Boeing 727-21 (registration N317PA) {{operating}} the return {{leg of the}} airline's daily cargo flight from Berlin to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport (flight number PA 708) was due to land that night at Tegel Airport, rather than Tempelhof, due to runway resurfacing work taking place at that time at the latter. Berlin Control had cleared flight 708 for an instrument landing system approach to Tegel Airport's runway 08, soon after the crew had begun its descent from FL030 before entering the southwest air corridor over East Germany on the last stretch of its journey to Berlin. The aircraft impacted the ground near Dallgow, East Germany, almost immediately after the crew had acknowledged further instructions received from Berlin Control, just [...] from Tegel Airport.

Following the accident, the Soviet military authorities in East Germany returned only half of the aircraft's wreckage to their US counterparts in West Berlin. This excluded vital parts, such as the flight data recorder, the cockpit voice recorder as well as the plane's flight control systems, its navigation and communication equipment. The subsequent National Transportation Safety Board investigation report concluded that the aircraft's descent below its altitude clearance limit was the accident's probable cause. However, the NTSB was unable to establish the factors that had caused the crew to descend below its cleared minimum altitude.|$|E
