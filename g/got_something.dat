5|$|In a side plot, a love {{triangle}} develops between Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza) and Ann. In an interview, Ann says Andy {{is a fun}} {{person but}} was a terrible boyfriend because he is completely reliant on others. When learning self-defense from Ron, Ann takes down Andy with a wrist grab, impressing Andy but making April jealous. After Andy is accidentally knocked out by Ron, Ann later approaches Andy at his shoe shine stand and brings him gifts to help him feel better. April arrives and Andy gives her a vegetarian muffin.

5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he <b>got</b> <b>something</b> wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E

25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem {{to come from the}} reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader <b>got</b> <b>something</b> correct.|$|E
25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one <b>got</b> <b>something</b> for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E

The title song has a notably country-soul feel about it and the album ended with another country tune, [...] "Moonshine Whiskey". Morrison said he originally intended to make an all country album. The recordings were as live as possible – after rehearsing the songs the musicians would enter the studio and play a whole set in one take. His co-producer, Ted Templeman, described this recording process as the [...] "scariest thing I've ever seen. When he's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing." ...|$|E

500|$|Rogan {{writes in}} the book's introduction: [...] "an {{important}} caveat to any serious, well-researched biography or study of Morrison's life is that the reader {{should be aware that}} a number of allegations against the subject cannot be featured in print for legal reasons. The author may feel that the final portrayal is far too flattering in certain places, while the reader who neglects to read between the lines may think the biographer could have been a little more sympathetic at times. Death alone will open this Pandora's box." [...] Morrison himself is quoted on the first page of the book, saying: [...] "Rogan's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to hide. What's he hiding?

500|$|On 6 December 2004 an {{expanded}} version of The Holy Bible was released, containing two CDs and a DVD. Disc one comprised a digitally re-mastered {{version of the}} original album plus four live tracks. The DVD features {{an interview with the}} band, footage of TV and festival appearances and promo videos. The second disc includes a remix of the album by Tom Lord-Alge. The remixed version had been intended for release in the US, but this never happened [...] "for well-documented reasons", according to James Dean Bradfield. The band felt the second mix was superior to the version originally released. As Bradfield puts it: [...] "For once we <b>got</b> <b>something</b> back from the American record company—who we despised—and it was brilliant".|$|E

500|$|... "Between You and Me" [...] {{is built}} around {{acoustic}} strumming and synthesized drums, courtesy of Scott Williamson. The song begins with acoustic strumming in the key of G major. The song then moves into the key of E major during the verses. [...] "Between You and Me" [...] features a chorus {{that is in the}} key of G major; in addition, the chorus is composed of [...] "boyish lead vocals", [...] "sweet harmonies", and [...] "whirling organs". During the verses, Michael Tait, Kevin Max, and Toby McKeehan take turns singing lead. The second chorus is followed by a melodic breakdown featuring minimalistic guitar and whispered vocals. The song then repeats the line [...] "It's my way to freedom" [...] and [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to say" [...] until the end.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I <b>got</b> <b>{{something}}</b> to say about it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|The vocals on {{the album}} were always live after rehearsing each song five or six times, {{according}} to saxophonist and flautist [...] "Boots" [...] Houston, who further commented that when Morrison and the band went into the studio: [...] "we would then just play a whole set straight through without repeating anything. [...] We would have played maybe twenty songs and Van would go back and cut out the songs he didn't want. The only time we'd go back would be to overdub backing vocals or horns." [...] Ted Templeman remarked {{that he had to}} go through three engineers during the recording of the album, due to Morrison's [...] "ability as a musician, arranger and producer": [...] "When he's <b>got</b> <b>something</b> together, he wants to put it down right away with no overdubbing ...

500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{begins with}} a low {{fidelity}} indie rock arrangement which is brought about by distorted guitar arpeggios and a discreet pipe organ. Beyoncé sings a meandering melody as she alternately references the pleasures of love and sex. Using simple arithmetic to describe her undying love for her partner, she begins the first verse as she affirms to her romantic interest {{that the only thing}} she is sure about is her feelings for him, [...] "I don't know much about algebra, but I know that one plus one equals two ... If I ain't <b>got</b> <b>something,</b> I don't give a damn / 'Cause I got it with you". In the pre-chorus lines, Beyoncé expresses her reliance on her man without whom she believes to be incomplete as she sings, [...] "And it's me and you, that's all we'll have when the world is through / Because baby we ain't got nothing without love / Darling, you got enough love for the both of us".|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And I passed you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{was set to}} star in a {{film version}} of The Yearling for 1942, but on-set {{difficulties}} and bad weather forced the production to close.

She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle, The Philadelphia Story (1940). Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for Woman of the Year, saying [...] "I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me." [...] The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews. William Boehnel wrote in the New York World-Telegram, [...] "To begin with, it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles. This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable. But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot, you've <b>got</b> <b>something</b> to cheer about." ...|$|E
