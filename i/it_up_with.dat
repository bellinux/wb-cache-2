On April 19, 2013, {{it was announced}} that Scorsese would begin production on Silence in 2014, after a reputed 23-year wait. Irwin Winkler was announced as a producer the same day, as were Randall Emmett and George Furla, who would finance the production through their company Emmett/Furla Films. Paul Breuls' Corsan Films was also reportedly funding the project. Additionally, {{it was announced that}} the film would be shot in Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Before {{returning}} {{to play for}} Somerset, Mitchell-Innes once again featured for the Gentlemen at Lord's, though in a low-scoring match, he was dismissed for less than 20 runs in each innings. In six matches for Somerset in July and August, Mitchell-Innes scored 499 runs, and his average of 55.44 was the county's best that season. He scored 182, his best score for Somerset, in a County Championship match against Worcestershire, and followed <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> another century in the next match, against Lancashire. In all, 1936 was statistically Mitchell-Innes' best season; he scored 1,438 runs {{at an average of}} 44.93.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the series}} had premiered, some media critics {{stated that the}} series had {{potential}} to become a ratings hit and possibly raise NBC from being the fourth highest-rated network out of five. Greenblatt has also stated that he has high hopes for the series. In {{order to make it}} more likely the series will be a success, NBC picked the series up for 15 episodes and opted to hold the show for mid-season in order to pair <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the hit reality show The Voice on Monday nights. Despite this, other media critics have said unless the series receives a rating above a 3.0 rating in the 18–49 demographic, it will be considered a failure, and only two other NBC series ranked above a 3.0 rating at the time; Fear Factor and The Office. The series has also been put on Monday nights against CBS, with Monday featuring Two and a Half Men, one of the highest-rated shows of the season. Also, musical shows have a known record for failures, like Cop Rock.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the poor}} run of form, Kohli was {{retained}} in the ODI squad for a three-match series against Australia in October, and in the only completed match of the series at Visakhapatnam, scored his third ODI century–118 off 121 balls–which helped India reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early. Winning {{the man of the}} match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series. Part of a largely inexperienced team for the home ODI series against New Zealand, Kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth ODI hundred and second in succession, in the first game, and followed <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 64 and 63* in the next two matches. India completed a 5–0 whitewash of New Zealand, while Kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the ODI team and made him a strong contender for a spot in India's World Cup squad. He was India's leading run-scorer in ODIs in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, {{he moved}} down a {{division}} to join Conference Premier side Wrexham. He scored his first goal for Wrexham on his debut in a 5–0 win over Stevenage. Whalley followed <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> another goal in a 1–1 draw with Rushden & Diamonds. He scored his {{third and fourth}} goals of the month as Wrexham beat Salisbury City 4–1, which proved to be his last game for that club. He then joined Conference North side Southport on loan in February 2009 {{for the remainder of}} the 2008–09 season. Whalley made his Southport debut in the 2–0 win over Hyde United at Haig Avenue. He went on to play 13 league matches for the team as they reached the Conference North play-offs, but they were defeated in the semi-finals by Gateshead. During the loan spell, Whalley played in the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy, but he could not prevent Southport losing 3–2 on aggregate over two legs against AFC Telford United. In the summer of 2009, he was released by Wrexham along with eight other out-of-contract players.|$|E
5|$|Kohli got double {{centuries in}} the next two test series against England and Bangladesh, making him the first ever batsman to score double centuries in four {{consecutive}} series. He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Indian Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he got his highest Test score of 235. He followed <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> ODI centuries against West Indies and Sri Lanka in consecutive series, equalling Ricky Ponting's tally of 30 ODI centuries. In October 2017, he was adjourned the ODI player of the series against New Zealand for scoring two ODI centuries, during the course of which he made a new record for the most runs (8,888), best average (55.55) and highest number of centuries (31) for any batsman when completing 200 ODIs.|$|E

5|$|Kohli started 2016 {{with scores}} of 91 and 59 {{in the first two}} ODIs of the limited-overs tour of Australia. He {{followed}} <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a pair of hundreds–a run-a-ball 117 at Melbourne and 106 from 92 balls at Canberra–in the next two matches. During the course of the series, he became the fastest batsman in the world to cross the 7000-run mark in ODIs, getting to the milestone in his 161st innings, and the fastest to get to 25 centuries. After the ODI series ended in a 1–4 loss, the Indian team came back to whitewash the Australians 3–0 in the T20I series. Kohli made fifties in all three T20Is {{with scores of}} 90 not out, 59 not out and 50, winning two man of the matches as well as the man of the series award. He was also instrumental in India winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh the following month in which he scored 49 in a run-chase of 84 against Pakistan, followed by an unbeaten 56 against Sri Lanka and 41 not out in the Final against Bangladesh in two more successful chases.|$|E
5|$|Most residents, {{including}} the mayor, supported the parliamentarians during the English Civil War, although its military governor, Colonel Goring, supported the royalists. The town {{became a major}} base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the Siege of Portsmouth; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist garrison in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in Gosport joined in the assault, with their guns damaging St Thomas's Church. On 5September 1642, the remaining royalists in the garrison at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to blow <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> gunpowder. In return, he and his garrison were allowed safe passage.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's next—and final—televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this was unfair and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
