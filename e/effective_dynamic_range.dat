Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile.

Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power.

For interrogation region dimensions typical of many PIV experiments the {{spatial filtering}} inherent in PIV is shown to significantly underestimate turbulent fluctuations, however in practical experiments this effect is largely offset by measurement noise. In order to determine the noise level and the noise-free <b>effective</b> spatial <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of a given PIV measurement it is therefore necessary to compare experimental measurements in terms of the 1 D velocity power spectra and the associated 1 D transfer function of PIV, in both the absence of measurement noise and at the equivalent spatial resolution.

40|$|Equipment and {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to implement a method of photometric calibration of consumer video cameras for imaging of objects that are sufficiently narrow or sufficiently distant to be optically equivalent to point or line sources. Heretofore, it has been difficult to calibrate consumer video cameras, especially in cases of image saturation, because they exhibit nonlinear responses with <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> much smaller than those of scientific-grade video cameras. The present method not only takes this difficulty in stride but also makes it possible to extend <b>effective</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> to several powers of ten beyond saturation levels. The method will likely be primarily useful in astronomical photometry. There are also potential commercial applications in medical and industrial imaging of point or line sources in the presence of saturation. This development was prompted by the need to measure brightnesses of debris in amateur video images of the breakup of the Space Shuttle Columbia. The purpose of these measurements is to use the brightness values to estimate relative masses of debris objects. In most of the images, the brightness of the main body of Columbia was found to exceed the <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> of the cameras. A similar problem arose a few years ago in the analysis of video images of Leonid meteors. The present method is a refined version of the calibration method developed to solve the Leonid calibration problem. In this method, one performs an endto- end calibration of the entire imaging system, including not only the imaging optics and imaging photodetector array but also analog tape recording and playback equipment (if used) and any frame grabber or other analog-to-digital converter (if used). To automatically incorporate the effects of nonlinearity and any other distortions into the calibration, the calibration images are processed in precisely the same manner as are the images of meteors, space-shuttle debris, or other objects that one seeks to analyze. The light source used to generate the calibration images is an artificial variable star comprising a Newtonian collimator illuminated by a light source modulated by a rotating variable neutral- density filter. This source acts as a point source, the brightness of which varies at a known rate. A video camera to be calibrated is aimed at this source. Fixed neutral-density filters are inserted in or removed from the light path as needed to make the video image of the source appear to fluctuate between dark and saturated bright. The resulting video-image data are analyzed by use of custom software that determines the integrated signal in each video frame and determines the system response curve (measured output signal versus input brightness). These determinations constitute the calibration, which is thereafter used in automatic, frame-by-frame processing of the data from the video images to be analyzed...|$|R

The approach was {{to set up a}} small experimental apparatus, develop a torsional vibration detection system, and maximize the dynamic range and the signal to noise ratio. The results of the testing and analysis clearly demonstrated the feasibility of using torsional vibration to detect the change in natural frequency of a blade due to a change in stiffness such as those associated with a blade crack. However, it was found that harmonics of shaft operating speed, created as an unwanted artifact of the measurement method, resulted in spectral regions in which the <b>effective</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> was inadequate to detect low-level torsional vibration associated with the natural frequencies.

This {{has a number of}} advantages. The time delay between the two measurements is eliminated, and the effective measurement time is improved by a factor of two. Moreover, the optical subtraction provides a large reduction in <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of the measured signal, which prevents detector saturation, and enables <b>effective</b> use of <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of the analog to digital converter in the FT-IR spectrometer. This results in an increased signal to noise ratio, compared to the standard FT-IR instrument.

40|$|Variable shadow screens {{have been}} {{proposed}} for reducing the apparent brightnesses of very bright light sources relative to other sources within the fields of view of diverse imaging optical devices, including video and film cameras and optical devices for imaging directly into the human eye. In other words, variable shadow screens would increase the <b>effective</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>ranges</b> of such devices. Traditionally, imaging sensors are protected against excessive brightness by use of dark filters and/or reduction of iris diameters. These traditional means do not increase dynamic range; they reduce the ability to view or image dimmer features of an image because they reduce the brightness of all parts of an image by the same factor. On the other hand, a variable shadow screen would darken only the excessively bright parts of an image. For example, dim objects {{in a field of}} view that included the setting Sun or bright headlights could be seen more readily in a picture taken through a variable shadow screen than in a picture of the same scene taken through a dark filter or a narrowed iris. The figure depicts one of many potential variations of the basic concept of the variable shadow screen. The shadow screen would be a normally transparent liquid-crystal matrix placed in front of a focal-plane array of photodetectors in a charge-coupled-device video camera. The shadow screen would be placed far enough from the focal plane so as not to disrupt the focal-plane image to an unacceptable degree, yet close enough so that the out-of-focus shadows cast by the screen would still be effective in darkening the brightest parts of the image. The image detected by the photodetector array itself would be used as feedback to drive the variable shadow screen: The video output of the camera would be processed by suitable analog and/or digital electronic circuitry to generate a negative partial version of the image to be impressed on the shadow screen. The parts of the shadow screen in front of those parts of the image with brightness below a specified threshold would be left transparent; the parts of the shadow screen in front of those parts of the image where the brightness exceeded the threshold would be darkened by an amount that would increase with the excess above the threshold...|$|R

40|$|Bibliography: pages 86 - 88. Research into stepped {{frequency}} {{continuous wave}} {{ground penetrating radar}} (SFCW GPR) at UCT {{has been carried out}} since 1990. A first generation system comprising of Hewlett-Packard test equipment controlled by a PC was assembled. Cavity-backed log spiral antennas were designed and built by the University of Stellenbosch for the specific use of ground penetrating radar. Measurements with the first generation system proved the concept of SFCW GPR and thus a dedicated second generation system was planned. A SFCW GPR system was designed to replace the first generation system. Various designs for transmitter and receiver configurations were investigated and those found most suitable were used for the implementation. The SFCW radar consists of a wideband CW transmitter and a coherent receiver. A 300 - 1000 MHz transmitter was constructed using varactor-tuned oscillators as frequency sources. A double-sideband, low-IF receiver was constructed for the 300 - 1000 MHz signal, to mix it to an IF of 10. 7 MHz and I-Q demodulate it. The transmitter was found to operate according to specifications. The receiver was found to operate satisfactorily, but the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> was less than expected. A limiting problem encountered in the first generation GPR was the large direct coupling signal from the transmitter into the receiver. This large signal reduced the <b>effective</b> receiver <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> A method of cancelling this large direct coupling signal was implemented, using a bi-phase modulator to generate the cancelling signal in antiphase to the coupling signal. A 20 dB reduction in coupling was shown. The system was used to measure cable lengths to within the inherent accuracy of the system. A metal plate target was detected by the system feeding two antenna and a concrete floor was detected under 1 m of sand. It was thus shown that the SFCW system {{could be used as a}} second generation GPR...|$|R
