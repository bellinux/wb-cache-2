40|$|Prof. Ogden {{presents}} {{the views of}} administrative law judge’s {{on the role of}} <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence</b> in determining the credibility of witnesses’ testimony in fact finding. The opinions of administrative law judges add an important new perspective on the issue of whether <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence</b> increases the accuracy of credibility determinations. The views of administrative law judges were determined through the techniques of survey research, utilizing a questionnaire. After defining <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence</b> for purposes of the study, Ogden explains the administrative law principle of judicial review that gives weight or deference to credibility determinations based on <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence.</b> A statistical analysis of the gathered data is provided which demonstrates that administrative law judges view <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence</b> to be of relatively low value. This finding warrants further study of the fact finding process as well as the process of determining credibility...|$|E
40|$|Conflicting {{results in}} two recent police {{excessive}} force decisions by the U. S. Supreme Court—Tolan v. Cotton and Plumhoff v. Rickard—have sown {{confusion about the}} standards for summary judgment. This Note shows how the two decisions are consistent {{with each other and}} with longstanding summary judgment precedents. The key insight is that since the Second Circuit’s iconic 1946 decision in Arnstein v. Porter, appellate judges, including Supreme Court Justices, have listened to audio recordings, scrutinized artwork, and—as in the case of Plumhoff—watched video footage in order to decide for themselves whether there is a genuine issue of material fact for trial. These “objective” components of the record are considered vitally important to the decisions. When no objective evidence is available, appellate judges are left with “he said, she said” testimonial evidence in which <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence</b> looms larger and are therefore more likely to allow the cases to proceed to trial. The presumed propriety of appellate judicial review of audiovisual evidence not only explains the different results in Tolan (no audiovisual evidence of police shooting and vacating the lower court’s finding for the defendant officer) and Plumhoff (video evidence of a police car chase resulting in the Court finding for the officer), but it also will have greater significance in current police excessive force cases given the omnipresence of smartphones and police recordings. At the same time, it is worth questioning whether appellate judges should continue to exercise limitless, de novo review of present-day audiovisual evidence, which may require as much understanding of context as traditional <b>demeanor</b> <b>evidence...</b>|$|E
50|$|However, on 12 October 1753, {{the dead}} body of Osborne {{was found in the}} garden of the house, in which he was lodged and which belonged to a local councilman. The cadaver {{presented}} evidences of strangulation. James De Lancey, the lieutenant governor who took over as acting governor on Osborne's death, reported to the Board of Trade that Osborne had had a melancholic <b>demeanor,</b> which <b>evidenced</b> a great psychological disorder. Historically, such instability of Osborne, which would have provoked a suicide, is attributed to the grief of his lost wife.|$|R
5000|$|Rebellious Soul has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 5 reviews. Andy Kellman of Allmusic praised the material influenced by classic soul, citing [...] "Damn" [...] and lead single [...] "V.S.O.P." [...] as key examples, overall referring {{to it as}} a [...] "compact, lyrically diverse debut." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe notes Michelle's [...] "rough around the edges" [...] <b>demeanor</b> as <b>evidenced</b> in her role in Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, but points out that the album shows more to her than just the [...] " [...] 'shaking the table' moments, Piscean dramatics and a mouthful of expletives. Her keep-it-real charm drew fans in, and her rebellious soul will keep them there." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "His way" [...] could {{generally}} {{be summed up}} as domineering and increasingly paranoid. In one well-known incident, he claimed that a secretary's cut thumb {{was the result of}} a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit, when in reality, the secretary had simply grabbed at a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on. After he received the Nobel Prize in 1956 his <b>demeanor</b> changed, as <b>evidenced</b> in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style. In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the [...] "traitorous eight", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor, a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctrine}} so {{laid down}} demands that every several circumstance should in itself be conclusive, {{or at least}} should afford a violent presumption: it must, we were told, without question, be material to the charge depending. But, as we conceive, its materiality, more or less, {{is not in the}} first instance to be established. To make it admissible, it is enough to give proof, or to raise a legal inference, of its connection both with the charge depending and the person of the party charged, where it does not appear {{on the face of the}} evidence offered. Besides, by this new doctrine, the materiality required to be shown must be decided from a consideration, not of the whole circumstance, but in truth of one half of the circumstance,--of a demeanor unconnected with and unexplained by that on which it arose, though the connection between the demeanor of the party and the paper is that which must be shown to be material. Your Committee, after all they have heard, is yet to learn how the full force and effect of any <b>demeanor,</b> as <b>evidence</b> of guilt or innocence, can be known, unless it be also fully known to what that demeanor applied,--unless, when a person did or said anything, it be known, not generally and abstractedly, that a paper was read to him, but particularly and specifically what were the contents of that paper: whether they were matters lightly or weightily alleged,--within the power of the party accused to have confuted on the spot, if false,--or such as, though he might have denied, he could not instantly have disproved. The doctrine appeared and still appears to your Committee to be totally abhorrent from the genius of circumstantial evidence, and mischievously subversive of its use. We did, however, offer that extraneous proof which was demanded of us; but it was refused, as well as the office document.|$|R
