40|$|Field {{observations}} in estuaries reveal that phytoplankton blooms are strongly affected by advection processes related to river flow. To gain quantitative insight into this dependence, experiments were performed {{with a new}} idealised model that couples physical and biological processes. Advection of phytoplankton and nutrient by subtidal flow was explicitly accounted for, as well as longitudinal and vertical mixing processes. Results show that the idealised model is capable of reproducing the observed bloom. The specific spatial distribution of phytoplankton population emerges because the latter is suppressed in the upper reach by the advection processes, and the growth is limited in the lower reach by low nutrient concentrations. A sensitivity study of model results to different river discharges reveals the presence of three regimes. In the low <b>discharge</b> <b>regime,</b> blooms form because growth is faster than decay due to advection processes. In the high <b>discharge</b> <b>regime,</b> the situation is opposite and no blooms form. If time scales of growth and advection are comparable (in moderate <b>discharge</b> <b>regime),</b> phytoplankton population increases significantly slower compared to the low <b>discharge</b> <b>regime.</b> Results of additional model runs, in which water depth and the e-folding length scale of estuarine width convergence were varied, revealed that the three regimes occur in all these cases...|$|E

Model predictions of surplus power (energy available per unit time for lll growth and reproduction) {{were not statistically}} distinguishable from observations of surplus power in three laboratory studies. Of 40 experimental trials in these three studies, the model correctly predicted surplus power in 39 cases (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). I collected observations of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) focal velocity and physical habitat availability in the Green River of northeastern Utah, USA (1988 - 1990). In the winter of 1988, Flaming Gorge Dam generated hydropower and delivered an lJDStable <b>discharge</b> <b>regime</b> with a higher mean discharge to the Green River. During 1989 and 1990, Flaming Gorge Dam 2 ̆ 7 s operation was curtailed by drought. Therefore, the Green River exhibited a more stable <b>discharge</b> <b>regime</b> with lower mean daily discharge. During winters exhibiting the stable <b>discharge</b> <b>regime,</b> all size classes of rainbow trout selected slower focal velocities than under an unstable winter <b>discharge</b> <b>regime.</b> Season had less influence on microhabitat selection of large fish than smaller individuals. Rainbow trout larger than 33 cm (total length) find and use positions with low focal velocities and high velocity shear regardless of season. In contrast, during the summer, fish less than 33 cm TL find and use positions with much higher focal velocities and greater velocity shear compared to the winter. Four bioenergetic models were tested with the focal velocity use data. Two optimal goal models produced excellent fits (r 2 = 0. 91 and 0. 93) to observed focal velocity use of rainbow trout larger than 33 cm TL. These results {{were consistent with the}} hypothesis that large rainbow trout were finding optimal focal velocity positions in stable discharge summers and under both discharge regimes in winter. Rainbow trout movement was quantified along two scales with radio-telemetered fish: 1) weekly observations generated estimates of distances moved at intervals greater than one day and 2) multiple observations of a fish in one day produced estimates of distances moved over hours. I found an unstable <b>discharge</b> <b>regime</b> significantly reduces movement measured weekly (F = 11. 10, P = 0. 0019); hourly movement rates (m/h) were also reduced (F = 5. 90, P = 0. 0273) ...|$|E

An extensive series of experiments are conducted with copper as a consumable electrode and pure nitrogen as the inert gas. Three different DC power supplies are used to drive electrical discharges for the entire operating current range. Then, three electrical <b>discharge</b> <b>regimes</b> (spark, glow, and arc) with distinct voltage–current characteristics and plasma emission spectra are recognized. For the first time, nanoparticles are synthesized by evaporation of an electrode by atmospheric pressure inert gas DC glow discharge of a few millimeters in size. The <b>discharge</b> <b>regimes</b> are characterized {{in terms of the}} mass output rate and the particle size distribution of the copper aerosols by means of online (tapered element oscillating microbalance, TEOM; and scanning mobility particle sizer, SPMS) and offline (gravimetric analysis; small and wide angle X-ray scattering, SWAXS; and transmission electron microscopy, TEM) techniques. The electrical power delivered to the electrode gap and the gas flow rate are two major parameters determining the aerosol mass output rate and the aerosol particle size distribution. The mass output rate of copper aerosols raises from 2 mg h- 1 to 2 g h- 1 when increasing the electrical power from 9 to 900 W. The particle mean size (SMPS dg) varies between 20 and 100 nm depending upon the electrical power and the gas flow rate, whereas the particle size dispersion (SMPS sg) ranges from 1. 4 to 1. 7 and is only weakly dependent on the gas flow rate...|$|R

The method of "discriminant periods" is used, {{as it was in}} the study of the Danube catchment. Regarding to the chosen method, 7 regime types were determinated in Slovenia. Regarding to this determination the stability, as it was proposed by Nováky (2001), was computed for all the used water gauging stations. The results had shown that maximum hydrological events have more influence on the stability of a certain regime, then the minimum hydrological events. In the second part the up mentioned method was compared with the method for hierarchical clustering, with which the last grouping of Slovenian rivers in to <b>discharge</b> <b>regimes</b> was made, using the period from 1961 to 1990. <b>Discharge</b> <b>regimes</b> were also defined for the period from 1971 to 2000, using the same clustering method. Besides this the grouping was also made for both periods together. The similarity among gauging stations was calculated on the basis of the Manhattan distance, but for their clustering in to groups the Ward’s method was used. The comparison between two periods and two methods has shown important climate changes and with that the time distribution of high and low waters, changes of type of precipitation due to higher temperatures and lesser differences between regime types. Finally we wanted to determinate the Nováky’s empirical classes of runoff regime stability so that they would have an arithmetic background.

Based on volumetric proportions of diet composition, relative abundance of fish species and their daily food rations, the mean cumulative consumption of each prey taxon was estimated for each fish population. Food web diagrams were prepared using trophic index of fish, trophic class of prey and feeding interactions between fish and prey. Both streams showed seasonal patterns of discharge due to rainfall, but no significant effect {{was evident in}} the trophic index of most fish species. In both streams, cumulative consumption of prey taxa was highest during low <b>discharge</b> <b>regime</b> due to increased abundance of both prey taxa and consumers. In Eswathu Oya, diversity of prey taxa was higher during the low <b>discharge</b> <b>regime,</b> but in Yan Oya, high diversity occurred during the high <b>discharge</b> <b>regime.</b> Herbivorous and/or detritivorous fish species were rare in Eswathu Oya but dominant in Yan Oya.

40|$|International audienceDuring the ageing of {{in service}} medium voltage equipments, {{electrical}} losses are mainly due to partial discharges.

Partial discharges include (i) bulk discharges occurring in insulating material voids, (ii) corona discharges affecting or not the insulator and (iii) surface discharges developing on an insulator surface from a triple point (conductor/insulating material/air).

Surface discharges and corona discharges produce chemical species in atmospheric air, i. e. ozone and nitrogen oxides.
