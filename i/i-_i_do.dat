40|$|We have {{constructed}} a replication-defective adenovirus vector encoding the yeast <b>I-</b> Sce <b>I</b> endonuclease {{under the control}} of the murine cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter (AdM Sce I) for efficient delivery of this enzyme to mammalian cells. We present evidence of AdM Sce I-mediated <b>I-</b> Sce <b>I</b> protein expression and cleavage activity in replication-permissive 293 cells, and of cleavage of chromosomes in vivo in both 293 cells and in non-permissive human cells. We have exploited this system for the generation of chromosomes capped by artificial telomeric sequences in cells with integrated plasmids containing telomeric DNA arrays adjacent to an <b>I-</b> Sce <b>I</b> recognition site. The properties of the AdM Sce I virus described here make it a useful tool for studying biological processes involving induction of DNA breaks, recombination and gene targeting in cells grown in culture and in vivo...|$|R

Direct measurements of three individual iodine species: <b>I(-),</b> <b>I</b> 2 and I 3 (-), were made. In addition three measures of total titratable iodine species were used. It {{has been found that}} I 2 and I 3 (-) solutions produce a significant fraction of the non-disinfecting species iodine I(-), ranging from 50 to 80 % of added iodine, respectively, at pH values of approximately 5. Correspondingly, I 2 solutions produce more than twice the concentration of disinfecting iodine species per mass iodine dose than I 3 (-) solutions. Both <b>I(-)</b> and <b>I</b> 2 species were found in aqeuous extracts of pentaiodide resin, although no soluble species were detected with triiodide resin...|$|R

30|$|Now, {{we address}} the etch {{chemistry}} of por-Si films with solutions containing <b>I–,</b> <b>I</b> 2, and I 3 – to which HF {{has also been}} added. HI[*]+[*]HF, I 2 [*]+[*]HF[*]+[*]ethanol, and HI[*]+[*]I 2 [*]+[*]HF solutions all remove por-Si layers accompanied by the formation of bubbles. The {{rate at which the}} por-Si is destroyed is dependent on the concentration of the iodine species. Interestingly, when <b>I–</b> and <b>I</b> 2 destroy por-Si, they leave behind a nearly mirror-like Si substrate. These two species, therefore, facilitate step flow etching in HF solutions. This is consistent with their lack of reactivity with the terraces of polished surfaces. I 3 –-containing solutions, on the other hand, remove por-Si to reveal a rough and pitted surface much like the one shown in Figure[*] 3. Again, {{this is consistent with the}} more aggressive and anisotropic nature of I 3 –-induced etching. All three of these species destroy nanoscale Si structures; therefore, the initiation step and etch rate of each reaction must not be constrained by quantum confinement.|$|R

30|$|We {{believe that}} IO 3 –-induced etching {{is capable of}} {{producing}} nanoporous silicon. This generates {{a great deal of}} surface area, which enhances the reactivity of the Si substrate toward other species. This facilitates such major restructuring of the surface because the chemistry of iodine-containing species in solution is extremely complex, and it is impossible to separate IO 3 –-induced chemistry from that induced by <b>I–,</b> <b>I</b> 2, and I 3 –. As we will show below, all of these species are capable of etching Si. The first two lead to smooth isotropic etching, and the last leads to anisotropic etching. The combination and balance of these chemistries with IO 3 –-induced etching leads to the great variety of surface features observed.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to extend exact model {{reduction}} methods to wideband analysis. After a review of the realization methods in the underwater acoustic context, it is shown that the Optimal Realization Method is very well suited to the wideband analysis, thanks to the rational modelling. The basic steps of the proposed method are a multidimensional AR modelling of the sensor outputs, spatial interpolation, and model reduction of a unique model for the frequency band of analysis. It is important to note that this method uses no a priori assumption about source locations or source models. Moreover, this one inherits the robustness w. r. t. spatial noise coloration from its narrowband version. Simulation results demonstrate the resolution and detection improvements achieved by the method. <b>I-</b> <b>I</b> "...|$|R
