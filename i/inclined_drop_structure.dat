40|$|Flood Control Areas (FCAs) {{are one of}} the {{measures}} to protect the Flemish part of the Scheldt estuary against storm surges. Recently, in some of these FCAs a Controlled Reduced Tide (CRT) was introduced by means of simple sluice constructions, aiming at a combination of flood control with nature development and the ecological functions of intertidal areas. This paper gives an overview of the different types of inlet sluices and energy dissipation measures that have been designed, built and/or are under construction: an inlet sluice with an <b>inclined</b> <b>drop,</b> an inlet sluice with a pooled step cascade and a combined inlet-outlet sluice with an internal <b>drop</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R
50|$|The river {{has a low}} <b>incline</b> <b>dropping</b> only 87 meters {{over its}} 292 {{kilometer}} length. The result is a meandering river with lots of swamps and oxbox lakes. The area of its drainage basin is 5820 sqkm sq mi. The average annual flow of water {{at the mouth of}} the Ubort River is 24.4 Cubic metres per second.|$|R
500|$|A {{number of}} <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> (small dams {{used to control}} water {{velocity}} and erosion) exist on tributaries of San Juan Creek. On Trabuco Creek, there are eight <b>drop</b> <b>structures,</b> mostly built of riprap. The largest are a [...] cascade immediately downstream of a Metrolink bridge, and a concrete <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> at the terminus of a culvert that crosses underneath Interstate 5. There are also seven <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> on Oso Creek, mostly built of riprap. There are no such specifically constructed structures on San Juan Creek itself.|$|R
50|$|A grouted sloping boulder <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> is {{the most}} {{versatile}} of <b>drop</b> <b>structures.</b> Able to accommodate both a broad floodplain or a narrow channel, they can also handle many different drop heights. Heights of these structures usually range from 1 ft to 10 ft. These structures are built by creating a slope of riprap, which consists of large boulders or less commonly, blocks of concrete. These are then cemented together ("grouted") to form the <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> Another less common type of <b>drop</b> <b>structure,</b> the sculpted sloping boulder drop, is derived from this. The sculpted sloping boulder drop is {{used to create a}} more natural appearance to the <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> Both of these structures also tend to suffer from downstream erosion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>structures</b> {{have been}} shown to either be {{beneficial}} or detrimental to habitat in the stream. They create complexity of habitat by breaking up a stretch of stream into a series of pools. Surface turbulence, eddies and bubbles are generated by <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> that provide hiding and cover for fish and other aquatic organisms. Water is aerated as it passes over <b>drop</b> <b>structures.</b> Sediment is collected and sorted in scour pools, which provide energy dissipation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>structure</b> {{is a key}} {{hydraulic}} structure used in river improvement projects for flood control purposes. However, as demand for riparian construction techniques with environmental consid-erations is increasing both domestically and internationally, discontinuation of aquatic organisms {{as a result of}} high head is raised as a serious issue associated with the existing <b>drop</b> <b>structures.</b> Accordingly, it has become necessary to install a <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> with a mild slope rather than the existing <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> with high head, so that the structure can function as a migration channel for fish, which is severed by the existing <b>drop</b> <b>structures,</b> and also improve surrounding land-scapes. In this study, which was initiated based on the necessity as such, a <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> of mild slope was defined as sloping weir and flow characteristics under different conditions were ana-lyzed through a hydraulic experiment. Focusing on efficiency according to energy dissipation that takes place according to different gradients of sloping weir, particle sizes of riverbed materials and the effect of hydraulic jump occurring at the downstream of a structure, this study aimed at identifying flow characteristics according to the conditions of sloping weirs. The hydraulic expe-riment was carried out on a variable-slope channel measuring 0. 6 m in width and 20. 0 m in length...|$|R
40|$|Although ecologically disadvantageous since a {{river is}} {{interrupted}} because of <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> installation, such structure installation is also deemed ecologically advantageous {{in terms of}} scour and complex flows in the direct downstream area. This study started from the premise that scour hole carries value as a habitat and sought to analyze quantitatively the local scour adjustment possibility in the downstream area through <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> type change and to offer a habitat through scouring. This study provided changes in <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> types, such as straight line type and V type. For local scour analysis impacting the downstream area by <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> type, quantitative analysis of scour scope, depth, and length was comparatively performed for a tentative physical habitat through hydraulic experiments. As {{a result of the}} experiments, this study found that scour scope increases and various water depth conditions are offered as the angle of the <b>drop</b> <b>structureâ€™s</b> apex becomes smaller. Future studies accompanied by various fish habitation evaluations are considered useful in finding an alternative to upgrade the ecological environment...|$|R

The large-scale applicability experiment performed in this study installed low <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> as the study object within the experiment channel and precisely surveyed topography in the downstream area of <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> along with the hydraulic amount including water level and flow velocity under certain flow conditions.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a general {{theoretical}} model of flow behavior {{at the base of}} a <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> is developed, based on reasonable assumptions, using one-dimensional momentum and energy principles. Theoretical predictions of the main flow characteristics are made and their validity verified by comparison with two series of experimental results.

50|$|Human {{activities}} {{have led to}} the loss of over 80 percent of suitable spawning habitat for fall-run Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River watersheds. Straightening of lower Marsh Creek for flood control steepened its gradient relative to its original meandering course, requiring construction of a 6 foot m waterfall <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> in 1958 below Marsh Creek Dam (4 miles from the creek mouth). The <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> and the Marsh Creek Reservoir dam (constructed in 1963) are complete barriers to anadromous fish migration. Below the dam and above the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> barrier, there is approximately 7 mi suitable gravel quality, quantity, and vegetative cover to support Chinook salmon spawning. The presence of coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) has not been established in fish surveys of Marsh Creek above the <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> In December 2010, American Rivers, the Natural Heritage Institute and the Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), constructed a $400,000 fish ladder that made passage of the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> possible {{for the first time in}} 52 years, enabling Chinook salmon and steelhead to potentially use the next 7 mi of stream channel, up to the Marsh Creek Reservoir Dam, as well as the Sand Creek and Deer Creek tributaries. The Friends of Marsh Creek Watershed citizen salmon monitoring program had identified salmon congregating immediately below the <b>drop</b> <b>structure</b> barrier prior to construction of the fish ladder. On December 2, 2012, Chinook salmon were videotaped above the fish ladder between Balfour and Central Avenue. By December 2016, Chinook salmon numbering in the hundreds used the fish ladder and returned to Marsh Creek to spawn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vertical}} hard basin <b>drop</b> <b>structure,</b> {{also called}} a dissipation wall, {{is the basic}} type of <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> The vertical hard basin drop consists of a vertical [...] "cutoff wall", usually built of concrete, that is usually laid perpendicular to the stream flow; and an impact basin, not unlike a stream pool, to catch the discharged water. The purpose of the vertical hard basin drop is to force the water into a hydraulic jump (a small standing wave). Though the simplest type of <b>drop</b> <b>structure,</b> it is highest in maintenance needs and less safe, with most problems related to the impact basin. Sediment is often deposited in the basin, requiring frequent removal, and erosion downstream of {{the base of the}} structure.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> may also become {{barriers}} to fish. The downstream channel may erode and slowly and unexpectedly increase {{the height of}} the structure, to a point where migratory fish, such as salmon, cannot pass over the structure. Other causes may be that the plunge pool is obstructed or the water flow is too shallow. However, many properly functioning <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> themselves may impede the upstream and downstream migration of fish.|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic jumps {{primarily}} {{serve to}} dissipate the excess energy of flowing water downstream of hydraulic structures, such as spillways, weir, sluice gates etc. This type of jump is of practical importance when tail water depth is inadequate {{to give a}} good jump. The research conducted at the hydraulics laboratory aimed to obtain suitability of drop number (D) and an estimated hydraulic jump using the drop number. The objective was to obtain the affectivities of application of D on vertical drop and sloped <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> and to develop the model equation for the sloped <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> The hydraulic laboratory conducted research on a hydraulic rectangular flume. Results showed that the D equation could predict drop length (L(d)), and hydraulic jump length (L(j)) for vertical drop structures; however, the equation could not estimate the hydraulic jump length for sloped <b>drop</b> <b>structure.</b> Therefore, development of a D equation {{that could be used}} to estimate hydraulic jump for sloped <b>drop</b> <b>structures,</b> with analysis of non dimensional relationships based on mathematical equations, was needed.

40|$|The city of Naples (Italy) is {{well known}} for its hilly landscape, along with a {{peculiar}} geology characterized by volcanic soils (i. e. tuf and pyroclastic rocks). The development of the sewer system serving the urban area has been strongly constrained by these factors. In particular, several <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> were realized in order to connect the modern urban drainage system (realized in during the last decades) to the early sewer mains realized {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century and serving the downtown districts located at the sea level. The purpose of these <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> is twofold: (i) to convey the storm runoff toward the sea through the existing sewer system located at lower elevations, and (ii) to by-pass insufficient sewer channels. Most of the <b>drop</b> <b>structures</b> were realized according to the â€˜vortex drop shaftâ€™ scheme, mainly for drop heights larger than 10 meters, up to 80 meters. The proper operation of these structures is crucial to prevent flooding and guarantee the urban safety. The paper aims to describe the most crucial aspects of the hydraulic behavior of the vortex shafts along with some examples of malfunction of these structures. Laboratory experiments were conducted to test existing vortex dropshafts and improve their hydraulic capacity; some relevant results are finally presented, along with pertinent practical issues...|$|R
