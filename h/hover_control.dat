40|$|Summary. The Report {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} improving <b>hovering</b> <b>control</b> of unstabilized jet-lift aircraft by reshaping stick commands. From basic theoretical considerations it is shown that the open-loop properties of any linear dynamic system operating in an environment without external disturbance can be altered to those of a lower order system {{by means of a}} suitable shaping function. Thus there may be numerous shaping laws which, in principle, could simplify <b>control</b> of <b>hovering</b> aircraft. However, it is felt that practical applications of the concept would depend upon the performance of the mechanical system, which must operate under the limitations of control power available and which must satisfy certain safety requirements. A hydraulic integrating mechanism designed to meet such conditions was chosen for detailed study. Simulated hovering flight studies were conducted to observe the effect of variations of mechanism parameters on pilot performance and a discussion on optimum controls is included. A practical <b>hovering</b> <b>control</b> circuit for jet-borne vehicles was thence proposed {{on the basis of a}} compromise between mechanism characteristics desirable for normal operation and those that would be necessar...|$|R

A helicopter with sufficient lift capability was selected and a lightweight aluminum structure was built to serve as both an avionics platform for the necessary equipment and also as a landing skid.

40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} is a paradigm for learning decision-making tasks from interaction with the environment. Function approximators solve {{a part of the}} curse of dimensionality when learning in high-dimensional state and/or action spaces. It can be a time-consuming process to learn a good policy in a high dimensional state space directly. A method is proposed for initially limiting the state and action space to a subset of the variables of the Markov Decision Process. Therefore, the agent will initially learn a coarse policy. It is then gradually exposed to new state and action variables to increase the dimensionality of the state and action space to the ones posed by the control problem. A local function approximator has been developed that supports the expansion of state and action space. The concept is applied to the Model-Learning Actor-Critic, a model-based Heuristic Dynamic Programming algorithm. Its functioning is demonstrated by training a reinforcement learning agent for 2 -dimensional <b>hover</b> <b>control</b> of a Parrot AR 2. 0 quad-rotor.

40|$|This paper overviews {{the latest}} {{advances}} in our {{research and development}} programme in undersea vehicle control. The paper describes a powerful remote control and monitoring system for both undersea and surface vehicles. The system is based upon a set of self-tuning autopilots for transit, waypoint following, and four modes of dynamic positioning. The system is flexible, allowing the user to adjust the link bandwidth usage down to minimal and even zero during a mission. The dynamic positioning system provides four types of automatic <b>hover</b> <b>control,</b> including a minimum-power mode. Self-tuning applies to all control modes, and this allows the vehicle autopilot parameters to be adjusted automatically even when the vehicle dynamics are altered, e. g. after picking up or dropping a payload. This approach to remote control is powerful, since it minimises operator workload by providing a high-level interface. The vehicle mission can be altered at any time using a graphical mission-planning screen which includes an electronic chart of the mission area. The new mission parameters are automatically downloaded to the vehicle and low-level vehicle control is performed by the onboard autopilot, leaving the operator free to concentrate on high-level decisions. The paper outlines how the system {{can be adapted to}} suit a variety of vehicle configurations, by setting up the vehicle parameters on a simulator and then downloading a configuration database to the vehicle unit.

40|$|The {{research}} work has advanced the inversion-based guidance theory for: systems with non-hyperbolic internal dynamics; systems with parameter jumps; and systems where a redesign of the output trajectory is desired. A technique to achieve output tracking for nonminimum phase linear systems with non-hyperbolic and near non-hyperbolic internal dynamics was developed. This approach integrated stable inversion techniques, that achieve exact-tracking, with approximation techniques, that modify the internal dynamics to achieve desirable performance. Such {{modification of the}} internal dynamics was used (a) to remove non-hyperbolicity which is an obstruction to applying stable inversion techniques and (b) to reduce large preactuation times needed to apply stable inversion for near non-hyperbolic cases. The method was applied to an example helicopter <b>hover</b> <b>control</b> problem with near non-hyperbolic internal dynamics for illustrating the trade-off between exact tracking and reduction of preactuation time. Future work will extend these results to guidance of nonlinear non-hyperbolic systems. The exact output tracking problem for systems with parameter jumps was considered. Necessary and sufficient conditions were derived {{for the elimination of}} switching-introduced output transient. While previous works had studied this problem by developing a regulator that maintains exact tracking through parameter jumps (switches), such techniques are, however, only applicable to minimum-phase systems. In contrast, our approach is also applicable to nonminimum-phase systems and leads to bounded but possibly non-causal solutions. In addition, for the case when the reference trajectories are generated by an exosystem, we developed an exact-tracking controller which could be written in a feedback form. As in standard regulator theory, we also obtained a linear map from the states of the exosystem to the desired system state, which was defined via a matrix differential equation...|$|E
