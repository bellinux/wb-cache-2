5|$|Green Wings {{title is}} said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in {{executive}} producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears {{at the end of the}} credits on <b>every</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
5|$|To help {{design the}} next major show, Laliberté and Caron hired Franco Dragone, another {{instructor}} from the National Circus School {{who had been working}} in Belgium. When he joined the troupe in 1985, he brought with him his experience in commedia dell'arte techniques, which he imparted to the performers. Although his experience would be limited in the next show due to budget restraints, he would go on to direct <b>every</b> <b>show</b> up to, but not including Dralion.|$|E
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed <b>every</b> <b>show</b> with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on the balls of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E

25|$|Up to {{the live}} shows, episodes of The Xtra Factor were pre-recorded, {{and during the}} live shows, they were {{broadcast}} live, however, from series 13, The Xtra Factor aired live directly after <b>every</b> <b>show</b> {{over the course of}} the series from the auditions to the finals.|$|E

Kelly had previously chosen the song for a wake up call on Space Shuttle flight STS-134.|$|E
25|$|Ian Messiter, the show's creator, set the {{subjects}} for <b>every</b> <b>show</b> {{until his death}} in 1999. Until 1989 he also sat on the stage with a stopwatch and blew a whistle when the sixty seconds were up. He {{has been replaced by a}} succession of different whistle-blowers, a role which now falls to the production assistant.|$|E
25|$|Several {{games were}} played {{live in the}} Bungalow in each episode. These were mostly contested by the Bungalow Heads for points, {{although}} there were some exceptions. In accordance with UK children's television tradition, many of the games involved the participants being gunged. This was particularly true of {{the final game of}} <b>every</b> <b>show,</b> called Creamy Muck Muck.|$|E

25|$|Edinburgh based {{newspaper}} The Scotsman, {{known for}} its comprehensive coverage of the Edinburgh Festival, originally aimed to review <b>every</b> <b>show</b> on the Fringe.

Exhibitors that compete at the Sydney Royal Pig Show are often from small family-based Stud farms.|$|E

On nine {{occasions}} he {{has appeared on}} the panel, and others have acted as chairman including Sir Clement Freud, Geraldine Jones, Andrée Melly and Kenneth Williams.

25|$|The most shocking, frightening, and {{fascinating}} image in {{rock in the}} last few years is Courtney Love's stage dive... When some male performers do it, it looks like muscular, frat-boy fun, controlled aggression... For obvious reasons, the practice was strictly no-girls-allowed, but Love, typically, decided that she wanted to do it, too. Groped, ravaged, she compared the experience to being raped, wrote a song about it, and now does it just about <b>every</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the tour, {{the girls}} {{began work on}} their second Christmas release. The girls spent the summer of 2005 recording, which, like A Christmas Story, {{featured}} holiday classics and original songs. Winter Wonderland was released on October 4, 2005. They launched their first Christmas tour, the Winter Wonderland Tour in late November, playing 16 concerts. The show had John David Webster, who was featured on Winter Wonderland, as a special guests, and local choirs participated in <b>every</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 2011, {{the show}} began a 30-day {{countdown}} to the finale.

This tour included shows with hundreds of other bands such as Screw 32, J Church, AFI, Still Life, Mustard Plug, Face to Face, and Cosmic Psychos. At the Drive-In’s fan base began to swell with <b>every</b> <b>show</b> it performed. Following this tour, the band members took a month vacation (Jim Ward remained on vacation until the recording of In/Casino/Out) before rehearsing for their next record and subsequent tour.|$|E
25|$|In his teen years, Cuccurullo {{became a}} devoted fan of Frank Zappa and began {{traveling}} to <b>every</b> <b>show</b> within 500 miles of his Brooklyn home. During the mid-1970s, he befriended {{several members of}} Zappa's band, including Terry Bozzio and Patrick O'Hearn. Over the next three years, he appeared with the band on stage {{at a couple of}} shows {{as well as in the}} 1979 Zappa film Baby Snakes (filmed October 1977). He impressed Frank Zappa by knowing the guitar parts to every Zappa song in the catalog, including the strangest sounds and most bizarre time signatures.|$|E

From the live shows, the Saturday episode was replaced by a live episode on Thursdays {{for the remainder of the}} series, starting on 29 October 2015. For series 13, it reverted to airing directly after each ITV broadcast of The X Factor, though the episode after the live performance shows was 30 minutes long instead of an hour.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{increase}} {{was a result of}} Paley's second upgrade to the CBS business plan - improved affiliate relations. There were two types of program at the time: sponsored and sustaining, i.e., unsponsored. Rival NBC paid affiliates for <b>every</b> sponsored <b>show</b> they carried and charged them for <b>every</b> sustaining <b>show</b> they ran. It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible: he would give the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run <b>every</b> sponsored <b>show,</b> and accept CBS's check for doing so. CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue.|$|R
