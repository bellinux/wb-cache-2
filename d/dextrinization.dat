40|$|Native {{starches}} {{have limited}} use in industrial applications {{due to their}} poor water resistance, pasting, and mechanical properties. These behaviors can be amended by altering the starch structure by introducing ionic or hydrophobic groups in the starch structure. Structural modifications tend to stabilize the starch granules, impart hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, heat resistance, desirable rheological properties, and increased processability.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong Cheng ShiThe {{reaction}} of starch and octenylsuccinic anhydride (OSA) produces lipophilic starch {{that has the}} ability to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions. The functional properties of octenylsuccinate (OS) starch depend on its molecular structure and distribution of OS groups. Structures of OSA and OS starches were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. In granular OS starches, OS groups were substituted at O- 2, O- 3 positions, but not the O- 6 position. Distribution of OS groups was investigated by enzyme hydrolysis followed by chromatography analysis. OS substitution predominantly occurred at the amorphous region of the starch granules. OS starch of degree of substitution (DS) 0. 018 had OS groups located close to the branching points, whereas the OS substitution in OS starch of DS 0. 092 occurred near non-reducing ends as well as the branching points. OS starches with different substitution patterns were prepared from two approaches. OS starches from the first approach had OS substitution near the branching points or non-reducing ends, whereas OS starches from the second approach had OS groups distributed randomly throughout the starch chains. A method of preparing OS starch by dry heating a mixture of waxy maize starch and OSA was developed. The optimum reaction was investigated and found to be pH 8. 5 by addition of 3 % NH 4 HCO 3, 180 °C and 2 h. Reaction efficiency of ca. 90 % was obtained at OSA levels from 1 to 6 %. The OS starch had a DS of 0. 0202 with 98 % solubility when reacted with 3 % OSA. Transglucosidation occurred during the reaction. The OS starch had a degree of branching of 19. 8 %. The highly debranched OS starch showed excellent emulsification property for vitamin E and vitamin A. The structural changes of insoluble native waxy maize starch granules to cold watersoluble pyrodextrin during <b>dextrinization</b> under acidic conditions were investigated. We proposed that the starch was hydrolyzed by acid in the amorphous regions. Unwinding of the double helices also occurred, and crystallite size decreased. Starch molecules were hydrolyzed into small molecule fractions but remain in a radial arrangement. Glycosyl linkages including - (1 2), -(1 6), -(1 2), and -(1 6) linkages were formed and the majority starch chain terminals were 1, 6 -anhydro- -D-glucopyranose.

40|$|Malting and {{fermentation}} {{were applied}} to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, {{with the aim of}} alleviating grittiness, dryness and crumb firmness normally associated with inclusion of sorghum flour in composite bread. Malt amylases were effectively inactivated by boiling, before drying at high temperatures. A fractionation and reconstitution process revealed that malting and boiling dextrinized and gelatinized starch, increased water-soluble pentosans and crude fiber. <b>Dextrinization</b> and gelatinization of starch decreased gelatinization temperature and the rate of starch retrogradation, thus decreasing crumb grittiness and firmness. The increase in crude fiber and water-soluble pentosans caused by the germinating grain root and shoot growth and the hydrolysis of non-starch polysaccharides, respectively, during malting, increased water-holding capacity and dough viscosity, thus decreasing dryness and the crumb-firming rate. Malting and boiling also decreased the total protein and the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) of sorghum flour and sorghum and wheat composite bread. Fermentation of sorghum flour, followed by drying at 60 °C, decreased the pH of sorghum flour and slightly increased gelatinized starch and pasting viscosity. Apparently, the low pH of fermented sorghum flour caused higher loaf volume and softer crumb by suppressing the malt amylases and increasing starch water-holding capacity, henc...|$|E
40|$|Flour {{has been}} an ample source of {{research}} and most abundant material {{for a number of}} food applications. The aim {{of this study is to}} introduce modified Kithul flour for certain industrial requirements. Several physical and chemical treatments were employed to modify Kithul (Caryota urens) flour. The effects of pregelatinization (PG-I and II), acid modification (AC), and <b>dextrinization</b> (DX) on their swelling power, solubility, granular morphology, viscosity, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were studied. At 75 °C, pregelatinized treated (PG-II) flour had a high solubility (5. 31), while at 70 °C pregelatinized treated (PG-I) flour had a low solubility (4. 47) as compared to the solubility of native flour sample (RW = 4. 88). Same pattern has been followed by the swelling power while viscosity showed the highest value for PG-II (7296. 51 [*]Cp) and lowest value for DX treatment (873. 40 [*]Cp) as peak viscosities. There were no significant changes in granular size of all treatments compared with the native Kithul flour (45. 52 [*]μm). X-ray diffraction (XRD) also followed the same pattern by presenting Bragg’s angle (2 θ) positions near 15 (Peak 1), 17 (Peak 2), 18 (Peak 3), and 23 (Peak 4) providing evidence for the presence of crystallites which belong to type A in all modified and native Kithul flour treatments...|$|E
40|$|The possibililty {{of using}} the simple {{technologies}} of malting and fermentation to modify endogenously the sorghum grain components, to alleviate the grittiness, dryness and high crumb firmness caused by the inclusion of sorghum flour in composite bread, was investigated. The most suitable grain and the optimal malting time for sorghum for bread¬making, were selected by malting five sorghum cultivars, up to 8 days, and evaluating them for the highest protein modification and lowest dry matter losses. On that basis, a 6 ¬days malt of Local White, a relatively high protein sorghum (10. 7 %), was selected. Sorghum malt flour potentially suitable for bread-making was produced by boiling the selected malt, rather than drying it at high temperatures, stewing or steaming. Boiling was most effective in inactivating the amylases and in increasing the pasting viscosity of sorghum malt. The bread made with boiled malt flour (30 %) had an improved crumb structure and water-holding capacity, a softer crumb and increased resistance to staling, compared to bread made with sorghum grain flour (30 %). Bread-making with reconstituted flours from flour and bran fractions of whole sorghum grain and whole boiled sorghum malt indicated that the bread improving effect of malting and boiling was due to <b>dextrinization</b> and gelatinization of starch, and to the increase of total and water-soluble pentosans, and crude fiber. <b>Dextrinization</b> and gelatinization of starch decreased the gelatinization temperature {{and the rate of}} starch retrogradation, thus decreasing the crumb firmness and firming rate of sorghum and wheat composite bread. However, high levels of gelatinized starch decreased dough strength and bread volume. The increase of total pentosans and crude fiber of sorghum malts, caused by germinating grains roots and shoots growth, and the increase of water-soluble pentosans, due to hydrolysis of the non-starch polyssacharides during malting, significantly increased flour and dough water-holding capacity. Thus, crumb structure was improved and crumb firmness and crumb-firming rate decreased. Treatment of sorghum flour with endo-(l- 4) -β-xylanase to determine whether endoxylanases could solubilize sorghum pentosans, increased the water-soluble pentosans slightly, indicating the potential of endoxylanases to improve the bread-making quality of sorghum flour. However, heating the endoxylanase treated flour to inactivate the enzyme, so as to determine its specific effect, gelatinized the starch and decreased the bread volume. A natural lactic acid fermentation of sorghum flour, followed by drying at 60 °C, decreased the pH of sorghum flour from 6. 2 to 3. 4 and slightly increased the gelatinized starch and the pasting viscosity of sorghum flour. Apparently, the low pH caused higher loaf volume and improved crumb structure and softness by suppressing the amylases and by increasing the viscosity of dough, and hence increasing its gas-holding capacity. Adding wet fermented sorghum flour directly to wheat flour (sourdough process), as an alternative to drying, further increased the volume and decreased the crumb firmness. Fermentation and drying also improved the protein digestibility of sorghum composite bread. Consumer panel members liked the bread made with boiled sorghum malt flour most, apparently because it was softer, more moist and had a fine malt flavor. They liked the bread made with fern 1 ented and dried sorghum flour less, apparently because it had a pronounced sour taste. Malting and fermentation can be successfully used to produce acceptable sorghum and wheat composite bread. Fermentation is probably the most suitable technology for poor developing countries because it is simple and effective. Steaming the malt and adding the endoxylanases directly when mixing the dough, to eliminate the flour drying step and to reduce starch gelatinization, should be looked at further.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, three {{different}} modification methods (pregelatinization, acid-thinning and <b>dextrinization)</b> {{were used to}} produce the modified corn starches. Physicochemical and rheological properties of the native and modified corn starch were studied. In addition, the resultant modified corn starches were used at levels 5 %, 10 % and 15 % to replace wheat flour in noodle processing. The crude protein and lipid contents of modified corn starches significantly decreased compared to native ones. Water and oil binding capacity of corn starch increased up to 1. 49 and 2. 35 g/g, respectively, after modifying by the pregelatinization method. Results also showed that the maximum solubility was given by dextrinized corn starch after heat treatment at 90 °C being 44. 85 %, which means about 5. 9 -fold increase in solubility as compared to native starch. However, acid-thinning modified corn starch showed a significant decreased effect on the syneresis of its gel in comparison {{to those of other}} modified starches and the native one. The maximum viscosity decreased in pregelatinized starch followed by acid-thinned starch in comparison to native corn starch. The same trend was found in the viscosity after holding at 95 °C for 15 min. The highest noodle weight and volume increases were recorded for noodles containing 5 % and 10 % of native corn starch followed by 10 % of pregelatinized corn starch, as well as, the control. Replacing wheat flour with 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of native or pregelatinized corn starch did not cause any negative effects on sensory attributes of noodles in comparison to the control sample. Finally, it could be concluded that the native and pregelatinized corn starch can be used up to 15 % in noodle processing with high quality and acceptable sensory attributes...|$|E
