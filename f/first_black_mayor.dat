5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor</b> in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League wondered whether, if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, {{a federal}} {{district}} court {{ruled in favor of}} Curtis Holt Jr. who had claimed the council's existing election process— an at large voting system— was racially biased. The verdict required the city to rebuild its council into nine distinct wards. Within the year the city council switched from majority white to majority black, reflecting the city's populace. This new city council elected Richmond's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor,</b> Henry L. Marsh.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{volunteered for}} the {{campaign}} of John V. Tunney for the United States Senate in 1970. He started a statewide neighborhood crime watch program while serving {{as chairman of the}} California Council on Criminal Justice. His initial political experience included working to help Tom Bradley win election as Los Angeles's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor</b> in 1973. The historical significance of Bradley's victory further inspired Davis to pursue a career in politics. Davis ran for State Treasurer in 1974 but lost when the more popular Jesse Unruh filed to run on the deadline.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with its}} {{incorporation}} in 1802, Detroit {{has had a}} total of 74 mayors. Detroit's last mayor from the Republican Party was Louis Miriani, who served from 1957 to 1962. In 1973, the city elected its <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor,</b> Coleman Young. Despite development efforts, his combative style during his five terms in office was not well received by many suburban residents. Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Michigan Supreme Court Justice, refocused the city's attention on redevelopment {{with a plan to}} permit three casinos downtown. By 2008, three major casino resort hotels established operations in the city.|$|E

25|$|Though Brazilians of {{at least}} partial African {{heritage}} make up {{a large percentage of}} the population, few blacks have been elected as politicians. The city of Salvador, Bahia, for instance, is 80% people of color, but voters have not elected a mayor of color. Journalists like to say that US cities with black majorities, such as Detroit and New Orleans, have not elected white mayors since after the civil rights movement, when the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protected the franchise for minorities, and blacks in the South regained the power to vote for the first time since the turn of the 20th century. New Orleans elected its <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor</b> in the 1970s. New Orleans elected a white mayor after the widescale disruption and damage of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, the {{department}} hired {{its first two}} black officers, Robert William Stewart and Roy Green.. The LAPD {{was one of the}} first two police departments in the country to hire an African-American woman officer, Georgia Ann Robinson in 1919. Despite this, {{the department}} was slow at integration. During the 1965 Watts riots, only 5 of the 205 police assigned to South Central Los Angeles were black, despite the fact that it was the largest black community in Los Angeles. Los Angeles' <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor</b> Tom Bradley was an ex-police officer and quit the department after being unable to advance past the rank of lieutenant like other black police officers in the department. When Bradley was elected mayor in 1972, only 5% of LAPD officers were black and there was only one black captain in the department, Homer Broome. Broome would break down racial barriers on the force going on to become first black officer to obtain the rank of commander and the first black to command a police station, the Southwest Division which included historically black neighborhoods of South Central Los Angeles in 1975.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{members of the}} Missouri General Assembly and Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon again began attacking the {{desegregation}} plan {{on the grounds of}} its costs. Nixon proposed that instead of spending money to transfer students, funds would be better spent improving derelict conditions in city schools, a view supported by St. Louis's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor,</b> Freeman Bosley, Jr.. After another legal challenge to the plan in early 1996 (based on recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings), the court ordered a review of the plan and a second settlement agreement. A settlement plan developed in the Missouri legislature called for reduced state money for the program and a focus only on funding magnet schools in the city and the voluntary transfer program. All but one of the suburban districts agreed to renew the agreement on these terms (Ladue School District was the exception), and in 1999, the renewed settlement was established. However, under the 1999 agreement, school districts have been permitted to withdraw from the voluntary transfer program starting in 2002, and two districts have done so (Lindbergh School District and Pattonville School District). A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 2013–2014 school year in participating districts.|$|E

500|$|By {{spring of}} 2003, Brown was {{a rising star}} in the declining years of the [...] "Harlem Clubhouse", a loose {{political}} fraternity of David Dinkins, Charles Rangel, Basil Paterson, Percy Sutton and sometimes H. Carl McCall that had dominated state politics while forging the careers of its members {{for much of the}} late 20th century. He was envisioned as a front-runner for the 2006 Democratic nomination as Lieutenant Governor of New York or as Buffalo's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor.</b> By 2004 it seemed clear that he was eyeing the mayor's office. In the 2004 New York State Senate elections, Republican nominee Al Coppola opposed Brown for the redistricted 60th District and garnered only 23% of the vote.|$|E
500|$|Helen Shiller (born 1947) is {{a former}} Alderman of the 46th ward in Chicago, Illinois. She served in the Chicago City Council for six {{four-year}} terms, from 1987 to 2011. Shiller {{was elected to the}} City Council on her third attempt, as Harold Washington, Chicago's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>Mayor,</b> was re-elected to his second term, and her election as alderman helped close the Council Wars era in Chicago government. Shiller has been described as [...] "committed to liberal causes". Among her most significant impacts on Chicago were her advocacy for diverse, inclusive, affordable housing and helping craft Chicago's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Her commitment to fostering community development without displacement often brought Shiller into contention with some constituencies, real estate developers, and editorial boards. Shiller's oral history was collected by Pulitzer Prize-winning author and Uptown resident Studs Terkel in his 2003 book, Hope Dies Last.|$|E
500|$|Burke was, {{along with}} Alderman Edward Vrdolyak, {{a leader of}} the [...] "Vrdolyak 29", a City Council {{majority}} voting block, which included 28 white and one Puerto Rican aldermen, who opposed the agenda of the newly elected Mayor Harold Washington, Chicago's <b>first</b> <b>black</b> <b>mayor,</b> during Washington's first three years as mayor, 1983–1986, a period referred to as Council Wars. Vrdolyak, a Burke mentor, was chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party. Vrdolyak forged the alliance by expanding the number of city council committees to 29 and negotiating 29 committee chairmanship assignments. On May 2, 1983, during the first city council meeting of the Washington administration, the mayor and some aldermen left the meeting, Vrdolyak was President pro tempore of the city council (chair of city council meetings when the mayor is not present) so he continued the meeting. Burke was chosen to chair the powerful Finance Committee.|$|E
