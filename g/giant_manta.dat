40|$|Sightings of planktivorous {{elasmobranchs}} {{at their}} coastal aggregation sites are often linked to biological, environmental and temporal variables. Many large planktivorous elasmobranchs are also globally threatened species, {{so it is}} necessary to try and separate population trends from environmentally driven, short-term fluctuations. We investigated the influence of environmental variables on sightings of 3 species of planktivorous elasmobranchs off Praia do Tofo, Mozambique: the reef manta ray Manta alfredi, <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> ray M. birostris and whale shark Rhincodon typus. We used 8 - (2003 to 2011) and 6 -yr (2005 to 2011) logbook data for manta rays and whale sharks, respectively, and constructed a generalised linear model with animal sightings as the response. Predictors included temporal (year, month, time of day), biological (plankton categories), oceanographic (water temperature, time from high tide, current direction and strength and wave height) and celestial (moon illumination) indices. These predictors best fitted reef manta ray sightings, a coastal species with high residency, but less so for the wider-ranging <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> rays and whale sharks. We found a significant decline in the standardised sightings time series for the reef manta ray (88 %) and whale shark (79 %), but not for the <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> ray...|$|E
50|$|Reef {{manta rays}} are {{typically}} 3 to 3.5 m in disc width, {{with a maximum}} size of about 5.5 m.

Compared to the <b>giant</b> oceanic <b>manta</b> ray, the reef manta ray tends to be found in shallower, more coastal habitats, but local migrations are sometimes reported.Manta birostris is similar in appearance to Manta alfredi and the two species may be confused as their distribution overlaps.

5000|$|The first {{difference}} {{could be}} the size because the <b>giant</b> oceanic <b>manta</b> ray is bigger than the reef manta ray, 4 to(-) 5 m on average versus 3 to(-) 3.5 m on average. However, if the observed rays are young, their size can easily bring confusion. Only the color pattern remains a fast and effective way to distinguish them.The reef manta ray has a dark dorsal side with usually two lighter areas {{on top of the}} head, looking like a nuanced gradient of its dark dominating back coloration and whitish to greyish, the longitudinal separation between these two lighter areas forms a kind of “Y”.While for the oceanic manta ray, the dorsal surface is deep dark and the two white areas are well marked without gradient effect.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of diet for the <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> ray Manta birostris has been problematic given their large-scale movement patterns {{and the difficulty}} in obtaining stomach contents from this species.

Recently discovered aggregation sites for the <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> ray off mainland Ecuador {{are some of the}} most accessible to date and provide a unique opportunity for researchers to gather much needed information on this elusive species. To assess how important surface zooplankton is to <b>giant</b> <b>manta</b> ray diet, we conducted stable isotope analysis (N- 15 and C- 13) on M. birostris muscle and surface zooplankton. Trophic position estimates placed M. birostris overall at a secondary consumer level of approximately 3. 4 but there was large variation in delta N- 15 and delta C- 13 values among individuals. Manta birostris muscle tissue delta C- 13 values were also not consistent with this species feeding predominantly on surface zooplankton and suggest that the majority of dietary intake is of mesopelagic origin. Given the conservative life history and fisheries pressure on large planktivores, knowledge of their trophic role and foraging strategies is essential to better understand their ecology and develop effective conservation measures...|$|E

50|$|When {{traveling}} in deep water, the <b>giant</b> oceanic <b>manta</b> ray swims steadily {{in a straight}} line, while further inshore it usually basks or swims idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50 and sometimes associate with other fish species, as well as sea birds and marine mammals. They are filter feeders and consume large quantities of zooplankton {{in the form of}} shrimp, krill, and planktonic crabs. An individual manta may eat about 13% of its body weight each week. When foraging, it usually swims slowly around its prey, herding the planktonic creatures into a tight group before speeding through the bunched-up organisms with its mouth open wide. While feeding, the cephalic fins are spread to channel the prey into its mouth and the small particles are sifted from the water by the tissue between the gill arches. As many as 50 individual fish may gather at a single, plankton-rich feeding site.|$|R

A study on Manta rays from the Indian Ocean was {{conducted}} from April 2001 to August 2005 at Cilacap-Central Java and Tanjungluar-East Lombok fish landings. Catch data of Cilacap fishing port from 2006 to 2011 are also presented in this paper. The methodology utilized was direct observations and data collection by enumerators. The results show that Manta rays were caught as by-catch of tuna gillnet and tuna longline fishing in the Indian Ocean. There were three age groups (cohorts) of the Manta birostris caught in the Indian Ocean, i. e. size class between 200 - 300 cm disc width (DW) as a young group, 301 - 400 cm DW (subadult group), and 401 - 500 cm DW (adult group), respectivelly. The sex ratio of males to females of Manta birostris was 1 : 1 (P> 0. 05).
