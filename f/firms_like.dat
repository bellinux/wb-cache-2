A number of smaller firms were also contracted. The cost was estimated at $395,000 per ship, or approximately $8 million in total. Some shipyards, such as Cramp, were forced to substantially upgrade their ironworking facilities for the production of the new vessels.|$|E
25|$|The US government's {{attitude}} towards fascism seemed less friendly, but President Roosevelt ultimately joined with Britain and France in taking a strictly neutral {{policy in the}} Spanish Civil War, thereby enabling Francisco Franco's victory there. With no serious sanctions on the rising Axis powers until 1941, top US <b>firms</b> <b>like</b> IBM and General Motors were extremely active in Nazi Germany for years, and exchange controls ensured that most of their profits were cycled back into the country, strengthening Hitler's regime; this also meant that Nazi-associated businesses like IG Farben and Thyssen industries did extensive dealings with elite US banks like Brown Brothers Harriman and Union Banking Corporation up through 1942. Franklin Roosevelt also expressed support for the Munich agreement, in spite of it allowing for a partition of Czechoslovakia.|$|E

25|$|In 1981 Ebonite began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first urethane cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. Ebonite produced AMF balls at that time. Ebonite {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. That ball became the AMF Angle and this one coverstock change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the urethane finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation.

25|$|Nonethelesses, belligerents {{were able}} to {{purchase}} torpedo boats, arms and munitions abroad and to circumvent ambiguous neutrality laws, and <b>firms</b> <b>like</b> Baring Brothers in London were not averse to dealing with both Chile and Peru. Arms were sold freely to whichever side could pay for them (but not British warships). For example, in the 1879–1880 period Peru acquired weapons from the United States, Europe, Costa Rica and Panama. Weapons offloaded on the Caribbean coast of Panama were sent overland to the Pacific coast by the isthmus railway. In the Pacific a number of ships including Talismán, Chalaco, Limeña, Estrella, Enriqueta and Guadiana transported the cargo to Peru. This trade {{was done with the}} consent {{of the president of the}} Sovereign State of Panamá (then part of Colombia). The Chilean consul in Panama persistently protested against this trade citing a Chile–Colombia agreement of 1844 that prohibited Colombia from providing war supplies to Chile's enemies.|$|E
