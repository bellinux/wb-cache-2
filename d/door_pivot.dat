50|$|The Apple Store {{location}} was just remodeled and expanded (re-opened March 26, 2016). The large glass entrance <b>doors</b> now <b>pivot</b> 90 degrees when {{the store is}} open, new diffuse lighting, no discrete Genius Bar, elegant wood, and other hallmarks of the new Apple store design language.|$|R
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a <b>door</b> that <b>pivots</b> down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|R
25|$|Most {{doors are}} hinged {{along one side}} to allow the <b>door</b> to <b>pivot</b> away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of {{rotation}} is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged garage doors, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.|$|R

5000|$|Many flexure {{bearings}} {{are made}} of a single part; two rigid structures joined by a thin [...] "hinge" [...] area. A hinged door can be created by implementing a flexible element between a door and the door frame, such that the flexible element bends allowing the <b>door</b> to <b>pivot</b> open.|$|R
50|$|The central front {{entrance}} comprises a draft lobby {{consisting of a}} pair of exterior timber paneled doors with an arched fanlight and a pair of interior glazed timber <b>doors</b> on <b>pivoting</b> hinges. These swing doors are notable for the decorative brass, timber and glass handles. The flanking arched openings accommodate large double-hung timber sash windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept has}} {{butterfly}} <b>doors</b> and <b>pivoted</b> {{up to the}} front to allow passengers to exit from the car in places that ordinary conventional doors cannot handle. Gas filled struts kept the door in place when open. The doors covered the roof of the car as well as the sides, with the door glass forming part of the roof.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{a sliding}} {{door at the}} side the Samba had two <b>pivot</b> <b>doors.</b> In {{addition}} the Samba had a fabric sunroof. At that time Volkswagen advertised {{with the idea of}} using the Samba to make tourist trips through the Alps.|$|R
30|$|Removing {{the central}} {{handrail}} and adding more grab rails at head height increases space without compromising passenger comfort. An {{addition to the}} design would be to add portable shelving to {{the part of the}} carriage between the <b>doors</b> and <b>pivoting</b> bogie. The shelving would be mounted on wheels with brakes to allow easy entry and removal from the carriage. This shelving would be used for smaller, individual packages that would not be transported using the cargo boxes.|$|R
5000|$|Dual and tri-operating gates: Ford's {{full-size}} wagons for 1966 {{introduced a}} system marketed as [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] — a conventional tailgate with retracting rear glass, where the tailgate could either fold down or pivot open {{on a side}} hinge — with the rear window retracted in either case. Competitors marketed their versions as a Drop and Swing or Dual Action Tailgate. [...] For 1969, Ford incorporated a design that allowed the rear glass to remain up or down when the <b>door</b> <b>pivoted</b> open on its side hinge, marketing the system, which had been engineered by Donald N. Frey as the [...] "Three-Way Magic Doorgate". Similar configurations became the standard on full-size and intermediate wagons from GM, Ford, and Chrysler. GM added a notch in the rear bumper that acted as a step plate; to fill the gap, {{a small portion of}} bumper was attached to the doorgate. When opened as a swinging door, this part of the bumper moved away, allowing the depression in the bumper to provide a [...] "step" [...] to ease entry; when the gate was opened by being lowered or raised to a closed position, the chrome section remained in place making the bumper [...] "whole".|$|R
25|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>door,</b> {{instead of}} hinges, is {{supported}} on a bearing {{some distance away}} from the edge, {{so that there is}} more or less of a gap on the pivot side as well as the opening side. In some cases the pivot is central, creating two equal openings.|$|R
50|$|The {{design for}} U.S. Bank Stadium has been {{compared}} to the Crystal Cathedral in southern California, which was created by architect Philip Johnson. Opened in 1980, Crystal Cathedral was previously considered America's largest glass-dominated building. The stadium, which likewise sports transparent roofs, walls, and giant rotating doors, has the world's five largest <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
60|$|I had {{not long}} to wait, for {{presently}} the golden surface commenced to move rapidly. Scarcely had it started than I gave {{the signal to}} Tars Tarkas, simultaneously springing for the receding half of the <b>pivoting</b> <b>door.</b> In like manner the Thark wheeled and leaped for the opening being made by the inswinging section.|$|R
50|$|The F300 Rocky/Feroza {{underwent}} {{some very}} minor facelifts during its production, mostly limited to different grilles with early cars having a chromed unit. The taillights were {{mounted in the}} bodywork, but some cars had blinds in these spaces and instead carried their taillights in an enlarged rear bumper. This was due to legislation introduced in some markets regarding the rear <b>pivot</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other common {{devices for}} {{containing}} water spray include a highly flexible, waterproof shower curtain, or more recently, a shower door, {{which is a}} permanently installed sliding or <b>pivoting</b> <b>door</b> made from glass or plastic. Containing water spray, leaks, and splashes within the bathtub is particularly important in bathrooms constructed with wooden under-flooring because water causes the wooden floor boards and floor joists to rot or decay over time, if left unattended.|$|R
50|$|Luce’s {{approach}} to architecture is art-based and associative: Research and dialogue uncover correspondences between design concepts and other creative disciplines such as musical composition, scientific research, or the visual arts, for example. Luce {{is known for}} pairing a minimalist, industrial sensibility with unusual materials chosen for sensory impact. The studio’s signature design {{approach to}} doors as “transformations” is evident in completed residential projects and {{on a large scale}} in the Nissan building in Farmington Hills, with its 20-foot high stainless steel <b>door</b> on a <b>pivot.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} is a {{door actuator}} and alignment apparatus for {{opening and closing}} the 15, 000 -pound horizontally sliding door of a storage overpack. The door actuator includes a ball screw mounted horizontally on a rigid frame including a pair of door panel support rails. An electrically powered ball nut moves along the ball screw. The ball nut rotating device {{is attached to a}} carriage. The carriage attachment to the sliding <b>door</b> is horizontally <b>pivoting.</b> Additional alignment features include precision cam followers attached to the rails and rail guides attached to the carriage...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] {{western end}} {{features}} a cantilevered street awning over the western entrance detailed with decorative cornicing and circular motifs. Horizontal banding visually distinguishes the building's two floor levels. Tall, rectangular windows puncture {{the western end}} of the elevation while a circular porthole style window is centrally located above the western entrance. From here the bell tower rises and features tall, rectangular windows and clock faces to all four sides. It is capped with a pyramidal roof and a scalloped parapet wall forms a solid balustrade allowing access to the bell chamber. Access into the [...] end of the elevation is via timber paneled doors which open onto an octagonal-shaped and timber-lined entrance vestibule. A decorative leadlight fanlight is located above the entrance. Another pair of glazed and paneled swing <b>doors</b> on <b>pivoting</b> hinges provides access into the lower vestibule. Floors in the entrance vestibule are terrazzo with a central motif pattern.|$|R
50|$|Original {{internal}} walls {{on the upper}} two levels are finished with plaster lined to imitate stone ashlar while ceilings on all levels are lined with double beaded tongue and groove boards with timber cornices. Internal openings are generous in height and consist of timber-paneled <b>doors</b> with glazed <b>pivoting</b> fanlights above. Generous timber skirting boards, skirting blocks and architraves are located in many areas. The majority of the interior timber work and joinery is clear finished though the skirting in the rear office of the ground floor has been painted. Original door and window furniture survives and some light fittings including gas jets above the staircase and in the rear office on the first floor.|$|R
50|$|Architecture firm HKS, Inc., also {{responsible}} for the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium and the Indianapolis Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium, {{decided to go for}} a lightweight translucent roof and glazed entrances with giant <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors,</b> aiming to get as much natural light from the outside as possible. The roof is made up of 60% Ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a fluorine-based clear plastic, and is the largest in North America, spanning 240000 sq ft supplied and installed by the firm Vector Foiltec. ETFE's low R-factor and the roof's slanted design, inspired by Nordic vernacular architecture, allows the stadium to endure heavy snow loads. Snow accumulates in areas that are more safely and easily accessible, and also moves down the slanted roof into a heated gutter, the water from which drains to the nearby Mississippi River.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} walls {{on the upper}} two levels are lined with plaster while ceilings on both levels are lined with double-beaded tongue and groove pine boards with elaborate cornices using plaster to walls and timber to ceilings. The floors on both levels are covered with carpet. Ceiling roses remain in the upper living room (timber) and in the front foyer (plaster). Internal openings are generous in height and consist of timber-paneled <b>doors</b> with glazed <b>pivoting</b> fanlights above. The original rear door leading into the 1930s addition has patterned and obscure glass panels. The former lower level rear window is still in place and is a multi-paned double-hung timber-framed window. Generous cedar skirting boards, skirting blocks and architraves are located in many areas {{and the majority of}} the interior timber work and joinery is clear finished. Original window and door furniture generally survives.|$|R
50|$|Identified as {{standard}} type C/T2, Block C retains important fabric that identifies {{it as an}} early Department of Public Works design. It is a high-set, timber-framed building with a northern and southern verandah and a gable roof. Four sets of timber stairs provide access to the verandahs and the northern verandah is connected to Block D to the east. The walls are clad with weatherboards and the roof with corrugated metal sheeting. Both the gable end walls have a panel of ventilating weatherboards. The verandah walls are single-skin, lined internally, with chamfered stud framing exposed externally. The verandah walls have a ventilation flap at floor level and retain original double leaf <b>doors</b> with <b>pivoting</b> fanlights. The southern verandah retains a hat room enclosure at its southern end. The interior is partitioned into two rooms connected by a large opening; this partition is not of cultural heritage significance. The interior walls and ceiling are lined with v-jointed tongue and groove timber boards. The ceiling is coved and has a latticed ventilation panel. Timber tie beams at cornice level are exposed in the space. The fenestration pattern remains intact with windows only in the eastern and western walls sheltered by original timber hoods with timber brackets and battened cheeks. The northern verandah is enclosed at the western end. A small teacher's room projects from both verandahs. A small enclosure of the northern verandah accommodates a store room that is not of cultural heritage significance.|$|R
500|$|On {{the north}} side of the {{building}} was a fortified standard gauge railway station, linked to the main Calais-Saint-Omer line at Watten via a [...] spur line. Missiles, warheads and other components would be shipped to the station and transported on trucks into the main area of the bunker. Here the rockets were to be assembled, raised into a vertical position and fuelled and armed. From the arming halls, they would be moved to either end of the building through <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors</b> [...] high. They would exit through the south face of the building and would be moved on tracks to the launch pads. There were no doors on the exit portals so chicanes were installed in the exit passage to deflect the blast of rockets being launched from outside. Launches would be overseen from a command tower located in the centre of the south side of the bunker, overlooking the launch pads.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sides of}} the Cathedral {{comprise}} twelve reinforced concrete arched window units surmounted by reinforced concrete spandrel panels and separated by brick piers, with wider panels of brickwork at either end. Paired timber panelled <b>doors</b> surmounted by <b>pivoting</b> fanlights are located below each arched window and open from the nave and sanctuary onto the side verandahs. The fanlights are glazed to match the arched windows above. Three bays of the southern verandah are enclosed to form a side chapel adjacent to the sanctuary. This side chapel has five narrow reinforced concrete arched window units which are separated by brick piers. All windows in the Cathedral were originally glazed with a burgundy red field and an amber border; however the eastern windows {{and a number of}} the northern windows to the nave and sanctuary have been reglazed with stained/painted glass. Two sets of paired confessionals, which are the same height as the side doors and are surmounted by fanlights, are located on both side verandahs.|$|R
50|$|On {{the north}} side of the {{building}} was a fortified standard gauge railway station, linked to the main Calais-Saint-Omer line at Watten via a 1.2 km spur line. Missiles, warheads and other components would be shipped to the station and transported on trucks into the main area of the bunker. Here the rockets were to be assembled, raised into a vertical position and fuelled and armed. From the arming halls, they would be moved to either end of the building through <b>pivoting</b> <b>doors</b> 18 m high. They would exit through the south face of the building and would be moved on tracks to the launch pads.

50|$|On {{the triple}} gabled {{north-western}} elevation all openings {{are protected by}} timber framed corrugated clad awnings and each apex houses a pair of centre pivoting sashes: two light sashes to Bay 1 and four light sashes to Bays 2 and 3. Bay 1 comprises a central pair of doors with tall centre pivoting fanlights above, between two double hung windows, covered by an awning supported on steel posts which provides protection for the air conditioning units positioned against the wall. Bay 2 comprises a row of three pairs of centre pivoting sashes above a large awning supported on four timber posts. Under the awning, a single four panel door and three small windows to the toilets are separated {{by a pair of}} four panel <b>doors</b> (with centre <b>pivoting</b> fanlights over) accessed by a set of stairs. Bay 3 contains a large, central, sliding ledged and braced door with a braced and ledged door adjacent to the north.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the tiled}} lower-storey {{verandah}} is gained from Burnett Street up a short flight of concrete stairs. The front <b>door</b> has a <b>pivoting</b> glass fanlight and opens onto a central hallway divided in two by an arched opening. The walls are plastered brick and a scraping has revealed a two-part colour scheme (light green atop dark, {{separated by a}} thin maroon band). Two rooms open to each side of this hallway. A set of stairs begins at its end and an opening to the sunroom fits under them. To the right are the living and dining spaces, which are joined by a broad archway. There is evidence that this wall was originally complete and featured a two-way fireplace, matching that which is found between the two rooms opening {{to the left of}} the hall. A section of brick chimneystack remains within the roof space. The ceilings are 3m in height and lined with 20 cm wide beaded tongue and groove boarding. The boarding features a central dummy bead. The hallway's ceiling is lined in a similar manner.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of greenhouse vent configuration on greenhouse microclimate and energy consumption when natural ventilation {{was used for}} greenhouse dehumidification was numerically analysed using a computational fluid dynamics model after its experimental validation. Two commonly found vent configurations (roll-up type and <b>pivoting</b> <b>door</b> type) were tested in a tunnel greenhouse with a mature tomato crop. The simulations were two dimensional and the solution was obtained in two steps. First a converged solution under steady-state conditions was obtained. Then, the flow was considered unsteady air humidity inside the greenhouse {{was assumed to be}} 90 % and air temperature 20 °C whereas the corresponding outside climate variables were 50 % and 10 °C. Ventilation openings were activated and air humidity and temperature were decreased in the greenhouse at a rate depending on the local value of the air velocity inside the greenhouse. The different vent arrangements resulted in different airflow patterns inside the greenhouse. As a result of the different airflows, the temperatures and humidities inside the greenhouse were reduced accordingly during dehumidification. The ratio of latent to sensible heat exchange during the dehumidification process was chosen as the criterion in order to evaluate the energy efficiency of each ventilation configuration. The roll-type vent configuration had the best energy performance...|$|R
5000|$|Like its predecessor, the Art Institute, the {{building}} for San Francisco State shares a preoccupation with the horizontal {{in the creation of}} an artificial datum. The result of a competition and the byproduct of Moshe Safdie, who had previously been awarded the commission, Keatinge-Clay claimed the design {{to be the result of}} countless hours of collective workshops and collaborative student input. The student workshops resulted in two trapezoidal concrete pyramids: one that aligned sectionally with an axis to Polaris, the North Star, to create a space for “quiet, introspective activities”, the other was composed of an occupiable roof terrace/theater, for “boisterious, public activities”. More than half the program is buried below ground on a prominent site at the heart of the campus facing the main quadrangle. The whole is accessed through a pair of 30 ft high enamelled steel offset <b>pivot</b> <b>doors</b> that open into a great public room on the interior of {{the building}} from which all functions were to be accessed. Structural expression was designed in the form of a triangulated series of poured-in-place concrete columns, ordered on a decidedly Wrightian [...] "triagrid" [...] plan module that hearkens back to the Usonian house studies of the late 1940s.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{efficiency}} of two different greenhouse ventilation opening configurations on greenhouse microclimate during dehumidification process with simultaneously heating and ventilation was analysed by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using a commercial program based on the finite volume method. The numerical model was firstly validated against experimental data collected in a tunnel greenhouse identical with the one used in simulations. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement {{was found between the}} numerical results and the experimental measurements. The results of the simulations performed for an outside wind direction perpendicular to the greenhouse axis show clearly the influence of ventilation opening configurations on the velocity, temperature and humidity distributions inside the greenhouse. With the first ventilation configuration (roll-up type) maximum air velocity inside the greenhouse was reached in the greenhouse near the ground, with the lowest values observed near the greenhouse roof. As a result, temperature and humidity decreased first near the ground and afterwards {{in the rest of the}} greenhouse volume during the dehumidification process. The exactly opposite pattern was observed with the second configuration (<b>pivoting</b> <b>door</b> type). The maximum air velocities were observed near the greenhouse roof where air temperature and humidity were decreased first during the dehumidification process. Energetically the first configuration is proven to be better since the ratio of latent to sensible exchanges during the dehumidification process was higher than the first configuration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

6000|$|The left or {{opposite}} bank, which wants water, {{is formed}} by the tall conglomerate-capped cliffs, which support the [...] "Muttali'" [...] or hauteville, and by the warty block called Jebel el-Fahísát. In [...] "The Gold-Mines of Midian" [...] (Chap. XII.) it is called El-Muzayndi, an error of my informants for El-Muzeúdi: the latter {{is the name of}} the small red hill north of our camp. I again visited the high town, which is about a hundred feet above the valley: presently it will disappear bodily, as its base is being corroded, like the Jebel el-Safrá of Magháir Shu'ayb. The walls still standing form a long room running north-south; and the two adjoining closets set off to the north-east and south-east. This sadly shrunken upper settlement covers the remnant of the rocky plateau to the east: there are also traces of building on the southern slopes. Ruined heaps of the usual material, gypsum, dot and line the short broad valley to the north, which rejoices in the neat and handy name, Wady Majrá Sayl Jebel el-Marú. Here, however, they are hardly to be distinguished from the chloritic spines and natural sandbanks that stud the bed. The only antiquities found in the [...] "Muttali"' were a stone cut into parallel bands, and the fragment of a basalt <b>door</b> with its <b>pivot</b> acting as hinge in the upper part: it reminded me of the Græco-Roman townlets in the Haurán, where the credulous discovered [...] "giant Cities" [...] and similar ineptitudes.

50|$|A chimney damper is a {{metal plate}} {{that can be}} {{positioned}} to close off the chimney {{when not in use}} and prevent outside air from entering the interior space, and can be opened to permit hot gases to exhaust when a fire is burning. A top damper or cap damper is a metal spring door placed {{at the top of the}} chimney with a long metal chain that allows one to open and close the damper from the fireplace. A throat damper is a metal plate at the base of the chimney, just above the firebox, that can be opened and closed by a lever, gear, or chain to seal off the fireplace from the chimney. The advantage of a top damper is the tight weatherproof seal that it provides when closed, which prevents cold outside air from flowing down the chimney and into the living space—a feature that can rarely be matched by the metal-on-metal seal afforded by a throat damper. Additionally, because the throat damper is subjected to intense heat from the fire directly below, it is common for the metal to become warped over time, thus further degrading the ability of the throat damper to seal. However, the advantage of a throat damper is that it seals off the living space from the air mass in the chimney, which, especially for chimneys positioned on an outside of wall of the home, is generally very cold. It is possible in practice to use both a top damper and a throat damper to obtain the benefits of both. The two top damper designs currently on the market are the Lyemance (<b>pivoting</b> <b>door)</b> and the Lock Top (translating door).|$|R
