5|$|Children of Men used several lengthy single-shot {{sequences}} {{in which}} extremely complex actions take place. The longest {{of these are}} a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and {{a scene in which}} Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> and through a building {{in the middle of a}} raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18). These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by CGI effects.|$|E
5|$|Anne learns {{from an old}} friend, Mrs. Smith (Helen Schlesinger), that Mr. Elliot is {{bankrupt}} {{and only}} interested in marrying Anne to help ensure his inheritance from her father. Anne also is told that Mr. Elliot wishes to keep the baronet from possibly marrying Mrs. Clay to produce a male heir. Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street,</b> arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} production team IKIOI. It opens with a birds-eye view shot from the ground, showing several buildings and trees; just before the first verse, a short shot of Amuro is seen. The first verse opens with Amuro walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> in Los Angeles, California, singing to the track. During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings and landscapes around Los Angeles. The camera then pans into several individuals citizens in the city: an elderly couple, {{a man in his}} car, a couple who have just finished surfing, and a woman walking her dog.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|Filming {{took place}} in the summer of 2002. Whereas the actual Calendar Girls were members of the Rylstone Women's Institute, much of the film was shot in and around the village of Kettlewell in North Yorkshire, some ten miles away. Additional {{locations}} include Buckden, Burnsall, Coniston, Ilkley, Settle, Linton, Malham, Skipton, Westminster and Ealing in London, and the beach in Santa Monica. The penultimate shot of Chris and Annie walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> was filmed in Turville. Interiors were filmed in the Shepperton Studios.|$|E
25|$|On October 20, 2014, 17-year old Laquan McDonald was {{fatally shot}} by Officer Jason Van Dyke. The killing sparked protests {{and calls for}} the mayor to resign. A video {{released}} revealed McDonald walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street,</b> carrying a knife. McDonald was walking parallel to the two police cars {{when he was shot}} 16 times. A criminal complaint filed in Cook County Circuit Court revealed that Van Dyke was the only officer to shoot. The complaint also said that McDonald was on PCP {{at the time of his}} death. Protestors were frustrated that the video took 13 months to release. A freelance journalist sued to have the footage released as it was a public record. A judge found in the reporter's favor and the video became public in November 2015.|$|E
25|$|Faye's first film, {{which she}} also acted in, was a 1972 short called La Passante (The Passerby), drawn from her {{experiences}} as a foreign woman in Paris. It follows a woman (Faye) walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> and noticing the reactions of men nearby. Faye's first feature film was Kaddu Beykat which means The Voice of the Peasant in Wolof and was known internationally as Letter from My Village or News from My Village. She obtained financial backing for Kaddu Beykat from the French Ministry of Cooperation. Released in 1975, {{it was the first}} feature film to be made by a Sub-Saharan African woman to be commercially distributed and gained international recognition for Faye. On its release it was banned in Senegal. In 1976 it won the FIPRESCI Prize from the International Federation of Film Critics (tied with Chhatrabhang) and the OCIC Award.|$|E

25|$|Profits {{were made}} immediately, and in 1877 an {{additional}} seven cars were delivered, allowing the headway to drop to five minutes. The company {{became a major}} retailer of used horses. These were sought after due to the good treatment they received at the company. However, if they ever walked <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> with tracks they would follow these blindly and {{it was difficult to}} get them to diverge off the route. From 1878, the fare increased to 15 øre for all routes. KSS opened its first extension on 18 March 1878, when {{the first part of the}} Grünerløkka–Torshov Line opened from Storgata to Thorvald Meyers gate. It was further extended to Beyer Bridge on 12 April 1879. In conjunction with this a new depot was built at Olaf Ryes plass with place for fifty horses and a number of horsecars. The Vestbanen Line was extended to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} {{series of the}} show, the opening {{sequence}} consisted of a police car, a Rover SD1, racing <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> with its siren wailing and its blue flashing light on. The car would screech to a stop, and the camera would zoom in on the blue light. Various clips were then shown from the series {{of the characters in}} action, often chasing suspects. This sequence kept the first version of [...] "Overkill", and also used the same ending credits from series one. This sequence was also used in the third series.|$|E
500|$|The {{first ever}} opening {{sequence}} of The Bill was first {{seen in the}} episode [...] "Funny Ol' Business – Cops & Robbers".

This sequence {{was used for the}} first series only. It featured the first version of the series iconic theme tune, [...] "Overkill", composed by Charlie Morgan and Andy Pask. The theme is notable for its use of septuple meter. The end titles of the series simply showed the feet of the two police constables pounding the beat.|$|E

500|$|Baffert {{created some}} {{controversy}} {{prior to the}} Belmont by choosing to work the horse at Churchill Downs and ship late to Belmont Park without a timed workout at the New York track. While several prominent trainers questioned his decision, Baffert {{believed that it was}} more important to keep American Pharoah [...] "happy" [...] on a track he liked, having used a similar strategy with his 2001 Belmont Stakes winner, Point Given. Rival trainers Kiaran McLaughlin and D. Wayne Lukas backed Baffert's strategy, with McLaughlin making the remark, [...] "I don't think it matters for American Pharoah. He could probably run <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> over broken glass." [...] Appearing unperturbed but curious about a small crowd of well-wishers, American Pharoah arrived at Long Island MacArthur Airport on June 2, having traveled from Louisville, Kentucky on a customized Boeing 727 dubbed [...] "Air Horse One".|$|E
500|$|Randle {{described}} the feeling {{after the game}} as, [...] "It's like driving <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> and getting every green light {{for the next ten}} miles, and you're just cruising along, and it's just smooth. And all of a sudden, you're getting there, you're almost there, and all of a sudden, the fucking light turns red, and you get sideswiped." [...] Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as [...] "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." [...] Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the Philadelphia Eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.|$|E
500|$|As {{the song}} begins, Brown watches a woman, who {{appears as a}} hologram, lying in a bed. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing {{in front of a}} flowing backdrop. He then {{approaches}} the woman, and together they appear under white bedsheets. Brown is then seen walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street,</b> while women are shown levitating out of their beds as he passes by them. He then enters a limo and starts caressing various ghostlike female figures. Brown then returns to the bedroom where he [...] "strips shirtless and makes passionate love" [...] to the woman [...] "as they are showered in water". He later enters a dance studio, where he performs a dance routine with other shirtless male dancers, while several women watch them from across the room. Towards the end of the video, more scenes are shown of Brown and the woman in the bedroom.|$|E

500|$|The visual {{begins with}} {{a shot of the}} three singers walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> in Venice Beach, {{followed}} by them getting ice cream and being on top of a motorcycle. As the singers lip-sync their verses, the camera zooms in each singer. These are interspersed with clips of the trio {{standing in front of a}} wall with several graffitis. Later on, they are seen sitting on chairs on a beach, with [...] "coquettish" [...] sunglasses; walking near the sea. As the song builds to its last compass, they run to an orange convertible, in which they drive to a desert. They reach the desert and are joined by a marching band, who play the drums heard in the song. The group exits the car and start dancing to the sound of the drums. The very last scene of the music video sees Siobhan driving them away as they have their hands in the air, and the screen fades to black.|$|E
500|$|In {{the video}} the Pussycat Dolls are shown {{sitting in a}} car {{in the middle of a}} traffic jam, where Scherzinger flashes a ring that says [...] "famous".

Then they walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> of Hollywood stars with bubbles floating all around them. As they walk down the street, they also stop to sing on a bench. As the second chorus starts, the Dolls climb scaffolding and begin to dance. During Scherzinger's solo, she stands in a small area with the Pussycat Dolls logo to the left and a mirror to the right, with lights flashing. The Dolls then dance in the breakdown section with the logo behind them and the camera zooms out to reveal filming equipment and playback screens.|$|E

[...] Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade, and led 50men <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>street</b> towards a two-story building. [...] The building formed part of the city's defenses, and was in fact a blockhouse occupied by 15Quebec militia armed with muskets and cannons. [...] The defenders opened fire at close range, and Montgomery was killed instantly, shot through the head by a burst of grapeshot. [...] The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade; only Aaron Burr and a few others escaped unhurt. [...] Many of Montgomery's officers were injured in the attack; {{one of the few remaining}} uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham, leaving Montgomery's body behind.|$|E
