5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) were <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> {{ribs and}} gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports {{the theory that}} these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory was}} {{put forward by}} the Russian scholar Ph. Bruun in 1876, who {{suggested}} that Prester John might be <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> kings of Georgia, which, {{at the time of}} Crusades, experienced military resurgence challenging the Muslim power. However, this theory, though regarded with certain indulgence by Henry Yule and some modern Georgian historians, was summarily dismissed by Friedrich Zarncke.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Zapotec and Maya civilisations.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang music likely {{evolved from}} this simple {{signaling}} tradition, transitioning into a period consisting of one player, one-gong type ensembles (like those <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Ifugao of Luzon or Tiruray of Mindanao), developing into a multi-gong, multiplayer ensemble with {{the incorporation of}} concepts originating from Sunda and finally transforming into the present day kulintang ensemble, {{with the addition of}} the d’bakan, babndir and musical concepts of Islam via Islam traders.|$|E

5|$|The Austrians {{fell back}} into Alessandria, having lost about half the forces they had committed.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the gongs {{themselves}} are still disputed by scholars. It is likely, as observed by Thomas Forrest, a British explorer, that gongs without knobs on them (like the gandingan) came from China. However, other sources suggest the gandingan came to the Philippines via Indonesia or Malaysian Sarawak due to similar gandingan-type instruments <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Tausug of Sulu.|$|E

5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and {{the outline of a}} new will was <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the raid}} one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had been killed and eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former. The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom two later died. A Japanese man was <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen as evidence that the Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. The American soldiers were commended for their bravery during the raid, and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious.

Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Russian generals, the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich von Schmitt and Friedrich Karl Wilhelm, Fürst zu Hohenlohe. Although retired since 1800, Schmitt had been recalled after the Ulm debacle and had come to Kutuzov highly recommended by the Emperor. He was an experienced tactician and strategist and had served {{in a variety of}} posts in the Habsburg military; he had been Archduke Charles' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles' victories. Upon his recall, Schmitt was appointed Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Coalition Army. The generals also had <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Austrian force one Capt. Christoph Freiherr von Stiebar (1753–1824), who had knowledge of the local geography.|$|E
5|$|Most gods were {{depicted}} in several ways. Hathor {{could be a}} cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are {{depicted in}} {{a finite number of}} these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. Combinations of forms, such as gods with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.|$|E

50|$|In 323 AD, Constantine the Great {{recognised}} the Christian religion, and in 356 Constantius II {{ordered the}} closing of pagan temples throughout the empire. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were <b>founded</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> ruins, the most famous {{example of this is}} the reuse of the Festival Hall of Thutmose III's central hall, where painted decorations of saints and Coptic inscriptions can still be seen.|$|R
5|$|Some {{passengers}} and crew members who called from the aircraft using the cabin airphone service and mobile phones provided details: several hijackers were aboard each plane; they used mace, tear gas, or pepper spray to overcome attendants; and some people aboard had been stabbed. Reports indicated hijackers stabbed and killed pilots, flight attendants, and one or more passengers. According to the 9/11 Commission's final report, the hijackers had recently purchased multi-function hand tools and assorted Leatherman-type utility knives with locking blades, which were not forbidden to passengers at the time, but were not <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> possessions {{left behind by the}} hijackers. A flight attendant on Flight 11, a passenger on Flight 175, and passengers on Flight 93 said the hijackers had bombs, but one of the passengers said he thought the bombs were fake. The FBI found no traces of explosives at the crash sites, and the 9/11 Commission concluded that the bombs were probably fake.|$|E
5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan but it has also been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan are <b>found</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though {{there exist}} no identifiable rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with {{names such as}} the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three identifiable compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E
