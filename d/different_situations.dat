5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, the effect it has on humans in <b>different</b> <b>situations,</b> etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.|$|E
5|$|Players may {{initially}} {{choose from}} five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, USA, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in {{fields such as}} technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in <b>different</b> <b>situations,</b> since each have different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control.|$|E
5|$|In many {{naturally}} occurring bilayers, the compositions {{of the inner}} and outer membrane leaflets are different. In human red blood cells, the inner (cytoplasmic) leaflet is composed mostly of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives. By contrast, the outer (extracellular) leaflet is based on phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin and a variety of glycolipids, In some cases, this asymmetry is based on where the lipids are made in the cell and reflects their initial orientation. The biological functions of lipid asymmetry are imperfectly understood, although it is clear that it is used in several <b>different</b> <b>situations.</b> For example, when a cell undergoes apoptosis, the phosphatidylserine— normally localised to the cytoplasmic leaflet— is transferred to the outer surface: There, it is recognised by a macrophage that then actively scavenges the dying cell.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven <b>different</b> <b>situations.</b> The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally <b>different</b> <b>situations</b> and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Brooklyn Dodgers, winning 55–7. The Browns scored three touchdowns {{in five minutes}} during the first quarter. Cleveland added five more touchdowns {{in the second half}} and held a {{comfortable}} lead to the end. Fullback Marion Motley ran for 111 yards on five carries and scored two touchdowns, including a 50-yard run {{at the beginning of the}} second half. Tommy Colella scored a touchdown on an 82-yard punt return, and Bill Lund ran back an interception 28 yards for another. It was in this game that the Draw play was accidentally invented when Otto Graham tripped while dropping back for a pass. As he went down, sensing blitzers about to wallop him, he stuck the ball in Motley's stomach who scampered for a sizable gain. Liking the effect, Brown added it to the playbook during halftime. By the next game the play became a staple of the offense with several versions for <b>different</b> <b>situations.</b> As Cleveland's lead increased in the second half, Brown put in second-string players. Quarterback Otto Graham was replaced by Ermal Allen, who threw for two of the Browns' touchdowns and intercepted a pass while playing on defense. Cliff Lewis, Graham's primary backup, also played in the game. Brooklyn's only score came in the second quarter on a Bob Hoernschemeyer rush. The Dodgers were hurt by short punts from Mickey Colmer and a poor passing game. The team was held to 39 yards of passing. Edgar Jones, Cleveland's primary halfback suffered an elbow injury during the game.|$|E
