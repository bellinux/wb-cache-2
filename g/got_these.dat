25|$|According to Gray, {{this plan}} was first put into action {{when he had}} a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy {{director}} of the CIA, in which he quotes Walters as falsely saying, “If the investigation gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto some of our covert projects. Since you’ve <b>got</b> <b>these</b> five men under arrest, it will be best to taper the matter off here.” This conversation implicitly stated that the FBI should not interview Manuel Ogarrio and Kenneth Dahlberg, individuals connected with the money used to fund the Watergate burglars.|$|E
500|$|Swift's music {{contains}} elements of pop, pop rock and country. She self-identified {{as a country}} artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a [...] "sonically cohesive pop album". Rolling Stone asserted, [...] " [...] might get played on the country station, but she's {{one of the few}} genuine rock stars we've <b>got</b> <b>these</b> days". The New York Times noted, [...] "There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country—a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar—but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville". According to The Guardian, Swift [...] "cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory".|$|E

500|$|By 1967, Lennon's {{aggressive}} edges {{from his}} childhood had disappeared, and he spent considerable amounts of time sitting in his sunroom or garden and daydreaming for hours at end. He became somewhat uncommunicative towards most people, including Cynthia (but not with the other Beatles, who had an almost unspoken ability to understand one another). [...] Cynthia once complained, saying: [...] "What I'd like is a holiday of our own ... John, Julian and me". Lennon replied with, [...] "OK, I know, we'll all retire to a little cottage on a cliff in Cornwall, all right?" [...] Then adding, [...] "No, I've <b>got</b> <b>these</b> bloody songs to write. I have to work, to justify living." [...] She understood his temperament, but felt frustrated at never having developed her own career by using her art college background.|$|E
500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. What if they couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>these</b> two guys to squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E
500|$|Singh always {{aspired to}} be an actor, {{participating}} in several school plays and debates. Once when he had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song [...] "Chumma Chumma" [...] from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting {{a break in the}} film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who <b>got</b> <b>these</b> opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was [...] "too far-fetched", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.|$|E

500|$|After {{the more}} {{produced}} Rings Around the World, which {{relied heavily on}} computers and electronics, the group were keen to make Phantom Power [...] "a little more human" [...] with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: [...] "with technology {{you can do anything}} these days, but sometimes less is more". Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded [...] "pretty good right from the start" [...] which also contributed to the decision to avoid [...] "over-tweak them in the studio". Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of [...] "sound effect and light music" [...] vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: [...] "he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: [...] "hey, I've <b>got</b> <b>these</b> records to sell, are ya interested?" [...] And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room".|$|E
500|$|The master {{tapes to}} [...] "Big Boy" [...] {{were thought to}} be lost, but in 1994, Jackson family friend Ben Brown (and a former Steeltown co-owner) said he found the tapes in his parents' kitchen pantry. Brown reissued the record in 1995, on the Inverted Records label — a week before Michael Jackson's HIStory album was issued. He also remastered the song, selling it by mail order, along with an {{instrumental}} version, in a limited edition package consisting of a compact disc and cassette tape — the package could be purchased at a cost of approximately $30. The reissue of [...] "Big Boy" [...] was promoted with a music video. In 2009, Gordon Keith put items from the Steeltown era up for auction, including [...] "a sizable number of mint-condition copies of 'Big Boy'" [...] in 45 rpm format and 100 copies of [...] "We Don't Have To Be Over 21 (to Fall in Love)".

500|$|The song [...] "Mean" [...] won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards. She {{performed}} the song during the ceremony. Claire Suddath of Time felt she [...] "delivered her comeback on-key {{and with a}} vengeance", and Jayme Deerwester of USA Today remarked that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have [...] "made her a better songwriter and live performer". Swift won various other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011), Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011), and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012) and the Country Music Association in 2011. At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album. Speak Now was included in Rolling Stone list of [...] "50 Best Female Albums of All Time" [...] in 2012, ranking at number forty-five.

500|$|The Philippines and Thailand {{were the}} only Southeast Asian {{countries}} that actually participated in the organization. Both shared close ties with the United States, particularly the Philippines, and both faced incipient communist insurgencies against their own governments. Thailand became a member upon {{the discovery of the}} newly founded [...] "Thai Autonomous Region" [...] (the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture) in Yunnan (in South West China) – apparently feeling threatened by potential Chinese communist subversion on its land. Other regional countries like Burma and Indonesia were far more mindful of domestic internal stability rather than any communist threat, and thus rejected joining it. Malaya (including Singapore) also chose to not participate formally, though it was kept updated with key developments due to its close relationship with the United Kingdom. The rest of Southeast Asian countries: Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were prevented from taking part in any international military alliance {{as a result of the}} Geneva Agreements signed 20 July of the same year concluding the end of the First Indochina War. However, with the lingering threat coming from communist North Vietnam and the possibility of the domino theory with Indochina turning into a communist frontier, SEATO <b>got</b> <b>these</b> countries under its protection – an act that would be considered to be one of the main justifications for the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Cambodia, however rejected the protection in 1956.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve <b>got</b> <b>these</b> 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, {{building}} on 2×2 spin matrices which he purported to have discovered independently of Wolfgang Pauli's work on non-relativistic spin systems (Dirac told Abraham Pais, [...] "I believe I <b>got</b> <b>these</b> [...] independently of Pauli and possibly Pauli <b>got</b> <b>these</b> independently of me."), he proposed the Dirac equation as a relativistic {{equation of motion}} for the wave function of the electron. This work led Dirac to predict {{the existence of the}} positron, the electron's antiparticle, which he interpreted in terms of what came to be called the Dirac sea. The positron was observed by Carl Anderson in 1932. Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of quantum spin as a relativistic phenomenon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{formative}} {{period in}} the institutional development of Canadian intelligence agencies is unique {{in the sense that}} the birth of the fledgling services predated confederation in 1867 by several years.

Between the period of 1865 to 1870, Irish nationalists launched a number of raids to strike back at the British Empire. A [...] "lone wolf" [...] believed to be, who was a sympathizer for Irish nationalism, assassinated Canadian politician Thomas D'Arcy McGee.
