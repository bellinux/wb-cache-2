25|$|The {{distribution}} of domestic routes was a contentious political issue. SAS held {{a privilege to}} commence any route they wished, but lacked regional airliners to serve the smaller airports. Norway and Sweden had seen extensive construction of regional and smaller primary airports earlier than in Denmark. In Norway the <b>independent</b> <b>operator</b> Braathens SAFE was allowed to operate {{a majority of the}} domestic services and in Sweden Linjeflyg had been established to fly the larger portion of domestic hauls. This had been met by skepticism in Denmark, where this was seen as a breach of the agreements establishing the SAS consortium. It also made some Danish politicians call {{for the establishment of a}} Danish domestic carrier.|$|E
25|$|Capone {{continued}} to back Thompson. Voting booths were targeted by Capone's bomber James Belcastro in the wards where Thompson's opponents {{were thought to}} have support, on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called Pineapple Primary, causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro was also accused {{of the murder of}} lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who challenged Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Four policemen were among those charged along with Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an <b>independent</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|E

[...] While most operators supported this act, one <b>independent</b> <b>operator,</b> Spooner Oils Ltd., launched legal proceedings to have the act declared ultra vires; this was successful in a Supreme Court of Canada judgement handed down 3 October 1933.

2500|$|The Project for Restructuring the Brazilian Electric Sector, RESEB, which {{laid down}} the first steps for the {{implementation}} of the power sector reform, was initiated in 1996 during the administration of President Cardoso. The objective of the reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation. In addition, state-owned utilities and assets were privatized. Although transmission assets were not privatized, most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital. This reform also led to the creation, in 1996, of ANEEL (Brazil's National Electricity Regulatory Agency), a quasi-independent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector. However, the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the 1998 Law (Law 9648/98). Those steps included the creation of an <b>independent</b> <b>operator</b> of the national transmission system (ONS) and an operator of the commercial market (MAE), which did not become operational until 2001.|$|E
