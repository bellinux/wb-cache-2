5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month compared to three <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six <b>days</b> <b>per</b> year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.|$|E

5|$|In November, Seattle averages more {{rainfall}} {{than any}} other U.S. city of more than 250,000 people; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation.

Seattle {{is one of the}} five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation, and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states, along with some cities in the Northeast, Ohio and Michigan. Thunderstorms are rare, as the city reports thunder on just seven <b>days</b> <b>per</b> year.

5|$|Records {{from the}} Pool Adit copper mine at Trevenson (the most {{successful}} {{of the early}} copper mines) show in 1729, 25 bal maidens and three males worked as 'pickers' sorting high quality from poor quality ore, earning a flat rate of 4d per day and typically working 20 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month. (Records do not show {{the ages of the}} pickers at Pool Adit, but the male pickers are likely to have been boys too young for heavy labour.) In 1730 Pool Adit employed 30 female and four male pickers, and by 1731 the figures had risen to 55 female and five male, typically working 22 to 26 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> month. The number of bal maidens employed in the industry rose dramatically, and by the early 1770s Dolcoath, by then the most significant of the Cornish copper mines, employed around 220 bal maidens on the copper dressing floors alone.|$|E
