500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Stackpole was {{commissioned}} to sculpt architectural features for the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, a major assignment {{that was to}} take two years to complete, even {{with the aid of}} assistants. To give a grand <b>entrance</b> <b>portal</b> to the Palace of Varied Industries, he completed a copy of the main entrance to the Hospice of Santa Cruz, built in Toledo, Spain in the 16th century. Stackpole's design replaced the original figures of Catholic saints with figures of industry. His works for the Palace of Varied Industries included [...] "Man with a pick", [...] "Tympanum group of Varied Industries", [...] "New World Receiving Burdens of Old", [...] "Keystone figure", and [...] "Power of Industry". Stackpole also sculpted figures of [...] "Thought" [...] on the columns flanking the half domes of the west facade of the Palace Group. At the Palace of Fine Arts, Stackpole produced a kneeling [...] "Venus" [...] on the Altar of Inspiration.

500|$|In Portal, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective {{as she is}} challenged to navigate {{through a series of}} rooms using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or portal gun, under the watchful supervision of the artificial intelligence GLaDOS. The portal gun can create two distinct portal ends, orange and blue. The portals create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Neither end is specifically an entrance or exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. An important aspect of the game's physics is momentum redirection. As moving objects pass through portals, they come through the exit portal at the same direction that the exit portal is facing and with the same speed with which they passed through the <b>entrance</b> <b>portal.</b> For example, a common maneuver is to jump down to a portal on the floor and emerge through a wall, flying over a gap or another obstacle. This allows the player to launch objects or Chell over great distances, both vertically and horizontally, referred to as 'flinging' by Valve. As GLaDOS puts it, [...] "In layman's terms: speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out." [...] If portal ends are not on parallel planes, the character passing through is reoriented to be upright with respect to gravity after leaving a portal end.|$|E

6000|$|There are {{hosts of}} people who journey like restless spirits round and about this earth in search of seascapes and landscapes and the wonders and beauties of nature. They overrun Europe in armies; they can be met in droves and herds in Florida and the West Indies, at the Pyramids, and on the slopes and summits of the Canadian and American Rockies; but in the House of the Sun they are as rare as live and wriggling dinosaurs. Haleakala is the Hawaiian name for [...] "the House of the Sun." [...] It is a noble dwelling, {{situated}} on the Island of Maui; but so few tourists have ever peeped into it, much less entered it, that their number may be practically reckoned as zero. Yet I venture to state that for natural beauty and wonder the nature-lover may see dissimilar things as great as Haleakala, but no greater, while he will never see elsewhere anything more beautiful or wonderful. Honolulu is six days' steaming from San Francisco; Maui is a night's run on the steamer from Honolulu; and six hours more if {{he is in a}} hurry, can bring the traveller to Kolikoli, which is ten thousand and thirty-two feet above the sea and which stands hard by the <b>entrance</b> <b>portal</b> to the House of the Sun. Yet the tourist comes not, and Haleakala sleeps on in lonely and unseen grandeur.|$|E
