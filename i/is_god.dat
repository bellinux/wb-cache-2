5|$|According to Hindu legend Ramanuja (1017–1137), {{the leading}} expounder of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, visited the temple. One of his disciples placed Ramanuja's sandals {{along with the}} image of Varadarajar. Ramanujar became furious at this, for which the disciple {{explained}} that for Ramanuja Varadarajar <b>is</b> <b>god,</b> but for him, Ramanuja is supreme. Thiruvellarai is the birthplace of Uyyakondar, a disciple of Nathamuni. Swami Engalazhwan is believed to have taught Sri Bhasyam to Nadadhoor Ammal in the temple.|$|E
60|$|For see. One says, and truly, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> good; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> love; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> just; <b>God</b> hates {{oppression and}} wrong.|$|R
60|$|Now we all, I trust, hold <b>God</b> to <b>be</b> supremely good. We ascribe to Him, in perfection, {{every kind}} of {{goodness}} of which we can conceive in man. We say <b>God</b> <b>is</b> just; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> truthful; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> pure; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> bountiful; <b>God</b> <b>is</b> merciful; and, in one word, <b>God</b> <b>is</b> Love.|$|R
50|$|Father Divine {{had finally}} parted ways {{with his former}} associates. Denying that Father Jehovia <b>was</b> <b>God,</b> and saying that {{everyone}} could not <b>be</b> <b>God,</b> he declared that he himself <b>was</b> <b>God,</b> and the only true expression of God's spirit.|$|R
5|$|God is {{not lost}} to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: Where <b>is</b> <b>God?</b> Where is he? Not heavy enough for {{the weight of his}} body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but it could be the universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which <b>is</b> <b>God.</b> Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|Therefore I shall again {{repeat the}} {{doctrine}} of the Trinity, as it is positively affirmed in Scripture: that God is there expressed in three different names, as Father, as Son, and as Holy Ghost: that each of these <b>is</b> <b>God,</b> and that there is but one God. But this union and distinction are a mystery utterly unknown to mankind.|$|E
6000|$|For it is {{demonstrable}} that {{if there}} be three Persons and one God, [...] each Person must <b>be</b> <b>God,</b> and yet there cannot <b>be</b> three distinct <b>Gods,</b> [...] but one. For if each Person <b>be</b> not <b>God,</b> all three cannot <b>be</b> <b>God,</b> [...] unless the Godhead have Persons in it which <b>are</b> not <b>God.</b>|$|R

50|$|Adventist {{believe the}} Bible {{declares}} that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> infinite, human beings <b>are</b> finite. <b>God</b> <b>is</b> immortal, they <b>are</b> mortal. <b>God</b> <b>is</b> eternal, they are transitory.|$|R
5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks <b>is</b> <b>God</b> telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

60|$|Answ. So <b>is</b> <b>God's</b> worship, which <b>is</b> so his by his ordination, {{yet even}} that very worship may be spoiled by man's transgression. Prayer <b>is</b> <b>God's</b> ordinance, but all prayer is not {{accepted}} of God. We must then {{distinguish between the}} thing commanded, and our using of that thing. The temple <b>was</b> <b>God's</b> house, but <b>was</b> abused by the irreverence of those that worshipped there, even to the demolishing of it.|$|R
25|$|Behold, {{a virgin}} shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being {{interpreted}} <b>is,</b> <b>God</b> with us.|$|E

25|$|The four cups {{might also}} reflect the Roman custom of {{drinking}} as many cups {{as there are}} letters {{in the name of}} the chief guest at a meal, which in the case of the Seder <b>is</b> <b>God</b> Himself whose Hebrew name has four letters.|$|E
25|$|Instead of man below {{making an}} earthly vow, the sun shifts the focus upwards to the {{trinitarian}} {{god of the}} Trekkers, as it <b>is</b> <b>God</b> who communicates through Moerdijk's sun architecture, making Himself a heavenly vow with the words: WE - as in GOD - FOR THEE SOUTH-AFRICA.|$|E
25|$|Adoration is {{the first}} {{attitude}} of man acknowledging {{that he is a}} creature before his Creator. Praise is the form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God <b>is</b> <b>God.</b> It lauds God for his own sake and gives him glory, quite beyond what He does, but simply because He is.|$|E
50|$|In other words, Semi-Arian binitarians {{believe that}} in the flesh Jesus was not who He was prior to His {{incarnation}} (God the Word), not what He was (i.e. not fully God with all authority) prior to His resurrection. He <b>was</b> <b>God,</b> then he <b>was</b> not fully <b>God,</b> then he <b>was</b> <b>God</b> again.|$|R
5000|$|Modern Judaism {{teaches that}} it is heretical for any man to claim to <b>be</b> <b>God,</b> part of God, or the literal son of God. The Jerusalem Talmud (Ta'anit 2:1) states explicitly: [...] "if a man claims to <b>be</b> <b>God,</b> he <b>is</b> a liar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe you, doctor," [...] she said, [...] "for {{you have}} true eyes. Also Stephen says so. But {{in any case}} {{the death of the}} dear young woman <b>was</b> <b>God's</b> will, and if it <b>was</b> <b>God's</b> will, how can you be responsible?" ...|$|R
25|$|Stephen Hawking and {{co-author}} Leonard Mlodinow state in their book, The Grand Design, {{that it is}} reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer <b>is</b> <b>God,</b> then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim however, {{that it is possible to}} answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{tenet of}} Christian faith (Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant) that God is {{the creator of}} all things from nothing, and has made human beings in the Image of God, who by direct {{inference}} is also {{the source of the}} human soul. In Chalcedonian Christology, Jesus is the Word of God, which was in the beginning and, thus, is uncreated, and hence <b>is</b> <b>God,</b> and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ex nihilo.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrines of}} Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body {{to another in}} endless cycles of Saṃsāra, until liberation. Each birth begins karma (karam), these actions leave a karni (karmic signature) on one's soul which {{influences}} rebirth states Sikhism, but it <b>is</b> <b>God</b> whose grace that liberates. The {{way out of the}} reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name. The precepts of Sikhism encourage the bhakti of One Lord for mukti (liberation).|$|E

6000|$|What {{made him}} do such things? Somebody more {{powerful}} than he must force him to act at times. [...] "All-powerful," [...] thought Tarzan. [...] "The little bugs say that <b>God</b> <b>is</b> all-powerful. It must <b>be</b> that <b>God</b> made me do these things, for I never did them by myself. It <b>was</b> <b>God</b> who made Teeka rush upon Histah. Teeka would never go near Histah of her own volition. It <b>was</b> <b>God</b> who held my knife from the throat of the old Gomangani. God accomplishes strange things for he is 'all-powerful.' I cannot see Him; but I know that it must <b>be</b> <b>God</b> who does these things. No Mangani, no Gomangani, no Tarmangani could do them." ...|$|R
