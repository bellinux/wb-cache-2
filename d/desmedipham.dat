40|$|To {{investigate}} the tank-mixing of herbicides and Humic acid {{to improve the}} management of weeds in sugar beet, an experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications in private farm located in the village in Khorramabad Jovin in 2012 - 13. The treatments were as follows: chloridazon at 3. 2 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid, phenmedipham at 0. 78 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid, <b>desmedipham</b> at 0. 54 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid, chloridazon + <b>desmedipham</b> at 1. 7 and 0. 27 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid, chloridazon + phenmedipham at 1. 7 and 0. 39 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid, chloridazon + phenmedipham + <b>desmedipham</b> at 1. 1, 0. 29 and 0. 18 Kg ai ha- 1 mixing with humic acid and weed free and weedy controls. Herbicide was done at 4 to 6 leaf stage of sugar beet. Humic acid with Humax brand name was applied as 4 liters per hectare. The {{results showed that the}} highest yield of shoot, root yield and sugar yield was obtained by tank-mixing of chloridazon + phenmedipham with Humic acid. Humic acid application in combination with herbicides was increased Non-sugar percentage, so that the highest levels of gross sugar was obtained when chloridazon and humic acid were mixed. Root impurities was not affected by herbicide mixture but adding humic acid increased the percentage of root impurity. Overall, the results showed that the mixture chloridazon + phenmedipham with Humic acid had highest root yield and sugar yield...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in sugar beet rotations, volunteer oilseed rape can occur in increased numbers in subsequent crops. The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with metamitron. Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments. A significantly higher reduction of plant fresh mass (shoot) > 90 % was caused by herbicide treatments that included the active ingredients <b>desmedipham,</b> phenmedipham, ethofumesate, chloridazon and quinmerac. The results showed that triflusulfuron is no longer suitable to control volunteers if they are derived from imidazolinone-tolerance expressing varieties. However, alternative herbicides are available. Generally, increased attention has to be paid to volunteer management within the whole crop rotation if imidazolinonetolerant oilseed rape is grown. Appropriate tillage strategies after oilseed rape harvest have to be followed by effective herbicide treatments in the subsequent sugar beet, for example a mixture of metamitron, phenmedipham, <b>desmedipham,</b> ethofumesat and lenaciel...|$|E

Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of thiram, captan, and mefenoxam (all as seed treatments); cycloate and pyrazon preplant herbicides; and the postemergence carbamate herbicides phenmedipham and <b>desmedipham</b> would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of herbicide applications is a main research priority in recent years. In order {{to study the}} effect of individual post-emergence application of sugar beet broad-leaf herbicides at four to six true-leaf stage of weeds, experiments were conducted during 2013. Treatments included untreated control and several rates of <b>desmedipham</b> + phenmedipham + ethofumesate, chloridazon and clopyralid on Portulaca oleracea, Solanum nigrum, Amaranthus retroflexus and Chenopodium album. A completely randomized layout with three replications was used for each herbicide. Three weeks after spraying (WAS), plants were harvested and measured their dry weight. These herbicides were more effective to control Portulaca oleracea than other weeds, thereupon minimum dose required for a satisfactory efficacy of 90 % {{reduction of}} Portulaca oleracea aboveground dry matter (ED 90) were 299. 22, 1138. 31 and 129. 44 g a. i ha- 1 of <b>desmedipham</b> + phenmedipham + ethofumesate, chloridazon and clopyralid, respectively. Solanum nigrum was more affected by clopyralid application (132. 40 g a. i ha- 1), and did not make significant difference in Portulaca oleracea. Chloridazon had lower effect for control of Chenopodium album due to existence of powdery covering on abaxial side of the leaves. Biomass ED 50 or ED 90, based on log-logistic dose–response curves, for Chenopodium album was considerably higher than other species. These results showed that tank mixtures with other herbicides may be required for satisfactory weed control and reduction in applied herbicides doses...|$|E

40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb {{and wild}} buckwheat, chamomile, mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), <b>Desmedipham</b> (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. Ethofumesate, which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and <b>Desmedipham.</b> The high concentration of 200 g/L Ethofumesate leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum application rate per treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (Metamitron + Quinmerac) or Goltix® Gold (Metamitron) the weed spectrum is broadened. Basically, a timely application whose application rates are adapted to the location is essential for a good efficacy of beet herbicides...|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} study possible reduction of concentration (dose) of phenmedipham + <b>desmedipham</b> + ethofumesate herbicides at different application times to control weeds in sugar beet field. Thus, a factorial experiment based on complete randomized block design with three replications was performed at Sabzevar, Khorasan-e-Razavi in 2013. Factors consisted of herbicide dosages (control, 75 % of the recommended dosage, and 125 % of recommended dosage and application times at 2 - 4, 4 - 8 and 8 - 12 leaf stages of sugar beet. Herbicide used in the {{experiment was}} phenmedipham (9. 2 %) + <b>desmedipham</b> (7. 2 %) + ethofumesate (11. 3 %) (PROGRESS OF BETAMIX) as 877 ga. i ha- 1 27. 4 EC.

40|$|The {{possibility}} to decrease herbicide doses without reducing their weed controlling effectiveness {{was investigated in}} two microplots and one field experiment. The following herbicides were used: atrazine, mixture of atrazine with terbutrine, MCPA + MCPP, MCPA + dikamba, <b>desmedipham</b> and phenmedipham (Betanal 31, 32 or 37). They were combined with one or several of the following adjuvants: parafinic oil, refuse product of rape oil rafination, oil mixture from the Institute of Organic Chemistry Industry (IPO-Warsaw), surfactant Rokafenol N- 1 O, mineral oil Nr 8 (Aviol). It was shown that the doses of herbicides could be lowered by 30 - 50 % without loosing their phytotoxic effect on weeds due to addition of adjuvants. The mineral oil 8 was very active in a mixture with Betanal 37 and was completly non toxic toward sugar beets.

Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were carried out against two broad of weeds to describe how the Kautsky curve and its parameters were affected by herbicides. <b>Desmedipham</b> + phenmedipham + ethofumesate changed the chlorophyll fluorescence induction curve at all time intervals except four hours after spring (HAS) in Amaranthus retroflexus L. and at all doses of Portulaca oleracea L. 4 HAS. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence inhibition was evident by chloridazon at doses of 650 and 325 g a. i. ha- 1 in P. oleracea and A. retroflexus respectively, for all time intervals. Furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence decays only occurred by clopyralid in A. retroflexus at the highest dose.

40|$|Arthrobacter oxydans P 52 {{isolated}} from soil samples {{was found to}} degrade the phenylcarbamate herbicides phenmedipham and <b>desmedipham</b> cometabolically by hydrolyzing their central carbamate linkages. The phenylcarbamate hydrolase (phenmedipham hydrolase) responsible for the degradative reaction was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme was {{shown to be a}} monomer with a molecular weight of 55, 000. A 41 -kb wild-type plasmid (pHP 52) was identified in A. oxydans P 52, but not in a derivative of this strain that had spontaneously lost the ability to hydrolyze phenylcarbamates, indicating that the gene for phenylcarbamate degradation (pcd) is plasmid encoded. Determination of two partial amino acid sequences allowed the localization of the coding sequence of the pcd gene on a 3. 3 -kb PstI restriction fragment within pHP 52 DNA by hybridization with synthetic oligonucleotides. The phenylcarbamate hydrolase was functionally expressed in Escherichia coli under control of the lacZ promoter after the 3. 3 -kb PstI fragment was subcloned into the vector pUC 19. A stretch of 1, 864 bases within the cloned Pst fragment was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1, 479 bases containing the amino acid partial sequences determined for the purified enzyme.

40|$|The {{results of}} eleven {{experiments}} dealing with (1) lime application, (2) herbicides, (3) nematicides, (4) varieties, (5) fungicides, (6) sowing date and (7) yield potential, are discussed. Lime was necessary, {{not to create}} a more neutral soil reaction, but to eliminate most of the exchangeable aluminium in the soil. It was necessary to incorporate lime to a depth of 200 mm but not deeper. Cycloate and ethofumesate applied at 3, 7 and 1,O kg ailha respectively allowed the crop to emerge free of weeds. Broadleaf weeds emerged soon afterwards and were controllled with an application of 0, 8 kg ailha <b>desmedipham.</b> The efficacy of cycloate depended on the method of incorporation. Nernaticides applied at very high rates prevented a decline iin the plant population due to Meloidogyne incognita but did not prevent serious losses in sucrose yield. Nematodes in clay soils would, for economic reasons, have to be controlled by cultural means. Varieties designated by the breeders as resistant to Cercospora beticola outyielded those that were not even though their resistance was only partial. Cremona, Kawerita' and AM 2 Hybrid B were noted as the best varieties for Niital. Triphenyltin acetate (TPTA) was the most effective fungicide used against Cercospora leaf spot while benomyl, which had proved effective in the past, was no longer effective againgt the disease. Fortnightly applications of TPTA from mid-December to the end of March controlled leaf spot almost completely at all sites.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} over fifteen years of {{experimentation}} are summarized, concerning the possibility of use of herbicides included in several chemical classes and with various mechanisms of action on poplar clones of different species, European and North American. The active ingredients were tested mainly singly or in commercial mixtures as well, applied before emergence (interpreted here as sprout of poplar cuttings not yet occurred and before weed infestation) or after emergence (interpreted here as cuttings with sprouts 20 - 25 cm long and after weed colonisation). Almost 50 % of the 43 tested formulations {{has proved to be}} unserviceable in poplar nursery because of the hard damage induced on plantlets, i. e. dicotyledonicides and those with a wide action range, especially applied after emergence. It was the case of acetolactate synthase inhibitors and synthetic auxins. About 25 % of formulations has proved to be utilizable with limited risks and 20 % without risk. After emergence, the lowest damage was caused by graminicide compounds included in the class of acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors (e. g. diclofop-methyl, cycloxydim); before emergence, very good applicative opportunities were showed by microtubule assembly inhibitors, especially propyzamide, and the cellulose synthesis inhibitor isoxaben. Among the herbicides utilizable with some risk after emergence, the photosynthesis inhibitors pyridate and phenmedipham (singly or in mixture) were interesting since they are the only ones that allow the control of broad-leaved weeds in the presence of herbaceous poplar shoots. Before emergence, flufenacet and isoxaflutole were remarkable as well, the latter being active versus hardly limited weeds. In summary, besides the two aforesaid compounds, the graminicide cycloxydim and - more cautiously - clodinafop and propaquizafop may be hopefully introduced in poplar nurseries after emergence, in association with the wide action range mixture of phenmedipham, <b>desmedipham</b> and ethofumesate...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Presentation date: 2000 - 04 - 26 Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in 1998 and 1999, to evaluate glyphosate and glufosinate for control of redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, hairy nightshade, and barnyardgrass in herbicide-resistant sugarbeets. Treatments that included two or three applications of glyphosate, regardless of rate, or glyphosate applied once in combination with BAS 656 07 H or ethofumesate, resulted in 83 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters and hairy nightshade control. Redroot pigweed and barnyardgrass control was lower when glyphosate was applied to cotyledon sugarbeets, with sequential applications one and two weeks later, than when glyphosate was applied to two to four leaf sugarbeets. Sugarbeet yield with glyphosate treatments was {{greater than or equal}} to the standard herbicide program used in sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied earlypostemergence or mid-postemergence resulted in 78 to 100 percent redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, and hairy nightshade control. Glufosinate following ethofumesate applied preplant incorporated or ethofumesate applied postemergence in combination with glufosinate provided weed control similar to the standard herbicide program. Barnyardgrass control was lowest with glufosinate applied postemergence in combination with ethofumesate. Glufosinate treatments that were applied in combination with ethofumesate postemergence resulted in lower sugarbeet yields. Slight sugarbeet injury was observed early in the growing season when ethofumesate was applied postemergence. However, weed control was the main factor that affected sugarbeet yield. Treatments did not affect sugarbeet sucrose content. Field dodder control, with glyphosate, ranged from 98 to 100 percent, 42 days after treatment. Glyphosate treatments reduced dodder dry weight compared to a conventional, herbicide program of the commercial premix of <b>desmedipham</b> and phenmedipham, tank mixed with triflusulfuron, and clopyralid. Sugarbeet dry weight was greater, and dodder dry weight was lower with the conventional program compared to the untreated control and a single application of glufosinate. Three applications of glufosinate, at 0. 40 and 0. 80 kg ai/ha with 3. 4 kg ai/ha of AMS resulted in a lower dodder dry weight than three applications of glufosinate at 0. 30 kg/ha with AMS and the untreated control. Glyphosate reduced dodder growth in some cases when applied before dodder attachment to glyphosate-resistant sugarbeets. Glufosinate applied before attachment to glufosinate-resistant sugarbeets had no effect on dodder growth. Dipping a single leaf from a dodder infested sugarbeet in a glyphosate solution reduced the growth of dodder that was attached to other sugarbeet leaves on the same plant. Since glyphosate was not in contact with dodder surface, the glyphosate that caused the dodder growth reduction translocated from the treated leaf to the leaves in which dodder was attached...|$|E
