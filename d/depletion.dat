40|$|The MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN) {{spacecraft}} {{is providing}} new detailed {{observations of the}} Martian ionosphere thanks to its unique orbital coverage and instrument suite. During most periapsis passages on the nightside ionosphere suprathermal electron <b>depletions</b> were detected. A simple criterion was implemented to identify the 1742 <b>depletions</b> observed from 16 November 2014 to 28 February 2015. A statistical analysis reveals that the main ion and electron populations within the <b>depletions</b> are surprisingly constant in time and altitude. Absorption by CO 2 is the main loss process for suprathermal electrons, and electrons that strongly peaked around 6 [*]eV are resulting from this interaction. The observation of <b>depletions</b> appears however highly dependent on altitude. <b>Depletions</b> are mainly located above strong crustal magnetic sources above 170 [*]km, whereas the <b>depletions</b> observed {{for the first time}} below 170 [*]km are globally scattered onto the Martian surface with no particular dependence on crustal fields...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} conducted in December 1979 to investigate the structure of plasma <b>depletions</b> in the low latitude, nighttime ionosphere is discussed. Density biteouts of about one order of magnitude in the dominant ion, O(+), are mapped to lower altitudes along magnetic field lines for comparison with 6300 -A and 7774 -A O I airglow <b>depletions.</b> Owing to the different airglow production mechanisms (dissociative recombination of O 2 (+) for 6300 A and radiative recombination of O(+) for 7774 A), the 6300 -A <b>depletions</b> reflect plasma <b>depletions</b> near the bottomside of the F layer, while those at 7774 A are located near {{the peak of the}} layer. The O(+) biteouts map directly into the 7774 -A airglow <b>depletions</b> in the same hemisphere and also when traced into the opposite hemisphere, which suggests magnetic flux tube alignment over north-south distances of approximately 2220 km. The 6300 -A (bottomside) <b>depletions</b> are found to be wider in longitude than the 7774 -A (F-peak) depeletions near the equatorward edge of the Appleton anomaly...|$|R
40|$|From {{several years}} of Atmosphere Explorer data, it is shown that {{large-scale}} plasma density <b>depletions</b> (horizontal scale greater than 1000 km) in the nocturnal F region occur mainly {{during the first half}} of the night. The geomagnetic latitude of these <b>depletions</b> depends on season: at solstice periods the occurrence is mainly in the summer hemisphere and at equinoxes mainly on the geomagnetic equator. Large-scale <b>depletions</b> occur most often at longitudes characterized by a large magnetic declination. The large-scale plasma <b>depletions</b> are interpreted to be a consequence of imposed upward drift which raises the F region above the satellite trajectory. This interpretation is tested by calculating the vertical ion drift velocity imposed by zonal and meridional winds and electrostatic fields, with allowance for the effects of diffusion. The calculations reveal a correspondence between the locations of maxima in the calculated vertical ion drift velocity and the large-scale plasma <b>depletions...</b>|$|R
5|$|Damage to {{skeletal}} muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to muscle cells directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell metabolism. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including sodium ions. The swelling itself {{may lead to}} destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to continuous muscle contraction and <b>depletion</b> of ATP, the main carrier {{of energy in the}} cell.

5|$|Even though {{geothermal}} {{power is}} globally sustainable, extraction {{must still be}} monitored to avoid local <b>depletion.</b> Over the course of decades, individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows. The three oldest sites, at Larderello, Wairakei, and the Geysers have experienced reduced output because of local <b>depletion.</b> Heat and water, in uncertain proportions, were extracted faster than they were replenished. If production is reduced and water is reinjected, these wells could theoretically recover their full potential. Such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites. The long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the Lardarello field in Italy since 1913, at the Wairakei field in New Zealand since 1958, and at The Geysers field in California since 1960.|$|E

Even though the observed scattering region constitutes {{only a fraction of the}} total column density of dust, it is expected that the present line-of-sight analysis provides useful information on the gas and dust in the scattering nebulosity. Somewhat larger overall <b>depletions</b> than normal are found, and it is found that the <b>depletions</b> of certain elements (manganese and zinc) are enhanced relative to the normal pattern of element-to-element <b>depletions,</b> suggesting that grain growth has occurred with some elements sticking to grains preferentially.

The airglow patterns that emerge show that the dominant features are enhancements in 6300 Å levels to the east and west of the plasma <b>depletions,</b> while at 7774 Å the airglow signals show reductions coincident with the integrated plasma <b>depletions.</b> Recent airglow imaging data from Natal, Brazil, confirm the simulation results, showing that the formation and earlytime behavior of ionospheric <b>depletions</b> can be studied by their airglow signatures observed from groundbased equatorial sites...|$|R

Monochromatic images of <b>depletions</b> in the OI(630 nm) nightglow were recorded on eight nights during 1 ‐ 16 October, 1994, {{as part of the}} Guará campaign. The drift motions of the <b>depletions</b> were typically 80 – 100 m/s eastward prior to local midnight and reduced to a minimum of ∼ 30 – 50 m/s in the morning hours, in accord with previous observations. However, on October 2 – 3 and 12 – 13 the <b>depletions</b> were observed to reverse direction for ∼ 60 – 90 min, achieving westward speeds of ∼ 30 m/s before the motion reverted to eastward around 0100 LT and accelerated to 35 – 45 m/s near dawn. Magnetic activity and other evidence suggests that these reversals in the motion of the airglow <b>depletions</b> probably result from reversals in the F‐region dynamo rather than from shifts in the altitude of the shear in the nighttime F‐region plasma drift...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{repeated}} sodium <b>depletions</b> using the natriuretic–diuretic furosemide induce progressive increases in NaCl ingestion.

Our results show maximal licking across a range of NaCl concentrations after each of the three <b>depletions,</b> regardless of whether the solutions contained sucrose or were presented alone. Similarly, the presence of sucrose did not affect stimulated NaCl intake in long-term tests, although ingestion of NaCl solutions increased progressively with successive <b>depletions.</b> Finally, both licking and ingestion returned to baseline levels during need-free conditions. These results suggest that sodium imbalance acutely increases the salience of sodium taste and thereby the likelihood of NaCl ingestion, which may, in turn, contribute to progressive increases in NaCl intake that occur with multiple furosemide-induced sodium <b>depletions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Some {{scientific}} {{studies suggest that}} ozone <b>depletion</b> may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere). Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. Ozone <b>depletion</b> over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling {{has the effect of}} intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the polar vortex) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting. Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.|$|E

Rats were exposed to 10 days of CUS and then challenged with MDMA (5 mg/kg i. p. once every 2 h {{for a total of}} four injections). Prior exposure to CUS augmented MDMA-induced hyperthermia and plasma CORT secretion and the long-term <b>depletions</b> in 5 -HT content in striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex and DA content in striatum. A reduced ambient temperature of 21 °C attenuated the hyperthermia, CORT secretion, and 5 -HT decreases after MDMA in nonstressed rats. The lower ambient temperature also prevented the augmented hyperthermia, CORT secretion, and enhanced 5 -HT and DA <b>depletions</b> after MDMA in chronically stressed rats to levels exhibited by nonstressed, MDMA-treated rats. To investigate the role of CORT on monoamine <b>depletions</b> in response to MDMA, stressed and nonstressed rats were treated with the CORT synthesis inhibitor metyrapone during exposure to MDMA. Metyrapone prevented CORT secretion in both stressed and nonstressed rats but did not modify 5 -HT or DA <b>depletions</b> in any brain region examined.
