5|$|As {{described}} earlier, prevailing {{and local}} winds are not spread <b>evenly</b> across the earth, {{which means that}} wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.|$|E
5|$|In the Confederate Artillery, {{a normal}} junior officer had {{two rows of}} seven <b>evenly</b> spaced buttons, grouped into pairs, while a senior officer could {{have as many as}} eight buttons in two rows.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August, Owen Gingerich {{said that}} {{correspondence}} {{he had received}} had been <b>evenly</b> divided for and against the proposal.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and <b>evenly</b> — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E
5|$|After {{significant}} ridership {{gains in}} 1984, PennDOT proposed {{that a second}} train {{be added to the}} route. PennDOT and Amtrak would have split the costs <b>evenly.</b> Amtrak officials were favorable, but budget problems stalled the plan.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams were}} <b>evenly</b> matched, with the West Indies not the force they had been, and England on the rise. The key players for the West Indies were Lara, Walsh and Bishop while England {{had a strong}} opening pair of Atherton and Graham Thorpe plus the young Dominic Cork who would be decisive in England's two Test {{victories}} in this series.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{population}} is almost <b>evenly</b> divided between {{urban and rural}} dwellers. Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, Yaoundé, and Garoua are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, {{and most of the}} South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.|$|E
5|$|During the 1988 session, the Indiana House of Representatives {{was split}} <b>evenly</b> between both parties {{for the first}} time in Indiana's history. After a period of negotiations, both parties agreed to share {{majority}} powers, alternating which party controlled the position of speaker each day. The same General Assembly legalized horse racing in the state in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Erie's {{population}} was spread <b>evenly</b> among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% {{of families and}} 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most {{of the people who}} reside in Erie are of European descent.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply <b>evenly</b> than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Victoria faced Lita for the WWE Women's Championship. Both women <b>evenly</b> {{controlled}} the match. The match ended when Victoria pinned Lita with an Inside Cradle. After the match, Molly Holly and Gail Kim attacked both Lita and Victoria.|$|E
5|$|On Super Tuesday, Clinton won {{the largest}} states, such as California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, while Obama won more states; they almost <b>evenly</b> split the total popular vote. But Obama was gaining more pledged delegates for {{his share of}} the popular vote due to better {{exploitation}} of the Democratic proportional allocation rules.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that <b>evenly</b> span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences. For example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed more <b>evenly</b> so that people who went out earlier earned more money, while those who made it to the final table won less.|$|E
5|$|Song sources likely {{inflated}} {{the number}} of Jin soldiers and casualties at Caishi, but the 18,000 figure for the Song army is plausible. Modern {{studies suggest that the}} battle was smaller and that both sides were more <b>evenly</b> matched than traditional accounts suggest. Nonetheless, the victory boosted the morale of the Song infantry and halted the southern advance of the Jin army.|$|E
5|$|The CFMI {{board of}} {{directors}} is currently split <b>evenly</b> between SNECMA and GE (five members each). There are two vice presidents, one from each company, who support the President of CFMI. The president tends {{to be drawn from}} SNECMA and sits at CFMI's headquarters near GE in Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|The RAN {{originally}} intended to order up to ten DDLs. All the ships were {{to be built in}} Australia to maintain local shipbuilding capabilities, and Australian industry was to be involved to the greatest possible extent. Production of the ships was to be <b>evenly</b> split between Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney and Williamstown Naval Dockyard in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{process of}} dyeing requires soaking the material containing the dye (the dyestuff) in water, adding the textile to be dyed to the resulting solution (the dyebath), and bringing {{the solution to}} a simmer for an extended period, often measured in days or even weeks, stirring occasionally until the color has <b>evenly</b> transferred to the textiles.|$|E
5|$|The first romance, in A major, has as {{an opening}} theme an {{uncomplicated}} melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented {{first in the}} higher {{and then in the}} middle register, before flowing <b>evenly</b> to its conclusion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are only}} around a dozen {{businesses}} operating in Bradwall today, {{half of which}} are farms split <b>evenly</b> between dairy and agricultural farming. Other businesses include property development, accountancy and gardening. Some of the farms also operate secondary businesses, notably riding schools, stables and an annual eventing event.|$|E
5|$|Where {{rainfall}} {{is relatively}} <b>evenly</b> {{spread across the}} seasons in temperate regions, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest typified by species like oak, beech, birch and maple is found. Temperate forest {{is also found in}} the southern hemisphere, as for example in the Eastern Australia temperate forest, characterised by Eucalyptus forest and open acacia woodland.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Mycena, {{it is found}} in the section Filipedes, on account of the cheilocystidia covered with <b>evenly</b> spaced, short {{cylindrical}} excrescences, and its size and occurrence on wood. It can be separated from {{the other members of the}} section on account of a cap with yellowish to olive shades, gills with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration.|$|E
5|$|A Physics Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, {{a diploma}} bearing a citation, and a sum of money. The {{amount of money}} awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year. If a prize is awarded {{to more than one}} laureate, the money is either split <b>evenly</b> among them or, for three laureates, it may be divided into a half and two quarters.|$|E
5|$|A Washington Post-SurveyMonkey 50-state poll, {{conducted}} online between August 9 and September 1 found Gary Johnson polling at 10% {{or higher}} in 42 states, and at 15% or higher in 15 states (Johnson received 25% {{in his home}} state of New Mexico and 23% in Utah). Another poll conducted in mid-August by the Pew Research Center found Johnson supported by about 10% of registered voters. Of Johnson supporters, more than 60% identified as independent and more than 70% were younger than fifty years old. Johnson's supporters were <b>evenly</b> divided between men and women.|$|E
5|$|After Von Laue's {{pioneering}} research, {{the field}} developed rapidly, most notably by physicists William Lawrence Bragg {{and his father}} William Henry Bragg. In 1912–1913, the younger Bragg developed Bragg's law, which connects the observed scattering with reflections from <b>evenly</b> spaced planes within the crystal. The Braggs, father and son, shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in crystallography. The earliest structures were generally simple and marked by one-dimensional symmetry. However, as computational and experimental methods improved over the next decades, it became feasible to deduce reliable atomic positions for more complicated two- and three-dimensional arrangements of atoms in the unit-cell.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{the third}} lowest of the capital cities (after Adelaide and Hobart) but is spread fairly <b>evenly</b> over the seasons, with late spring bringing the highest rainfall. Thunderstorms occur mostly between October and April, owing {{to the effect of}} summer and the mountains. The area is not very windy and the breeze is at its strongest from August to November. Canberra is less humid than the nearby coastal areas.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, Toronto FC {{games are}} {{exclusively}} broadcast by TSN, with certain games (typically against other Canadian MLS franchises) also shown on CTV. Prior to 2017, Toronto FC games were broadcast exclusively by TSN and Sportsnet. Games {{that were not}} covered under national broadcast contracts with MLS or other competition organizers were divided <b>evenly</b> between the two broadcasters, pursuant to agreements between their parent companies (Bell Canada and Rogers Communications respectively) in connection to their joint 2011 purchase of MLSE.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and <b>evenly</b> through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{lopsided}} {{start in the}} early 20th century, the Terps and Midshipmen were <b>evenly</b> matched {{for most of the}} history of the series. Between 1931 and 1965, Navy won six and Maryland five games. In the 2005 season opener, Navy was coming off one of its best seasons in history with a 10–2 record the previous year. Maryland struggled later in 2005, but proved a competitive match for Navy and achieved a last-minute win, 23–20.|$|E
5|$|During Soviet times, stanitsas, {{no longer}} being Cossack settlements, still {{encompassed}} relatively large populations. In 1926, for example, the populations of five of the sixteen stanitsas then existing exceeded five thousand. As of 2014, there are twelve stanitsas in the republic, accounting for 5.3% of the republic's rural localities, but their combined population accounts for {{almost a quarter of}} the republic's rural population. They are fairly <b>evenly</b> spread across the republic's territory.|$|E
5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided <b>evenly</b> by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Further south, in Victoria and New South Wales, {{rainfall}} {{is spread}} more <b>evenly</b> {{throughout the year}} and the driest season lasts from December to May. At this time, southern populations congregate in inland flocking areas which include upland marshes, the edges of reservoirs and lakes, pastures and agricultural land. When rain arrives in June and July, they disperse to the coastal freshwater marshes, shallow lakes, wet meadows and other wetlands where they breed.|$|E
5|$|In McPherson's sector, Logan's {{division}} {{made another}} thrust down the Jackson Road at about 2 p.m., but met with heavy losses and {{the attack was}} called off. McClernand attacked again, reinforced by Quinby's division, but with no success. Union casualties were 502 killed, 2,550 wounded, and 147 missing, about <b>evenly</b> divided across the three corps. Confederate casualties were not reported directly, but {{are estimated to be}} under 500. Grant blamed McClernand's misleading dispatches for part of the poor results of the day, storing up another grievance against the political general who had caused him so many aggravations during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|In {{a perfect}} scenario, this would enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to <b>evenly</b> {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned <b>evenly</b> and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E
5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi diagrams for moving a set of points on a surface to more <b>evenly</b> spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
