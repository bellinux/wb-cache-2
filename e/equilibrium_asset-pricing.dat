Inventories allow firms to react to high (low) productivity states by increasing (decreasing) production in good (bad) times.

40|$|The {{demand for}} durable goods is more {{cyclical}} {{than that for}} nondurable goods and services. Consequently, the cash flows and stock returns of durable‐good producers are exposed to higher systematic risk. Using the benchmark input‐output accounts of the National Income and Product Accounts, we construct portfolios of durable‐good, nondurable‐good, and service producers. In the cross section, an investment strategy that is long on the durable‐good portfolio and short on the service portfolio earns a risk premium exceeding 4 percent annually. In the time series, an investment strategy that is long on the durable‐good portfolio and short on the market portfolio earns a countercyclical risk premium. We explain these findings in a general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset‐pricing</b> model with endogenous production. ...|$|E

First, we use the present discounted value methodology to decompose {{the difference between the}} unanticipated return of nominal and inflation-linked bonds into news about expected inflation and premiums. Second, we use a general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model to estimate a time-varying inflation risk premium. Our results show that inflation-expectations movements account for about only 25 % of the relative returns, indicating that premiums are a very important source of changes in inflation compensation. We also show that the estimated inflation risk premium is time-varying but seems to be of negligible size, with average size and volatility very close to zero. l II) could be helpful on this task. ...|$|E
40|$|A cost-based {{approach}} to <b>asset-pricing</b> <b>equilibrium</b> relationships is developed. A cost function induces a stochastic discount factor (pricing kernel) {{that is a}} function of random output, prices, and capital stockt. By eliminating opportunities for arbitrage between financial markets and the production technology, firms minimize the current cost of future consumption. The first-order conditions for this cost minimization problem generate the stochastic discount factor. The cost-based approach is dual in nature and determines state-claim prices as the current-period marginal cost of increasing future stochastic output. A costbased pricing kernel is estimated using annual time-series data on macroeconomic variables and returns data. Asset pricing theory requires that an asset’s price equals the inner product of a stochastic discount factor (or pricing kernel) and the asset’s stochastic payout (Ross, 1978; Harriso...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} literature {{documents that}} unexpected {{changes in the}} nominal interest rates {{have a significant effect}} on real stock prices: a 25 -basis point increase in the nominal interest rate is associated with an immediate decrease in broad real stock indices that may range from 0. 6 to 2. 2 percent, followed by a gradual decay as real stock prices revert towards their long-run expected value.

5000|$|In {{an article}} in the May 1970 issue of the Journal of Finance, {{entitled}} [...] "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work," [...] Fama proposed two concepts that have been used on efficient markets ever since. First, Fama proposed three types of efficiency: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak efficiency. They are explained in the context of what information sets are factored in price trend. In weak form efficiency the information set is just historical prices, which can be predicted from historical price trend; thus, it is impossible to profit from it. Semi-strong form requires that all public information is reflected in prices already, such as companies' announcements or annual earnings figures. Finally, the strong-form concerns all information sets, including private information, are incorporated in price trend; it states no monopolistic information can entail profits, in other words, insider trading cannot make a profit in the strong-form market efficiency world.Second, Fama demonstrated that the notion of market efficiency could not be rejected without an accompanying rejection of the model of market equilibrium (e.g. the price setting mechanism). This concept, known as the [...] "joint hypothesis problem," [...] has ever since vexed researchers. Market efficiency denotes how information is factored in price, Fama (1970) emphasizes that the hypothesis of market efficiency must be tested in the context of expected returns. The joint hypothesis problem states that when a model yields a predicted return significantly different from the actual return, one can never be certain if there exists an imperfection in the model or if the market is inefficient. Researchers can only modify their models by adding different factors to eliminate any anomalies, in hopes of fully explaining the return within the model. The anomaly, also known as alpha in the modeling test, thus functions as a signal to the model maker whether it can perfectly predict returns by the factors in the model. However, as long as there exists an alpha, neither the conclusion of a flawed model nor market inefficiency can be drawn according to the Joint Hypothesis. Fama (1991) also stresses that market efficiency per se is not testable and can only be tested jointly with some model of <b>equilibrium,</b> i.e. an <b>asset-pricing</b> model.|$|R
40|$|Many bond {{portfolio}} managers argue that bond laddering tends to outperform other bond investment strategies because it reduces both market price risk and reinvestment {{risk for a}} {{bond portfolio}} {{in the presence of}} interest rate uncertainty. Despite the popularity of bond ladders as a strategy for managing investments in fixed-income securities, there is surprising little reference to this subject in the economics and finance literature. In this paper we analyze complex bond portfolios within the framework of a dynamic general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model. Equilibrium bond portfolios are nonsensical, implying a trading volume that vastly exceeds observed trading volume on ¯nancial markets. Such portfolios would also be very costly and thus suboptimal in the presence of even very small transaction costs. Instead portfolios combining bond ladders with a market portfolio of equity assets are nearly optimal investment strategies, which in addition would minimize transaction costs.

40|$|International {{capital flows}} have {{increased}} dramatically since the 1980 s, {{with much of}} the increase being due to trade in equity and debt markets. Such developments are often attributed to the increased integration of world financial markets. We present a model that allows us to examine how greater integration in world financial markets affects the behavior of international capital flows and financial returns. Our model predicts that international capital flows are large (in absolute value) and very volatile during the early stages of financial integration when international asset trading is concentrated in bonds. As integration progresses and households gain access to world equity markets, the size and volatility of international bond flows fall dramatically but continue to exceed the size and volatility of international equity flows. This is the natural outcome of greater risk sharing facilitated by increased integration. We find that the equilibrium flows in bonds and stocks are larger than their empirical counterparts, and are largely driven by variations in equity risk premia. The paper also makes a methodological contribution to the literature on dynamic general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing.</b> We implement a new technique for solving a dynamic general equilibrium model with production, portfolio choice and incomplete markets. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{globalization}} hazard hypothesis {{maintains that}} the current account reversals and asset price collapses observed during 'Sudden Stops' are caused by global capital market frictions. A policy implication of this view is that Sudden Stops can be prevented by offering global investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees, however, introduce a moral hazard incentive for global investors, thus creating a tradeoff by which price guarantees weaken globalization hazard but strengthen international moral hazard. This paper studies the quantitative implications of this tradeoff using a dynamic stochastic <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model. Without guarantees, distortions induced by margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher's debt-deflation mechanism. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by introducing a distortion that props up foreign demand for assets. Non-state-contingent guarantees contain Sudden Stops but they are executed often and induce persistent asset overvaluation. Guarantees offered only in high-debt states are executed rarely and prevent Sudden Stops without persistent asset overvaluation. If the elasticity of foreign asset demand is low, price guarantees can still contain Sudden Stops but domestic agents obtain smaller welfare gains at Sudden Stop states and suffer welfare losses on average in the stochastic steady state. ...|$|E
40|$|Emerging market {{financial}} crises are abrupt and dramatic, usually occurring {{after a period}} of high output growth, massive capital flows, and a boom in asset markets. This paper develops an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model with informational frictions in which vulnerability and the crisis itself are consequences of the investor optimism in the period preceding the crisis. The model features two sets of investors, domestic and foreign. Both sets of investors learn from noisy signals, which contain information relevant for asset returns and formulate expectations, or "beliefs," about the state of productivity. We show that, if preceded by a sequence of positive signals, a small, negative noise shock can trigger a sharp downward adjustment in investors'' beliefs, asset prices, and consumption. The magnitude of this downward adjustment and sensitivity to negative signals increase with the level of optimism attained prior to the negative signal.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Sudden Stops to capital inflows in emerging economies {{may be caused}} by global capital market frictions, such as collateral constraints and trading costs, suggests that Sudden Stops could be prevented by offering price guarantees on the emerging-markets asset class. Providing these guarantees is a risky endeavor, however, because they introduce a moral-hazard-like incentive similar to those that are also viewed as a cause of emerging markets crises. This paper studies this financial frictions-moral hazard tradeoff using an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model in which margin constraints, trading costs, and ex-ante price guarantees interact in the determination of asset prices and macroeconomic dynamics. In the absence of guarantees, margin calls and trading costs create distortions that produce Sudden Stops driven by occasionally binding credit constraints and Irving Fisher’s debt-deflation mechanism. Price guarantees contain the asset deflation by creating another distortion that props up the foreign investors’ demand for emerging markets assets. Quantitative simulation analysis shows the strong interaction of these two distortions in driving the dynamics of asset prices, consumption and the current account. Price guarantees are found to be effective for containing Sudden Stops but at the cost of introducing potentially large distortions that could lead to ‘overvaluation’ of emerging markets assets.

40|$|Capital {{markets have}} {{witnessed}} {{a rash of}} `Sudden Stops' during the last decade. Policy proposals to prevent these crises include creating indexed bond markets and providing price guarantees for emerging market assets. Chapter 1 explores the macroeconomic implications of indexed bonds with a return indexed to the key variables driving emerging market economies such as terms of trade or productivity. We employ a quantitative model of a small open economy in which Sudden Stops are driven by the financial frictions inherent to world capital markets. While indexed bonds provide a hedge to income fluctuations and can undo the effects of financial frictions, they lead to interest rate fluctuations. Due to this tradeoff, there exists a non-monotonic relation between the "degree of indexation" (i. e., {{the percentage of the}} shock reflected in the return) and the overall effects of these bonds on macroe- conomic fluctuations. Therefore, indexation can improve macroeconomic conditions only if the degree of indexation is less than a critical value. When the degree of indexation is higher than this threshold, it strengthens the precautionary savings motive, increases consumption volatility and impact effect of Sudden Stops. The threshold degree of indexation depends on the volatility and persistence of income shocks as well as the relative openness of the economy. Chapter 2 explores the implications of asset price guarantees provided by an international financial organization on the emerging market assets. This policy is motivated by the globalization hazard hypothesis, which suggest that Sudden Stops caused by global financial frictions could be prevented by offering foreign investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a trade- off, however, because they weaken globalization hazard while creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using a quantitative, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by a Fisherian deflation. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by propping up foreign demand for assets. The effectiveness of price guarantees, their distor- tions on asset markets, and their welfare implications depend critically on whether the guarantees are contingent on debt levels and on the price elasticity of foreign demand for domestic assets...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of commodity futures markets {{is a widely}} debated topic in academia. The cotton futures market is no exception. The existence of trends in the futures market is characterized as a price bias, which is a testable trait. When analyzed, it allows {{a better understanding of}} market behavior and allows implementation of more effective income enhancing and/or risk reducing strategies. Three different approaches will be used to test the {{efficiency of}} the U. S. cotton futures market: pricing patterns, cointegration, and asset-pricing. In the first approach, pricing patterns, statistical methodology was applied to a dataset of daily futures prices. Returns did not show a consistent trend, supporting arguments of efficiency. Further research into seasonally-differentiated contracts has yielded strong evidence of declining prices. This result differs from previously published work in the most comprehensive study of futures prices, while updating and extending information on pricing patterns in the cotton futures market. Co-integration, the second approach, is a popular method for testing the efficiency of various commodity future and cash markets. Evidence indicates that the cotton futures and cash markets are co-integrated over the last ten years. Results lead to the conclusion that price is discovered in the cotton futures market, reinforcing the notion of an efficient cotton futures market that serves as an indicator for future cotton cash prices. The cotton futures market was also analyzed to explain price movements with an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> framework, in the third approach. In particular, the cotton futures market was analyzed to determine if behavior displayed by the market could be explained by risks specific to the cotton futures contract. Cotton futures do not show significant risk premiums over other financial assets, again supporting the efficient market hypothesis. The three approaches implemented in this thesis are generally supportive of longrun efficiency in the U. S. cotton futures market. An updated analysis of the cotton futures market will allow market participants the most recent information on pricing patterns and the overall long-run behavior of the market. More effective trading and operating strategies can be implemented that will best meet needs of market participants...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{research shows that}} a reasonable characterization of federal-funds-rate targeting behavior is that {{the change in the}} target rate depends on the maturity structure of interest rates and exhibits little dependence on lagged target rates. See, for example, Cochrane and Piazzesi (2002). The result echoes the policy rule used by McCallum (1994) to rationalize the empirical failure of the `expectations hypothesis' applied to the term- structure of interest rates. That is, rather than forward rates acting as unbiased predictors of future short rates, the historical evidence suggests that the correlation between forward rates and future short rates is surprisingly low. McCallum showed that a desire by the monetary authority to adjust short rates in response to exogenous shocks to the term premiums imbedded in long rates (i. e. "yield-curve smoothing"), along with a desire for smoothing interest rates across time, can generate term structures that account for the puzzling regression results of Fama and Bliss (1987). McCallum also clearly pointed out that this reduced-form approach to the policy rule, although naturally forward looking, needed to be studied further in the context of other response functions such as the now standard Taylor (1993) rule. We explore both the robustness of McCallum's result to endogenous models of the term premium and also its connections to the Taylor Rule. We model the term premium endogenously using two different models in the class of affine term structure models studied in Duffie and Kan (1996) : a stochastic volatility model and a stochastic price-of- risk model. We then solve for equilibrium term structures in environments in which interest rate targeting follows a rule such as the one suggested by McCallum (i. e., the "McCallum Rule"). We demonstrate that McCallum's original result generalizes in a natural way to this broader class of models. To understand the connection to the Taylor Rule, we then consider two structural macroeconomic models which have reduced forms that correspond to the two affine models and provide a macroeconomic interpretation of abstract state variables (as in Ang and Piazzesi (2003)). Moreover, such structural models allow us to interpret the parameters of the term-structure model in terms of the parameters governing preferences, technologies, and policy rules. We show how a monetary policy rule will manifest itself in the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>asset-pricing</b> kernel and, hence, the equilibrium term structure. We then show how this policy can be implemented with an interest-rate targeting rule. This provides us with a set of restrictions under which the Taylor and McCallum Rules are equivalent in the sense if implementing the same monetary policy. We conclude with some numerical examples that explore the quantitative link between these two models of monetary policy. ...|$|E
