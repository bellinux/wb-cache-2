40|$|AbstractDuring {{machining}} of shafts {{with multiple}} shoulders on CNC lathes {{it is necessary}} to obtain the accuracy of all dimensions automatically since re-setup of the machine tool for each individual part would be time consuming. In cases when the process datum is different from the design datum, datum errors may occur. This error may require the reduction of the process tolerance, which may lead to increased manufacturing costs. The resulting <b>datum</b> <b>error</b> depends on the method of holding the workpiece and the way the cutting tool is set up. This paper analyses the most widely used fixturing and setup methods and estimates the datum errors they may cause...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} systematic error caused by the incorrect use of planimetric datum in the image registration process. Firstly, a registration simulation was accomplished using Reservatório Rio Paraibuna (SP) topographic map, 1 : 10. 000, UTM/Córrego Alegre, 1969. The RMSE obtained for Córrego Alegre (CA), WGS 84 and SAD 69 data was 2. 18, 25. 57 and 42. 65 m, respectively. Only the datum CA presented correct values in respect of the standard for brazilian cartographic accuracy (0, 5 mm at the scale of the map). Statistical tests established that the <b>datum</b> <b>error</b> caused an uniform displacement, without deforming the registered map. However, these errors can make unpractible mapping that needs cartographic precision. Pages: 333 - 34...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Recently, the {{modeling}} of variation propagation in complex multistage manufacturing processes has drawn significant attention. In this paper, a linear model is developed {{to describe the}} dimensional variation propagation of machining processes through kinematic analysis of the relationships among fixture error, <b>datum</b> <b>error,</b> machine geometric error, and the dimensional quality of the product. The developed modeling technique can handle general fixture layouts rather than being limited to a 3 - 2 - 1 layout case. The dimensional error accumulation and transformation within the multistage process are quantitatively described in this model. A systematic procedure to build the model is presented and validated. This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complex machining processes.

A locator toler-ance {{is used to}} specify the range of permissible locator variation. Currently there are no models that relate a locator tolerance scheme to the worst case geometric errors that may result due to <b>datum</b> establishment <b>error.</b> This paper presents a methodology for modeling and analyzing {{the impact of a}} locator tolerance scheme on the potential <b>datum</b> related, geometric <b>errors</b> of linear, machined features.

40|$|AbstractAn {{assembly}} tolerance analysis method {{based on the}} real machine model is proposed, aiming to investigate {{the effect of the}} geometric <b>errors</b> of <b>datum</b> feature on the result of tolerance chain. The real parts are simulated by the variation of the geometric features, which are represented by the control point variation model and generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The investigated objective is the assembly success rate of pin-hole assembly at the location with the three datum planes, the assembly clearance or interference is calculated according to the assembly requirements and assembly process. The part coordinate system in assembly is constructed firstly by the datum embodiment principles, then the position of the junction planes are determined according to the assembly requirements, and finally, the position of the parts relative to machine are determined by the coordinate transformation. The assembly success rate is represented by the probability distribution of clearance or interference between pin and hole, and the influences of the <b>datum</b> <b>errors</b> on the assembly result are discussed by the example assembly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{electronic}} or pneumatic multi-section and multi-probe gauges {{are widely}} used for diameter and coaxiality measurements due to their high measurement efficiency in workshops. However, their measurement accuracy is determined mainly by the manufacturing errors of the assembly coaxiality master, therefore, how to establish coaxiality measurement datum reference is the key technology. The physical coaxiality masters {{are expected to be}} the impossible "zero error datum reference". The higher manufacturing accuracy of the masters, the more expensive for their manufacturing costs. A novel mathematical method on the basis of error separation principle was proposed in order to separate the manufacturing errors of the master. The basic principle is that the eccentric error of the coaxiality master can be expressed as the first harmonic function and the ideal zero-error datum reference could be established by the mathematical method of two sampling operations in phase difference of 180 ° in coaxiality master for gauge initialization. This method can be called as "mathematical datum reference " for coaxiality measurement. Experimental results indicate that the coaxiality measurement results of the multi-section and multi-probe gauge by the novel mathematical method coincide with those of the three-coordinate measuring machine and the maximum difference of both is about 0. 0014 mm. The new coaxiality measurement principle can separate the <b>datum</b> <b>error</b> of the coaxiality master theoretically and can improve the coaxiality measurement accuracy greatly with the common accuracy coaxiality master...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of aerial photos as a substitute for multiple-year pre-removal field data to assess the downstream channel changes associated with a small dam removal. The Brownsville Dam, a 2. 1 m tall concrete dam on the Calapooia River, Oregon, was removed in 2007. We surveyed cross sections below the dam during the summers prior to (2007) and follow (2008) removal, and we analyzed aerial photos from 1994 to 2006. The field surveys and aerial photos were used to map the low flow channel and bars over 1. 3 km downstream from the dam and in an upstream control reach. Three types of measurement error (position error, identification error, and wetted boundary <b>datum</b> <b>error)</b> were assessed for the field surveys and aerial photos in order make the two methods of measurement more comparable. The first year after the dam removal, we observed changes in bar width, wetted width, and wetted width midpoint as large as 17 m ± 3 m immediately below the dam. We inferred that channel changes below the dam after removal were a result of the removal through comparison with pre-dam removal aerial photos, where changes up to 67 m ± 24 m were predominantly far from the dam, and an upstream control, where changes were only as large as 9 m ± 5 m. We conclude with suggestions of best practices for reducing errors, including establishment of permanent monuments for field surveys, taking measurements at similar, well-known discharges, and generating the highest-quality digital aerial photos through source and scanning choices...|$|E

40|$|Glacial {{mass balance}} {{estimated}} through the geodetic method requires glacial surface coordinate observations from {{historical and contemporary}} sources. Contemporary observations and historical topographic maps are typically referenced to separate horizontal and vertical datums and observed with different sampling intervals. This research demonstrates the sensitivity of glacial change detection to the datum considerations and sampling schemes through case studies of Andrei, Bridge and Peyto glaciers in Western Canada. To simulate the procedure of observing the glacial surfaces, profile lines were sampled from Digital Elevation Model (DEMs) on contour intervals for historical data and horizontal intervals for contemporary data. Profile lines from the following scenarios were compared: (1) different horizontal and vertical sampling schemes; (2) the horizontal datum was correctly reconciled but the vertical datum was not; (3) the vertical datum was correctly reconciled but the horizontal datum was not; (4) both the horizontal and vertical datums were correctly reconciled; and (5) both the horizontal and vertical datums were incorrectly reconciled. Vertical errors of up to 6. 9 m, 6. 0 m and 5. 0 m were observed due to sampling effects and vertical errors of 22. 2 m, 9. 9 m and 55. 0 m were observed due to datum inconsistencies on Bridge, Andrei and Peyto glacier respectively. Horizontal datum inconsistencies manifested as erratic levels of growth or downwasting along the glacial surface profile and vertical <b>datum</b> <b>errors</b> manifested as a consistent vertical offset. Datum inconsistencies were identified to contribute errors of up to 257. 2 × 10 6 m 3 (or 87 %) and 54. 6 × 10 6 m 3 (or 580 %) of estimated volume change below and above the equilibrium line respectively on Peyto Glacier. The {{results of this study}} provide an estimate of typical errors due to sampling constraints or datum inconsistencies as well as guidance for identifying where these error sources have contaminated mass balance results...|$|R

This model has great potential to be applied toward fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for complex machining processes. Note to Practitioners-Variation reduction is essential to improve process efficiency and product quality {{in order to gain}} a competitive advantage in manufacturing. Unfortunately, variation reduction presents difficult challenges, particularly for large-scale modern manufacturing processes. Due to the increasing complexity of products, modern manufacturing processes often involve multiple stations or operations. For example, multiple setups and operations are often needed in machining processes to finish the final product. When the workpiece passes through multiple stages, machining errors at each stage will be accumulated onto the workpiece and could further influence the subsequent operations. The variation accumulation and propagation pose significant challenges to final product variation analysis and reduction. This paper focuses on a systematic technique for {{the modeling}} of dimensional variation propagation in multistage machining processes. The relationship between typical process faults and product quality characteristics are established through a kinematics analysis. One salient feature of the proposed technique is that the interactio- - ns among different operations with general fixture layouts are captured systematically through the modeling of setup errors. This model has great potential to be applied to fault diagnosis and process design evaluation for a complex machining proces...|$|E
40|$|Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA) {{data have}} been used to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of GTOPO 30, the first comprehensive, 1 km resolution, global topographic data set. GTOPO 30 was developed by the USGS Eros Data Center (EDC), in part, to address NASA's needs for a global topographic model in support of remote sensing instruments aboard the Earth Observing System AM- 1 spacecraft. SLA flew {{as a part of the}} STS- 72 mission in January, 1996 observing the latitude band from +/- 28. 5 deg, and on STS- 85 in August, 1997 extending the observations to +/- 57 deg. Combining the SLA ranging data with shuttle position and pointing knowledge yields surface elevation data of very high vertical accuracy in an Earth-centered, absolute reference frame (2. 8 m rms difference for SLA- 01 with respect to ocean reference surface). Use of the well-determined mean sea surface reference for calibration allows propagation of high accuracy altimetry onto the continents. 436, 635 SLA- 01 land elevations were compared to the GTOPO 30 grid after conversion to a mean sea level vertical datum using the Earth Geoid Model 96, jointly developed by Goddard and NIMA. The comparison reveals systematic elevation biases in southern Asia, Africa, Australia, and south America on the order 10 's to 100 meters in the GTOPO 30 compilation on spatial scales of 100 's to 1000 's of kilometers. These biases are likely due to vertical <b>datum</b> <b>errors</b> in the topographic source materials used to compile GTOPO 30, which primarily consist of Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) digital elevation and topographic map products. These biases imply that elevation corrections applied to land gravity measurements using these DMA source materials will be biased, leading to errors in geoid models incorporating these land gravity data...|$|R

A soft error is also a signal or datum which is wrong, but is not assumed to imply such a mistake or breakage.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} {{investigation into the}} dimensional error of the rapid prototyping additive process of powder-binder three-dimensional printing. Ten replicates of a purpose-designed part were produced using a three-dimensional printer, and measurements of {{the internal and external}} features of all surfaces were made using a general purpose coordinate measuring machine. The results reveal that the bases of all replicates (nominally flat) have a concave curvature, producing a flatness error of the primary datum. This is in contrast to findings regarding other three-dimensional printing processes, widely reported in the literature, where a convex curvature was observed. All external surfaces investigated in this study showed positive deviation from nominal values, especially in the z-axis. The z-axis error consisted of a consistent positive cumulative error and a different constant error in different replicates. By compensating for <b>datum</b> surface <b>error,</b> the average total height error of the test parts can be reduced by 25. 52  %. All the dimensional errors are hypothesised to be explained by expansion and the subsequent distortion caused by layer interaction during and after the printing process...|$|R
40|$|Invalid {{measurement}} {{data are}} phenomena that plague {{the reliability of}} Coordinate Measurement Systems. The best-fit algorithms used for feature computation all amplify {{the influence of the}} points most distant from the mean. As a result, a single invalid point can significantly skew the computed feature parameters, even for large data sets. If the feature happens to be a <b>datum,</b> the <b>error</b> propagates through the measurement of the entire part. A measurement consisting of thousands of measured points can be ruined by a single bad piece of data. It is therefore desirable that invalid data be identified and removed before feature evaluation is performed. Three separate cases are considered. The first case is the problem of contact occurring on undesired surfaces. This type of problem can occur when measuring complex parts such as a gear hob or when using a non-spherical probe. This case is the best suited for solution through the use of surface normal data since the change in surface normal between surfaces is large and easily detected. The remaining problem, the detection of invalid data due to dirt, burrs, porosity or external factors, is divided into 2 cases. The division is made based upon the spacing of the data collected. If the spacing is large, each point can only be considered independently. If the measurement data are dense we can use the relationship between points to refine the analysis...|$|R

First of all, the distributions of the incomplete spells of employment are analysed without explanatory variables (such as age, sex, etc.), assuming that the unobserved completed spells have a Weibull distribution. The relationships between {{the mean of the}} incomplete spells and the mean of the completed spells are reported for first-job seekers, unemployed, employed, and self-employed workers. Given that the unobserved completed spells are Weibull-distributed, the unobserved heterogeneity is introduced on the scale parameter of the Weibull.

As the beginning of a spell a retrospective <b>datum,</b> the recall <b>errors</b> are modelled including the heaping effect. Using some proportional hazards models, the methodology to study the influences of explanatory variables on spell distributions is then described, once again including both the heterogeneity and the heaping effect.

40|$|Integrated {{multi-sensor}} systems, {{with their}} major progress {{in terms of}} sensor resolution, data rate and operational flexibility, have become a very attractive mapping tool over the last decade. In aerial mapping application, for example, Exterior Orientation (EO) parameters for the imaging sensors are required. Using the integrated Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), direct determination of the EO parameters {{can be obtained from}} the integrated system navigation solution. This process is referred to as Direct Georeferening (DG). DG provides substantial benefits over the indirect determination method of estimating the EO parameters from conventional Aerial Triangulation (AT) techniques using a block of images with a sufficient number of known control points. These benefits include the ability to map remote and inaccessible regions, and by replacing tie point measurements/matching and AT, significant cost-savings can be obtained for projects that do not require stereo models (such as projects with existing DEM or single image). The accuracy of DG, however, is limited by the accuracy attainable by the DGPS and any residual <b>datum</b> calibration <b>errors.</b> These can typically be as large as 10 cm RMSE, which is not sufficient for some large scale mapping applications. However, by combining the direct EO data a traditional block adjustment, AT techniques can be used to remove the residual errors in the solution. This technique is known as Integrated Sensor Orientation (ISO). It has several advantages over traditional AT, primarily because the stable geometry provided by direct EO can reduce the number of required GCP and tie-point to a minimum. At the same time, ISO provides an excellent tool for Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) of the EO derived from a DG system. This paper examines the factors that determine the system performance for ISO. In addition, examples are given to illustrate the expected accuracy of an aerial mapping project using ISO under different qualities of DGPS/IMU data...|$|R
40|$|Five {{widespread}} upper Cenozoic tephra layers {{that are}} found within continental sediments of the western United States have been correlated with tephra layers in marine sediments in the Humboldt and Ventura basins of coastal California by similarities in major-and trace-element abundances; four of these layers have also been identified in deep-ocean sediments at DSDP sites 34, 36, 173, and 470 in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. These layers, erupted from vents in the Yellowstone National Park area of Wyoming and Idaho (Y), the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest (C), and the Long Valley area, California (L), are the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed (2. 0 Ma, Y), Rio Dell ash bed (ca. 1. 5 Ma, C), Bishop ash bed (0. 74 Ma, L), Lava Creek B ash bed (0. 62 Ma, Y), and Loleta ash bed (ca. 0. 4 Ma, C). The isochronous nature of these beds allows direct comparison of chronologic and climatic data {{in a variety of}} depositional environments. For example, the widespread Bishop ash bed is correlated from proximal localities near Bishop in east-central California, where it is interbedded with volcanic and glacial deposits, to lacustrine beds near Tecopa, southeastern California, to deformed on-shore marine strata near Ventura, southwestern California, to deep-ocean sediments at site 470 in the eastern Pacific Ocean west of northern Mexico. The correlations allow us to compare isotopic ages determined for the tephra layers with ages of continental and marine biostratigraphic zones determined by magnetostratigraphy and other numerical age control and also provide iterative checks for available age control. Relative age variations of as much as 0. 5 m. y. exist between marine biostratigraphic datums [for example, highest occurrence level of Discoaster brouweri and Calcidiscus tropicus (= C. macintyrei) ], as determined from sedimentation rate curves derived from other age control available at each of several sites. These discrepancies may be due to several factors, among which are (1) diachronism of the lowest and highest occurrence levels of marine faunal and floral species with latitude because of ecologic thresholds, (2) upward reworking of older forms in hemipelagic sections adjacent to the tectonically active coast of the western United States and other similar analytical problems in identification of biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic datums, (3) dissolution of microfossils or selective diagenesis of some taxa, (4) lack of precision in isotopic age calibration of these <b>datums,</b> (5) <b>errors</b> in isotopic ages of tephra beds, and (6) large variations in sedimentation rates or hiatuses in stratigraphic sections that result in age <b>errors</b> of interpolated <b>datums.</b> Correlation of tephra layers between on-land marine and deep-ocean deposits indicates that some biostratigraphic datums (diatom and calcareous nannofossil) may be truly time transgressive because at some sites, they are found above and, at other sites, below the same tephra layers...|$|R
