40|$|<b>Fillet</b> {{weight is}} an {{economically}} important trait in Nile tilapia production for the European market which asks for fish with average body weights {{of at least}} 700 g. Genetic parameters to design or optimize breeding programs for these body weights are lacking. In an earlier study we showed that high phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and low phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yield. To evaluate the potential of mass selection for <b>fillet</b> traits, however, genetic parameters are required. The aim {{of the current study}} was to estimate genetic parameters for body weight, <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements. Therefore, slaughter data was collected on 1884 pedigreed Nile tilapias. Measurements of body weight, length, width, corrected (=fillet) length and head length were taken on each fish. <b>Filleting</b> machines were used to <b>fillet</b> fish and measurements of <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and head weight were collected. Subsequently, genetic parameters were estimated. Heritabilities were 0. 26 for body weight, 0. 24 for <b>fillet</b> weight and 0. 12 for <b>fillet</b> yield. The genetic correlation between body weight and <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 99 and between body weight and <b>fillet</b> yield 0. 74. The genetic correlation between <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 81. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> weight and body measurements were 0. 89 for length, 0. 70 for head length, 0. 94 for width and 0. 91 for corrected length. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements were 0. 62 for length, 0. 47 for head length, 0. 98 for width and 0. 60 for corrected length. The potential of mass selection aiming to improve <b>fillet</b> weight was evaluated by a number of selection indexes. The accuracy of a selection index including only body weight indicated that in this way almost the same amount of the selection response could be achieved compared to what hypothetical direct selection for <b>fillet</b> weight would. The use of only width in the selection index would result in 8. 5 % lower selection response than the use of body weight. We conclude that body weight is the best predictor for <b>fillet</b> weight compared to body measurement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fillet</b> yield (i. e. the {{proportion}} of edible flesh from a given amount of fish) is a trait of high economic interest for species sold as <b>fillets.</b> Improving it by selective breeding {{is not an easy}} task, as it is a ratio trait, which causes mathematical difficulties. It is moreover a specific ratio where numerator (<b>fillet</b> weight) and denominator (body weight) are very strongly correlated (genetic and phenotypic correlations in the range 0. 89 – 0. 99). This led some authors to conclude that they have the same genetic and phenotypic basis, precluding selection for improved <b>fillet</b> yield. In this study, we propose to study <b>fillet</b> yield as a component of two traits, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight (waste weight = body weight- <b>fillet</b> weight, so the sum of head, bones, fins and viscera weight), which we expect to be less correlated. Using data from 5 batches of fish from 3 species (sea bass, sea bream, rainbow trout), we show that as expected, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight are less correlated than <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight (on average, r A = 0. 91 and r P = 0. 88 vs. r A = 0. 987, r P = 0. 981). We used stochastic simulation to generate genotypes and phenotypes of fish using those genetic parameters for <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. We simulated 10 generations of selection for increased <b>fillet</b> yield using nine selection indices. Five indices had rather similar performances, residual <b>fillet</b> weight (the residual of the regression of <b>fillet</b> weight to body weight), <b>fillet</b> yield, <b>fillet</b> to waste ratio, restricted selection index (a linear index aimed at improving <b>fillet</b> weight while keeping waste weight constant) and linear index (optimized to improve fillet/waste ratio). With these indices, the average selection gain was + 0. 66 % of <b>fillet</b> yield per generation (range 0. 30 to 0. 95 % using real genetic parameters from 5 fish batches). Selection for the difference between <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight was 30 % less efficient, while selection for increased <b>fillet</b> weight or increased body weight was 55 – 65 % less efficient. Selection against waste weight had a null or even negative impact on <b>fillet</b> yield. Factors favorable to higher selection gains are low initial <b>fillet</b> yield, different heritabilities and CVs of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight, low genetic correlation and high phenotypic correlation of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. These results suggest that although <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight are strongly correlated and proportional to each other, moderate selection gains on <b>fillet</b> yield are possible. We consider {{it would be useful to}} add waste weight in the parameters recorded in future genetic studies on <b>fillet</b> yield...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to observe the relationships between operator’s work performance (speed of <b>filleting</b> and actual output rate of round codfish as well as of <b>fillets)</b> and his physiological parameters (mean heart rate, blood pressure and product of mean heart rate and blood pressure) during codfish <b>filleting</b> operation, and at the same time collect sufficient data to observe the effect of factors, such as speed of <b>filleting</b> and size of fish on the actual output rate and percentage yield of <b>filleting.</b> The effect of size of round codfish <b>filleted</b> on mean heart rate and normal output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> of the <b>filleting</b> operator was also investigated. [...] This study was carried out at a small fish processing plant. Four average skilled male <b>filleting</b> operators were selected with the help of plant supervisors. Each subject was asked to work at five different <b>filleting</b> speeds, on an individual type <b>filleting</b> table layout. “Head on-gut in” codfish was supplied to each operator in 75 lb. boxes. A total of about 2625 lbs. of round codfish was processed during this study. A total of 35 individual experiments were performed. The actual time of <b>filleting</b> each box of 75 lbs. round codfish, performance rating (speed of <b>filleting),</b> number of codfish/ 75 lb. box, weight of skin-on <b>fillets,</b> operator’s mean heart rate and blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) were recorded for each <b>filleting</b> experiment. [...] Within the range and scope of this study, the analysis of the results indicated following trends: [...] 1. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 2. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 3. Significant linear positive relationship between speed of <b>filleting</b> and product of mean heart rate and systolic blood pressure of the operator. [...] 4.

Significant linear positive relationship between actual output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> and mean heart rate of <b>filleting</b> operator. [...] 7. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and actual output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> produced. [...] 8. Significant linear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and mean heart rate of the operator. [...] 9. Significant curvilinear positive relationship between size of round fish <b>filleted</b> and normal output rate (round fish as well as <b>fillets)</b> produced. [...] Management in fish plants could use the relationships between work performance (actual output rate, etc.) and physiological parameters (mean heart rate, etc.) to design a better method of <b>filleting,</b> working height and work layout etc., and therefore improve the efficiency of the plant, without causing unnecessary higher physiological loads on the operator. [...] This study also suggests that management in fish plants should set work standards by establishing relationships between size of fish and normal output rate for a range of different species of fish, input quality of fish, offshore-inshore fish, and dressed-undressed condition of the fish...|$|R
40|$|In Nile tilapia, {{breeding}} programs focus {{mainly on}} growth, {{and information on}} genetic improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield is scarce. In this study, slaughter data were collected on 1215 tilapia and {{used to analyze the}} relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Fish were obtained from three different origins/strains, and raised in a commercial farm in the Netherlands in closed recirculation systems until a final mean weight of 700 g. Body weight, length, height, width and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length were taken prior to slaughter, and used to predict <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield using linear regression models. Average <b>fillet</b> yield was 35. 7 % with large differences between strains (range 34. 4 - 38 %). There was a strong almost linear relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, but relationships with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. R- 2 of the regression model for <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 95 and the correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight 0. 98. The effect of strain/origin was significant for each body measurement. The effect of sex and strain x sex was significant for length and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length. The <b>fillet</b> yield model explained 15 % of the observed variance; the correlation between observed and predicted <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 38, but there were large differences within strains. We conclude that in Nile tilapia, predicting <b>fillet</b> yield based on body measurements is possible, but correlations can be improved if more accurate methods for measuring body width become available.

40|$|A three {{generation}} {{data set}} consisting of 5, 532 records {{from a long}} term selection program for high growth rate in GIFT was used to derive prediction equations for <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Models were based on body traits (body weight, standard length, body width and body depth) and a carcass measurement (<b>fillet</b> weight). Length, width and depth were adjusted for the systematic effects of generation, selection line, gender, <b>filleting</b> batch, grow-out pond, their first order interactions, and for the covariables age at slaughter and body weight. Body and <b>fillet</b> weights adjusted for the same effects (except body weight) were used to calculate <b>fillet</b> yield. Average <b>fillet</b> weight and yield were 177. 7 g and 33. 6 %, respectively. The simple (Pearson) correlation coefficients between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight were moderate to very high (0. 52 to 0. 94), but the correlations between body traits and <b>fillet</b> yield were very low (- 0. 02 to 0. 14). There were strong linear relationships between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, whereas relationships of body traits with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. Step-wise multiple regression analysis showed that the best model to predict <b>fillet</b> weight included all body traits, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 94 and a correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight of 0. 97. The corresponding figures for <b>fillet</b> yield were 0. 12 and 0. 35, respectively. Body weight was {{the best predictor of}} <b>fillet</b> weight, explaining 93 % of observed variance when it was fitted alone in the model. By contrast, body depth explained a large proportion (97 %) of total variance in the full prediction model for <b>fillet</b> yield. It is concluded that in practical breeding programs, improvement of <b>fillet</b> weight can be easily made through indirect selection for body trait combinations. By contrast, improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield seems much more difficult to achieve by indirect means, with only 12 % of the variation in the trait explained by the body and carcass traits examined in this stud...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{total weight}} {{is the best}} single {{measurement}} for predicting <b>fillet</b> weight in Asian sea bass. Regression models developed {{in this study are}} applicable to fish weighing 960 – 1190  g from all populations sampled. Using separate models yielded similar prediction power and accuracy for <b>fillet</b> weight. This study demonstrates the use of various body measurements in predicting <b>fillet</b> yields. Despite relatively weak correlations between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yields, we were able to develop useful prediction models for <b>fillet</b> yields in three stocks of Asian sea bass. Although <b>fillet</b> yield is the most important trait for fish processors, increased <b>fillet</b> percentages could be achieved along with increased <b>fillet</b> weights, given the positive correlation between the traits. The application of prediction models would allow for rapid genetic improvement via breeding to increase <b>fillet</b> yields and enable producers to be more competitive in the value-added markets of Asian sea bass.|$|R
