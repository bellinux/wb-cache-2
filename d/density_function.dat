Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability <b>density</b> <b>function</b> for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the First World War, after {{originally}} {{being placed}} as a radio operator, {{he was moved}} to research duties regarding sound ranging due to his specialist knowledge. In 1921, Born returned to Göttingen, arranging another chair for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck. Under Born, Göttingen {{became one of the}} world's foremost centres for physics. In 1925, Born and Werner Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. The following year, he formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability <b>density</b> <b>function</b> for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1954. His influence extended far beyond his own research. Max Delbrück, Siegfried Flügge, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf all received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen, and his assistants included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.|$|E
25|$|The goal of density {{estimation}} {{is to take}} {{a finite}} sample of data and to make inferences about the underlying probability <b>density</b> <b>function</b> everywhere, including where no data are observed.

Aggregating the individually smoothed contributions gives an overall picture {{of the structure of the}} data and its <b>density</b> <b>function.</b> In the details to follow, we show that this approach leads to a reasonable estimate of the underlying <b>density</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a differential-geometric structure for spectral <b>density</b> <b>functions</b> of discrete-time random processes.

Herein, we {{introduce a}}n analogous Riemannian metric, which we motivate with a problem in prediction theory. It turns out that this problem also provides a prediction theoretic interpretation to the Itakura distortion measure, which relates to our metric. Geodesics and geodesic distances are characterized in closed form and, hence, the geodesic distance between two spectral <b>density</b> <b>functions</b> provides an explicit, intrinsic (pseudo) metric on the cone of <b>density</b> <b>functions.</b> Certain other distortion measures that involve generalized means of spectral <b>density</b> <b>functions</b> are shown to lead to the same Riemannian metric. Finally, an alternative Riemannian metric is introduced, which is motivated by an analogous problem involving smoothing instead of prediction.
