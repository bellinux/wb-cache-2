5|$|Asser's prose {{style has}} been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. <b>His</b> <b>frequent</b> use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that {{is common in}} Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are {{peculiar}} to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E

5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover.
