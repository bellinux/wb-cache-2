5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an <b>economic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

The first is that we extend the evolution model of retail formats through integrating the work of Ehrlich and Fisher (1982) and Betancourt (2006). Our model introduces consumers’ reactions to the retail service environment, namely consumer psychological costs, into the Ehrlich-Fisher Model. Through the revised model, we deduce the existence of different retail formats. The second contribution is that we demonstrate {{the possibility of the}} existence of multiple <b>economic</b> <b>equilibriums</b> by building a partial equilibrium model. This paper describes the distribution of the multiple equilibriums of retail formats and analyzes the evolution of equilibrium with changes in the external environment. These conclusions reveal how retail formats response to consumer heterogeneity.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in dynamic general <b>equilibrium</b> <b>economic</b> models <b>equilibrium</b> may be indeterminate. Indeterminacy means that there is a {{continuum}} of equilibrium trajectories converging to the same steady state. Very often, the same mechanisms that are responsible for indeterminacy, like increasing returns to scale or market imperfections, lead to existence of multiple steady states, and development traps can arise. On the other hand, indeterminacy often allows construction of rational sunspot equilibrium as a randomization over di¤erent equilibrium trajectories or equilibria. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to study the possibility of “rescuing ” an economy from a development trap 1. 1 Indeterminacy and Poverty Traps There are several types of models that produce “development traps ” or “poverty traps”.

Using data for the G 7 economies during the postwar period since 1950, the empirical analysis yields a long-run model which implies plausible estimates of the production function parameters. Postwar economic growth in each of the G 7 countries appears to be well characterized by a nonlinear equilibrium correction model where the dynamic adjustment towards long-run equilibrium is governed by a logistic function, while also capturing spillover effects in growth dynamics. <b>Economic</b> Growth; <b>Equilibrium</b> Correction; Nonlinear Dynamics; Spillover...|$|R
