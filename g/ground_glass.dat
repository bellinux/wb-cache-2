There are three successive models: the RZ67 Professional (first model released in 1982), RZ67 Professional II (released in 1995) and RZ67 Professional IID (released in 2004). RZ67 is a modular camera system, meaning lenses, viewfinders, <b>ground</b> <b>glasses,</b> film winders and film backs are all interchangeable.

Focusing is performed with a bellows on the body instead of the lenses.|$|R
25|$|From about July 1942 {{to about}} September 1943, {{experiments}} {{to investigate the}} effectiveness of sulfonamide, a synthetic antimicrobial agent, were conducted at Ravensbrück. Wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens (a major causative agent in gas gangrene) and Clostridium tetani, the causative agent in tetanus. Circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels {{at both ends of}} the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound. Infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> into the wounds. The infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The Argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé Argand, revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The Argand lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} Argand, in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E
25|$|In every lens there is, {{corresponding}} {{to a given}} apertal ratio (that is, {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a 1/4 in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal range will depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' have not come into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.|$|E

For instance, the degree of the second- and third-order coherence of the superbunching pseudothermal light with five rotating <b>ground</b> <b>glasses</b> can reach 32 and 7776, respectively.

25|$|Volcanoes {{can cause}} {{widespread}} destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. The effects include the volcanic eruption itself that may cause harm following {{the explosion of}} the volcano or falling rocks. Secondly, lava may be produced during the eruption of a volcano, and so as it leaves the volcano the lava destroys many buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. Thirdly, volcanic ash, generally meaning the cooled ash, may form a cloud, and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight but even small quantities will harm humans if inhaled. Since the ash has the consistency of <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> it causes abrasion damage to moving parts such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is the pyroclastic flows, which consist of a cloud of hot volcanic ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that Pompeii was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. The 1953 Tangiwai disaster was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 Armero tragedy in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.|$|E
500|$|The enamel lies {{flush with}} the gold surfaces; it was a {{preparation}} of finely <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas, and then fired. Different colours of enamel meet {{each other with a}} neat boundary, which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of gum tragacanth before adding the next. The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing, so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour {{around the edges of the}} tinted area. This is especially used on [...] "flux", or colourless enamel, as in the ground areas, rocks and trees. Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin. The rouge clair or [...] "ruby glass" [...] red, used so effectively here, was made by adding tiny particles of copper, silver and gold to the glass; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used. After firing the enamel was polished {{flush with the}} surrounding metal. The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans (see the Lycurgus Cup, also in the British Museum), but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17thcentury. The added cylinders use opaque enamel, except for the red on the Tudor roses, which is translucent rouge clair, of a similar composition to the original reds. Translucent enamel is more fragile than opaque, and medieval survivals in good condition are very rare.|$|E

2500|$|Condensers {{are often}} used in reflux, where the hot solvent vapors of a liquid being heated are cooled and allowed to drip back. This reduces the loss of solvent {{allowing}} the mixture to be heated for extended periods. Condensers are used in distillation to cool the hot vapors, condensing them into liquid for separate collection. For fractional distillation, an air or Vigreux condenser is usually used to slow {{the rate at which}} the hot vapors rise, giving a better separation between the different components in the distillate. For microscale distillation, the apparatus includes the [...] "pot", and the condenser fused into one-piece, which reduces the hold-up volume, and obviates the need for <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints preventing contamination by grease and precluding leaks.|$|E
2500|$|When using {{glassware}} it {{is often}} necessary to control the flow of fluid. [...] It is commonly stopped with a stopper. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware.

[...] For a leak-tight connection a <b>ground</b> <b>glass</b> joints is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a Keck clips). [...] Another way to connect glassware is with a hose barb and flexible tubing. Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a valve, of which a stopcock is a common type fused to the glassware.
