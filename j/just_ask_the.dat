2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who does it all belong to and why is it all going on. I <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three techniques}} and the graphics implementations {{which can be}} used as diagnostic aides in the design and understanding of scattering structures: Imaging, near fields, and surface current displays. The imaging analysis is a new bistatic k space approach which has potential for much greater information than standard experimental approaches. The near field and current analysis are implementations of standard theory while the diagnostic graphics displays are implementations exploiting recent computer engineering work station graphics libraries. INTRODUCTION The goals and motivation of this work are to provide insight and guidance into the design of scattering structures. Analytical/computer codes have historically been conceived only to provide predictions of experimentally measured quantities, i. e., backscatter RCS versus angle. In principle, an analytical code should be able to provide a much greater insight into the scattering process if we <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> proper ques [...] ...|$|E
40|$|How well social {{programs}} reach the poor {{has been a}} long-standing social policy question in developing and developed countries. As J. S. Mill observed, the key issue in designing policies to alleviate poverty is “giving {{the greatest amount of}} needful help with the smallest amount of undue reliance on it ” (Besley and Kanbur 1993, 67). The question is not only about who receives the benefits but also about their impact and cost. These con-cerns pertain both to the poor who urgently need cash or in-kind transfers and to the nonpoor who have to pay for these benefits and on whose sup-port the political sustainability of {{social programs}} depends. The answer to the question requires a definition of who the neediest are, what they need most, and {{what is the best way}} to provide them with it. But the complications do not end there. Next, the neediest have to be identi-fied—not as simple a job as it may first appear. Being concerned about pro-gram costs, we cannot <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> individuals who belong to the group defined as “the neediest”—say, the poor, who lack the income to purchase a basket of basic needs. If we did, many nonpoor would be tempted to say they are poor in order to receive the transfers. But the cost of finding out who is truly poor may be high, so program officers have to live with imper-fect solutions. The consideration of incentives and administrative costs leads us to the notion of an optimal but imperfect level of targeting (Besley and Kanbur 1993). Tullock (1982) adds another rationale for less-than-per-fect targeting: the nonpoor usually have more political power than the poor...|$|E
