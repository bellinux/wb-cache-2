5|$|Duhalde was {{succeeded by}} Néstor Kirchner on May 25, 2003. Kirchner soon {{distanced himself from}} Duhalde, and removed all the people close to Duhalde from the {{government}} to reduce his political influence. Kirchner also sought supporters from all {{the social and political}} spectra to counter the influence of Duhalde within the party. However, both men delayed an open dispute and stuck together during the 2003 legislative elections, held in October. The dispute continued in the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> for Victory, which was kept by the Kirchners.

5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed behind the front line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
5|$|Facing the British V Corps was the 1st Parachute Division (1.

5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face and {{pain in her}} limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard left <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|Lunars English {{version was}} handled by Working Designs, a small California-based {{publisher}} {{who had previously}} localized smaller games for the TurboGrafx-16 and TurboDuo. Their biggest project yet, the team, headed by company {{vice president and chief}} writer Victor Ireland, took to the project seriously, often collaborating with the original Japanese team themselves. New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of the}} game. Working Designs also put extra effort into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{itself was}} also hastily fortified. According to Zhukov, 250,000 women and {{teenagers}} worked building trenches and anti-tank moats around Moscow, moving almost three million {{cubic meters of}} earth with no mechanical help. Moscow's factories were hastily converted to military tasks: one automobile factory {{was turned into a}} submachine gun armory, a clock factory manufactured mine detonators, the chocolate factory shifted to food production <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> and automobile repair stations worked fixing damaged tanks and military vehicles. Despite these preparations, the capital was within striking distance of German tanks, with the Luftwaffe mounting large-scale air raids on the city. The air raids caused only limited damage because of extensive anti-aircraft defenses and effective civilian fire brigades.|$|E

5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{was elected}} {{president}} in 2003, and Cristina became the First Lady. Under these circumstances, she sought a lower profile in Congress. Néstor Kirchner had a political dispute with the previous president, Eduardo Duhalde. Their dispute continued during the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a single candidate for senator of the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their respective wives run for the office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ, and Cristina Kirchner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> for Victory.

5|$|The two-tier {{steel frame}} and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, {{a part of the}} ground called The Paddock. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.|$|E

5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the Loggia palace, and finished {{up the bulk}} of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner soon distanced {{himself from}} Duhalde, {{removing}} those close to the former president from the government to reduce his political influence. He also sought supporters across {{the social and political}} spectrum to counter Duhalde's influence in the party. Although Duhalde was not initially against Kirchner, Kirchner tried to prevent the presence of alternative leaderships within the PJ. However, they put their differences behind them during the October 2003 legislative elections. Their dispute was fanned by the political weight of Buenos Aires province (the most populous in Argentina, with almost 40 percent of the national vote), and continued through the 2005 midterm elections. Without consensus in the PJ for a candidate for senator in the Buenos Aires province, both leaders had their wives run for office: Hilda González de Duhalde for the PJ and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> for Victory, which contested the election as a different party. Cristina Kirchner won the election. As in 2003, the elections were defined by Peronist factions; the opposition parties could not put up a united national front. The victory gave Kirchner the confidence to remove Lavagna, Rafael Bielsa, Jose Pampuro, and Alicia Kirchner from his cabinet and replace them with ministers who, though less well-known, had perspectives closer to his own.|$|E
50|$|Support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Front</b> is {{stronger}} {{in the ranks}} of LGB people than among all the French people, with 13% support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Front</b> in 2013. <b>The</b> National <b>Front</b> is benefiting among LGB voters, with a +5% increase between 2012 and 2013, than {{in the rest of the}} population, +4% of heterosexuals in the same period. The increase of <b>the</b> National <b>Front</b> among LGB people is probably due to the composition of the electorate, with more male, urban, and younger people than the average population therefore generally more willing to vote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Front.</b> In Paris, 26% of LGB residents support <b>the</b> National <b>Front,</b> with 16% heterosexuals support National <b>Front.</b> <b>The</b> National <b>Front's</b> hostility towards Islamism can seduce LGB people for whom Islam can appear as a threat against their lives and freedoms.|$|R

5|$|Néstor Kirchner {{did not run}} for reelection. Instead, Cristina Kirchner was the {{candidate}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> for Victory party, becoming president in the 2007 presidential election. Her first term of office started with a conflict with the agricultural sector, and her proposed taxation system was rejected. After this she nationalized private pension funds, and fired {{the president of the}} Central Bank. The price of public services remained subsidised, the country lost its self-supply of energy, and she renationalized energy firm YPF as a result. The country fell into sovereign default in 2014. The country had good relations with other South American nations, and a rocky one with the United States and the United Kingdom. She also continued her husband's human rights policies, and had a rocky relationship with the press. Néstor Kirchner died in 2010, and Cristina Kirchner was reelected in 2011. She established currency controls during her second term. Several corruption scandals took place, and she faced several demonstrations against her rule. In the 2013 midterm elections the Front for Victory failed to achieve the two-thirds majority necessary to amend the constitution to allow the president to run for a third term. Governor Daniel Scioli was appointed as {{the candidate}} for the 2015 presidential elections. Scioli was defeated by Mayor Mauricio Macri in a ballotage.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{soon began}} {{to come to a}} head. Austria had {{solidified}} its control over Lombardy-Venice and extended its protection to provinces nominally under the control of Francis' daughter Marie Louise. On 18 April Metternich announced that Austria was formally at war with Murat's Naples. Austria won the Battle of Tolentino on 3 May and captured Naples less than three weeks later. Metternich then was able to delay a decision {{on the future of the}} country until after Vienna. Discussions about Germany would drag on until early June, when a joint Austrian-Prussian proposition was ratified. It left most constitutional issues to the new diet; its President would be the Emperor Francis himself. Despite criticism from within Austria, Metternich was pleased with the outcome and the degree of control it granted Habsburgs, and, through them, himself. Certainly, Metternich was able to use the diet to his own ends on numerous occasions. The arrangement was similarly popular with most German representatives. A summation treaty was signed on 19 June (the Russians signed a week later), bringing the Vienna Congress officially to an end. Metternich himself had left on 13 June <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, prepared for a lengthy war against Napoleon. Napoleon, however, was defeated decisively at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June.|$|E
