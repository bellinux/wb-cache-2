As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his <b>house</b> <b>because</b> of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony {{noted that}} {{ordinary}} citizens responded to Nixon. When {{a group of}} rural people visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her <b>house</b> <b>because</b> {{he could not see}} the washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister Zhou En-lai was suffienciently smitten with her so as to give two rare giant pandas to the ambassador as a gift from China.|$|E

The dinosaur, named Uncle Beazley, becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Beazley is first kept at National Museum of Natural History, but is eventually transferred to the National Zoo's Elephant <b>House</b> <b>because</b> there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while {{auditioning for}} a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' <b>house</b> <b>because</b> of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E

Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe <b>house</b> <b>because</b> Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave the desk. Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E
25|$|In addition, some modern astrologers {{who follow}} the X=Y=Z or Planet=Sign=House doctrine, which was first taught by Alan Leo {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, believe that certain houses are also ruled by—or have an {{affinity}} with—the planet which rules the corresponding zodiacal sign. For instance, Mars is ruler of the 1st <b>house</b> <b>because</b> it rules Aries, the first sign; Mercury rules (or has an affinity with) the 3rd <b>house</b> <b>because</b> it rules Gemini, the 3rd sign; etc.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{evidence}} shows that because homeowners would allegedly keep their homes for longer, young households often rent for longer before buying a <b>house.</b> <b>Because</b> Proposition 13 could be a disincentive to sell, there is less turnover among owners near the older downtown areas, resulting in an upward pressure on price appreciation in these areas.|$|E
