5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU would drive Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Five star {{systems have}} been found to have planets, four of which have been {{discovered}} by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in Chile. HD 4308 is a star with around 83% of the Sun's mass located 72 light-years away with a super-Earth planet with an orbital period of around 15 days. HD 215497 is an orange star of spectral type K3V around 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet around the size of Saturn with a period of around 567 days. HD 221287 has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a super-Jovian planet. HD 7199 has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a planet with around 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. HD 219077 has a planet around 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b> These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

50|$|All of Saturn's regular moons except Iapetus orbit {{very nearly}} {{in the plane}} of Saturn's equator. The outer {{irregular}} satellites follow moderately to <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits,</b> and none are expected to rotate synchronously as all the inner moons of Saturn do (except for Hyperion). See Saturn's satellites' families.|$|R
25|$|A {{satellite}} in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> {{spends most}} of its time {{in the neighborhood of}} apogee which for a Molniya orbit is over the Northern Hemisphere, the sub-satellite point at apogee having a latitude of 63.4 degrees north. As the apogee altitude is as high as 40,000km, it will therefore, for a considerable period around apogee, have an excellent visibility from the Northern Hemisphere, from the Russian Federation but also from northern Europe, Greenland and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Circumbinary discs {{that may}} {{indicate}} processes of planet formation {{have been found}} around several stars, and are in fact common around binaries with separations less than 3 AU. One notable example is in the HD 98800 system, which comprises two pairs of binary stars separated by around 34 AU. The binary subsystem HD 98800 B, which consists of two stars of 0.70 and 0.58 solar masses in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> with semimajor axis 0.983 AU, {{is surrounded by a}} complex dust disc that is being warped by the gravitational effects of the mutually-inclined and eccentric stellar orbits. The other binary subsystem, HD 98800 A, is not associated with significant amounts of dust.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} the Martian moons is still controversial. Phobos and Deimos both {{have much in common}} with {{carbonaceous}} C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids. Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids. Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces, although {{it is not clear that}} sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos. Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking. Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.|$|E

50|$|KOI 54 is {{believed}} to be a binary system containing two Class-A stars in <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> with a semi-major axis of 0.4 AU. During periastron, tidal distortions cause a periodic brightening of the system. In addition, these tidal forces induce resonant pulsations in one (or both) of the stars, making it only the 4th known stellar system to exhibit such behavior.|$|R
500|$|Eta Carinae B is presumably also losing mass via a thin fast stellar wind, {{but this}} cannot be {{detected}} directly. Models of the radiation observed from {{interactions between the}} winds of the two stars show a mass loss rate {{of the order of}} /year at speeds of 3,000km/s, typical of a hot O class star. [...] For a portion of the <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> it may actually gain material from the primary via an accretion disk. During the Great Eruption of the primary, the secondary could have accreted , producing strong jets which formed the bipolar shape of the Homunculus Nebula.|$|E
500|$|Caltech {{researchers}} Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown have hypothesised {{the existence}} of a giant planet in the outer Solar System, nicknamed Planet Nine. The planet would be about 10 times as massive as Earth. It would have a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> and its average distance from the Sun would be about 20 times that of Neptune (which orbits at an average distance of [...] ). Its orbital period would be 10,000 to 20,000 years. The planet's existence was hypothesised using mathematical modeling and computer simulations, but it has not been observed directly. It may explain the orbits of a group of objects that includes Sedna.|$|E
500|$|The second {{change was}} a {{redrawing}} of the planetary definition {{in the case}} of a double planet system. [...] There had been a concern that, in extreme cases where a double body had its secondary component in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit,</b> there could have been a drift of the barycenter in and out of the primary body, leading to a shift in the classification of the secondary body between satellite and planet depending on where the system was in its orbit. [...] Thus the definition was reformulated so as to consider a double planet system in existence if its barycenter lay outside both bodies for a majority of the system's orbital period.|$|E
40|$|An {{ephemeris}} {{has been}} obtained for Explorer 28 (IMP 3) which agrees well with 2 years of radio observations and with SAO observations a year later. This ephemeris is generated over the 3 year lifetime by a numerical integration method utilizing {{a set of}} initial conditions at launch and without requiring further differential correction. Because <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> are difficult to compute with acceptable accuracy and because a long continuous arc has been obtained which compares with actual data to a known precision, this ephemeris {{may be used as}} a standard for computing <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> in the earth-moon system. Orbit improvement was used to obtain the initial conditions which generated the ephemeris. This improvement was based on correcting the energy by adjusting the semimajor axis to match computed times of perigee passage with the observed. This procedure may generate errors in semimajor axis to compensate for model errors in the energy; however, this compensation error is also implicit in orbit determination itself...|$|R

500|$|In 2008 Tadashi Mukai and Patryk Sofia Lykawka {{suggested}} that a distant Mars- or Earth-sized minor planet currently in a <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit</b> between 100 and [...] and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20° to 40° {{was responsible for the}} structure of the Kuiper belt. They proposed that the perturbations of this planet excited the eccentricities and inclinations of the trans-Neptunian objects, truncated the planetesimal disk at 48 AU, and detached the orbits of objects like Sedna from Neptune. During Neptune's migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of Neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to the Kozai mechanism leaving the remaining trans-Neptunian objects on stable orbits.|$|E

500|$|Sedna (provisionally {{designated}} [...] ) {{was discovered}} by Michael Brown (Caltech), Chad Trujillo (Gemini Observatory), and David Rabinowitz (Yale University) on 14 November 2003. The discovery formed part of a survey begun in 2001 with the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California using Yale's 160-megapixel Palomar Quest camera. On that day, an object was observed to move by 4.6 arcseconds over 3.1 hours relative to stars, which indicated that its distance was about 100AU. Follow-up observations in November–December 2003 with the SMARTS telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile {{as well as with}} the Tenagra IV telescope at the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea in Hawaii revealed that the object was moving along a distant <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbit.</b> Later, the object was precovered on older images made by the Samuel Oschin telescope as well as on images from the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking consortium.

40|$|Explaining {{the origin}} and {{evolution}} of exoplanetary "hot Jupiters" remains a significant challenge. One possible mechanism for their production is planet-planet interactions, which produces hot Jupiters from planets born far from their host stars but near their dynamical stability limits. In the much more likely case of planets born far from their dynamical stability limits, can hot Jupiters can be formed in star clusters? Our N-body simulations of planetary systems inside star clusters answer this question in the affirmative, and show that hot Jupiter formation is not a rare event. We detail three case studies of the dynamics-induced births of hot Jupiters on <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits</b> that can only occur inside star clusters. The hot Jupiters' orbits bear remarkable similarities to those {{of some of the}} most extreme exoplanets known: HAT-P- 32 b, HAT-P- 2 b, HD 80606 b and GJ 876 d. If stellar perturbations formed these hot Jupiters then our simulations predict that these very hot, inner planets are often accompanied by much more distant gas giants in <b>highly</b> <b>eccentric</b> <b>orbits.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
