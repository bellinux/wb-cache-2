25|$|Screamo arose as a {{distinct}} music genre in 1991, in San Diego, at the Ché Café, including bands such as Heroin and Antioch Arrow. Gravity Records and <b>Ebullition</b> Records released this more chaotic and expressive descendant of emo. The scene is noted for its distinctive fashion sense, inspired by mod culture. As with emo, the term screamo carries some controversy among participants.|$|E
25|$|Sea ice {{serves to}} {{stabilise}} methane deposits on {{and near the}} shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called <b>ebullition),</b> and found that 100–630mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels {{in the water column}} drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the <b>ebullition</b> process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is really important for the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Taal {{remained}} {{quiet for}} 54 years {{except for a}} minor eruption in 1790. Not until March 1808 did another big eruption occur. While this outbreak was not as violent {{as the one in}} 1754, the immediate vicinity was covered with ashes to a depth of [...] It brought great changes in the interior of the crater, according to chroniclers of that time. [...] "Before, the bottom looked very deep and seemed unfathomable, but at the bottom, a liquid mass was seen in continual <b>ebullition.</b> After the eruption, the crater had widened and the pond within it had been reduced to one-third {{and the rest of the}} crater floor was higher and dry enough to walk over it. [...] The height of the crater walls has diminished and near the center of the new crater floor, a little hill that continually emitted smoke. On its sides were several wells, one of which was especially remarkable for its size." ...|$|E
6000|$|Landor, in his {{delightful}} {{book the}} Pentameron--a book {{full of the}} profoundest as well as sweetest humanity--makes Petrarch follow up Boccaccio's eulogies of the episode of Paulo and Francesca with <b>ebullitions</b> of surprise and horror: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He danced {{round the}} room with noisy joy, till Mrs. Gamp made him {{understand}} how very unsuited were such riotous <b>ebullitions</b> to the weak state of his lady-love upstairs. He then gave over, not the dancing but the noise, and went on capering round {{the room with}} suppressed steps, ever and anon singing to himself in a whisper, ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped short, for Andrew, albeit unaccustomed, {{like most}} of his countrymen, {{to give way to}} <b>ebullitions</b> of strong feeling, threw his long arms around his friend and fairly hugged him. He did not, indeed, condescend on a Frenchman's kiss, but he gave him a stage embrace and a squeeze that was worthy of a bear.|$|R
60|$|During this <b>ebullition,</b> Mr St Lys had {{surveyed}} {{the apartment and}} recognised Sybil.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she began}} to laugh. It was a strange, hysterical <b>ebullition</b> of feeling, frankly horrifying. Naida gazed at her with {{distended}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|George {{remained}} {{standing at the}} bedside; but he knew not what to do, or what answer to make to this <b>ebullition</b> of anger.|$|E
60|$|We {{are aware}} that the unthinking part of the {{population}} will meet us here, with the assertion, that dancing on May-day still continues—that ‘greens’ are annually seen to roll along the streets—that youths in the garb of clowns, precede them, giving vent to the <b>ebullitions</b> of their sportive fancies; and that lords and ladies follow in their wake.|$|R
60|$|Somewhat less spiteful in her {{intercourse}} with other scholars, Mliss still retained an offensive attitude {{in regard to}} Clytemnestra. Perhaps the jealous element was not entirely lulled in her passionate little breast. Perhaps it was only that the round curves and plump outline offered more extended pinching surface. But while such <b>ebullitions</b> were under the master's control, her enmity occasionally took a new and irrepressible form.|$|R

60|$|The General {{raised his}} eyebrows. He knew Thomson {{well enough to}} be aware how unusual such an <b>ebullition</b> of feeling on his part was.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little <b>ebullition</b> of feeling, my dear Paul," [...] he explained, [...] "on seeing you. You met Mrs. Bundercombe? You {{have heard}} the news?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is worthy}} of remark, that all the jollity of the Carnival is a genuine <b>ebullition</b> of spirit, {{without the aid of}} wine or strong drink.|$|E
60|$|But loud {{as was the}} laughter, and vehement the cheering, {{with which}} Lucian's {{performances}} were received, all these <b>ebullitions</b> sank into insignificance compared with the reception which greeted what he himself announced {{was to be the}} speech of the night. Having quaffed full many a quaigh of toddy, he insisted on delivering, it on the table, a proposition with which his auditors immediately closed.|$|R
60|$|THE {{destiny of}} nations {{appears to have}} decreed that a society should periodically, though rarely, flourish, characterised by its love of the Fine Arts, and its {{capacity}} of ideal creation. These occasional and brilliant <b>ebullitions</b> of human invention elevate the race of man; they purify and chasten the taste of succeeding generations; and posterity accepts them as the standard of what is choice, and the model of what is excellent.|$|R
500|$|In October 1881 {{there was}} a revolt. Eight church members resigned, signing a {{document}} complaining of Eddy's [...] "frequent <b>ebullitions</b> of temper, love of money, {{and the appearance of}} hypocrisy." [...] Only a few students remained, including Calvin Frye, who became Eddy's most loyal personal assistant. They appointed Eddy pastor of the church in November 1881, and drew up a resolution in February 1882 that she was [...] "the chosen messenger of God to the nations." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to admit the truth of these remarks. After the first <b>ebullition</b> of joy at the meeting was over, we went along the street together.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>ebullition</b> {{of feeling}} {{seemed to have}} {{restored}} Dr. May's calmness, and he rose, saying, [...] "I must go to my work; the man is coming here this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|Soon {{after this}} <b>ebullition,</b> Lady Kirkaldy carried off her nephew, {{and his first}} {{utterance}} outside the door was 'A woman like {{that will be the}} salvation of my uncle.' ...|$|E
60|$|So strange is love, {{that this}} kind of veiled allusion to his secret passion {{relieved}} and gratified the overcharged bosom of Ferdinand. He pursued the subject with enjoyment. Anybody but Glastonbury might have thought that he had lost his senses, he laughed so loud, and talked so fast about a subject which seemed almost nonsensical; but the good Glastonbury ascribed these <b>ebullitions</b> to the wanton spirit of youth, and smiled out of sympathy, though he knew not why, except that his pupil appeared happy.|$|R
60|$|Laugh as he might, Fitzjocelyn {{was much}} {{concerned}} and perplexed by his cousin's ill-humour, {{when it appeared}} more permanent than could be puffed off in a few <b>ebullitions.</b> Attempts to penetrate the gloom made it heavier, and Louis resolved to give it time to subside. He waited some days before going near James, and when he next walked to his college found him engaged with pupils. He was himself very busy, and had missed his cousin several times before he at length found him alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next door}} people had also missed him, and they {{likewise}} greeted his return with extravagant <b>ebullitions</b> of joy. This gave the cat an idea. He {{saw that his}} game was to play the two families off one against the other; which he did. He spent an alternate fortnight with each, and lived like a fighting cock. His return was always greeted with enthusiasm, and every means were adopted to induce him to stay. His little whims were carefully studied, his favourite dishes kept in constant readiness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What, not if I {{give you}} a famous one--like a real one, with a stock and barrel?' said Gilbert, anxious to be freed from the tokens of his <b>ebullition.</b>|$|E
60|$|Robert seized this {{opportunity}} of concluding the interview. Lucy ran up-stairs for the fierce quarter-deck walking that served her instead of tears, as an <b>ebullition</b> that tired down her feelings by exhaustion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{half the}} women in England were as respectable as you," [...] he said, in an <b>ebullition</b> of {{bitterness}} against womankind in general. [...] "It isn't a question of respectability, but one of principle!" ...|$|E
60|$|Our solitary equestrian, however, was {{no sooner}} mounted than {{he put his}} horse to its speed, and never drew in his rein until he reached Hyde Park Corner. The rapid motion accorded with his tumultuous mood. He was soon at home, gave his horse to a servant, for {{he had left his}} groom behind, rushed into his library, tore up a letter of Lady Monteagle's with a demoniac glance, and rang his bell with such force that it broke. His valet, not unused to such <b>ebullitions,</b> {{immediately}} appeared.|$|R
60|$|Not {{even the}} {{influence}} of the softer passion on the young gentlemen--and they all, to a boy, doted on Florence--could restrain them from taking quite a noisy leave of Paul; waving hats after him, pressing downstairs to shake hands with him, crying individually 'Dombey, don't forget me!' and indulging in many such <b>ebullitions</b> of feeling, uncommon among those young Chesterfields. Paul whispered Florence, as she wrapped him up before the door was opened, Did she hear them? Would she ever forget it? Was she glad to know it? And a lively delight was in his eyes as he spoke to her.|$|R
60|$|Sun {{and shower}} alternated like day and night, making the hours longer by their variety. When the showers were heavy, I could feel each drop {{striking}} through my jersey to my warm skin; and {{the accumulation of}} small shocks put me nearly beside myself. I decided I should buy a mackintosh at Noyon. It is nothing to get wet; but the misery of these individual pricks of cold all over my body {{at the same instant}} of time made me flail the water with my paddle like a madman. The Cigarette was greatly amused by these <b>ebullitions.</b> It gave him something else to look at besides clay banks and willows.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Harry and Jacques {{continued}} to pace quietly before the house, waiting patiently {{until the first}} <b>ebullition</b> of feeling at the meeting of Charley {{with his father and}} sister should be over. In a few minutes Charley ran out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{that is an}} {{additional}} reason,' said the duke, quietly, but in his sweetest tone, 'why we should not treat as a light <b>ebullition</b> this first instance of his preferring his own will to that {{of his father and}} mother.' ...|$|E
60|$|The archdeacon {{had been}} {{interrupted}} {{in his speech}} before he had quite finished it; but {{he felt that he}} could not recommence with dignity after this little <b>ebullition,</b> and he led the way back into the garden, followed by his father-in-law.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{did leave}} the sheet, and then, sobbing violently, {{ran out of}} the room up to her own chamber. Mrs. Dosett {{determined}} that she would not follow her. She partly forgave the girl because of her sorrows, partly reminded herself that she was not soft and facile as had been her sister-in-law, Lucy's mother; and then, as she continued her work, she assured herself that {{it would be best to}} let her niece have her cry out upstairs. Lucy's violence had astonished her for a moment, but she had taught herself to think it best to allow such little <b>ebullitions</b> to pass off by themselves.|$|R
60|$|The {{only child}} of her parents who had lived to see a second {{birthday}} was sure to be the centre of solicitude. She had not been spoilt in the usual acceptation of the word, for she had no liberty, fewer indulgences and luxuries than many children, and never was permitted to be naughty; but then she was quite aware that each dainty or each pleasure was granted or withheld from a careful consideration of her welfare, and that nothing came by chance with her. And on her rare <b>ebullitions</b> of self-will, mamma, governess, nurse, nay even papa, were all in sorrowful commotion till their princess {{had been brought to}} a sense of the enormity of her fault.|$|R
6000|$|A light dawned upon me again. But, {{warned by}} {{previous}} <b>ebullitions,</b> I expressed myself {{this time with}} becoming timidity. [...] "Charles," [...] I suggested, [...] "may we not here again have been the slaves of a preconception? We thought Forbes-Gaskell was Colonel Clay--for no better reason than because he wore a wig. We thought Elihu Quackenboss wasn't Colonel Clay--for no better reason than because he didn't wear one. But {{how do we know}} he ever wears wigs? Isn't it possible, after all, that those hints he gave us about make-up, when he was Medhurst the detective, were framed on purpose, so as to mislead and deceive us? And isn't it possible what he said of his methods at the Seamew's island that day was similarly designed in order to hoodwink us?" ...|$|R
