When donors {{expressed}} their {{dissatisfaction with the}} poor performance of the sector, the government initiated another sector reform that, again, aimed at improving service quality, gradually attaining a <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and improving staff skills.

25|$|An {{important}} element of the urban sector reform was that the government refrained from political interference and established tools to objectively and independently monitor the performance of ONEA. In the crucial field of cost recovery, a financial model of ONEA was developed in a participatory manner and applied, allowing the government to assess progress towards <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of ONEA and providing an objective basis for further tariff revision requests. The government then approved requests for tariff increases submitted by the utility and justified by {{the outcome of the}} model’s calculations in a timely fashion, which was crucial to maintain the utility in good financial health. The Government also helped to strengthen the utility by not interfering with investment and staffing decisions and paying its water bills on time.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} years, a great debate about {{accounting}} treatment of urbanization proceeds has arisen. The various interpretations that, {{in the course}} of the last decade, have been proposed on this matter can be ascribed to the behaviour of the Italian Legislator that, from time to time, has inserted or deleted constraints to the use of urbanization proceeds. Moreover, it is known that the accounting treatment of urbanization proceeds may have a great impact on the <b>financial</b> <b>equilibriums</b> of the annual budget of municipalities. The urbanization proceeds are, in fact, not repetitive and highly variable revenues. In this paper, after having briefly analysed the main steps of the normative evolution about accounting treatment of urbanization proceeds, the "point of view" of 106 financial services managers is investigated in order to 1) describe the most common behaviours with reference to some relevant issues that relate the accounting treatment of urbanization proceeds; 2) determine the effects that the accounting treatment of urbanization proceeds may have on financial stability of municipalities (in particular, on the <b>financial</b> <b>equilibriums</b> of the annual budget).

60|$|For {{many years}} {{circumstances}} {{had given to}} finance a lively and commanding place in popular interest. The protracted discussion on the corn law, conducted not only in senate and cabinet, but in country market-places and thronged exchanges, in the farmer's ordinary and at huge gatherings in all the large towns in the kingdom, had agitated every class in the community. The battle between free trade and protection, ending in a revolution of our commercial system, had awakened men to the enormous truth, as {{to which they are}} always so soon ready to relapse into slumber, that budgets are not merely affairs of arithmetic, but in a thousand ways go to the root of the prosperity of individuals, the relations of classes, and the strength of kingdoms. The finance of the whigs in the years after the Reform bill had not only bewildered parliament, but had filled merchants, bankers, shipowners, manufacturers, shopkeepers, and the whole array of general taxpayers with perplexity and dismay. Peel recovered a <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> and restored public confidence, but Peel was gone. The whigs who followed him after 1846 had once more laboured under an unlucky star in this vital sphere of national affairs. They performed the unexampled feat of bringing forward four budgets in a single year, the first of them introduced by Lord John Russell himself as prime minister. By 1851 floundering had reached a climax. Finance had thus discredited one historical party; it had broken up the other. It was finance that overthrew weak governments and hindered the possibility of a strong one.|$|E
6000|$|Besides {{his sense}} of the vital {{importance}} of {{the reconstruction of the}} party system, he had two other high related aims. The commanding position that had first been held in the objects of his activity by the church, then, for a considerable space, by the colonies, was now filled by finance. As he put it {{in a letter to his}} sympathetic brother Robertson: He saw two cardinal subjects for the present moment in public affairs, a rational and pacific foreign policy, and second, the due reduction in our establishments, economy in administration, and finance to correspond. In 1853 he had, as he believed, given financial pledges to the country. These pledges were by the present ministers in danger of being forgotten. They were incompatible with Palmerston's spirit of foreign policy. His duty, then, was to oppose that policy, and to labour as hard as he could for the redemption of his pledges. Yet isolated as he was, he had little power over either one of these aims or the other. The liberal party was determined to support the reigning foreign policy, and this made financial improvement desperate. Of Lord Derby's friends he was not hopeful, but they were not committed to so dangerous a leader.[354] As he put it to Elwin, the editor of the Quarterly: There is a policy going a begging; the general policy that Sir Robert Peel in 1841 took office to support--the policy of peace abroad, of economy, of <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> of steady resistance to abuses, and promotion of practical improvements at home, with a disinclination to questions of reform, gratuitously raised.[355] ...|$|E

50|$|The club hit {{the local}} press for all the wrong reasons early in 1977 with a story that the club was £23,000 in debt and two weeks from bankruptcy. There {{followed}} a drastic re-organisation and effort {{both on and off}} the field which, over several years, restored <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> Unfortunately one of the adjustments was on the playing front. Manager Dennis Hunt left and player Bobby Nash took on the role. He was replaced in April 1978 by Gordon Burden who assumed the player/manager role. Gordon had first played for the club in 1954-55 and he was in his fourth stint as a 'Town' player. On-field performance suffered as a result of the financial tightening and the team endured a run of lowly finishes. The 1978-79 season was a particular low point as the Town scored an all-time record low of 28 league goals from a programme of 40 matches. Overall in all competitions the team scored 35 goals in their total of 46 matches. Dave Clay top-scored with 8 goals and Peter McRobert next highest with 7. Over the next twenty years Peter would go on to make a club record 765 appearances for the 'Nuts and Bolts'.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{refers to}} {{traditional}} methods of appreciating the <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of the agricultural company, methods based {{on the study of}} the company’s financial statements. As far as <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is concerned, we consider that there’s no specific indicator to be analyzed in order to appreciate <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> due to different perception the stakeholders have on the enterprise equilibrium. In real life we often see the same indicator calculated differently according to the objective pursued by the analyst. This paper shows the calculation method of the static <b>financial</b> <b>equilibrium</b> indicators, the evolution and the factors leading to the alteration of these indicators, their financial management.
