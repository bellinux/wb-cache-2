5000|$|Domoganâ€™s {{first term}} {{was marked by}} the start of the Herculean task of rehabilitating the city after the July 16, 1990 {{earthquake}} in cooperation with then Congressman Bernardo Vergara, the other city officials, city residents, and national leadership. Massive reconstructions of the city roads, buildings and other infrastructures continued during his second and third terms. These included the modernization of Marcos Hi-way, the Baguio-Tuba-Itogon-Sablan-La Trinidad (BLIST) circumferential road, and Naguilian Road, the repair, rerouting, <b>declogging</b> and construction of the drainage system of the City Camp Lagoon, among others. In addition, Mayor Domogan orchestrated the twin drive of cleaning and greening the city, making it the [...] "Cleanest and Greenest Highly Urbanized City" [...] in the country for three consecutive years, elevating the city to the Hall of Fame Award category with a total monetary award of 5 million pesos, which was used to purchase garbage trucks. Moreover, Mayor Domogan was able to lead the city in garnering the highest award that the national government could bestow to a local government unit, namely, the GAWAD PAMANA NG LAHI AWARD for two consecutive years, thereby elevating the city, once again, to the Hall of Fame Award category ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{development}} of a three-dimensional, three-phase, multicomponent numerical model to analyse the microbial transport and fluid flow phenomena in a microbe-flooded reservoir is presented. The multiphase flow equations are solved in multi cases and in three-dimensional frameworks following the implicit pressure explicit saturation (IMPES) procedure in which {{the solution of the}} bacteria transport equations is solved implicitly whereas the nutrient transport equation is solved explicitly. The MEOR model was incorporated into an existing chemical flooding simulator (UTCHEM). The simulation results showed that the sharp increase of pressure after the microbial flooding is caused by pore plugging and the production of biogenic gas. As the time increased and water flooding continued, the permeability recovered slightly with the <b>declogging</b> of microbes in the pore space, resulting in a decrease in pressure drop...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} colloid transport in the unsaturated fractured zone {{by means}} of three-dimensional site-scale numerical model under present-day climate infiltration, considering varying colloid diameters, kinetic <b>declogging,</b> and filtration. The radionuclide transport model was used to simulate continuous release of colloids into fractures throughout the proposed repository, in which any components of engineered barrier system such as waste package or drip shield were not considered. {{the results of the}} study indicate the importance of subsurface geology and site hydrology, i. e., the presence of faults (they dominate and control transport), fractures (the main migration pathways), and the relative distribution of zeolitic and vitric tuffs. The simulations indicate that (1) colloid transport is not significantly affected by varying the filtration parameters, (2) travel time to the water table decreases with the colloid size, (3) larger colloids show little retardation whereas very small ones are retarded significantly, and (4) fracture filtration can have an impact on transport. Because of uncertainties in the fundamentals of colloid transport and an extremely conservative approach (based on an improbably adverse worst-case scenario), caution should be exercised in the analysis and interpretation of the 3 -D simulation results. The results discussed here should be viewed as an attempt to identify and evaluate the mechanisms, processes, and geological features that control colloidal transport...|$|E

40|$|The Yucca Mountain {{site has}} a dry climate and deep water table, with the {{repository}} {{located in the}} middle of an unsaturated zone approximately 600 m thick. Radionuclide transport processes from the repository to the water table are sensitive to the unsaturated zone flow field, as well as to sorption, matrix diffusion, radioactive decay, and colloid transport mechanisms. The unsaturated zone flow and transport models are calibrated against both physical and chemical data, including pneumatic pressure, liquid saturation, water potential, temperature, chloride, and calcite. The transport model predictions are further compared with testing specific to unsaturated zone transport: at Alcove 1 in the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), at Alcove 8 and Niche 3 of the ESF, and at the Busted Butte site. The models are applied to predict the breakthroughs at the water table for nonsorbing and sorbing radionuclides, with faults shown as the important paths for radionuclide transport. Daughter products of some important radionuclides, such as {sup 239 }Pu and {sup 241 }Am, have faster transport than the parents and must be considered in the unsaturated zone transport model. Colloid transport is significantly affected by colloid size, but only negligibly affected by lunetic <b>declogging</b> (reverse filtering) mechanisms. Unsaturated zone model uncertainties are discussed, including the sensitivity of breakthrough to the active fracture model parameter, as an example of uncertainties related to detailed flow characteristics and fracture-matrix interaction. It is expected that additional benefits from the unsaturated zone barrier for transport can be achieved by full implementation of the shadow zone concept immediately below the radionuclide release points in the waste emplacement drifts...|$|E
