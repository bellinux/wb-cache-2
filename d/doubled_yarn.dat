Since the woolen fiber very quickly gets the temperature for breaking up the hydrogen bridges and the steam for hydrolysing the cystine bridges, a relatively quick twist modification is possible which roughly corresponds {{to the values of}} an autoclave moderated yarn; however, the steaming quality of the Steamatic steaming process is much better with reference to the evenness of moisture absorption.|$|E
50|$|Preparing {{the fiber}} was an {{extensive}} process that involved cleaning and teasing the fiber, spinning the yarn and plying it, dyeing the coloured yarns, and lastly weaving. Creating the yarn {{was done with}} a shank which is usually 2-3 ft. long and holds the stone or preferably whalebone whorl. The spindle is rotated by striking the lower side of the whorl with the right hand, while {{the upper end of}} the shank is held between the thumb and forefinger of the other hand, and the lower end rests on the ground. Using the spindle the two strands of yarn are twisted round each other into a single thread. Goat hair was always spun “s” meaning that the whorl would be turned counterclockwise in spinning. As goat hair was always made into two-ply yarn, the <b>doubled</b> <b>yarn</b> would have been spun by attaching two lengths of single -ply “s” spun yarn and then turning the whorl clockwise in a “l” twist.|$|E
5000|$|Doubling of yarn {{where two}} or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many {{purposes}} where <b>doubled</b> <b>yarn</b> is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of theses threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a doubling winding machine, and {{two or more}} of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when yarns pass over guides or other surfaces. The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with <b>doubled</b> <b>yarn</b> in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} guide surface and blocked twist builds up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the guide surface. In the second mechanism blocking torque is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn surface and the guide surface or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of yarn to guide. The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a singles yarn (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces. The main circumstances under which these different mechanisms may operate, have been identified and suggestions made for minimising the blockage of twist...|$|E

50|$|While {{this method}} {{works very well}} with plied yarns, singles don't have bumps to count. One way to {{determine}} the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then {{count the number of}} times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two paper-clips into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the single to ply against itself: the resulting two ply yarn is about half the number of twists per inch of the single.

Drawing Spandex to be a core yarn of covered yarn into the hollow spindles is so complicated that its automation is especially hoped. So we developed an auto drawing-in apparatus that could draw Spandex in both upper and lower hollow spindles simultaneously. Results obtained are as follows : (1) The auto drawing-in apparatus comprises both an injector and an ejector. Spandex was drawn into the lower spindle by the injection flow driven by the injector and was drawn from the upper spindle by the suction flow driven by the ejector. (2) Drawing-in was performed for a model covering machine by the developed auto-doffing apparatus. It could draw-in 20 D Spandex that was widely used and was too thin to be easily drawn-in even by a manual doffing operation.

Effective factors and techniques are suggested to maintain uniform flow of liquor.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the Intersecting Gill Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for <b>double</b> knitting <b>yarn,</b> the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with <b>double</b> plied <b>yarn</b> had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{examination}} of weft-faced compound non-silk fabrics found in Egypt (ca. 3 rd - 7 th century A. D.), in the Royal Ontario Museum collections, revealed many structural differences and similarities. Single, <b>double</b> and ply <b>yarns</b> with apparent variation {{in size and}} set density were observed. Some have their twist in 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 direction, others in 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 2 direction, with diverse amount of twist. Wool yarns make {{up the majority of}} the constructions, but in many cases wool yarns alternate with cotton and sometimes linen yarns. Tabby and 1 / 2 twill weaves are employed as binding weaves, while the compound weave structures comprise 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ratios of inner-warp to binding-warp ends. These variations provide a very interesting spectrum of textures executed in varying degrees of design complexity. The existence of many variables creates a necessity to seek: a quantitative and systematic methodology, through which identification, classification and interpretation of technical data would be possible. Reconstruction of weaving technologies has been selected as the principal criterion for the research. It requires analysis which must be detailed enough to determine the technological range of variations, and to indicate how and why weavers of different groups of civilization manipulated their weaving techniques. This paper mainly discusses the aspects considered in developing a protocol which records and confirms objectively the structural and technical parameters of the textiles under study. 1. 0. 0. The Objective: Concept and Rational A protocol for reconstructing early weaving technologies should consist of indispensable attributes to impart an integral system, thus elucidating the weaving details and mode of fabrication. It should not be devised for the mere gathering of technical data, but it should enclose a system organizing and employing these data to deal with basic and imperative questions. The data would provide information on what types of material were used; indicate how these materials were assembled in a textile form; and be utilized to explain why materials and processes changed at certain times of history in a certain way, in addition to what can be learned from textiles as to the resources, skills and knowledge of those who made it. Thus, further distinctions of early textiles can be drawn, not only on the basis of elements related to their outer appearance, but also by the indispensable attributes of their inner structures...|$|R
