5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket was soaked by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E

This was criticized by proponents of logical positivism such as Moritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, or Reichenbach.

Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> basic assumptions of Newtonian mechanics are simpler, {{it can only be}} brought into accord with modern experiments by inventing auxiliary hypotheses.

25|$|The {{weakness}} of the Vaishnava origins theory is that it conflates two systems. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Vaishnava Hindus in the eastern region of India worshipped the triad of Balarama, Ekanamsa and Krishna, it does not automatically prove that the Jagannath triad originated from the same. Some medieval texts, for example, present the Jagannath triad as Brahma (Subhadra), Shiva (Balarama) and Vishnu. The historic evidence and current practices suggest that the Jagannath tradition has a strong dedication to the Harihara (fusion Shiva-Vishnu) idea as well as tantric Sri Vidya practices, neither of which reconcile with the Vaishnava origins proposal. Further, in many Jagannath temples {{of central and eastern}} regions of India, the Shiva icons such as the Linga-yoni are reverentially incorporated, a fact that is difficult to explain given the assumed competition between the Shaivism and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of the mitrailleuse's poor performance {{have been the subject}} of some dispute among historians. In Machine Guns: An Illustrated History, J. Willbanks argues that the weapon's ineffectiveness in the Franco-Prussian War resulted in long-standing opposition among European armies to adopting machine gun weapons, particularly in Continental Europe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French Army did not adopt an automatic machine gun until 1897, when they chose the Hotchkiss machine gun, later to be followed by the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun. The French armed forces also adopted another automatic machine gun, the St. Étienne Mle 1907. It has been suggested that the relative slowness displayed by the French services to adopt machine guns was the result of wariness occasioned by the failure of the mitrailleuse. There is some evidence for that suggestion, as the Maxim gun had repeatedly been tested by the French armed services ever since its inception.|$|E

He secured, during the council's second period, 1551–1553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. Melanchthon and Johannes Brenz, with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trento. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than Nuremberg, took with him the Confessio Saxonica. But the refusal to give the Protestants the right to vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.|$|E
25|$|The Commonwealth of Virginia, {{initially}} led by {{efforts of}} Harry Flood Byrd, used the Great Depression {{and access to}} jobs and modern amenities such as indoor plumbing and public schools to help justify the controversial dislodging of the mountain residents. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development of the Park and the Skyline Drive created badly needed jobs for many Virginians during the Great Depression. Nearly 90% of {{the inhabitants of the}} land taken by the government worked the land for a living. Many worked in the apple orchards in the valley and in areas near the eastern slopes. The work to create the National Park and the Skyline Drive began following a terrible drought in 1930 that destroyed the crops of many families in the area who farmed in the mountainous terrain, as well as many of the apple orchards where they worked picking crops. Nevertheless, it remains a fact that they were displaced, often against their will, and even for the very few who managed to stay, their communities were lost.|$|E

25|$|Margaret Bromley is {{identified}} by the heraldic visitation of Staffordshire {{as the daughter of}} Nicholas Lowe of Tymore, Enville, Staffordshire. This Enville connection has been accepted by several authorities since, including successive volumes of The History of Parliament, which name her father as Nicholas Lowe of Enville. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lowes had a long history as landowners in the region and were once the lords of the manor of Enville: it passed to the Grey family in the 15th century when Eleanor Lowe, heir of Humphrey Lowe, married Robert Grey, son of the notorious marcher lord Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn. However, Tymore or Timmor was not at Enville: the Victoria County History locates it rather at Fisherwick, near Lichfield, {{on the other side of}} the county. It was part of the manor of Lichfield, which was held by the Bishop of Lichfield, although leased to the corporation of Lichfield. Parts of Tymore, including the house, some of the land and other rights, were leased for £100 to Michel Lowe and his heirs in October 1581, using the archaic device of fine of lands, by Peter Roos or Ross. Ross had himself purchased Tymore earlier that year for 400 marks.|$|E
25|$|When the Eleventh Dynasty came to power, it was {{necessary}} to subdue the power of the Nomarchs if Egypt was to be reunified under a central government. The first major steps towards that end took place under Amenemhet I. Amenemhet made the city, not the nome, the center of administration, and only the haty-a, or mayor, of the larger cities would be permitted to carry the title of Nomarch. The title of Nomarch continued to be used until the reign of Senusret III, as did the elaborate tombs indicative of their power, after which they suddenly disappear. This has been interpreted several ways. Traditionally, it has been believed that Senusret III took some action to suppress the nomarch families during his reign. Recently, other interpretations have been proposed. Detlef Franke has argued that Senusret II adopted a policy of educating the sons of nomarchs in the capital and appointing them to government posts. In this way, many provincial families may have been bled dry of scions. Also, while the title of Great Overlord of the Nome disappeared, other distinctive titles of the nomarchs remained. During the First Intermediate Period, individuals holding the title of Great Overlord also often held the title of Overseer of Priests. In the late Middle Kingdom, there exist families holding the titles of mayor and overseer of priests as hereditary possessions. Therefore, {{it has been argued that}} the great nomarch families were never subdued, but were simply absorbed into the Pharaonic administration of the country. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> large tombs indicative of nomarchs disappear at the end of the twelfth dynasty, grand royal tombs also disappear soon thereafter due to general instability surrounding the decline of the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
