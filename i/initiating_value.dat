40|$|This thesis {{examines}} consumer <b>initiated</b> <b>value</b> co-creation behaviour in {{the context}} of convergent mobile online services using a Service-Dominant logic (SD logic) theoretical framework. It focuses on non-reciprocal marketing phenomena such as open innovation and user generated content whereby new viable business models are derived and consumer roles and community become essential to the success of business. Attention to customers. roles and personalised experiences in value co-creation has been recognised in the literature (e. g., Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2000; Prahalad, 2004; Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2004). Similarly, in a subsequent iteration of their 2004 version of the foundations of SD logic, Vargo and Lusch (2006) replaced the concept of value co-production with value co-creation and suggested that a value co-creation mindset is essential to underpin the firm-customer value creation relationship. Much of this focus, however, has been limited to firm <b>initiated</b> <b>value</b> co-creation (e. g., B 2 B or B 2 C), while consumer <b>initiated</b> <b>value</b> creation, particularly consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) has received little attention in the SD logic literature. While it is recognised that not every consumer wishes to make the effort to engage extensively in co-creation processes (MacDonald & Uncles, 2009), some consumers may not be satisfied with a standard product, instead they engage in the effort required for personalisation that potentially leads to greater value for themselves, and which may benefit not only the firm, but other consumers as well. Literature suggests that there are consumers who do, and as a result initiate such behaviour and expend effort to engage in co-creation activity (e. g., Gruen, Osmonbekov and Czaplewski, 2006; 2007 MacDonald & Uncles, 2009). In terms of consumers. engagement in value proposition (co-production) and value actualisation (co-creation), SD logic (Vargo & Lusch, 2004, 2008) provides a new lens that enables marketing scholars to transcend existing marketing theory and facilitates marketing practitioners to initiate service centric and value co-creation oriented marketing practices. Although the active role of the consumer is acknowledged in the SD logic oriented literature, we know little about how and why consumers participate in a value co-creation process (Payne, Storbacka, & Frow, 2008). Literature suggests that researchers should focus on areas such as C 2 C interaction (Gummesson 2007; Nicholls 2010) and consumer experience sharing and co-creation (Belk 2009; Prahalad & Ramaswamy 2004). In particular, this thesis seeks to better understand consumer <b>initiated</b> <b>value</b> co-creation, which is aligned with the notion that consumers can be resource integrators (Baron & Harris, 2008) and more. The reason for this focus is that consumers today are more empowered in both online and offline contexts (Füller, Mühlbacher, Matzler, & Jawecki, 2009; Sweeney, 2007). Active consumers take initiatives to engage and co-create solutions with other active actors in the market for their betterment of life (Ballantyne & Varey, 2006; Grönroos & Ravald, 2009). In terms of the organisation of the thesis, this thesis first takes a „zoom-out. (Vargo & Lusch, 2011) approach and develops the Experience Co-Creation (ECo) framework that is aligned with balanced centricity (Gummesson, 2008) and Actor-to-Actor worldview (Vargo & Lusch, 2011). This ECo framework is based on an extended „SD logic friendly lexicon. (Lusch & Vargo, 2006) : value initiation and value initiator, value-in-experience, betterment centricity and betterment outcomes, and experience co-creation contexts derived from five gaps identified from the SD logic literature review. The framework is also designed to accommodate broader marketing phenomena (i. e., both reciprocal and non-reciprocal marketing phenomena). After zooming out and establishing the ECo framework, the thesis takes a zoom-in approach and places attention back on the value co-creation process. Owing to the scope of the current research, this thesis focuses specifically on non-reciprocal <b>value</b> co-creation phenomena <b>initiated</b> by consumers in online communities. Two emergent concepts: User Experience Sharing (UES) and Co-Creative Consumers are proposed grounded in the ECo framework. Together, these two theorised concepts shed light on the following two propositions: (1) User Experience Sharing derives value-in-experience as consumers make initiative efforts to participate in value co-creation, and (2) Co-Creative Consumers are value initiators who perform UES. Three research questions were identified underpinning the scope of this research: RQ 1 : What factors influence consumers to exhibit User Experience Sharing behaviour? RQ 2 : Why do Co-Creative Consumers participate in User Experience Sharing as part of value co-creation behaviour? RQ 3 : What are the characteristics of Co-Creative Consumers? To answer these research questions, two theoretical models were developed: the User Experience Sharing Behaviour Model (UESBM) grounded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour framework, and the Co-Creative Consumer Motivation Model (CCMM) grounded in the Motivation, Opportunity, Ability framework. The models use SD logic consistent constructs and draw upon multiple streams of literature including consumer education, consumer psychology and consumer behaviour, and organisational psychology and organisational behaviour. These constructs include User Experience Sharing with Other Consumers (UESC), User Experience Sharing with Firms (UESF), Enjoyment in Helping Others (EIHO), Consumer Empowerment (EMP), Consumer Competence (COMP), and Intention to Engage in User Experience Sharing (INT), Attitudes toward User Experience Sharing (ATT) and Subjective Norm (SN) in the UESBM, and User Experience Sharing (UES), Consumer Citizenship (CIT), Relating Needs of Self (RELS) and Relating Needs of Others (RELO), Newness (NEW), Mavenism (MAV), Use Innovativeness (UI), Personal Initiative (PIN) and Communality (COMU) in the CCMM. Many of these constructs are relatively new to marketing and require further empirical evidence for support. Two studies were conducted to underpin the corresponding research questions. Study One was conducted to calibrate and re-specify the proposed models. Study Two was a replica study to confirm the proposed models. In Study One, data were collected from a PC DIY online community. In Study Two, a majority of data were collected from Apple product online communities. The data were examined using structural equation modelling and cluster analysis. Considering the nature of the forums, the Study One data is considered to reflect some characteristics of Prosumers and the Study Two data is considered to reflect some characteristics of Innovators. The results drawn from two independent samples (N = 326 and N = 294) provide empirical support for the overall structure theorised in the research models. The results in both models show that Enjoyment in Helping Others and Consumer Competence in the UESBM, and Consumer Citizenship and Relating Needs in CCMM have significant impacts on UES. The consistent results appeared in both Study One and Study Two. The results also support the conceptualisation of Co-Creative Consumers and indicate Co-Creative Consumers are individuals who are able to relate the needs of themselves and others and feel a responsibility to share their valuable personal experiences. In general, the results shed light on "How and why consumers voluntarily participate in the value co-creation process?. The findings provide evidence to conceptualise User Experience Sharing behaviour as well as the Co-Creative Consumer using the lens of SD logic. This research is a pioneering study that incorporates and empirically tests SD logic consistent constructs to examine a particular area of the logic – that is consumer <b>initiated</b> <b>value</b> co-creation behaviour. This thesis also informs practitioners about how to facilitate and understand factors that engage with either firm or consumer initiated online communities...|$|R

Many previous studies looked at consumers' demand, but in this paper we looked at the entire supply chain (from producers to retailers) to examine the mechanism creating the market for sustainable seafood. Using a retrospective case study approach to draw out and understand how the sustainable seafood movement’s ‘theory of change’ has evolved over a series of inductively-defined time periods, we trace the coordination failures inherent in these iterations of the theory of change, and propose an improved theory of change in which new forms of value chain partnerships better align the incentives of retailers, producers, and NGO-led sustainability programs to drive environmental improvements.

Air quality numerical models are very useful tools in forecasting air pollutants transport and spread. Consequently, this paper analyzes the regional concentration of PM 10 (a geographical domain representative of Romania’s territory), by using the numerical air quality forecasting model: WRF-CHEM version 3. 5. The respective model has been applied on a Romania-centered upon geographical area, for both the two months representative of the warm and cold seasons (June and January 2013, respectively), at a spatial resolution of 10 km, with a 24 hours’ anticipation. For the WRF-CHEM chemistry module to be <b>initiated,</b> <b>values</b> of PM 10 emissions were extracted from the TNO (Nederlandse Organisatie voor toegepast natuurwetenschappelijk onderzoek, www. tno. nl) database for 2009.

All these meteorological parameters are very important for air quality simulations, especially wind profiles, which are very important assessment tools since they determine where pollutants are transported, and air-temperature as it may largely influence the speed of chemical reactions in the atmosphere. The vertical diffusion is strongly linked to the height of the mixing layer and influences the exchange between the ground layers and the open troposphere. In order to highlight the quality of the numerical forecasts for PM 10 from the WRF-CHEM model, the results obtained were compared to the measurements obtained through gravimetric methods (average daily values of PM 10).

40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} such as Ringhals 4 have {{undertaken}} major investments in technical improvements {{during the last decade}} to ensure secure operating and to increase efficiency. All activity concerning nuclear processing is performed under heavy regulation and it is therefore desirable to better anticipate how changes in components or new operating guidelines will implicate the overall process. The modern nuclear reactor system operates at a level of complexity where simple math and theoretical models are not capable of performing complete process calculations. Complex numerical schemes have therefore been developed to serve as powerful tools in solving the partial differential equations that describe two-phase flow and heat transfer. One of these numerical schemes is the code TRACE (TRAC/RELAP Advanced Computational Engine) that is used in this project. The objective was to compare results from the theoretical model in TRACE for the condenser system at Ringhals 4 with actual data obtained under normal operating conditions. The main components of the condenser system is composed of condenser-pumps and drain coolers with low pressure pre-heater. The main task of these pumps is to increase the static pressure in the system while the drain cooler with the preheater’s main objective is to raise the temperature. The graphic interface SNAP (Symbolic Nuclear Analysis Package) was used to design the model with constructional drawings and internal documentation as complementary sources. The boundary conditions used are sourced from either local readings, heat- and mass balance or logged values. The analysis was broken down in three different parts with focus initially on the pump system and preheaters. For completeness, the two systems were thereafter assembled to represent the whole condenser system. Satisfactory results have been obtained considering the main objective. Also discovered was that the theoretical model has a great sensitivity with new <b>initiating</b> <b>values</b> for temperature, mass flow as well as when using different pressure conditions. The main reason for this sensitivity is believed {{to be found in the}} HEATER-component, which is used to model the preheaters shell side. This also poses questions concerning how the code handles the condensation in the HEATER-component, where film condensation and forced convection should exist. Further investigation and development are therefore required before the model can be implemented in the context of more complex flow set-ups. Some of the more direct changes that are proposed would be to lowering the valves on the HEATER-component and a complete investigation around the physical conditions for the preheaters is needed to be performed. ...|$|R

The controller employs a tensiometer used as a sensor of SWT to directly control a mechanically actuated hydraulic valve. Six controllers were installed in an orchard to control the irrigation for six rows of plants over 64 days. Each controller controlled the irrigation of one lateral drip line. The drip irrigation system was gravity-fed from a water source placed 7 m above the soil surface. The SWT and the pressure in each lateral line were measured to evaluate the performance of the controllers. All the controllers tested in the field autonomously initiated and terminated the irrigation during the evaluation. Irrigation events were <b>initiated</b> when <b>values</b> close to the set soil-tension values were reached and were terminated at lower soil-tension values. As the SWT in the root zone was maintained close to the setup threshold plus 20 % tolerance for at least 90 % of the evaluation period, the performance of the controllers was considered satisfactory. The proposed controller was shown to be functional and was operated effectively for an SWT range of up to 30 kPa, which is commonly encountered under high-frequency irrigation conditions...|$|R

A value of sigma(u) below this range gave rise to global damage throughout the bonded region before any crack propagation <b>initiated.</b> A <b>value</b> above this range gave rise to a discontinuous process zone, which resulted in failure loads that were strongly dependent on sigma(u). A discontinuous process zone gives rise to mesh dependent results. The CZM parameters used in the predictions were determined from the experimental fracture mechanics specimen test data. When damage initiated, a deviation from the linear load-displacement curve was observed. The value for sigma(u) was determined by identifying the magnitude that gave rise to the experimentally observed deviation. The CZM energy (Gamma(0)) was then obtained by correlating the simulated load-crack length response with corresponding experimental data. The R-curve behaviour seen with increasing crack length was successfully simulated when adhesive plasticity was included in the constitutive model of the adhesive layer. This was also seen to enhance the prediction of the lap shear specimens. Excellent correlation was found between the experimental and predicted joint strengths...|$|R
40|$|A self {{stabilizing}} {{protocol for}} constructing a rooted spanning tree in an arbitrary asyn-chronous network of processors that communicate through sha~ed memory is presented. The processors have unique identifiers but are otherwise identical. The network topology {{is assumed to}} be dynamic, that is, edges can join or leave the computation before it eventually stabilizes. The algorithm is design uses a new paradigm in self stabilization. The idea is to ensure that if the system is not in a legal state (this is a global condition) then a locaJ condition of some node will be violated. Thus the new could rester the algorithm. The algorithm provides an underlying se|f-stabilization mechanism and can serve a ~ a basic building block in the construction of self stabilizing protocols for several other applications such as: mutual-exclusion, snapshot, and reset. The algorithm is memory efficient in that it requires only a linear size memory of words of size log u (the size of an identity) over the entire network. Each processor needs a constant number of words per incident link, thus the storage requirement is in the same order of mag-nitude as the size of the traditionally assumed message buffers size. The adversary may be permitted to <b>initiate</b> the <b>values</b> of the variables to any size. Still, in this case the a~iditional memory used by the algorithm is the amount stated above. Extensions of our algorithm to other models are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gvozdeva, Hemaspaandra, and Slinko (2011) have {{introduced}} three hierarchies for simple games {{in order to}} measure the distance of a given simple game to the class of (roughly) weighted voting games. Their third class C_α consists of all simple games permitting a weighted representation such that each winning coalition has a weight of at least 1 and each losing coalition a weight of at most α. For a given game the minimal possible value of α is called its critical threshold value. We continue the work on the critical threshold <b>value,</b> <b>initiated</b> by Gvozdeva et al., and contribute some new results on the possible values for a given number of voters as well as some general bounds for restricted subclasses of games. A strong relation beween this concept and the cost of stability, i. e. the minimum amount of external payment to ensure stability in a coalitional game, is uncovered.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{mediating}} effects of motivation {{in the relationship}} between human values and service quality. To examine the fundamental relationships among human values, motivation, and service quality, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) with a full mediation model was adopted. The model was designed and subsequently analyzed by utilizing the Partial Least Squares (PLS) procedure on data collected from a survey that yielded 936 usable questionnaires. The survey was sent to all 117 branches of two local commercial banks (CIMB and Maybank) operating in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Both banks ranked the highest in terms of asset size and market capitalization. The mediating role of motivation was examined {{in the relationship between}} four dimensions of human values and bank service quality, whereby human <b>values</b> <b>initiate</b> service quality. The results support the notion that employee motivation fully mediates the relationship between self-enhancement values and service quality in commercial banks. These results demonstrate the unpredictable role of the interaction structures of human values on bank service quality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{real-time}} relation between the evolution of the electrical resistance and the crack width opening in a saturated concrete sample. The splitting (Brazilian) test has been enhanced and adapted so that the monitoring of a single crack opening and the electrical resistance of the specimen are possible. The experimental results showed that the electrical resistance is constant before the peak (when no crack is observed) and decreases only when the peak of load is reached and when a crack is <b>initiated.</b> No threshold <b>value</b> and no delay between the crack opening and the resistance evolution have been observed, even in the case of a breathing crack. The evolution of the electrical conductance has then been modeled by taking into account the (simplified) morphology of the crack and assuming a constant value for the electrolyte conductivity. The model and the experimental conductance through a traversing crack have proved to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|When {{a single}} muscle fiber {{is exposed to}} a {{solution}} with a high potassium concentra-tion, the membrane is immediately depolarized along the whole fiber length, and tension develops rapidly (1). After reaching a peak value, tension is maintained for several seconds, so that the contracture presents a plateau, and then the fiber relaxes spontaneously in an approximately exponential way. Hodgkin and Horowicz (1) have described the relationship that links the depolari-zation of the membrane, caused by the raised potassium concentration, with the tension developed uring the contracture. They {{also found that the}} relaxation rate is dependent on the membrane depolarization. To explain the time course of the con-tracture, they assumed that the membrane depolarization, beyond a certain threshold <b>value,</b> <b>initiated</b> two processes: the first, immediate, responsible for the activation of the contractile material, and the second, delayed, responsible for the relaxation of the fibers. The first process is probably associated with the liberation of calcium ions from elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (9 - 4), and the second process with the disap-pearance of this extra calcium from the myoplasm, presumably by a mechanism o...|$|R
