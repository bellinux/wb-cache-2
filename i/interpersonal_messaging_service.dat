40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the private}} <b>message</b> <b>service</b> {{described}} in [4] we show efficiency improvements of that private <b>message</b> <b>service</b> in the computational setting. Regarding an attacker which may control {{all but one of}} the queried servers we describe a private <b>message</b> <b>service</b> with a total communication complexity of blinded read between client and private <b>message</b> <b>service</b> of n bit upstream and k bit downstream, where n denotes the number of cells in the database and k the size of one cell. Apart from a registration mechanism, the communication complexity between client and service is independent of the number of queried servers. Our improvement of the private <b>message</b> <b>service</b> is not only extremely efficient in terms of communication, but also in terms of computation. Further we describe how to use the <b>message</b> <b>service</b> in case of messages which are addressed using visible implicit addresses. After that we prove that at least parts of messages which are addressed using invisible implicit addresses must be broadcasted. We generalize the <b>message</b> <b>service</b> to operations in ZZN (N ≥ 2) and prove the security of blinded read. ...|$|R
