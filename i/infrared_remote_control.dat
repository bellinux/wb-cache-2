25|$|Photodiodes {{are used}} in {{consumer}} electronics devices such as compact disc players, smoke detectors, and the receivers for <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> devices used to control equipment from televisions to air conditioners.

Either type of photosensor {{may be used for}} light measurement, as in camera light meters, or to respond to light levels, as in switching on street lighting after dark.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a Canadian company, Viewstar, Inc., {{was formed}} by {{engineer}} Paul Hrivnak and started producing a cable TV converter with an <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b> The product was sold through Philips for approximately $190 CAD. At the time the most popular remote control was the Starcom of Jerrold (a division of General Instruments) which used 40-kHz sound to change channels. The Viewstar converter was an immediate success, the millionth converter being sold on March 21, 1985, with 1.6 million sold by 1989.|$|E

The transmitter is responsible for transmitting or broadcasting a connected audio-video device, while the receiver outputs that transmitted audio-video signal to a connected television.

25|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{high-frequency}} electronic ballasts do {{not produce}} visible light flicker, since above about 5kHz, the excited electron state half-life is longer than a half cycle, and light production becomes continuous. Operating frequencies of electronic ballasts are selected to avoid interference with <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls.</b> Poor quality (or failing) electronic ballasts may have insufficient reservoir capacitance or have poor regulation, thereby producing considerable 100/120Hz modulation of the light.|$|R

50|$|Because many {{electrical}} appliances use <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> (IR) <b>controls,</b> {{concurrent use}} of the Apple Remote with other IR remotes may scramble communications and generate interference, preventing stable use. Remotes should be used individually to circumvent the problem.|$|R
25|$|Different {{manufacturers}} of <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use different protocols to transmit the infrared commands. The RC-5 protocol {{that has its}} origins within Philips, uses, for instance, a total of 14 bits for each button press. The bit pattern is modulated onto a carrier frequency that, again, can be different for different manufacturers and standards, {{in the case of}} RC-5, the carrier is 36kHz. Other consumer infrared protocols include the various versions of SIRCS used by Sony, the RC-6 from Philips, the Ruwido R-Step, and the NEC TC101 protocol.|$|R

25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
25|$|Existing <b>infrared</b> <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> {{can be used}} {{to control}} PC {{application}}s. Any application that supports shortcut keys can be <b>controlled</b> via IR <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> from other home devices (TV, VCR, AC). This is widely used with multimedia applications for PC based home theatre systems. For this to work, one needs a device that decodes IR <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> data signals and a PC application that communicates to this device connected to PC. Connection can be made via serial port, USB port or motherboard IrDA connector. Such devices are commercially available but can be homemade using low-cost micro controllers. LIRC (Linux IR <b>Remote</b> <b>control)</b> and WinLIRC (for Windows) are software packages developed for the purpose of controlling PC using TV remote and can be also used for homebrew remote with lesser modification.|$|R
