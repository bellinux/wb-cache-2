40|$|Here, we have {{characterized}} human STIL (SCL/TAL 1 interrupting locus), {{a distant}} {{member of the}} Drosophila Ana 2 and C. elegans SAS- 5 family of centriole duplication factors and a protein, which causes autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) when mutated in patients. We show that depletion of STIL from human cells blocks centriole duplication, whereas overexpression of STIL triggers the near-simultaneous formation of multiple daughter centrioles. A similar phenotype had previously been observed for HsSAS- 6 and the kinase Plk 4, two key regulators of centriole duplication that contribute to cartwheel assembly, a template for centriole formation. In line with these results, we observed a prominent co-localization of STIL and HsSAS- 6 at the cartwheel region. Together with two independent studies (Tang et al., 2011; Vulprecht et al., 2012), our work suggests that STIL cooperates with Plk 4 and HsSAS- 6 in cartwheel formation and thus represents a key centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> in human cells. The observation that excess STIL triggers centriole amplification, a condition {{that is associated with}} genome instability, prompted us to analyse the controls governing STIL cell-cycle regulation in more detail. By fluorescence time-lapse imaging, we revealed a two-step process that results in complete elimination of STIL towards the end of mitosis. First, during nuclear envelope breakdown, Cdk 1 triggers the translocation of STIL from daughter centrioles into the cytoplasm. This event might initiate cartwheel disassembly, as HsSAS- 6, a major cartwheel component, follows a similar trend. The bulk of cytoplasmic STIL is then degraded at the metaphase to anaphase transition by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which involves a KEN box located at the C-terminus of STIL. Interestingly, we found that truncations of STIL that cause MCPH in human patients delete this KEN box, but preserve the overall function of STIL as a centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factor.</b> We readily confirmed that STIL MCPH truncations resist APC/C-mediated degradation, and demonstrated that stabilization of mutant STIL is strong enough to trigger centriole amplification in our cell culture model. Therefore, by analysing STIL cell cycle regulation, we uncovered a provocative link to primary microcephaly. This leads us to propose that centriole amplification, triggered by STIL stabilization, is the underlying cause of MCPH in patients with STIL mutations...|$|E
40|$|Centrioles {{function}} in the assembly of centrosomes and cilia. Structural and numerical centrosome aberrations have long been implicated in cancer, and more recent genetic evidence directly links centrosomal proteins to the etiology of ciliopathies, dwarfism and microcephaly. To better understand these disease connections, {{it will be important}} to elucidate the biogenesis of centrioles as well as the controls that govern centriole duplication during the cell cycle. Moreover, it remains to be fully understood how these organelles organize a variety of dynamic microtubule-based structures in response to different physiological conditions. In proliferating cells, centrosomes are crucial for the assembly of microtubule arrays, including mitotic spindles, whereas in quiescent cells centrioles function as basal bodies in the formation of ciliary axonemes. In this short review, we briefly introduce the key gene products required for centriole duplication. Then we discuss recent findings on the centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> STIL that point to centrosome amplification as a potential root cause for primary microcephaly in humans. We also present recent data on the role of a disease-related centriole-associated protein complex, Cep 164 -TTBK 2, in ciliogenesis...|$|E
40|$|STIL is a {{centriole}} <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> that localizes to the procentriolar cartwheel region, and {{mutations in}} STIL {{are associated with}} autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH). Excess STIL triggers centriole amplification, raising {{the question of how}} STIL levels are regulated.; Using fluorescence time-lapse imaging, we identified a two-step process that culminates in the elimination of STIL at the end of mitosis. First, at nuclear envelope breakdown, Cdk 1 triggers the translocation of STIL from centrosomes to the cytoplasm. Subsequently, the cytoplasmic bulk of STIL is degraded via the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) -proteasome pathway. We identify a C-terminal KEN box as critical for STIL degradation. Remarkably, this KEN box is deleted in MCPH mutants of STIL, rendering STIL resistant to proteasomal degradation and causing centriole amplification.; Our results reveal a role for Cdk 1 in STIL dissociation from centrosomes during early mitosis, with implications for the timing of cartwheel disassembly. Additionally, we propose that centriole amplification triggered by STIL stabilization is the underlying cause of microcephaly in human patients with corresponding STIL mutations...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMicrotubules are {{organized}} by the centrosome, a dynamic organelle that exhibits changes in both size and number during the cell cycle. Here we show that SZY- 20, a putative RNA-binding protein, plays {{a critical role in}} limiting centrosome size in C. elegans. SZY- 20 localizes in part to centrosomes and in its absence centrosomes possess increased levels of centriolar and pericentriolar components including γ-tubulin and the centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> ZYG- 1 and SPD- 2. These enlarged centrosomes possess normal centrioles, nucleate more microtubules, and fail to properly direct a number of microtubule-dependent processes. Depletion of ZYG- 1 restores normal centrosome size and function to szy- 20 mutants, whereas loss of szy- 20 suppresses the centrosome duplication defects in both zyg- 1 and spd- 2 mutants. Our results describe a pathway that determines centrosome size and implicate centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> in this process...|$|R

40|$|In {{dividing}} cells, centrosomes act as {{the primary}} microtubule organising centre to orchestrate mitotic spindle assembly. Bipolar spindle assembly is responsible for accurate segregation of sister chromatids, such that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genome. Changes in centrosome number {{can lead to a}} lack of mitotic fidelity and genome instability. Chromosomes are replicated in a controlled and timely fashion and {{the same is true for}} centrosomes so that cells enter mitosis with two centrosomes. Further to their role in spindle assembly, centrosomes are also important in cell cycle regulation and DNA damage checkpoint signalling. Centrosomes are particularly important in the regulation of neuroepithelial cell division in the developing brain: all known incidences of primary microcephaly are caused by mutations in centrosome or spindle pole proteins. Xenopus laevis Cep 63 is a target of DNA damage kinase, ATM, and it’s important for the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles (Smith et al., 2009). Therefore, Cep 63 is an exciting candidate for maintenance of genome stability. Human Cep 63 has been identified as a centrosome protein (Andersen et al., 2003), but its function was uncharacterised. In this thesis Cep 63 was shown to be a constitutive centrosome protein, which plays a role in the regulation of centriole duplication. Cep 152 was identified as a Cep 63 interacting protein; and Cep 63 and Cep 152 are dependent on each other for their centrosomal localisation. Cep 152 is required for centriole duplication via recruitment of essential <b>duplication</b> <b>factors,</b> Plk 4 and CPAP, to the centrosome (Dzhindzhev et al., 2010 b, Cizmecioglu et al., 2010, Hatch et al., 2010 b). Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which the Cep 63 gene is disrupted show decreased centriole numbers and signs of genome instability. Intriguingly, preliminary analysis of mouse embryos points to a potential link between Cep 63 deficiency and microcephaly. We propose that Cep 63 and Cep 152 function together to ensure correct centrosomal levels of the essential centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> Plk 4 and CPAP...|$|R
40|$|Control of {{centriole}} {{number is}} crucial for genome stability and ciliogenesis. Here, we characterize the role of human STIL, a protein that displays distant sequence similarity to the centriole duplication factors Ana 2 in Drosophila and SAS- 5 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using RNA interference, we show that STIL is required for centriole duplication in human cells. Conversely, overexpression of STIL triggers the near-simultaneous formation of multiple daughter centrioles surrounding each mother, which is highly reminiscent of the phenotype produced by overexpression of the polo-like kinase PLK 4 or the spindle assembly abnormal protein 6 homolog (SAS- 6). We further show, by fluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, that STIL is recruited to nascent daughter centrioles {{at the onset of}} centriole duplication and degraded, in an APC/C(Cdc 20 -Cdh 1) -dependent manner, upon passage through mitosis. We did not detect a stable complex between STIL and SAS- 6, but the two proteins resemble each other with regard to both localization and cell cycle control of expression. Thus, STIL cooperates with SAS- 6 and PLK 4 in the control of centriole number and represents a key centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> in human cells...|$|E
40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} primary microcephaly (MCPH) is characterised by {{a significant}} reduction in prenatal human brain growth, without alteration of cerebral architecture. The genetic aetiology of MCPH is bi-allelic mutations in genes coding for a subset of centrosomal proteins 1 - 10. While at least three of these proteins have been implicated in centrosome duplication 11, the nature of centrosome dysfunction that underlies the neurodevelopmental defect in MCPH is unclear. Here we report a homozygous MCPH-causing mutation in the human CEP 63 gene. CEP 63 forms a complex with another MCPH protein, CEP 152, a conserved centrosome <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> 12 - 15. Together, they are essential for maintaining normal centrosome numbers in cells. Using super-resolution microscopy we find that CEP 63 and CEP 152 co-localise in a discrete ring around the proximal end of the parental centriole, a pattern specifically disrupted in CEP 63 -deficient patient-derived cells. This work suggests that the CEP 152 -CEP 63 ring-like structure ensures normal neurodevelopment and its impairment particularly affects human cerebral cortex growth. Keywords centrosome; mitotic spindle; centrosome duplication; microcephaly; brain We ascertained a consanguineous Pakistani family in which three members had primary microcephaly at birth (head circumference − 4 SD to − 6 SD) and by five years showed mild/ moderate mental retardation (Fig. 1 A and Supplementary Note).

40|$|Abstract—Configuring {{a network}} is a low-level, device-specific task. Many have {{compared}} it to writing a distributed program in assembly language, reserved only for highly experienced network operators. Automation has been proposed by researchers and industry as the solution to problems in network configuration. However, {{there is a certain}} amount of resistance from the operator community against automation. On the one hand, operators do desire a way for network-wide configuration. On the other hand, they still like to have access and control to details, to ensure flexibility and for debugging. In this paper, we attempt to answer the question “How should we automate network configuration” by studying where the complexity lies in network configuration. With an operational perspective, using data from three different types of production networks, we analyze the configuration files from these networks over the span of up to two years. Our analysis shows that the majority of changes to these files are a few lines each and made frequently. We found that routing, especially its policies, constitute a significant portion of the configuration files, as well as modifications to them. We then present complexity models to measure network-wide risk, impact and duplication of routing policies in network configuration. We show that risk and impact tend to grow over time, and the <b>duplication</b> <b>factor</b> is high. Based on the results of our analysis, we propose ways to automate the complex parts of network configuration. I...|$|E
40|$|Centrioles are symmetrical, barrel-shaped, microtubule-based structures, {{that serve}} as {{building}} platforms {{for the formation of}} centrosomes and cilia. In dividing cells, they recruit a matrix of proteins called pericentriolar material (PCM) to form the centrosome, the major microtubule-organizing centre in animal cells. In differentiating cells, centrioles also function as basal bodies for the formation of flagella and cilia. To ensure the proper segregation of centrioles during cell division, centriole duplication is tightly controlled and coordinated with the cell cycle. To date, several factors have been identified in human cells that are recruited in a consecutive fashion to nascent centrioles to template the outgrowth of one procentriole orthogonally to the pre-existing one during each cell cycle. In addition to structural components, these <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> include the kinase Plk 4 (polo-like kinase 4), which is pivotal for the initiation of centriole duplication. Here, we have taken two approaches to investigate centrosomes in more detail: first, the human centrosomal proteins Cep 192 and Cep 152 were functionally characterized; second, the localization of key centrosomal and centriolar components was analyzed using super-resolution three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3 D-SIM). 1. 	Previously, Cep 192 and Cep 152 had been identified as novel centrosomal proteins in a proteomic screen. Homologues of Cep 152 in flies and zebrafish had been implicated in PCM recruitment and centrosome duplication, but Cep 152 had not been investigated in humans. Likewise, the worm homologue of Cep 192 also functions in PCM recruitment and centrosome duplication. However, in humans its role in centriole duplication remained controversial. Here, we have established that Cep 152 is dispensable, whereas Cep 192 is essential for PCM recruitment in mitotic cells. This functional difference is further illustrated by their differential subcellular localizations during interphase and mitosis. The stable centrosomal integration of Cep 152 depended on Cep 192, whereas Cep 192 localized independently of Cep 152. Furthermore, both Cep 152 and Cep 192 were required for proper centriole duplication, thereby clarifying the controversy about the implication of Cep 192 in this process. We also show that Cep 192 and Cep 152 co-operate in the centriolar recruitment of the kinase Plk 4. Concomitantly, centriole duplication was only inhibited to a similar extent as in Plk 4 - or Sas- 6 -depleted cells, if both Cep 152 and Cep 192 were depleted. In agreement, we have identified and characterized interactions of Plk 4 with the N termini of both Cep 152 and Cep 192. Finally, not only the recruitment of Plk 4, but also of other <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> such as CPAP and Sas- 6 was impaired in Cep 152 - and/ or Cep 192 -depleted cells. We have also addressed the regulation of Cep 152 and Cep 192. Centrosomal levels of both proteins increased towards mitosis. Similarly, cytoplasmic Cep 152 levels peaked when cells approached mitosis, whereas Cep 192 levels were stable. Hence, we show that both Cep 152 and Cep 192 function as centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors.</b> Both proteins exert a partly redundant function and their co-operation orchestrates recruitment of Plk 4 as well as other centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> and thus canonical centriole duplication. 2. 	Using 3 D-SIM we have analysed the spatial relationship of 18 centriole and PCM components of human centrosomes at different cell cycle stages. During mitosis, PCM proteins formed extended networks with interspersed gamma-Tubulin. In interphase, most proteins were arranged at specific and defined distances from the walls of centrioles, resulting in ring-like staining. Additionally, orientation of Cep 152 with its C-terminus close to centriole walls and its N-terminus facing outwards was visualised using site-specific antibodies against either terminus of the protein. At the distal end of centrioles, appendage proteins formed rings with several density masses, usually with a multiplicity below that expected from the 9 -fold symmetry of centrioles. Although Cep 164 remained centriolar throughout the cell cycle, the number of discernible density masses was clearly reduced during mitosis. At the proximal end, Sas- 6 formed a dot at the site of daughter centriole formation, consistent with its role in cartwheel formation. Plk 4 and STIL co-localized with Sas- 6, but the bulk of the cartwheel protein Cep 135 was associated with mother centrioles. Remarkably, Plk 4 formed a dot {{on the surface of the}} mother centriole even before Sas- 6 staining became detectable, indicating that Plk 4 constitutes an early marker for the site of nascent centriole formation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} a conserved "core" of proteins that are required for centriole duplication. A small number of additional proteins have recently been identified as potential <b>duplication</b> <b>factors,</b> but {{it is unclear whether}} any of these proteins are components of the core duplication machinery. In this study, we investigate the function of one of these proteins, Drosophila melanogaster Ana 3. We show that Ana 3 is present in centrioles and basal bodies, but its behavior is distinct from that of the core duplication proteins. Most importantly, we find that Ana 3 is required for the structural integrity of both centrioles and basal bodies and for centriole cohesion, but it is not essential for centriole duplication. We show that Ana 3 has a mammalian homologue, Rotatin, that also localizes to centrioles and basal bodies and appears to be essential for cilia function. Thus, Ana 3 defines a conserved family of centriolar proteins and plays an important part in ensuring the structural integrity of centrioles and basal bodies...|$|R
40|$|Centrosomes {{consist of}} two centrioles {{embedded}} in pericentriolar material and {{function as the}} main microtubule organising centres in dividing animal cells. They ensure proper formation and orientation of the mitotic spindle and are therefore essential {{for the maintenance of}} genome stability. Centrosome function is crucial during embryonic development, highlighted by the discovery of mutations in genes encoding centrosome or spindle pole proteins that cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly, including Cep 63 and Cep 152. In this study we show that Cep 63 functions to ensure that centriole duplication occurs reliably in dividing mammalian cells. We show that the interaction between Cep 63 and Cep 152 can occur independently of centrosome localisation and that the two proteins are dependent on one another for centrosomal localisation. Further, both mouse and human Cep 63 and Cep 152 cooperate to ensure efficient centriole duplication by promoting the accumulation of essential centriole <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> upstream of SAS- 6 recruitment and procentriole formation. These observations describe the requirement for Cep 63 in maintaining centriole number in dividing mammalian cells and further establish the order of events in centriole formation...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePericentriolar {{material}} (PCM) recruitment to centrioles forms a key step in centrosome biogenesis. Deregulation of {{this process}} leads to centrosome aberrations causing disorders, {{one of which is}} autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder where brain size is reduced. During PCM recruitment, the conserved centrosomal protein Sas- 4 /CPAP/MCPH 6, known {{to play a role in}} centriole formation, acts as a scaffold for cytoplasmic PCM complexes to bind and then tethers them to centrioles to form functional centrosomes. To understand Sas- 4 's tethering role, we determined the crystal structure of its T complex protein 10 (TCP) domain displaying a solvent-exposed single-layer of β-sheets fold. This unique feature of the TCP domain suggests that it could provide an "extended surface-like" platform to tether the Sas- 4 -PCM scaffold to a centriole. Functional studies in Drosophila, human cells, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells were used to test this hypothesis, where point mutations within the 9 - 10 th β-strands (β 9 - 10 mutants including a MCPH-associated mutation) perturbed PCM tethering while allowing Sas- 4 /CPAP to scaffold cytoplasmic PCM complexes. Specifically, the Sas- 4 β 9 - 10 mutants displayed perturbed interactions with Ana 2, a centrosome <b>duplication</b> <b>factor,</b> and Bld- 10, a centriole microtubule-binding protein, suggesting a role for the β 9 - 10 surface in mediating protein-protein interactions for efficient Sas- 4 -PCM scaffold centriole tethering. Hence, we provide possible insights into how centrosomal protein defects result in human MCPH and how Sas- 4 proteins act as a vehicle to tether PCM complexes to centrioles independent of its well-known role in centriole duplication...|$|E

Strikingly, all three fly proteins can induce the de novo formation of centriole-like structures when overexpressed in unfertilized eggs.

Asl is now known to be essential for centriole duplication in flies, but no equivalent protein has been found in worms.

Two barrel-shaped structures called centrioles function as the <b>duplication</b> <b>factors</b> for centrosomes. Mutations in important centriole structural proteins can cause either down-regulation or amplification of centriole duplication.

In this study, we identified changes in total cellular levels of Ana 2 by arresting S 2 Drosophila cells in different phases of the cell cycle and immunoblotting for Ana 2.

Endogenous Ana 2 levels were highest in G 2, consistent with centriole maturation during this phase of the cell cycle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background All extant {{seed plants}} are {{successful}} paleopolyploids, whose genomes carry duplicate genes that have survived repeated episodes of diploidization. However, {{the survival of}} gene duplicates is biased with respect to gene function and mechanism of <b>duplication.</b> Transcription <b>factors,</b> in particular, are reported to be preferentially retained following whole-genome duplications (WGDs), but disproportionately lost when duplicated by tandem events. An explanation for this pattern {{is provided by the}} Gene Balance Hypothesis (GBH), which posits that duplicates of highly connected genes are retained following WGDs to maintain optimal stoichiometry among gene products; but such connected gene duplicates are disfavored following tandem duplications. Results We used genomic data from 25 taxonomically diverse plant species to investigate the roles of duplication mechanism, gene function, and age of duplication in the retention of duplicate genes. Enrichment analyses were conducted to identify Gene Ontology (GO) functional categories that were overrepresented in either WGD or tandem duplications, or across ranges of divergence times. Tandem paralogs were much younger, on average, than WGD paralogs and the most frequently overrepresented GO categories were not shared between tandem and WGD paralogs. Transcription factors were overrepresented among ancient paralogs regardless of mechanism of origin or presence of a WGD. Also, in many cases, there was no bias toward transcription factor retention following recent WGDs. Conclusions Both the fixation and the retention of duplicated genes in plant genomes are context-dependent events. The strong bias toward ancient transcription factor duplicates can be reconciled with the GBH if selection for optimal stoichiometry among gene products is strongest following the earliest polyploidization events and becomes increasingly relaxed as gene families expand...|$|R

40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, the kinase ZYG- 1 is {{required}} for centrosome <b>duplication.</b> To identify <b>factors</b> that interact with ZYG- 1, we used a classical genetic approach and identified 21 szy (suppressor of zyg- 1) genes that when mutated restore partial viability to a zyg- 1 mutant. None of the suppressors render animals completely independent of zyg- 1 activity and analysis of {{a subset of the}} suppressors indicates that all restore the normal process of centrosome duplication to zyg- 1 mutants. Thirteen of these suppressor mutations confer phenotypes of their own and cytological examination reveals that these genes function in a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle timing, microtubule organization, cytokinesis, chromosome segregation, and centrosome morphology. Interestingly, several of the szy genes play a role in attaching the centrosome to the nuclear envelope. We have found that one such szy gene is sun- 1, a gene encoding a nuclear envelope component. We further show that the role of SUN- 1 in centrosome duplication is distinct from its role in attachment. Our approach has thus identified numerous candidate regulators of centrosome duplication and uncovered an unanticipated regulatory mechanism involving factors that tether the centrosome to the nucleus...|$|R
40|$|Many {{natural and}} {{artificial}} networks contain overrepresented subgraphs, {{which have been}} termed network motifs. In this article, we investigate the processes {{that led to the}} formation of the two most common network motifs in eukaryote transcription factor networks: the bi-fan motif and the feed-forward loop. Around 100 million y ago, the common ancestor of the Saccharomyces clade underwent a whole-genome duplication event. The simultaneous duplication of the genes created by this event enabled the origin of many network motifs to be established. The data suggest that there are two primary mechanisms that are involved in motif formation. The first mechanism, enabled by the substantial plasticity in promoter regions, is rewiring of connections as a result of positive environmental selection. The second is <b>duplication</b> of transcription <b>factors,</b> which is also shown to be involved in the formation of intermediatescale network modularity. These two evolutionary processes are complementary, with the pre-existence of network motifs enabling duplicated transcription factors to bind different targets despite structural constraints on their DNAbinding specificities. This process may facilitate the creation of novel expression states and the increases in regulatory complexity associated with higher eukaryotes.

40|$|Abstract—ETS domain {{transcription}} {{factors have}} been linked to hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis. However, their biological functions and the mechanisms of action, remain incompletely understood. Here, we have performed a systematic analysis of zebrafish ETS domain genes and identified 31 in the genome. Detailed gene expression profiling revealed that 12 of them are expressed in blood and endothelial precursors during embryonic development. Combined with a phylogenetic tree assay, this suggests that some of the coexpressed genes may have redundant or additive functions in these cells. Loss-of-function analysis of 3 of them, erg, fli 1, and etsrp, demonstrated that erg and fli 1 act cooperatively and are required for angiogenesis possibly via direct regulation of an endothelial cell junction molecule, VE-cadherin, whereas etsrp is essential for primitive myeloid/endothelial progenitors (hemangio-blasts) in zebrafish. Taken together, these results provide a global view of the ETS genes in the zebrafish genome during embryogenesis and provide new insights on the functions and biology of erg, fli 1, and etsrp, which could be applicable to higher vertebrates, including mice and humans.

40|$|In this thesis, {{increased}} vertebrate genome {{sampling and}} recent methodological advancements were combined to address three distinct questions pertaining to vertebrate molecular evolution. Gene duplicability is {{the tendency to}} retain multiple gene copies after a <b>duplication</b> event. Various <b>factors</b> correlate with gene duplicability, such as protein function and timing of expression during development. The position of a gene’s encoded product in the protein-protein interaction network recently emerged as an additional factor determining gene duplicability. The first investigation described in this thesis coupled comparative genomics with protein-protein interaction data to assess the dynamic relationship between gene duplicability and network structure in primates. Deciphering {{the timing of the}} Ursidae (bear) phylogeny speciation events {{has proven to be a}} challenging task. A valuable node to calibrate in such studies is that separating giant panda and polar bear. The exact timing of this important calibration node is currently disputed. The second investigation described in this thesis applied the largest amount of nuclear data currently available in a Bayesian framework to attempt to accurately estimate the timing of divergence between the giant panda and polar bear. It is known that synonymous codon usage is governed by a combination of selective and neutral processes. Currently, it is thought that primarily neutral processes govern synonymous codon usage in vertebrates, possibly due to their lower long-term effective population sizes. The third investigation described in this thesis combined increased genomic sampling and a novel codon usage bias index to conduct the first systematic investigation into the forces that govern synonymous codon usage in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} chromosomal imbalances by whole-genome microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) in DNA samples of children in which karyotype results cannot be obtained. The present paper describes the first Albanian experience of an array CGH application. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The cohort included seven children with developmental delay or intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism and congenital anomalies according to clinical criteria, suggestive of chromosomal anomalies. The age range was from newborn to five years old. The cytogenetic analysis determined by a standard method of G-banding according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN 2005) was performed for all our patients, while array CGH was performed on genomic DNA isolated from the blood of 7 cases. RESULTS: Among the seven patients analysed with array CGH, three patients resulted in duplication and one deletion, one patient with a microdeletion and three patients with duplication. Array CGH facilitated the recognition of submicroscopic deletions and <b>duplications</b> as risk <b>factors</b> for genetic diagnosis in all our patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our case series with congenital chromosomal anomalies confirms the high diagnostic value of the method, as suggested by previous studies. The technique must be available also in less developed countries, to significantly improve the genetic diagnosis of paediatric patients with developmental delay or intellectual disability, congenital anomalies and dysmorphic features. The identification of chromosomal abnormalities in these patients and the genetic counselling will provide family members with an explanation for their child’s developmental disability or birth defect, allowing better information about recurrence risks, and permit the anticipation of certain medical problems that require intervention...|$|R
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SBF (Swi 4 –Swi 6 cell cycle box binding factor) and MBF (MluI binding factor) {{are the major}} {{transcription}} factors regulating the START of the cell cycle, a time just before DNA replication, bud growth initiation, and spindle pole body (SPB) <b>duplication.</b> These two <b>factors</b> bind to the promoters of 235 genes, but bind {{less than a quarter}} of the promoters upstream of genes with peak transcript levels at the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Several functional categories, which are known to be crucial for G 1 /S events, such as SPB duplication/migration and DNA synthesis, are under-represented in the list of SBF and MBF gene targets. SBF binds the promoters of several other transcription factors, including HCM 1, PLM 2, POG 1, TOS 4, TOS 8, TYE 7, YAP 5, YHP 1, and YOX 1. Here, we demonstrate that these factors are targets of SBF using an independent assay. To further elucidate the transcriptional circuitry that regulates the G 1 -to-S-phase progression, these factors were epitope-tagged and their binding targets were identified by chIp–chip analysis. These factors bind the promoters of genes with roles in G 1 /S events including DNA replication, bud growth, and spindle pole complex formation, as well as the general activities of mitochondrial function, transcription, and protein synthesis. Although functional overlap exists between these factors and MBF and SBF, each of these factors has distinct functional roles. Most of these factors bind the promoters of other transcription factors known to be cell cycle regulated or known to be important for cell cycle progression and differentiation processes indicating that a complex network of transcription factors coordinates the diverse activities that initiate a new cell cycle...|$|R
40|$|ContextIn 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{completed}} {{migration of}} all 59 surveillance project areas (PAs) from the case-based HIV/AIDS Reporting System to the document-based Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System. ObjectivesWe conducted a PA-level assessment of Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System process and outcome standards for HIV infection cases. DesignProcess standards {{were reported by}} PAs and outcome standards were calculated using standardized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention SAS code. SettingA total of 59 PAs including 50 US states, the District of Columbia, 6 separately funded cities (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles County, New York City, Philadelphia, and San Francisco), and 2 territories (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands). ParticipantsCases diagnosed or reported to the PA surveillance system between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011, using data collected through December 2012. Main Outcome MeasuresProcess standards for death ascertainment and intra- and interstate case de-duplication; outcome standards for completeness and timeliness of case reporting, data quality, intrastate <b>duplication</b> rate, risk <b>factor</b> ascertainment, and completeness of initial CD 4 and viral load reporting. ResultsFifty-five of 59 PAs (93 %) reported linking cases to state vital records death certificates during 2012, 76 % to the Social Security Death Master File, and 59 % to the National Death Index. Seventy percent completed monthly intrastate, and 63 % completed semiannual interstate de-duplication. Eighty-three percent met the 85 % or more case ascertainment standard, and 92 % met the 66 % or more timeliness standard; 75 % met the 97 % or more data quality standard; all PAs met the 5 % or less intrastate duplication rate; 41 % met the 85 % or more risk factor ascertainment standard; 90 % met the 50 % or more standard for initial CD 4; and 93 % met the same standard for viral load reporting. Overall, 7 % of PAs met all 11 process and outcome standards. ConclusionsFindings support the need for continued improvement in HIV surveillance activities and monitoring of system outcomes.
