Using the UK Biobank data, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and hearing aid usage on visuospatial memory function. This selection of variables resulted in a sub-sample of 138 098 participants after discarding extreme values. A digit triplets functional hearing test was used to divide the participants into three groups: poor, insufficient and normal hearers. We found negative relationships between <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and both visuospatial working memory (i. e., a card pair matching task) and visuospatial, episodic long-term memory (i. e., a prospective memory task), with the strongest association for episodic long-term memory. The use of hearing aids showed a small positive effect for working memory performance for the poor hearers, but did not have any influence on episodic long-term memory. Age also showed strong main effects for both memory tasks and interacted with gender and education for the long-term memory task. Broader theoretical implications based on a memory systems approach will be discussed and compared to theoretical alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Simulated hearing loss, {{spurious}} auditory responses, <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> or exaggerated auditory threshold levels or malingering is {{a common}} clinical terminology amongst audiologists who deal with occupationally noise exposed individuals. Malingering or spurious responses tend to pose a great challenge to the profession of audiology hence this paper tries to examine the array of battery of audiological techniques that may be applicable for diagnostic purposes particularly in developing countries where there is an acute dearth of sophisticated, objective tools for prompt detection of such responses. Apart from the review of antiquated 'subjective' but clinically potent audiological tests, this paper also attempts to examine the sociopsychologic characteristics such as individual background, introvertiveextrovertive behaviour, psychosomatic traits, intelligence level and possible tone test sophistication {{on a part of}} a hearing loss simulator as major relative factors for malingering outside financial inducement.

40|$|In the {{assessment}} of human hearing, it is often important to determine whether hearing loss is organic or nonorganic in nature. Nonorganic, or <b>functional,</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{is often associated with}} deceptive intention {{on the part of the}} listener. Over the past decade, functional neuroimaging has been used to study the neural correlates of deception, and studies have consistently highlighted the contribution of the prefrontal cortex in such behaviors. Can patterns of brain activity be similarly used to detect when an individual is feigning a hearing loss? To answer this question, 15 adult participants were requested to respond to pure tones and simple words correctly, incorrectly, randomly, or with the intent to feign a hearing loss. As predicted, more activity was observed in the prefrontal cortices (as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging), and delayed behavioral reaction times were noted, when the participants feigned a hearing loss or responded randomly versus when they responded correctly or incorrectly. The results suggest that cortical imaging techniques could play a role in identifying individuals who are feigning hearing loss. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|A <b>functional</b> {{simulation}} of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was evaluated {{in its ability}} to reproduce the temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) for nine listeners with mild to profound sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Each <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was simulated in a group of three age-matched normal-hearing listeners through spectrally shaped masking noise or a combination of masking noise and multiband expansion. TMTFs were measured for both groups of listeners using a broadband noise carrier as a function of modulation rate in the range 2 to 1024 Hz. The TMTFs were fit with a lowpass filter function that provided estimates of overall modulation-depth sensitivity and modulation cutoff frequency. Although the simulations were capable of accurately reproducing the threshold elevations of the hearing-impaired listeners, they were not successful in reproducing the TMTFs. On average, the simulations resulted in lower sensitivity and higher cutoff frequency than were observed in the TMTFs of the hearing-impaired listeners.

40|$|Approximately 70 % of U. S. adults over 65 are {{struggling}} with at least mild hearing impairment.

40|$|Under normal conditions, human {{speech is}} remarkably robust to {{degradation}} by noise and other distortions. However, people with hearing loss, {{including those with}} cochlear implants, often experience great difficulty in understanding speech in noisy environments. Recent work with normal-hearing listeners {{has shown that the}} amplitude fluctuations inherent in noise contribute strongly to the masking of speech. In contrast, this study shows that speech perception via a cochlear implant is unaffected by the inherent temporal fluctuations of noise. This qualitative difference between acoustic and electric auditory perception {{does not seem to be}} due to differences in underlying temporal acuity but can instead be explained by the poorer spectral resolution of cochlear implants, relative to the normally functioning ear, which leads to an effective smoothing of the inherent temporal-envelope fluctuations of noise. The outcome suggests an unexpected trade-off between the detrimental effects of poorer spectral resolution and the beneficial effects of a smoother noise temporal envelope. This trade-off provides an explanation for the long-standing puzzle of why strong correlations between speech understanding and spectral resolution have remained elusive. The results also provide a potential explanation for why cochlear-implant users and hearing-impaired listeners exhibit reduced or absent masking release when large and relatively slow temporal fluctuations are introduced in noise maskers. The multitone maskers used here may provide an effective new diagnostic tool for assessing <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and reduced spectral resolution...|$|E
40|$|Pseudohypacusis is a somatoform {{disorder}} characterized by hearing loss with discrepancies between pure-tone audiometry and auditory brainstem response (ABR), but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unclear. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for 14 unmedicated, right-handed patients and 35 healthy control subjects, we investigated whether <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{was associated with}} discernible changes of brain morphology. Group differences in gray matter volume (GMV) were assessed using high-resolution, T 1 -weighted, volumetric MR imaging datasets (3 T Trio scanner; Siemens AG) and analyzed with covariant factors of age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and total GMV, which was increased by 27. 9 % in the left medial frontal gyrus (MFG) (Brodmann area 10) (p=. 001, corrected cluster level) and by 14. 4 % in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and the adjacent middle temporal gyrus (MTG) (BA 42 to 21) (p=. 009, corrected cluster level) in patients with pseudohypacusis. The GMV in the right STG (BA 42) and verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) were correlated significantly with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Third Edition (WISC-III) (ß=−. 57, p<. 0001) and level of SES (ß=−. 55, p<. 0001).

The whole subjects of this study were 414 ears with inner ear hearing loss, 278 ears with normal hearing, 113 ears of neonates, 62 ears of the patients who were administered cis-platin, and 15 ears with <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> At first, 5 studies described below were performed to examine the characters and reliability of DPOAE as a clinical test: 1) The average DPOAE-gram of norrnal hearing ears. 2) The comparison between DPOAE levels and hearing levels. 3) The reproducibility of DPOAE on the different examinations in the same subjects. 4) The influences of respiratory noises on DPOAE levels. 5) The detection of fine cochlea damages using DPOAE which can not be detected by pure tone audiometry. Then the following 2 clinical studies were performed: 6) The utility of DPOAE in neonates and children. 7) The utility of DPOAE in functional deafness cases. From these studies, the following characters of DPOAE were comfirmed. Since DPOAE levels have correlations with hearing levels at the same frequencies, normal hearing could be determined by the DPOAE level. DPOAE is useful for following chronological changes of hearing, because of its reproducibility in a same subject at different times. The early and fine damages on the cochlea that could not be detected by conventional pure tone audiometry might be detected by DPOAE in some cases. Considering these results, I concluded that DPOAE could be a new objective hearing test which would help the conventinal examinations.

40|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> as {{a common}} {{comorbidity}} in children with cleft lip and/or palate has been well documented. Auditory impairment may contribute to abnormalities in speech, language and learning abilities, and other communicative disorders in children with oral clefts. The <b>functional</b> consequences of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in this group should not be underestimated. In this paper, the existing literature is reviewed {{with an emphasis on}} the prevalence, type, assessment, and management methods for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children with cleft lip and/or palate. The prevalence of hearing disorders reported in western patients with cleft lip and/or palate is generally higher than in the eastern countries. However, <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is common in children with cleft lip and/or palate of all ethnicities. Conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> caused by middle ear disease is reported to occur frequently in syndromic and non-syndromic cleft cases. The prevalence of sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is relatively higher in syndromic clefts than non-syndromic clefts. Assessments of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children with clefts should include case history taking and a detailed audiometric evaluation, and should be performed by otolaryngology and audiology professionals. Surgical treatment, including closure of clefts and ventilation tube insertion, is reported to be effective in reducing conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> but this remains controversial.

40|$|Aminoglycoside {{antibiotics}} (AGs) {{are used}} to treat infections in live-stranded odontocetes. Although AGs have high clinical efficacy, they can be ototoxic, especially to high frequency <b>hearing.</b> This <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is often irreversible and warrants concern because {{it is likely to}} affect odontocete echolocation and communication. AGs have a low toxicity threshold and thus a narrow therapeutic window. Common terrestrial mammal dosing protocols could be inappropriate for odontocetes because they may have a reduced ability to clear AGs. Poor health, common in stranded odontocetes, compounds this problem. It may also compromise intrinsic mechanisms that maintain homeostasis and postpone cochlear hair cell death. These factors can further narrow the therapeutic window, causing otherwise safe drug levels to become toxic. There are several effective ways of attenuating AG ototoxicity such as minimizing the area under the concentration-time curve by extending dosage intervals. Therapeutic monitoring and additive therapies can additionally reduce ototoxicity. Until ototoxic risk and risk reduction strategies are explored in odontocetes, it is safest to test a stranded animal's hearing prior to its release. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may only present weeks after treatment cessation due to AG cytotoxicity characteristics and compensatory mechanisms thereof. AGs have a protracted cochlear elimination half- life that may cause <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> to worsen for months after treatment. Developing strategies for reducing ototoxic risk, determining prevalence of ototoxicity in stranded animals, and documenting the <b>functional</b> effects of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> would make it easier to estimate the odds of post-release survival in AG-treated odontocete...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability of}} the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty. Study Design: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a bone-conduction transducer, with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window. Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital center. Patients: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and <b>functional</b> (moderate, mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique. Intervention: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window. Main Outcome Measure: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement. Results: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and speech audiometry in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} the subjective psychological and social effects of highly asymmetric <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (single-sided deafness) in adults. Design: Three group interviews were conducted using the critical incidence technique and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis. Study sample: Eight adults with a clinical diagnosis of a moderately-severe <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> or greater in one ear and normal or near-normal hearing in the other ear. Results: A range of <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> difficulties associated with single-sided deafness including impaired speech in background noise and reduced spatial awareness were reported to affect social and psychological well-being. Social consequences of single-sided deafness resulted from activity limitations and participation restrictions including withdrawal from and within situations. Participants reported psychological effects including worrying about losing the hearing in their other ear, embarrassment related to the social stigma attached to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and reduced confidence and belief in their abilities to participate. Conclusions: Single-sided deafness {{can be associated with}} many negative consequences. Counselling may help overcome the psychological consequences of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> regardless of whether technological support such as a hearing aid is prescribed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{functional}} {{results of the}} Vibrant Soundbridge (VBS) placed on the round window (RW) in patients with mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of <b>functional</b> <b>hearing,</b> with measurements performed 7 to 9 months postoperatively. SETTINGS: Two tertiary referral hospital centers. SUBJECTS: Twelve individuals with mixed severe <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> associated with chronic suppurative otitis media and otosclerosis. INTERVENTION: Surgical placement of the VBS mechanical effector {{in close contact with}} the RW membrane to directly drive the inner ear fluids. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: <b>Functional</b> <b>hearing</b> gain as analyzed via pure-tone audiometry and speech audiometry with VBS off and on in quiet and in noise. RESULTS: We observed a mean gain of 37. 5 dB (0. 5 - 4 kHz) with wide individual differences. The overall gain is mainly due to the air-bone gap recovery, whereas a further 12 -dB mean improvement of air-conducted threshold is evident at 2 kHz. The speech reception threshold in quiet shows a mean gain of 24 dB, whereas in noise, it requires a signal-to-noise ratio 7 to 13 dB greater than normal-hearing controls. All patients are daily users of their VBS device. CONCLUSION: A middle ear implant capable of directly driving the cochlear fluids seems to be a promising alternative for individuals with a severe to profound mixed <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> However, variability in hearing recovery is great, likely reflecting variability in responsiveness of the cochlea associated with chronic pathologic findings and, possibly, variability in how the VBS effector interfaces with the RW. Modifying the shape of the VBS effector can improve the mechanical coupling to the RW to better exploit the device's amplification power...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} natural course of tumor size and hearing during {{conservative}} management of 151 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma (VS), and {{to evaluate the}} same parameters for {{the part of the}} group (n = 84) who were treated by LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). METHODS: In prospectively collected data, patients underwent MRI and complete audiovestibular tests at inclusion, during the conservative management period and after SRS. Hearing was graded according to the Gardner-Robertson (GR) scale and tumor size according to Koos. Statistics were performed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate analyses including linear and logistic regression. Specific insight was given to patients with serviceable hearing. RESULTS: During the conservative management period (mean follow-up time: 24 months, range: 6 - 96), the annual risk of GR class degradation was 6 % for GRI and 15 % for GR II patients. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> as an initial symptom was highly predictive of further <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (p = 0. 003). Tumor growth reached 25 %. For SRS patients, <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> preservation was 51 % at 1 year and 36 % at 3 years. Tumor control was 94 and 91 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: In VS patients, <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> at the time of diagnosis is a predictor of poorer hearing outcome. LINAC SRS is efficient for tumor control. Patients who preserved their pretreatment hearing presented less <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> per year after SRS than before treatment, suggesting a protective effect of SRS when cochlear function can be preserved...|$|R

The mean word recognition scores varied significantly across lists from 54 to 68 %. The median of the variability of the word recognition score ranged from 30 % for one ten-word list down to 20 % for three ten-word lists. Syllabic and phonemic scores showed much less variability with standard deviations decreasing by 1. 15 with the use of syllabic scores and by 1. 45 with phonemic scores. The sensitivity of each list to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and distortions varied significantly. There was an increase in the minimum effect size that could be seen for syllabic scores compared to word scores, with no significant further improvement with phonemic scores. The use of at least two ten-word lists, quoted in syllables rather than in whole words, contributed to a large decrease in variability and an increase in sensitivity to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> However, those results emphasize the need of using updated linguistic material for clinical speech score assessments...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Osteomas of {{the middle}} ear are small, single, usually unilateral, peduncular growths, off-white in color, with smooth or multilobular surface, {{asymptomatic}} or causing <b>functional</b> disorders (progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> pathological appearance of the eardrum, vertigo and otorrhea), of unclear or unknown etiology. Fleury described three types of osteomas: massive, diffuse atticoantral and localized type. The therapy is surgical. Small and asymptomatic ones are followed-up. Cremers suggests surgical intervention in cases of progressive growth and increased <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Case description Discharge and pain in the left ear started twelve years ago, accompanied by impaired hearing and tinnitus. Four months ago the symptoms aggravated and discharge and pain increased. Otomicroscopic findings revealed: perforation in the posterior attic and a prominent polypous, clustered bright red formation. Schüller X-ray showed total absence of pneumocyte cells, with distinct sclerotic changes. Retroauricular access showed a biventricular bony formation in the cavum and partly in the antrum. A cholesteatoma extended from the cavum into the antrum, above the osteatoma. The bony formation was separated transmeatally from the grip in the posterior attic using a chisel, partially removing the bone wall of the exterior aural tube, removing it completely through the mastoid antrum. The removed bony mass, sized 5 x 8 x 8 mm, included also the incus. DISCUSSION Osteoma was discovered accidentally. Regarding clinical features, it belonged to the second group, due to progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> recurrent episodes of otorrhea, pain, biventricular shape and association with cholesteatoma. It was removed using a combined method. It was not possible to establish when the osteoma exactly started generating. It is possible that the initial complaints twelve years ago were the first signs of illness, and chronic otitis may have occurred {{as a consequence of the}} tumor...|$|R

50|$|A {{person with}} {{unilateral}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may have <b>functional</b> difficulty <b>hearing</b> {{even when the}} other ear is normal, particularly in demanding situations such as noisy environments and when several people are speaking the same time. A complication in single-sided deafness is hearing impairment in the hearing ear. Conventional ear surgery involves a risk of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> due to the surgical procedure. Most ear surgeons are thus reluctant to perform surgery on an only hearing ear. The BAHA surgery avoids this risk and may be an appropriate treatment.

40|$|In speech {{audiometric}} testing, hearing {{performance is}} typically measured by calculating {{the number of}} correct repetitions of a speech stimulus. We investigate {{to what extent the}} repetition accuracy of Dutch speech stimuli presented against a background noise is influenced by nonauditory processes. We show that variation in verbal repetition accuracy is partially explained by morpholexical and syntactic features of the target language. Verbs, prepositions, conjunctions, determiners, and pronouns yield significantly lower correct repetitions than nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. The reduced repetition performance for verbs and function words is probably best explained by the similarities in the perceptual nature of verbal morphology and function words in Dutch. For sentences, an overall negative effect of syntactic complexity on speech repetition accuracy was found. The lowest number of correct repetitions was obtained with passive sentences, reflecting the cognitive cost of processing a noncanonical sentence structure. Taken together, these findings may have important implications for the audiological practice. In combination with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> linguistic complexity may increase the cognitive demands to process sentences in noise, leading to suboptimal <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> in day-to-day listening situations.

40|$|Congenital human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{occurs in}} 0. 5 – 1 % of live births and approxi-mately 10 % of infected infants develop <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The mechanism(s) of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> re-main unknown. We developed a murine model of CMV induced <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in which murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of newborn mice leads to hematogenous spread of virus {{to the inner}} ear, induction of inflammatory responses, and <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Characteris-tics of the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> described in infants with congenital HCMV infection were observed including, delayed onset, progressive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> and unilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in this model and, these characteristics were viral inoculum dependent. Viral antigens {{were present in the}} inner ear as were CD 3 + mononuclear cells in the spiral ganglion and stria vascularis. Spiral ganglion neuron density was decreased after infection, thus providing a mechanism for <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The lack of significant inner ear histopathology and persistence of inflam-mation in cochlea of mice with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> raised the possibility that inflammation was a major component of the mechanism(s) of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in MCMV infected mice.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} external, middle, {{and inner}} ear abnormalities on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of temporal bone {{in patients with}} microtia and to predict anatomic external and middle ear anomalies {{as well as the}} degree of <b>functional</b> <b>hearing</b> impairment based on clinical grades of microtia. Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective study conducted on Indian population. Fifty-two patients with microtia were evaluated for external, middle, and inner ear anomalies on HRCT of temporal bone. Clinical grading of microtia was done based on criteria proposed by Weerda et al. in 37 patients and degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was assessed using pure tone audiometry or brainstem-evoked response in 32 patients. Independent statistical correlations of clinical grades of micotia with both external and middle ear anomalies detected on HRCT and the degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> were finally obtained. Results: The external, middle, and inner ear anomalies were present in 93. 1 %, 74. 5 %, and 2. 7 % patients, respectively. Combined cartilaginous and bony external auditory canal atresia (EAC) was the most common anatomic abnormality in our group of microtia patients. Hypoplastic mesotympanum represented the commonest middle ear anomaly. The incidence of combined ossicular dysplasia and facial canal anomalies was lower as compared to other population groups; however, we recorded a greater incidence of cholesteatoma. Both these factors can have a substantial impact on outcome of patients planned for surgery. We found no significant association between grades of microtia and external or middle ear anomalies. Similarly, no significant association was found between lower grades of microtia (grade I and II) and degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> However, association between grade III microtia and degree of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was significant. A significant association between congenital cholesteatoma and degree of pneumatization of atretic plate and mastoid process not previously studied was also recorded in our study...|$|R

40|$|Sudden {{bilateral}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{are seen}} rarely and the toxic substance exposure constitutes {{a small part}} of etiology. A Fifty-eight-year-old woman admitted to our clinic with sudden bilateral <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> shortly after chlorpyrifos-ethyl exposure. Otolaryngologic examination findings were normal. The patient had 40  dB sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> (SNHL) on the right ear and 48  dB SNHL on the left ear. Additional diagnostic tests were normal. The conventional treatment for sudden <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was performed. On the second week following organophosphate (OP) exposure the patient's <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> almost completely resolved. OP's are heavily used in agriculture and should be taken into consideration as an etiologic factor in sudden <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Keywords: Organophosphates, <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> Sudde...|$|R
40|$|Background: Estimation {{of the age}} of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{diagnosis}} {{in every}} society is recommended to be compared with standard criteria to establish common dirth in management and rehabilitation. This study was conducted {{in order to determine the}} age of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> diagnosis with respect to common criteria in Baghche-Ban school of hard of hearing children in Tehran. Methods: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 445 children in stages 2, 6 and 10 of Baghche-Ban school of hard of hearing participated. the research was performed by means of the three-stages questionaires that children filled with help of their parents. Results: The mean age of detection of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in both acquired and congenital <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in children was 3. 5 year-old. while the age in which <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> was doubted was 1. 8 year-old. In another word the mean age of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> detection decreased as the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> increases(in moderate- profound <b>hearing</b> <b>loss)</b> (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: among the refrence sources for refering children with <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> the least refering was related to physicians. Adversly the mean age of doubting and detection of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> increased in children with family history of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> (P< 0. 01). Meanwhile no relationship was detected between the age of diagnosis of <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and the number of deaf members in the family(P< 0. 02) ...|$|R
