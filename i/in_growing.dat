This can be seen most clearly through the extent of support he received when he announced his resignation as commissioner. One commentator declared, “the news hit the poker world … {{like a ton of}} bricks,” and that his tenure in the role “may be unmatched.” Well-known players like Phil Hellmuth, Peter Eastgate and Barry Goldstein expressed their esteem for Pollack.|$|E

5|$|Progressive {{alignments}} are {{not guaranteed}} to be globally optimal. The primary problem is that when errors are made at any stage <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> the MSA, these errors are then propagated through to the final result. Performance is also particularly bad {{when all of the}} sequences in the set are rather distantly related. Most modern progressive methods modify their scoring function with a secondary weighting function that assigns scaling factors to individual members of the query set in a nonlinear fashion based on their phylogenetic distance from their nearest neighbors. This corrects for non-random selection of the sequences given to the alignment program.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River and Muddy Creek. Having left the army, he had settled on his {{inherited}} farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With {{the help of}} approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> tobacco and milling flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott {{and his wife had}} four boys and four or five girls.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at the USDA, Thom became a world {{authority}} on the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Thom pioneered the technique of using defined, reproducible culture media to grow microorganisms; most of the taxa he described are still valid today. Together with Margaret B. Church, Thom maintained collections of fungus cultures for the American Type Culture Collection, established in 1925. In 1929, a year after discovering penicillin, Alexander Fleming published a well-known paper in which he identified the mold Penicillium rubrum as the one responsible for creating the drug. Harold Raistrick succeeded <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> the organism on a simple culture medium, but could not isolate the penicillin produced by the mold when grown this way. With Thom's assistance, they correctly identified the organism as Penicillium notatum and, in 1941, developed a method to scale up production at the Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional Research Laboratory in Peoria, Illinois, which ultimately resulted in an inexpensive supply of the drug.|$|E

5|$|On , 1889, the Land Run saw the {{founding}} of Norman, with at least 150 residents spending the night in makeshift campsites; {{by the next morning}} a downtown was already being constructed. Almost immediately two prominent Norman businessmen, former Purcell railroad freight agent Delbert Larsh and railroad station chief cashier Thomas Waggoner, began lobbying for the territorial government to locate its first university in Norman. The two were interested <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> the city and had reasoned that, rather than try to influence legislatures to locate the heavily contested territory capital in Norman, it made sense to attempt to secure the state's first university instead (a move that would be far less controversial). On , 1890, Larsh and Waggoner were successful with the passage of Council Bill 114, establishing the University of Oklahoma in Norman approximately 18 years before Oklahoma statehood.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine army {{retreated from}} the Sofia Valley towards Ihtiman where it stopped for the night. The rumours that the Bulgarians had barred the nearby {{mountain}} routes stirred commotion among {{the soldiers and}} {{on the following day}} the retreat continued <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> disorder. When the Bulgarians under Samuil and probably Roman saw that, they rushed to the enemy camp and the retreat turned to flight. The Byzantine advance guard managed to squeeze through slopes which were not yet taken by the Bulgarian attackers. The rest of the army was surrounded by the Bulgarians. Only the elite Armenian unit from the infantry managed to break out with heavy casualties and to lead their Emperor to safety through secondary routes. Enormous numbers of Byzantine soldiers perished in the battle; the rest were captured along with the Imperial insignia.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} inhibitors of {{bacterial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis upon logarithmically growing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. Cell division, ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, and DNA synthesis were measured after addition of nalidixic acid, fluorodeoxyuridine, or phenethyl alcohol to cultures of yeast <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> defined and complex media. Both nalidixic acid and fluorodeoxyuridine had only temporary effects on nucleic acid synthesis <b>in</b> cultures <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> defined medium, and {{little or no}} observable effect on cultures <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> complex medium. Neither compound inhibited colony formation on complex solid medium, although growth was slow on defined solid medium. Phenethyl alcohol caused complete inhibition of DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell division <b>in</b> cultures <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> defined medium. <b>In</b> cultures <b>growing</b> <b>in</b> complex medium, RNA synthesis and cell division were inhibited to a lesser extent. A slight increase in DNA was observed {{in the presence of}} the inhibitor...|$|R
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> chicks due to calcium deficiency. In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E
5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the initial inspection, the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{has been}} noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A.rubescens, although {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B.edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.|$|E

5|$|The {{resignation}} of Ubico did not restore democracy. Ubico appointed three generals, Federico Ponce Vaides, Eduardo Villagrán Ariza, and Buenaventura Pineda, to a junta which {{would lead the}} provisional government. A few days later, Ponce Vaides persuaded the congress to appoint him interim president. Ponce pledged to hold free elections soon, {{while at the same}} time suppressing the protests. Press freedom was suspended, arbitrary detentions continued, and memorial services for slain revolutionaries were prohibited. However, the protests had grown to the point where the government could not stamp them out, and rural areas also began organizing against the dictatorship. The government began using the police to intimidate the indigenous population to keep the junta in power through the forthcoming election. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> support for an armed revolution among some sections of the populace. By now, the army was disillusioned with the junta, and progressives within it had begun to plot a coup.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents often become resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted <b>in</b> <b>growing</b> grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
