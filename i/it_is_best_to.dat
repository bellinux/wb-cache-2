5|$|Maine Coons require ample {{protein and}} {{nutrients}} in their diets. Since {{they are a}} large cat breed {{with high levels of}} energy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|Research is also {{planned to}} clarify factors {{correlated}} to outcome in TBI {{and to determine}} in which cases <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> perform CT scans and surgical procedures.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> admit it.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a council}} of war held <b>to</b> {{consider}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a council of perplexity and despair. Nobody could tell what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. To go back was disgrace. To go forward <b>was</b> destruction; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{impossible for them}} to remain where they were.|$|R
60|$|Hassan. Lady, {{the hours}} <b>are</b> fleeting. <b>It</b> <b>were</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> make good speed.|$|R
60|$|Resistance was useless, and, {{like all}} strong, {{determined}} natures, he knew when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> give in.|$|R
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
25|$|If {{a person}} has {{difficulty}} removing a tick, or has {{reason to be concerned}} about allergic reactions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> seek professional medical attention. The process of removing ticks in humans has been associated with anaphylactic reactions and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> have appropriate medical supplies (oxygen, adrenaline) ready.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{move into}} new houses {{at night when}} the village is already asleep.|$|E
60|$|Jughi {{consulted}} his generals {{in respect}} <b>to</b> what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. They {{advised him to}} avoid a battle.|$|R
60|$|Wild. Ay; {{but then}} <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> trust {{them out of}} the cage together; let them hop about at liberty.|$|R
60|$|I knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> own up. I'd {{been in the}} wrong, and I {{meant to}} {{acknowledge}} it with perfect frankness.|$|R
25|$|After flowering, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{remove the}} old stems from Iris confusa, Iris japonica and Iris tectorum, as this helps the plant survive the winter.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} {{argument against}} the Roe decision is that, {{in the absence of}} consensus about when meaningful life begins, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> avoid the risk of doing harm.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of an {{economically}} interventionist state argue <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> evaluate {{the merits of}} government intervention {{on a case-by-case basis}} in order to address recessions (see Keynesian economics) or existential threats.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} now, and the others, seeing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> let her {{alone for a}} while, chatted gaily together.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Harris told him. He {{also added}} that he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> put him to bed at once before he came round.|$|R
50|$|After {{recovering}} from the injury the club decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> send him out on loan to another Tippeliga team, Sandnes Ulf for the 2014 season.|$|R
25|$|As {{with any}} {{supplements}} and drugs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> confer with a veterinarian {{as to the}} recommended dosages. Some drugs are not allowed in competition and {{may need to be}} withheld a few days before.|$|E
25|$|If {{signs of}} ER are seen, the horse {{should not be}} moved. Movement can cause further muscle damage. If the animal {{is far from the}} barn, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> trailer him back rather than move him.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in lightly used {{wilderness}} areas, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> replace {{anything that}} was moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter {{anything that was}} gathered, so that it looks as natural as possible. Make certain that anything that was {{in or near the}} fire is cool first.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} done so. I {{would not have had}} my heart crushed within me. But perhaps you <b>were</b> right. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> patient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I suppose I must do it, though I {{would much}} rather not. Still, as you say, <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> get <b>it</b> all over at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not turned}} out exactly; {{but as they}} said we should have <b>to</b> go soon, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> go now {{everybody}} was moving, because there are better chances." ...|$|R
25|$|Work {{in small}} circles is {{stressful}} on a horse's legs, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> limit a longeing session to about 20 minutes. Gaits {{should be changed}} frequently, and the horse should be worked for equal time in both directions so that {{both sides of the}} horse are worked evenly and to keep the work interesting for the horse.|$|E
25|$|No single {{treatment}} {{works for}} all cases, probably {{because there is}} no single cause for all cases. The degenerative changes are usually quite advanced by the time the horse is consistently lame, and these changes are believed to be non-reversible. At this time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> manage the condition and focus on alleviating pain and slowing the degeneration.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> go early, preferably {{arriving}} before 08.00 am, {{and proceed}} {{directly to the}} lift to the observation tower. The lift has a capacity of perhaps 160 people per hour so long queues build up quickly. The {{other parts of the}} monument, including the dioramas in the hall below the Monas, can be viewed later.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} better, David; but <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> {{see how she}} goes on. <b>It</b> may <b>be,</b> as you say, that she will shortly gain her {{strength}} and spirits again." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rollo did {{not know}} what to say to this, and so he was silent, and walked along, {{thinking}} what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. Presently, after a moment's pause, he added,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Alice smiled, {{and pushed}} away {{four of the}} eight books she had selected, as if afraid she had been greedy, and now felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> wait a little.|$|R
25|$|Both {{the cooking}} pot and lid handles {{can be made}} of the same {{material}} but will mean that, when picking up or touching either of these parts, oven gloves will need to be worn. In order to avoid this, handles can be made of non-heat-conducting materials, for example bakelite, plastic or wood. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> avoid hollow handles because they are difficult to clean or to dry.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the pretense}} of wishing to work in its quarries, Carter boards a ship bound for Inganok, a nation built of onyx. The trip to Inganok takes three weeks, but as they draw near, Carter spots a strange granite island. When he {{inquires}} about the mysterious isle, the captain explains {{that it is the}} nameless rock, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> not speak of it. That night, Carter hears strange howls from the nameless island.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make the most {{accurate}} flood forecasts for waterways, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> have a long time-series of historical data that relates stream flows to measured past rainfall events. Coupling this historical information with real-time knowledge about volumetric capacity in catchment areas, such as spare capacity in reservoirs, ground-water levels, and the degree of saturation of area aquifers is also needed in {{order to make}} the most acrate flood forecasts.|$|E
5000|$|Elagabalus("for {{being such}} a damn weirdo, that {{no one knew what}} to do with him, until they finally decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> kill him, which was {{probably}} for the best.") ...|$|R
60|$|But desperately as I {{resolved}} {{to accomplish the}} deliverance of the maiden, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> set heedfully about it. I desired no shedding of blood; though the odds were against us.|$|R
60|$|Dwight did {{not answer}} at first. He looked {{somewhat}} ashamed. Presently, however, he concluded, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frank and honest; so {{he looked up and}} acknowledged that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so.|$|R
