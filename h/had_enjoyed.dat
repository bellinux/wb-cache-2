5|$|Baroness Gisela von Donner {{had refused}} to marry Galland as the {{restrictions}} imposed upon her by her former husband's will would deny her the wealth and freedom she <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed.</b> She left for Germany in 1954. Galland married Sylvinia von Dönhoff on 12 February 1954. However, {{she was unable to}} have children and they divorced on 10 September 1963.|$|E
5|$|By November 1944, the First Canadian Army {{had entered}} the Nijmegen Salient which was being held {{for use in the}} {{development}} of future offensives. The 2nd Division came under the command of Major General Bruce Matthews, with Foulkes being transferred to command the I Canadian Corps on the Italian Front. The First Canadian Army launched no major offensive operations from November 1944 to January 1945; the longest hiatus the Canadians <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> since landing on the Normandy beaches the previous June.|$|E

5|$|By the 1991 World Cup New Zealand were an ageing side, co-coached by Alex Wyllie and John Hart. After beating hosts England in {{the tournament}} opener, they {{struggled}} during pool matches against the United States and Italy, and won their quarter-final against Canada. They were then knocked out by eventual winners Australia 16–6 in their semi-final at Lansdowne Road. In {{the wake of the}} tournament, there were many retirements, including coach Wyllie, who <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> an 86% win rate during 29 tests in charge.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online {{generally}} {{praised the}} soundtrack's quality, but {{felt there was}} too little variety. RPGFans Patrick Gann was generally positive, although he had little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the soundtrack of Nier. The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{features}} an ensemble cast, the largest Swanberg {{had worked with}} at the time. He and Johnson cast the film by contacting friends and other actors who they knew <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> their previous film together, Drinking Buddies. Rosemarie DeWitt and Swanberg decided to work together after her husband, Ron Livingston, starred in Drinking Buddies. Unlike the other actors, Orlando Bloom was cast through an agent. Swanberg cast his own son, Jude, as the three-year-old son of the lead characters.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Athens, Revithi {{encountered}} a male runner along the road. He gave her money and advised her {{to run the}} marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job. After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race: she <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> long-distance running as a child, and believed she could beat the male competitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the game mechanics, Naka {{was inspired by}} Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, whose games he <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more action-oriented than the Mario series; while playing Super Mario Bros., he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.|$|E
5|$|Manuel I Komnenos (or Comnenus; , Manouēl I Komnēnos; 28 November 1118 – 24 September 1180) was a Byzantine Emperor of the 12th century who reigned over {{a crucial}} {{turning point in}} the history of Byzantium and the Mediterranean. His reign saw the last {{flowering}} of the Komnenian restoration, during which the Byzantine Empire had seen a resurgence of its military and economic power, and <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> a cultural revival.|$|E

5|$|Samira Rajab, the country's Minister of State for Information (and Rajab's cousin twice over) {{declared}} that Rajab <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{a fair trial}} with unrestricted access to legal assistance. She said that action had been taken against him because although claiming {{to be a human}} rights activist he had in fact been engaging in political activity, a justification similar to that offered by an officially-appointed MP for the trial of Bahrain health workers.|$|E
5|$|She <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> {{developing}} {{the book with}} Warne, and, on July 2, sent him {{the remainder of the}} book, expressing her regret that its production was over. On July 25, proofs sent to her from the publisher showed spottiness that may have been caused by the summer heat affecting the chemicals used in the engraving process; the plates were re-engraved in September.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{plot was}} {{inspired}} by a similar incident in which Johnson discovered a gun and a bone in his backyard. Instead of a traditional script, he and Swanberg wrote an outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue. They cast the film mainly by contacting their friends and other actors who they knew <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> their previous work. It was filmed over 15 days in Los Angeles County, California. Swanberg dedicated the film to filmmaker Paul Mazursky.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan had}} been to take the songs out on the road, but no new tour transpired. Thus, Bush {{deliberately}} aimed for a live-band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and {{which would have been}} too difficult to re-create on stage. The result alienated some of her fan base, who <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the intricacy of her earlier compositions, but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} the writers Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966 — the first such public trials since Stalin's day — marked the {{reversion}} to a repressive cultural policy. Under Yuri Andropov the state security service (in {{the form of the}} KGB) regained some of the powers it <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> under Stalin, although there was no return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s, and Stalin's legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia.|$|E

He was almost forced to quit halfway through the season, but was able to obtain significant financial and personal support from Australian rugby union legend David Campese, which helped him to complete the year. Mark has since stated {{he has been able}} to pay back the money Campese gave him.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was based on that of Chadwick.|$|E
5|$|After {{nearly twenty}} years as a major, Berryman was {{promoted}} to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the 3rd Division. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by Militia officers who <b>had</b> <b>enjoyed</b> faster promotion.|$|E
