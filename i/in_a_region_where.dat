Many results known for smooth surfaces and their geodesics, such as Birkhoff's method of constructing geodesics by his curve-shortening process or van Mangoldt and Hadamard's theorem that a simply connected surface of non-positive curvature is homeomorphic to the plane, are equally valid in this more general setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the Magnesian Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are lower than they have historically been, {{as a result of}} the extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E

500|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> {{valuable}} {{gold was}} plentiful, transportation was insecure and effective {{law and order}} was lacking, travelers became easy prey for robbers. [...] By late 1863, thefts and murders along the routes in and around Alder Gulch had become common. In their writings about the vigilantes, Thomas Dimsdale and Nathaniel P. Langford estimated that at least 102 travelers were killed by robbers {{in the fall of}} 1863. [...] Many more travelers left the region and were never heard from again. [...] As this became a more frequent occurrence locals began suspecting that these crimes were being carried out by a single group of outlaws, known as [...] "road agents", under the control of Bannack sheriff Henry Plummer.

500|$|There are a {{large number}} of epifaunal organisms living on the shells of Antarctic scallops, which may {{represent}} 90% of the hard substrate available <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> rocky surfaces are not common and much of the seabed consists of sediment. [...] Because a diverse community of invertebrates and algae use its shell as a base, the Antarctic scallop {{is considered to be a}} [...] "foundation species"; a species of great importance in its habitat. The fact that the scallops can swim and move to other locations aids in the dispersal of these organisms. The epiphytes include benthic diatoms, forams, bacteria, bryozoans, sponges and algae. The foram Cibicides refulgens lives parasitically on the scallop's shell and also grazes on the algae and bacteria growing there. In a research study, 10 different species of demosponge were found growing on a single Antarctic scallop. The demosponge Homaxinella balfourensis was one of the commonest epibionts growing harmlessly on the scallop's shell. The relationship between sponge and scallop may be symbiotic; the sponge avoids being engulfed in sediment while the scallop benefits from the protection provided by the sponge, which is distasteful to many predators.|$|E

500|$|In April 1853, Meeker {{heard that}} the lands north of the Columbia would become a {{separate}} territory (named Washington Territory), with its capital on Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific. He decided to travel north with his brother to scout for lands to claim around the waterway. There were as yet only about 500 European-descended inhabitants in the Puget Sound region, of which 100 were {{in the village of}} Olympia, which would become the territorial (and later state) capital. Despite there only being a few settlers, there was considerable activity in the area—the lumber of Puget Sound fueled San Francisco's building boom. The Meekers' first view of Puget Sound was unprepossessing; the tide was out, exposing mud flats. [...] Nevertheless, they pressed on, building a skiff to travel by water. They were met by friendly Indians, who sold them clams and taught them how to cook the shellfish. Engaging one of the Native Americans as guide, they explored the area, looking for good, well-located farmland. At one point, they entered the Puyallup River, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>region</b> <b>where</b> no white settlers lived, and camped on the present site of Puyallup, but were deterred by the large number of huge trees, which would make it difficult to clear land for farming. They decided on tracts on McNeil Island, not far from the thriving town of Steilacoom, where the farm's produce could be sold. Oliver remained on the island to build a cabin while his brother went back to fetch family and possessions, and sell their old claims at Kalama. He returned to a cabin in which they installed a glass window that looked over the water to Steilacoom, with a view of Mount Rainier. The Meeker claim was later the site of McNeil Island Corrections Center.|$|E
