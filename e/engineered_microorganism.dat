5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in scaling up microbial fermentations is the stability of the microbial strain: the <b>engineered</b> <b>microorganism</b> will attempt to mutate or shed the metabolic pathway, in part because intermediates in the metabolic pathway accumulate and are toxic to the cells. To balance pathway flux and reduce the cost of producing a desired biofuel, Keasling’s laboratory developed dynamic regulators to sense the levels of intermediates in the pathway and regulate pathway activity. [...] These regulators stabilized the pathway and the cell and improved biofuel yields making it possible to grow the engineered cells in large-scale fermentation tanks for fuel production.|$|E
5000|$|Jay Keasling’s {{laboratory}} at the University of California, Berkeley has engineered both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce of artemisinic acid, {{a precursor to}} artemisinin that can be derivatized using established, simple, inexpensive chemistry to form artemisinin or any artemisinin derivative currently used to treat malaria. [...] The microorganisms were engineered with a ten-enzyme biosynthetic pathway using genes from ‘‘Artemisia annua’‘, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli (twelve genes in all) to transform a simple and renewable sugar, like glucose, into the complicated chemical structure of the anti-malarial drug artemisinin. The <b>engineered</b> <b>microorganism</b> is capable of secreting the final product from the cell, thereby purifying it from all other intracellular chemicals and reducing the purification costs and therefore {{the cost of the}} final drug. Given the existence of known, relatively high-yielding chemistry for the conversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin or any other artemisinin derivative, microbially-produced artemisinic acid is a viable, renewable, and scalable source of this potent family of anti-malarial drugs.|$|E
50|$|The human {{sewage and}} the process waste from the {{manufacturing}} industries are the two major sources of the waste water. In Thailand, the total volume of the wastewater from industries {{is much greater than}} that of the domestic sewage. As a result, an effective method is needed. Microbial remediation of xenobiotics has shown to be effective and the low cost technology, but it still has several limitations. Consequently, the genetic engineering approaches are used to create the new strain of microbes (Genetically engineered microorganisms, GEMS) which have better catabolic potential than the wild type species for bioremediation. There are four major approaches to GEM development for the bioremediation application which include the modification of enzyme specificity and affinity, pathway construction and regulation, bioprocess development, monitoring and control and lastly, bio-affinity bio-receptor sensor application for chemical sensing, toxicity reduction and end point analysis. These allow the extensive use of genetically <b>engineered</b> <b>microorganism.</b> In the far future, the genetically engineered microorganisms could possibly be used to control the green house gases, convert the waste to the value-added product as well as to reduce and capture the carbon dioxide gases from the atmosphere (carbon sequestration), but lots of research still need to be done in order to make these potential become true. There is a concern regarding the use of genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of pollutants. Once the genetically microorganisms has been added, it may disperse uncontrollably and hard to be removed. However, the serious majorconcern that leads to the limitation of GEMs development seem to be the lack of information on gene as well as the regulatory constraints.|$|E

40|$|A {{two-stage}} {{process was}} evaluated for the fermentation of polymeric feedstocks to ethanol by a single, genetically <b>engineered</b> <b>microorganism.</b> The truncated xylanase gene (xynZ) from the thermophilic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum was fused with the N terminus of lacZ to eliminate secretory signals. This hybrid gene was expressed {{at high levels}} in ethanologenic strains of Escherichia coli KO 11 and Klebsiella oxytoca M 5 A 1 (pLOI 555). Large amounts of xylanase (25 to 93 mU/mg of cell protein) accumulated as intracellular products during ethanol production. Cells containing xylanase were harvested {{at the end of}} fermentation and added to a xylan solution at 60 degrees C, thereby releasing xylanase for saccharification. After cooling, the hydrolysate was fermented to ethanol with the same organism (30 degrees C), thereby replenishing the supply of xylanase for a subsequent saccharification. Recombinant E. coli metabolized only xylose, while recombinant K. oxytoca M 5 A 1 metabolized xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose but not xylotetrose. Derivatives of this latter organism produced large amounts of intracellular xylosidase, and the organism is presumed to transport both xylobiose and xylotriose for intracellular hydrolysis. By using recombinant M 5 A 1, approximately 34 % of the maximal theoretical yield of ethanol was obtained from xylan by this two-stage process. The yield appeared to be limited by the digestibility of commercial xylan rather than by a lack of sufficient xylanase or by ethanol toxicity. In general form, this two-stage process, which uses a single, genetically <b>engineered</b> <b>microorganism,</b> should be applicable for the production of useful chemicals {{from a wide range of}} biomass polymers...|$|E
