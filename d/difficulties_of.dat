40|$|Objectives: The {{impact of}} {{preoperative}} endoscopic therapy on the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy {{and the impact}} <b>of</b> the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the myotomy on long-term outcome has not been determined. This study was undertaken to determine whether preoperative therapy impacts the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic Heller myotomy and whether preoperative therapy or <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> myotomy impacts long-term outcomes. Methods: Since 1992, 305 patients, 56 % male, median age 49 years, underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy and were prospectively followed. The <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the laparoscopic Heller myotomy was scored by the operating surgeon for the most recent 170 consecutive patients {{on a scale of}} 1 (easiest) to 5 (most difficult). Patients scored their symptoms before and after myotomy using a Likert scale from 0 (never/not bothersome) to 10 (always/very bothersome). Results: Before myotomy, 66 % of patients underwent endoscopic therapy: 33 % dilation, 11 % Botox, and 22 % both. Preoperative endoscopic therapy did not correlate with the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the myotomy (P�NS). Median follow-up was 25 months. Regardless <b>of</b> the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the myotomy, dysphagia improved with myotomy (P� 0. 0001). By regression analysis, the frequency and severity of postmyotomy dysphagia correlated with neither preoperative endoscopic therapy nor the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the myotomy...|$|R

Given a clue-answer pair (c,a), we model the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> guessing a based on c using the conditional probability P(a | c); easier mappings should enjoy a higher conditional probability. The model is tested by two experiments, each of which involves estimating the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> puzzles taken from The New York Times. Additionally, we discuss how the notion of information implicit in our model relates to more easily quantifiable types of information that figure into crossword puzzles. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver resections are related to both patient and tumour factors, however the available difficulty scoring systems only incorporate tumour factors. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the opinion of laparoscopic liver surgeons regarding the factors that affect the perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver resections. METHOD: Using a Visual Analogue Scale an international survey of laparoscopic liver surgeons was undertaken to assess the perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> 26 factors previously demonstrated to affect the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> a laparoscopic liver resection. RESULTS: 80 surgeons with a combined experience of over 7000 laparoscopic liver resections responded to the survey. The <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver surgery was suggested to be increased by a BMI > 35 by 89 % of respondents; neo-adjuvant chemotherapy by 79 %; repeated liver resection by 99 % and concurrent procedures by 59 % however these factors have not been included in the previous difficulty scoring systems. CONCLUSION: The results suggests that the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> laparoscopic liver surgery is not fully assessed by the available difficulty scoring systems and prompts the development <b>of</b> a new <b>difficulty</b> score that incorporates all factors believed to increase difficulty. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about students’ {{perception}} <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> algebraic equations in elementary school. The theoretical {{part of the}} thesis describes the process of metacognition and {{the function of the}} perception <b>of</b> <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> mathematics tasks in the learning process. Then, we present the semantic and syntactic components of mathematics tasks (an analogy to semantic and syntactic components of plain texts). In particular, we consider these components on tasks related to the solution of linear equations. The components serve as a tool for analyzing the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> mathematics tasks. We consider also the results of TIMSS and NPZ studies related to the linear algebraic equations with one unknown and relate them to the components that influence their difficulty and are later used in the empirical part of the thesis. In the empirical part of the thesis we present a research on the factors that influence the students’ perception <b>of</b> the <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> algebraic equations. Students were asked to range the tasks within several triads of tasks according to the perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the tasks. The found perceived <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> the tasks is compared with students’ performance in the TIMSS and NPZ research and the published research by other authors. ...|$|R
