40|$|The rate of {{synthesis}} of RNA in the thymus glands of adult mice increased after immunization with sheep {{red blood cells}} (SRBC). The specific activity of some fractions of RNA, separated first by density gradient centrifugation and then by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was 16 -fold higher on day 3 after immunization than control mice not injected. RNA synthesis in the thymus was inhibited by rabbit anti-mouse thymus serum, injected along with antigen. A material was found in RNA <b>extracts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> thymus glands of mice immunized with SRBC which converted {{a small proportion of}} either spleen cells or peritoneal cells from nonimmunized mice to form sheep cell hemolysins.
