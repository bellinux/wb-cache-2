5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and <b>Earthquake.</b> When <b>Earthquake</b> rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against <b>Earthquake</b> and Dino Bravo. Bravo and <b>Earthquake</b> powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed <b>Earthquake</b> to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside of the ring by <b>Earthquake,</b> Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. <b>Earthquake</b> powerslammed Hogan and performed two <b>Earthquake</b> splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed <b>Earthquake.</b> He performed a legdrop on <b>Earthquake</b> before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out of the ring and then bodyslammed <b>Earthquake</b> onto a table at ringside. Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. <b>Earthquake</b> attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting <b>Earthquake</b> with a chair.|$|E
5|$|The Pichilemu <b>earthquake</b> {{was caused}} by the change in {{regional}} stress from the 27February <b>earthquake.</b> Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March <b>earthquake</b> locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested that the event resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February <b>earthquake,</b> which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the <b>earthquake</b> was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the <b>earthquake</b> as an aftershock of the February <b>earthquake</b> in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent <b>earthquake,</b> a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E

40|$|Slow <b>earthquakes</b> are {{characterized}} by {{a wide spectrum of}} fault slip behaviors and seismic radiation patterns that differ from those of traditional <b>earthquakes.</b> However, slow <b>earthquakes</b> and huge megathrust <b>earthquakes</b> can have common slip mechanisms and are located in neighboring regions of the seismogenic zone. The frequent occurrence of slow <b>earthquakes</b> may help to reveal the physics underlying megathrust events as useful analogs. Slow <b>earthquakes</b> may function as stress meters because of their high sensitivity to stress changes in the seismogenic zone. Episodic stress transfer to megathrust source faults leads to an increased probability of triggering huge <b>earthquakes</b> if the adjacent locked region is critically loaded. Careful and precise monitoring of slow <b>earthquakes</b> may provide new information on the likelihood of impending huge <b>earthquakes.</b> UTokyo Research掲載「スロー地震の巨大地震との関連性」 URI: [URL] Research "Connecting slow <b>earthquakes</b> to huge earthquakes" URI: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|We relate seismologically {{observable}} parameters such as radiated energy, seismic moment, rupture area, and rupture {{speed to}} {{the dynamics of}} faulting. To achieve this objective, we computed the radiated energy for 23 subduction zone <b>earthquakes</b> recorded between 1992 and 2001; most of these <b>earthquakes</b> have a magnitude M_w > 7. 5, but we also included some smaller (M_w ∼ 6. 7) well-studied subduction zone <b>earthquakes</b> and six crustal <b>earthquakes.</b> We compiled static stress drop estimates for these 29 <b>earthquakes</b> from literature and used a slip-weakening model to determine the radiation efficiency of these <b>earthquakes.</b> We also determined the rupture speed of these <b>earthquakes</b> from literature. From fracture mechanics, fracture energy, and hence radiation efficiency, {{can be related to}} the rupture speed. The radiation efficiencies estimated from the partitioning of energy as given by the slip-weakening model are consistent with the rupture speed estimated for these <b>earthquakes.</b> Most <b>earthquakes</b> have radiation efficiencies between 0. 25 and 1 and are hence efficient in generating seismic waves, but tsunami <b>earthquakes</b> and two deep <b>earthquakes,</b> the 1994 Bolivia and the 1999 Russia-China border <b>earthquakes,</b> have very small radiation efficiencies (< 0. 25) and hence dissipate a large amount of energy during faulting. We suggest that differences in the radiation efficiencies of different types of <b>earthquakes</b> could be due to fundamental differences in their rupture mechanics. In deep events, the energy is probably dissipated in thermal processes in the fault zone, while {{it is possible that the}} morphology of the trench causes large energy dissipation during the rupture process of tsunami <b>earthquakes...</b>|$|R

30|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of seismicity in Mainland China exhibits tremendous inhomogeneity.

For the focal mechanisms, thrust <b>earthquakes</b> are mainly distributed on the Himalaya collision boundary, while extensional and strike-slip <b>earthquakes</b> are distributed inside Tibet plateau, and thrust and strike-slip <b>earthquakes</b> occurred along the north and east boundary of Tibet plateau. As for the correlation between Bz and <b>earthquakes,</b> Fig.  2 illustrates four phenomena: (1) More <b>earthquakes</b> have occurred in areas with negative anomalies than in areas with positive anomalies; (2) few <b>earthquakes</b> occurred inside predominant anomalies, either positive (e.g. basin anomalies) or negative (the two obvious anomalies located near the plate boundary of India and Eurasia); (3) numerous <b>earthquakes</b> occurred near zero Bz areas (around the Sichuan Basin anomaly), or near boundaries of obvious anomalies (such as the Tarim Basin anomaly); (4) for distributions of <b>earthquakes</b> that deviate from the above three rules, rules 1 – 3 could be reproduced by selecting <b>earthquakes</b> with magnitude larger than Ms 7.0, or by selecting <b>earthquakes</b> with a focal depth deeper than 30  km, such as those near the boundary of the whole Tibetan negative anomaly (Jiao et al. 2013).|$|R

5|$|Scientists have {{estimated}} {{that there have been}} at least 13significant earthquakes along the Cascadia subduction zone in the last 6,000years. The most recent, the 1700 Cascadia <b>earthquake,</b> was recorded in the oral traditions of the First Nations people on Vancouver Island.
