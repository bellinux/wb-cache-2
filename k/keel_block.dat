The AISI 8630 steel was heated and poured at a temperature of 1593 o C with a die temperature of 204 o C. The casting used in this research was subjected to heat treatment. Fatigue experiment was performed using the Rotating Beam Fatigue Testing Machine using frequencies 25 Hz and 50 Hz. The graph of cyclic stress was plotted against the number of cycles to failure. Fractographic analysis for fatigue specimens {{was conducted on the}} fracture surface using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) after testing was completed by cutting the fractured sample and viewing under the Scanning Electron Microscope. The results shows that as the cyclic stress increases, the life of the material decreases and as the frequency increases, the number of cycles to failure decreases. Results also show that gradients decrease with increase in frequencies and smaller frequencies give higher intercepts on y-axis. The fractography of the fractured specimen also revealed that the failure begins with crack initiations at the external surface and propagates slowly into the material till final fracture occurred...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigated}} the brittle fracture mechanism of a grade E cast steel knuckle {{that is one}} of the key components of the coupler for railway wagon by using scanning electronic microscope, optical microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy as well as mechanical property testing methods. It is found that large amounts of developed coarse dendrites and shrinkage porosity existed in the knuckle's microstructure, the plasticity and impact toughness of the knuckle entity are very bad and far below that of the <b>Keel</b> <b>block</b> represented this knuckle. Apparently, the shrinkage porosity resulted in the knuckle unsound metallic matrix and poor mechanical properties. The fracture morphology mainly shows the characteristic of cleavage, quasi-cleavage fracture as well as a little ductile fracture, so the failure of the knuckle can be attributed to brittle fracture distinctly. Moreover, a welding repair area with high hardness is also found in the fracture region, which might initiate micro-cracks on the surface of the knuckle. As a result, it can be inferred that under an impact load that did not exceed material fracture limit, the micro-cracks initiated from weld repair zone propagated rapidly into the inner matrix by continuously fracturing the dendrites along shrinkage porosity regions until the knuckle failed instantly...|$|E

40|$|A presente dissertacao, {{consiste}} no estudo das propriedades mecanicas, com base em ensaios de tracao e impacto de dois acos inoxidaveis martensiticos, fundidos sob designacoes da norma ASTM, o aco CA 15, um aco com 12 % de Cr e o aco CA 6 NM, um aco com 12 % Cr, 4 % Ni e 0, 65 % Mo. O trabalho atestou os dois acos CA 15 e CA 6 NM, em condicoes equiparaveis de ensaios de tracao e impacto, a partir de corpos de prova tipo <b>Keel</b> <b>Block</b> fundidos em molde de areia aglomerada com resina, conforme as designacoes da norma ASTM. A efetividade dos tratamentos termicos e o resultado sob os ensaios mecanicos foram verificados por meio de ensaios de caracterizacao microestrutural: analise metalografica por microscopia otica e eletronica de varredura. No aco CA 15 observou-se a predisposicao a obtencao de ferrita delta na matriz martensitica, e uma fraca tendencia a precipitacao de carbonetos. No aco CA 6 NM, tanto a microestrutura predominantemente martensitica, quanto a forte precipitacao de carbonetos, sao tracos marcantes. Os efeitos de dois meios de tempera: agua e ar, sob as propriedades mecanicas dos acos CA 15 e CA 6 NM, foram investigados e se mostraram muito significativos. Para ambos os acos, duas classes de limites de resistencia a tracao em temperatura ambiente foram obtidas, uma inferior a 700 MPa, e outra superior, em torno dos 900 MPa. No aco CA 15 obteve-se maiores valores de reducao de area e menores valores de alongamento, em comparacao com o CA 6 NM. Os ensaios de tracao a quente(500 C), revelaram uma reducao nos valores de limite de resistencia(em relacao ao obtido a temperatura ambiente), em torno dos 30 % no aco CA 15. Mas no aco CA 6 NM, a reducao do limite de resistencia atingiu valores baixos de ate 20 %, devido a presenca massiva de carbonetos. Apos ensaio de impacto em diversas temperaturas, para determinacao da temperatura de transicao ductil-fragil segundo criterio 20, 6 J, o aco CA 15 revelou temperaturas de transicao maiores que 10 C, enquanto que o CA 6 NM revelou valores de temperatura de transicao entre - 100 e - 150 C. The {{subject of}} this work was to study the mechanical properties, based in tensile and impact tests, of two stainless martensitic steels cast under designations of ASTM Standards, namely the CA 15 steel, a steel with 12 % of Cr, and the CA 6 NM steel, a steel with 12 % Cr and 4 % Ni. For both steel grades bar tests were machined out from <b>Keel</b> <b>Block</b> coupons test cast in sand molds bonded with no-bake resin, according to the ASTM designations. Before machining the Keel Blocks were heat treated according to the ASTM standards as following: solubilization, quenching and tempering. The effectiveness of the heat treatments {{and the results of}} the mechanical tests were evaluated by means of microstructural characterization using optical and scanning electron microscopies. The CA 15 steel showed the presence of delta ferrite in the martensitic matrix, and a weak tendency to carbide precipitation. On the other hand, the CA 6 NM steel showed predominantly a martensitic structure and strong carbide precipitation. The effect of two quenching conditions, namely water and air, were investigated on the mechanical properties of CA 15 and CA 6 NM steels and showed to be high significance. For both steels two distinct levels of tensile strength at room temperature were obtained, one inferior to 700 MPa, and other superior around the 900 MPa. In the CA 15 grades were obtained higher values of area reduction and lower elongation values, when compared to the CA 6 NM grade. The tensile tests at higher temperature (500 C), led to a reduction of approximately 30 % in the values of tensile strength for the CA 15 steel. However, in the CA 6 NM steel, the reduction of the tensile strength was lower(less than 20 %) due to presence of massive carbide precipitation. After impact tests at several temperatures for determination of the ductile-fragile transition temperature, according to the 20, 6 J criterion, the CA 15 steel revealed a transition temperature beyond 10 C, while the CA 6 NM steel revealed values between - 100 and - 150 C...|$|E

50|$|In June 1942, the {{reconstruction}} of Oglala began. Finally, on 23 June, after six months with her port side beneath the surface, she was floated. The salvage crew was unable to bring her to the draft depth required by the <b>keel</b> <b>blocks</b> in the dry dock, however, and the ship was unsteady. Work began to increase draft and improve her stability but she faced another stumbling block. During the night of 25-26 June 1942, the pumps fighting to keep Oglala afloat were overwhelmed by an influx of water and she settled to the bottom again. An investigation revealed that the fuel line for the main gasoline powered pump had become clogged overnight. There was an electrical back-up pump but the water level did not rise high enough {{for it to be}} effective. While attempting to refloat her again on 29 June, a failure to the cofferdam in aft section caused her to settle down again. It was determined that the field crew had not built the cofferdam to the proper specifications. It was the second time this costly mistake had been discovered. The cofferdam was removed, repaired properly and reinstalled within 24 hours. She was floated for a third time on 1 July. Sadly her dockside troubles were not behind her. On the same day, sometime between 18:15 and 18:30 while the pump in her bow was being refueled, gasoline was spilled on the hot exhaust manifold causing a flare-up. This resulted in fuel being splashed on the bow cofferdam and an open five-gallon fuel bucket to be dropped in the water. The fire watch on board responded quickly as did the crew of the submarine rescue vessel , the yard fire department, and men from other surrounding ships. The effort extinguished the blaze in 30 minutes, before it could cause any serious damage. When Oglala was finally towed to the dry dock, the bow was the only part of her above the waterline. Once she was settled into the <b>keel</b> <b>blocks,</b> the refitting work began.|$|R
