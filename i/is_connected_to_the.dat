5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that <b>is</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump.

40|$|Capítulos en librosDuring {{the last}} ten years Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica has built a {{considerable}} number of high voltage/medium voltage transformer stations in urban areas using high voltage (220 kV and 132 kV) Gas Insulated Substations (GISs). The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line bays, two transformer bays and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS using either insulated cables or Gas Insulated Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the insulated cables or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS also using insulated cables. 3. Power transformers <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS using insulated cables. Overhead lines <b>are</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, insulated cables, GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> length of the insulated cables and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
