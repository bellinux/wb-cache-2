50|$|Pregnanolone, {{also known}} as <b>eltanolone</b> (INN), as well as 3α,5β-tetrahydroprogesterone (3α,5β-THP) or 3α-hydroxy-5β-pregnan-20-one, is an {{endogenous}} neurosteroid that is biosynthesized from progesterone. It is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor, {{as well as a}} negative allosteric modulator of the glycine receptor, and is known to have sedative, anxiolytic, anesthetic, and anticonvulsant effects. It was investigated for clinical use as a general anesthetic, but produced unwanted side effects such as convulsions on occasion, and for that reason was never marketed.|$|E

Anaesthesia was induced successfully in all patients. The slower rates of induction were associ-ated with a significant increase in induction time (ANOVA, P < 0. 01) and a decrease in the induction dose (P < 0. 01). There was a significant reduction in systolic arterial pressure after induction of anaesthesia in groups 2 and 3 (MANOVA, P < 0. 01). This study suggests that the induction dose of <b>eltanolone</b> in unpremedicated older patients should not exceed 0. 6 mgkg~ 1. (Br. J. Anaesth...|$|E
