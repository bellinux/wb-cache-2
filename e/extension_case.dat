50|$|If a field K {{contains}} a primitive n-th root {{of unity and}} the n-th root of an element of K is adjoined, the resulting Kummer extension is an abelian extension (if K has characteristic p we should say that p doesn't divide n, since otherwise this can fail even to be a separable extension). In general, however, the Galois groups of n-th roots of elements operate both on the n-th roots and on the roots of unity, giving a non-abelian Galois group as semi-direct product. The Kummer theory gives a complete description of the abelian <b>extension</b> <b>case,</b> and the Kronecker-Weber theorem tells us that if K is the field of rational numbers, an extension is abelian {{if and only if}} it is a subfield of a field obtained by adjoining a root of unity.|$|E

Although the alternative machines add more complexity to the problem, it simulates real world job shop production scheduling requirements more effectively. GAs {{have been widely used}} for scheduling problems but the quality of the solution mainly depends on the design of the solution procedure. Therefore, different strategies are presented and applied to form the initial population. A single individual crossover operator is applied to produce a new chromosome and a mutation operator is presented to generate alternative routes as well as to maintain the diversity of the population. The model was validated by using different instances taken from the literature. The result obtained from the computational study has shown that the proposed approach is a feasible and effective solution to the DJSP...|$|E
40|$|Background: Transcranial {{surgery is}} {{considered}} more appropriate than an endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) {{for a large}} cavernous sinus meningioma with lateral <b>extension.</b> <b>Case</b> presentation: A 6 -cm-diameter hypervascular meningioma around cavernous sinus invaded the orbital apex and infratemporal fossa. 80 % of the tumor was removed without too much blood loss via endoscopic endonasal transpterygoidal-infratemporal approach. Preoperative embolization from some feeding arteries was done, and 80 % of the tumor staining disappeared. Discussion: Tumor removal rates for giant meningioma are worse with EEA than with the transcranial approach because of various anatomical limitations and blood control. Recently, EEA has become more widely used with approaches such as the transpterygoidal approach. The operation can be done safely with preoperative embolization because the operative view is clear without bleeding. Conclusion: Preoperative embolization for a large hypervascular tumor makes EEA more effective. A giant meningioma can be removed by EEA if the anatomical limitations can be identified and approached safely and effectively...|$|E

40|$|Use case driven {{approach}} is a method of object oriented software engineering (OOSE) developed by Jacobson et al (1992). The requirement model of the use case driven approach software system is defined by a collection of use cases, problem domain descriptions and user interfaces. Extension is an important type of association between use <b>cases.</b> <b>Extension</b> means that a use case that represents the major or basic course of events can be naturally extended with one or several other use cases that represent rare or exceptional courses of events. A difficulty for OOSE to transform the use <b>cases</b> with <b>extension</b> associations into the design and implementation model {{of the system is}} that most programming Languages, such as C++, Smalltalk and Java, do not have features to support the extension association. The current implementation of an extension association still relies on the basic course use case to initiate the <b>extension</b> use <b>cases.</b> This thesis presents a programming technique to overcome the difficulty described above. It supports the integration of a major course use <b>case</b> and its <b>extension</b> use <b>cases.</b> Based on this technique, a mechanism extension construct invocation is proposed to directly support the extension association between use <b>cases.</b> The <b>extension</b> statement and probing clause allow an <b>extension</b> use <b>case</b> to automatically respond to any extension request from a basic course use case. This mechanism reduces the responsibility of a method that represents a basic course use <b>case</b> with <b>extension</b> statements. The probing clause added to a method that represents an <b>extension</b> use <b>case</b> can automatically respond to any extension request from a basic course use case.

40|$|A stress {{distribution}} of composite patch with an aluminum substrate {{was obtained by}} using stress functions and Kantorovich method when the substrate was under uniaxial extension and pure bending moment. The principle of complementary virtual work was applied to obtain the governing equations.

The interlaminar stresses reached maximum at the free edge and decreased quickly at the inner part of the patch. To demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method, cross-ply, angle-ply, and quasi-isotropic laminates patches were studied. Since the proposed analysis accurately predicts three-dimensional stresses in a composite patch not only uniaxial <b>extension</b> <b>case,</b> but also pure bending case, it is promising to use as an efficient tool for analyzing and designing such aerospace structural component.

30|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on Diem’s version of index {{calculus}} for ECDLP over a binary field of prime extension degree n [3, 7, 15]. In that case, the Weil descent is performed on a vector space {{that is not a}} subfield of F_ 2 ^n, and the resulting polynomial system cannot be re-written in terms of symmetric variables only. We therefore introduce a different method to take advantage of symmetries even in the prime degree <b>extension</b> <b>case.</b> While Shantz and Teske use the same multivariate system as FPPR method [7, 20], in this work we re-write the system with both symmetric and non-symmetric variables. The total number of variables is increased compared to [7, 15], but we limit this increase as much as possible thanks to an appropriate choice of the vector space V. On the other hand, the use of symmetric variables in our system allows reducing the degrees of the equations significantly. Our experimental results show that our systems can be solved faster than the original systems of [7, 15] as long as n is large enough.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background We {{report the}} use of salvage {{radiosurgery}} to manage an aggressive olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma) with multiple recurrences and intracranial <b>extension.</b> <b>Case</b> presentation A 43 -year-old Caucasian woman presented 11 years ago with progressive nasal blockage and headaches. A necrotic polyp originating in her left middle meatus and extending to the ethmoid air cells and cribriform plate (Kadish stage C) was radically resected via a craniofacial approach. Four years later, a local recurrence extending into her left cavernous sinus was identified and deemed inoperable. She received vincristine, ifosfamide, doxorubicin and etoposide chemotherapy (with minimal benefit) and external beam radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) to her skull base. Two years later, tumour extension in her left neck was treated with radical radiotherapy. She developed visual disturbances in her left eye, which progressed to blindness {{in the next two}} years. Having exhausted chemoradiotherapy, the left cavernous sinus esthesioneuroblastoma was treated with Gamma Knife® radiosurgery 2 [*]years ago (20 Gy at 50 % isodose, tumour volume 7. 5 cm 3). At one year, there was dramatic reduction in the tumour and no new symptoms; however, there were new tumour foci (in her left frontal lobe and above her right orbital apex). These were again treated with radiosurgery (20 Gy at 50 % isodose, total tumour volume 0. 67 cm 3). Repeat imaging at six months showed no further disease progression. Conclusion Whilst rare, olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma) can present management challenges and Gamma Knife® radiosurgery may prove a useful strategy in controlling intracranial spread. </p...|$|E
