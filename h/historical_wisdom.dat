60|$|We {{have more}} moral, {{political}} and <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom,</b> than {{we know how}} to reduce into practice; we have more scientific and economical knowledge than can be accommodated to the just distribution of the produce which it multiplies. The poetry in these systems of thought, is concealed by the accumulation of facts and calculating processes. There is no want of knowledge respecting what is wisest and best in morals, government, and political economy, or at least, what is wiser and better than what men now practise and endure. But we let 'I DARE NOT wait upon I WOULD, like the poor cat in the adage.' We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine; we want the poetry of life: our calculations have outrun conception; we have eaten more than we can digest. The cultivation of those sciences which have enlarged the limits of the empire of man over the external world, has, for want of the poetical faculty, proportionally circumscribed those of the internal world; and man, having enslaved the elements, remains himself a slave. To what but a cultivation of the mechanical arts in a degree disproportioned to the presence of the creative faculty, which is the basis of all knowledge, is to be attributed the abuse of all invention for abridging and combining labour, to the exasperation of the inequality of mankind? From what other cause has it arisen that the discoveries which should have lightened, have added a weight to the curse imposed on Adam? Poetry, and the principle of Self, of which money is the visible, incarnation, are the God and Mammon of the world.|$|E

50|$|In this context, antiscience may be {{considered}} dependent on religious, moral and cultural arguments. For this kind of religious antiscience philosophy, science is an anti-spiritual and materialistic force that undermines traditional values, ethnic identity and accumulated <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom</b> in favor of reason and cosmopolitanism. In particular, the traditional and ethnic values emphasized {{are similar to those}} of white supremacist Christian Identity theology, but similar right-wing views have been developed by radically conservative sects of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. New religious movements such as New Age thinking also criticize the scientific worldview as favouring a reductionist, atheist, or materialist philosophy.|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the word berith (covenant) in the <b>historical</b> and <b>wisdom</b> books of the Old Testament, and continues research done in previous articles on berith in the Pentateuch and the prophetic literature. The main aim is to discuss in some detail the texts containing the word berith in the <b>historical</b> and <b>wisdom</b> books of the Old Testament and to examine the meaning and use of the word in these writings. The interrelationships between berith and other words in the contexts in which they appear are explored and explained. Finally, berith in the <b>historical</b> and <b>wisdom</b> books usually refers to one of the covenants of the Pentateuch, and which of these is applicable in each case will also be discussed.

50|$|The Azuma Kagami was {{compiled}} after 1266 under the directive of the Hōjō shikken (officially a regent to a shogun, but {{the de facto}} ruler) and is a record in diary form of events occurring in Japan. Written in a Japanized version of classical Chinese known as hentai kanbun (変体漢文), the massive work was incomprehensible to most Japanese until an edition with furigana glosses was published in 1626. It was given in present to shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1603, who obtained the missing section from other daimyos and then ordered the preparation and publication of the Fushimi version of the Azuma Kagami in Kokatsujiban, the old movable-type printing. This edition in turn {{became the basis for}} the present printed editions. Ieyasu considered the book as the product of <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom,</b> kept it at his side, and consulted it often.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we begin}} to explore the role of content {{knowledge}} in responsive teaching (RT), using in situ data to draw out and speak to a latent disagreement within the literature. We claim that one role that content knowledge plays in RT is to support teachers in eliciting, seeing, and then pursuing disciplinary connections within their students’ thinking. We suggest an approach to teacher education that draws on the <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom</b> of the physics education research community, in which teachers develop content knowledge and then practice using that knowledge to listen and respond to student thinking...|$|E
40|$|This {{preliminary}} work focuses on curriculum and syllabus statements and on examination documents produced mainly in New South Wales from 1860. Two questions addressed here are: How might the pedagogical arrangements installed through state education {{during the latter}} half of the nineteenth century be described? And how did English teaching [...] rather than geography or history teaching [...] become aligned in the twentieth century with particular forms of moral and ethical conduct on the part of its students; conduct such as self-problematisation, self-reflection, empathy, and introspection? The paper provides some reminders about the early terrain of English education in Australia and questions the conventional <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom</b> that secondary school English either 'filtered down' from the universities or was established as a result of a battle between the populist, radical champions of 'literature' and the elite, conservative protectors of 'classics'...|$|E
40|$|The article {{intends to}} address the Son-of-Man problem by {{applying}} Delbert Burkett’s ‘question of reference’ to those Son-of-Man logia that appear in the Sayings Gospel Q. A position is taken that recent philological approaches to the Son-of-Man problem have not been overly convincing, successful or helpful. Similarly, attempting to determine the authenticity of individual Son-of-Man sayings has not led to any form of scholarly consensus. In place of these approaches, a synchronic approach is defended and applied to the Son-of-Man sayings in Q, with interesting results.

All this carried little conviction. Most members of parliament like to think with pretty large blinkers on, and though it may make for narrowness, {{this is consistent with}} much practical <b>wisdom.</b> <b>Historical</b> parallels in the actual politics of the day are usually rather decorative than substantial.|$|R
40|$|Ignoring {{historical}} {{arguments on}} issues such as market, political economy, capital, and labour has great potential danger. The currently pervasive connotation of ‘liberalisation’ to mean virtually only the freeing of private ‘market’ from ‘normative’ social regulations, looks rather archaic in the light of enormously perceptive discourse developed, with the advent of capitalism, on this issue and its offshoots such as freedom, liberty and social justice. A calculated neglect of this insightful <b>historical</b> scholarship and <b>wisdom</b> appears – consequentially – analogous to the religious fanatics’ strategic harping on relatively crude, ritualistic and watered-down aspects of religion vis-à-vis its tolerant and humanistic core. market, media, historical scholarship...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the political crowd as a World Historical Event (WHE). Historian’s define the latter as an episode, incident or emergency that transforms {{the course of}} history. The paper examines Hayden White’s discussion of the WHE and the grounds he submits for separating it from pseudo-events. Namely, the identification of collective trauma and the attribution of the episode as the fulfilment or ‘filling out’ of an historical sequence. The paper offers a preliminary taxonomy and concentrates on the non violent political crowd protest. It examines Occupy (2011) as a World Historical Event. It draws comparisons between Occupy, the Paris Commune (1871) and the May Spring in Paris (1968). The aim is to set the evidence about Occupy as a World Historical Event against claims made on its behalf by the media {{of the day and}} leading political and social commentators, notably David Harvey, Todd Gitlin, Cornell West and Noam Chomsky. The concept of ‘Event inflation’ is introduced and the claim that World Historical Events can only be determined by retrospective (<b>historical)</b> <b>wisdom</b> is advanced...|$|E
40|$|Computational {{neural network}} methods are {{increasingly}} being used for research-oriented data mining tasks. Kohonen self-organising map (SOM) techniques are well established within the so-called connectionist paradigm of Artificial Intelligence where neural networks are used to extract both explicit and implicit dependency values often between data that is sometimes disparate in type and kind. The research described here seeks to elicit relationships between grape varieties and their growing conditions using SOM techniques. In addition, utilising k-means and principle component analysis (PCA) methods, the data mined and depicted by the SOM technique is shown to have dependency values that enable a clustering of terms relating to variety quality {{to be associated with}} growing condition data to produce optimal locations for each. This study {{is part of a larger}} research project that uses comparative data from New Zealand and Chile. The text mining aspect of it forms one element of a ‘toolbox ’ of integrated hardware and software instruments being developed to underpin an environmental modelling methodology oriented not only towards grape growing but also generally for optimal crop production. The example described here uses data from New Zealand in the first instance. The paper begins with a summary of some <b>historical</b> <b>wisdom</b> relating to grape growing with a discussion of some previous studies and then describes the text mining of comments from wine tasters, which are statistically analysed. The results are clustered and the paper concludes with a reflection on the investigation with a pointer to future work in this aspect of the larger research project previously described...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{references}} to the first stages of human life in the Old Testament Scriptures. Some of them are formulations of both descriptions {{of the creation of}} man in the Book of Genesis, fragments of Psalms, <b>historical</b> books and <b>wisdom</b> literature. These fragments do not create a coherent conception, which illustrates the development of prenatal humanity. They rather point to God’s involvement in human conception and birth, which remains for us hidden and unconceivable. This article discusses questions of human conception in the context of Hebrew Scriptures. They serve {{as a starting point for}} reflections of the state of the human embryo from the perspective of Jewish bioethics...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} the first of three on the {{relationship}} between the Sayings Gospel Q and the ancient concept of ‘psychostasia,’ which is the ancient notion that a divine or supernatural figure weighed people’s souls when judging them. The ultimate goal of all three articles is to enhance our understanding of Q 6 : 37 – 38, {{as well as of the}} Q document as a whole. In the current article, attention is focused on intertexts from the Old Testament, and the occurrences therein of the word ‘measure’ and the concept of ‘psychostasia’. The implications of these results for our interpretation of Q 6 : 37 – 38 are briefly noted. A second (future) article will focus on intertexts in apocryphal and pseudepigraphical writings from Second Temple Judaism dealing with ‘psychostasia’. A third study will ultimately spell out in more comprehensive detail the implications of the foregoing intertextual investigations on both our understanding of Q 6 : 37 – 38 and our understanding of the Sayings Gospel Q as a whole.

40|$|The {{shifting}} {{context of}} Western social structures and global inter-relatedness demands leaders who can effectively navigate systems through chaos. This study hypothesized that wisdom is the construct that enables leaders to 2 ̆ 2 see 2 ̆ 2 and thus interpret a beneficial path of action. The {{purpose of the}} study was to explore how psychological wisdom theory relates to transformational leadership. The historical Jesus served as the model for this relationship. Using Biblical historical criticism, an analysis was done of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 wisdom in the Jewish wisdom tradition. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 wisdom was then compared to the features of psychological wisdom. Both deal with contradictions and change, exhibit exceptional judgment and understanding, and demonstrate communication and relationship skills. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 wisdom further clarified that wisdom functions best in conflict situations and that wisdom has an individual voice. Using Biblical social-scientific criticism, those sayings and parables recognized by historical Jesus scholars as authentic were used to analyze Jesus 2 ̆ 7 leadership in first century Palestine. A comparison of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 leadership to transformational leadership revealed a close affinity. Jesus 2 ̆ 2 saw 2 ̆ 2 the limitations of his social system, and he had a comprehensive vision and a focused passion for its renewal. Jesus 2 ̆ 7 leadership further suggested that effective transformational leaders find the source of their identity and security in a spiritual relationship. Conclusions were drawn by comparing the wisdom features and the transformational leadership features illustrated in the <b>historical</b> Jesus. First, <b>wisdom</b> and transformational leadership share certain factors. They both deal with ambiguity and change, are most beneficial during chaos, have effective communication and relationship skills, consider individual needs, and stimulate maturation in others. Second, the study found that wisdom clarifies 2 ̆ 2 how 2 ̆ 2 transformational leadership functions during chaos and change. The wisdom leadership of Jesus suggests that wise, transformational leaders have these additional features: (1) a paradoxical view of reality, allowing them to see limitations and new perspectives; (2) an individual voice able to give guidance for change; (3) a vision for renewal that is aware of moral impact and sourced in a spiritual identity; and (4) a comprehensive vision, impacting the renewal of many aspects of a social system...|$|R
40|$|This article {{offers a}} counter {{narrative}} {{to the conventional}} description of legal aid in the United States. By offering this counter narrative it focuses us on certain enduring difficulties that any legal aid or legal services program has to face {{if it wants to}} engage in reform efforts: problems of funding and problems of the social and <b>historical</b> context. Conventional <b>wisdom</b> has it that legal aid until the 1960 s was largely devoted to individual cases and that {{it was not until the}} advent of federally-funded legal services that law reform and social change became part of the delivery of legal services to the poor. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, there is another story. As this article demonstrates, there was an aspiration toward using the legal system aggressively to achieve social justice during the period 1900 to roughly 1920. This changed during the 1920 s. In presenting this counter-narrative, this article first looks at legal aid during the period 1900 - 1920 to support the thesis that during this period legal aid aspired toward using the legal system to achieve social justice. It then looks at that next decade, the 1920 s, and describes how legal aid became the kind of organization that conventional wisdom describes: a legal aid organization devoted almost solely to individual cases with a large focus on domestic relations practice and abandoning any attempt to use law to achieve social justice. More importantly, this article explores why this change to a more traditional type of legal aid occurred. The most interesting theories blame Reginald Heber Smith and the American Bar Association. Smith is blamed because of his alleged emphasis on access to justice in a landmark study of legal aid called “Justice and the Poor” published in 1919. The ABA is blamed because of the alleged “takeover” of legal aid by the conservative bar in the 1920 ’s, enabled by the ABA’s establishment of a standing committee on legal aid. These theories, however, are too reductionist and overlook two more important explanations for this retreat from law reform: the need for funding and the social and historical context. These explanations are significant not only because they shed light on a neglected part of our past, but because they connect that past to issues that persist until today...|$|R
40|$|A {{short and}} {{selective}} {{catalogue of the}} reception of the psalmic texts in the Book of Judith {{tells us that the}} author of this deuterocanonical text of the Bible used the psalmody tradition a great deal. The Book of Psalms contains 150 psalms and the actual collection of psalms according to the doxologies is divided into five “books”; the Book of Psalms contains various literary kinds, such as: complaints, songs of praise, hymns, royal psalms and so-called shorter literary kinds. In these literary kinds we can find a <b>historical</b> orientation, didacticism, <b>wisdom</b> and so on. Perhaps the most important characteristic of the psalms is the teaching. Teaching in the Book of Psalms is divided into three thematic wholes: God; the believer and suffering; sin, repentance, forgiveness of sins. A separate theological analysis confirms to us that God as creator of the world and order in the world was {{in the history of the}} people of Israel always the defender of his people, i. e., of the people of Israel. Testimony is found in the so-called historical psalms, when the author of the psalms, in a framework of praise and learning, brings to life all those great themes that are known to us from the Pentateuch. If we consider the Biblical text of the history of Judith and Holofernes, we have to conclude that the psalmist’s theme of God, the believer and suffering and repentance and forgive-ness of sins appears numbers of times in the Book of Judith in a theological sense. All this appears several times, symbolically, manifoldly and out of scale in the segment of the Book of Judith in which Achior leaves his pagan faith and con-verts to the faith of Israel: “Then Achior, seeing the strength that had been shown by the God of Israel, left his false laws, believed in God, made his way…, and was entered into the number of the people of Israel, as his descendants are to this day”. After this it is logical to conclude that Jehovah is the only and almighty god that can defeat the ungodly forces and always have the power to defend his nation in the severest of situations. The people of Bethulia, knowing this, and being convinced of the power of God, at the end of the Assyrian campaign, see that the deed of Judith is a paradigm of faith and trust in God and for this reason have to thank him. After the victory of Judith over the Assyrians, the people of Bethulia celebrate the victrix, Judith, who sings the song of gratitude to God, in the form of the Biblical text the psalmic paraphrase...|$|R
