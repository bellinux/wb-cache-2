Across the world, around 20% of desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia. Where sand does occur, it is usually in large quantities {{in the form of}} sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they find on the ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E

Walk past a bar, and you'll hear the noise of the drunken patrons inside. Wander near a slave auction, and you'll hear the auctioneer calling. Go to a party in the festival hall, and it sounds just like a party". The same reviewer also stated [...] "Planescape has just about the best sound I've ever heard in a game." [...] IGN gave the sound 8.5 out of 10 and noted that [...] "The game has fantastic speech and sound effects, but what's more impressive <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> fade in and out depending on how close you're standing to them." ...|$|E

Similarly, Wilson praised the writers for {{achieving}} [...] "genuine poignancy" [...] in half an hour, and critics in the Metro said that the episode [...] "packs more drama and suspense into 30 minutes than many a five-part series". Mulkern said the episode was a [...] "superb piece of drama, imbued with an increasing sense of dread". The story's ending was praised, with Dessau saying that [...] "One of the skills of actor/writers Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> plant seeds and gradually leak out details. They do it so expertly here that one really doesn't see what is coming." [...] McDowall expressed a similar thought, saying that the [...] "writers so cleverly threw us off the scent, making the eventual realisation so agonising". Wilson called the ending [...] "devastating and unforeseen".|$|E
500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E
500|$|Whether the {{collection}} has a unified structure {{has been a}} source of debate among Hemingway critics. According to Reynolds {{the collection}} should be [...] "read as a predictable step in any young author's career" [...] and the pieces considered as [...] "discrete units". Yet he admits that Hemingway's remarks, and the complexity of the structure, suggests the stories and vignettes were meant to be an interconnected whole. In a letter to Pound in August 1923, Hemingway told him he had finished the full set of eighteen vignettes, saying of them, [...] "When they are read together, they all hook up... The bulls start, then reappear, then finish off. The war starts clear and noble just like it did... gets close and blurred and finished with the feller who goes home and gets clap." [...] He went on to say of [...] "in our time" [...] that [...] "it has form all right". On October 18, 1924, he wrote to Edmund Wilson, [...] "Finished the book of 14 stories with a chapter of 'In Our Time' between each story– that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are meant to go– to give the picture of the whole before examining it in detail".|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of {{philosophical}} schools and subtle nuances between many, all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories, which are defined in contrast to each other: idealism and materialism. The basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality, and the primary distinction between them <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> answer two fundamental questions: [...] "what does reality consist of?" [...] and [...] "how does it originate?" [...] To idealists, spirit or mind or the objects of mind (ideas) are primary, and matter secondary. To materialists, matter is primary, and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary, the product of matter acting upon matter.|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} aspect of the study of Lie groups is their representations, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> can act (linearly) on vector spaces. In physics, Lie groups often encode the symmetries of a physical system. The way one makes use of this symmetry to help analyze the system is often through representation theory. Consider, for example, the time-independent Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics, [...] Assume the system in question has the rotation group SO(3) as a symmetry, meaning that the Hamiltonian operator [...] commutes with the action of SO(3) on the wave function [...] (One important example of such a system is the Hydrogen atom.) This assumption {{does not necessarily mean that}} the solutions [...] are rotationally invariant functions. Rather, it means that the space of solutions to [...] is invariant under rotations. This space, therefore, constitutes a representation of SO(3). These representations have been [...] and the classification leads to a substantial simplification of the problem, essentially converting a three-dimensional partial differential equation to a one-dimensional ordinary differential equation.|$|E

2500|$|Although the etymological {{origins of}} [...] "Wa" [...] remain uncertain, Chinese {{historical}} texts recorded an ancient people {{residing in the}} Japanese archipelago (perhaps Kyūshū), named something like *ʼWâ or *ʼWər 倭. Carr (1992:9–10) surveys prevalent proposals for Wa's etymology ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns waga 我が [...] "my; our" [...] and ware 我 [...] "I; oneself; thou") to shameful (writing Japanese Wa as 倭 implying [...] "dwarf"), and summarizes interpretations for *ʼWâ [...] "Japanese" [...] into variations on two etymologies: [...] "behaviorally 'submissive' or physically 'short'." [...] The first [...] "submissive; obedient" [...] explanation began with the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary. It defines 倭 as shùnmào 順皃 [...] "obedient/submissive/docile appearance", graphically explains the [...] "person; human" [...] radical 亻 with a wěi 委 [...] "bent" [...] phonetic, and quotes the above Shijing poem. [...] "Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese," [...] Carr (1992:9) suggests [...] "they transcribed Wa as *ʼWâ 'bent back' signifying 'compliant' bowing/obeisance. Bowing is noted in early historical references to Japan." [...] Examples include [...] "Respect is shown by squatting" [...] (Hou Han Shu, tr. Tsunoda 1951:2), and [...] "they either squat or kneel, with {{both hands on the}} ground. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> show respect." [...] (Wei Zhi, tr. Tsunoda 1951:13). Koji Nakayama interprets wēi 逶 [...] "winding" [...] as [...] "very far away" [...] and euphemistically translates Wō 倭 as [...] "separated from the continent." [...] The second etymology of wō 倭 meaning [...] "dwarf, pygmy" [...] has possible cognates in ǎi 矮 [...] "low, short (of stature)", wō 踒 [...] "strain; sprain; bent legs", and wò 臥 [...] "lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)". Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a Zhūrúguó 侏儒國 [...] "pygmy/dwarf country" [...] located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as [...] "submissive people" [...] and the [...] "Country of Dwarfs" [...] legend as evidence that the [...] "little people" [...] etymology was a secondary development.|$|E
