5|$|Steinholt <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that small}} {{municipalities}} should be merged {{because of their}} economic problems. She feels the government focus on the struggling economy of the municipalities should be towards cleaning up their debt. In 2008 alone, the municipalities of Norway had a gathered debt of NOK 20.7 billion. She stated that if Red was elected to parliament, they would propose a bill giving the municipalities an immediate transfer of NOK 10 billion.|$|E

[...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in nature, just as I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in Odin. She is a myth.

5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> their claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found}} in a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul {{was one of three}} U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E

5|$|Elton <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|In the present, Detective Munch <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Byers' story, {{but it is}} soon {{corroborated by}} Mulder.

Susanne is then captured by X, who leers at the Lone Gunmen as he departs with her. Later, the three of them meet Mulder in the convention center and explain what happened to him.|$|E
5|$|It {{states that}} {{the theory of the}} Arab hijackers was created by the CIA, and that these Arabs may not even have been aware that the planes were going to crash. Seven of the alleged hijackers are claimed in the book to have been found alive and well after the attacks. The book explores the {{possibility}} that the various aircraft could have been remote-controlled. It cites observations in support of the theory that the collapse of the World Trade Center might have been due to explosives. Von Bülow <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are responsible for the 9/11 attacks.|$|E

Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the lead smelter.|$|E
5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to the strength of his performance.|$|E
5|$|The two armies {{meet in the}} Battle of Shrewsbury, but Falstaff hides in shrubs {{for most}} of the conflict. After a long and bloody fight, the King's men win the battle, after which Hotspur and Hal meet alone and duel; as Falstaff watches, Hal kills Hotspur. Henry {{sentences}} Worcester to death and takes his men as prisoners. Falstaff brings Hotspur's body to Henry, claiming that he killed Hotspur; Henry <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> Falstaff, instead looking disapprovingly at Hal and the ignoble company he keeps.|$|E

5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing." [...] Augustine: [...] "If you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Christ; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Son of God; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the Word of the Father; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the author of the world; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am the former and the reformer of man, his creator and recreator, He Who made him and remade him; if you <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that I Am that, you will die in your sins. This I Am, He says He Is, is embarrassing. Even if Moses could understand this, how could the people to whom he was being sent understand it? In point of fact, he did add: 'I Am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Exodus 3, 13-15)(Augustine on the Gospel of St. John) (Gilson, p. 85) ...|$|R
5|$|Asexual {{organizations}} and other Internet resources {{play a key}} role in informing people about asexuality. The lack of research makes it difficult for doctors to understand the causation. Like with any sexual orientation, most people who are asexual are self-identified. This can be a problem when asexuality is mistaken for an intimacy or relationship problem or for other symptoms that do not define asexuality. There is also a significant population that either does not understand or <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> in asexuality, which adds to the importance of these organizations to inform the general population; however, due to the lack of scientific fact on the subject, what these groups promote as information is often questioned.|$|E

Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus; she is weakest when she is hungry and must feed on flesh in order to sustain her life and appearance. Needy tells Chip about her discoveries and warns him not to attend the school dance. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> her, so she breaks up with him {{in order to protect}} him. Chip still goes to the dance, hoping to meet with Needy, but is instead intercepted by Jennifer, who seduces him and takes him to an abandoned pool house. Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her.

Ian and Erin are working at a hardware store; Wendy saves Ian from being impaled by falling planks of wood, causing Death to skip him and move onto Erin, who falls onto a nail gun and is shot repeatedly in the head.

While leaving the police station, Wendy is stalked by a grief-stricken Ian.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> that the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol bursts into tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> {{that he is a}} good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
