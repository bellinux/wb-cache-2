500|$|Hall of Fame {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72, based on 14 reviews. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly positively compared the album {{to the late}} 90's releases by Bad Boy and said that Big Sean easily outshines all the featured artists on the album. At USA Today, Edna Gunderson called this, an [...] "outstanding second album" [...] that he [...] "occasionally stumbles" [...] in an effort that is a [...] "smart set of slick club thumpers, tear-jerkers and introspective yarns." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone commented saying, [...] "The Detroit MC gets over on congeniality and crisp delivery, even when his lyrics are pro forma."

At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff noted that [...] "Hall of Fame is still a solid, confident and diverse set that shows how much he's grown as both an MC and a writer since 'Finally Famous' came out in 2011." [...] Andrea Aguilar of HipHopDX summarized the album stating, [...] "As a whole, the feel-good album's set of eclectic beats doesn't disappoint, but it lacks diversity. Most of Sean's content still teems with predictable material risking leaving listeners disinterested. Random skits also slightly interrupt {{the flow of the}} album, but if you're looking for motivational music centered on the money, the cars, the clothes and hoes, this album is sure to <b>get</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> replays on your iPod and local radio stations alike." ...|$|E
