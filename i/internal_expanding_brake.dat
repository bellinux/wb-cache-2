5000|$|The Flying Cloud was {{the first}} car to use Lockheed's new {{hydraulic}} <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brake</b> system and featured styling by Fabio Segardi. While Ned Jordan is credited with changing the way advertising was written with his [...] "Somewhere West of Laramie" [...] ads for his Jordan Playboy, Reo's Flying Cloud——a name that provoked evocative images of speed and lightness——changed the way automobiles would be named in the future. It had a 115 in wheelbase. The final REO model of 1936 was a Flying Cloud.|$|E
50|$|The tractor {{is built}} using a {{frameless}} block construction. The rear axle is a portal axle, the front axle is a swing axle. The wheelbase is 1668 mm. The {{track of the}} front wheels can be increased by turning the rims on the vertical axis. The <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brake</b> brakes the back wheels only. It can also act as a steering brake. The steering gear and the gearbox were produced by ZF Friedrichshafen. All Porsche-Diesel 218 tractors have a six gear gearbox with a crawler gear. The clutch is the single-disk dry clutch K 200 Z by Fichtel & Sachs. It operates with an oil hydraulic clutch by Voith. The exception is the Standard V 218, which has a five gear gearbox only. It also lacks the oil hydraulic clutch. Porsche-Diesel offered a Three-point linkage as an optional equipment. It can lift up to 550 kg The second optional equipment is a mowing bar. It was offered for DM 500. The weight of the tractor is 1625 kg including the three-point-linkage, the mower bar and the extra weights. The maximum weight allowed is 2300kg. The paint is RAL 3002 Karminrot for the body and RAL 1014 or 1015 Elfenbein for the rims. The Standard 218 doesn't have a fuel tap due to tightness problems.|$|E
50|$|The Aland was a four {{cylinder}} 2.5liter 16-valve, single ohc automobile with diagonally-connected four-wheel <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> {{and aluminum}} pistons. It {{was made in}} Detroit, Michigan, by the Aland Motor Car Company between 1916 and 1917. Two and five seater bodied versions were available for $1500.|$|R

Both front and rear wheels run on opposed high-grade taper roller bearings on an alloy steel spindle, which is designed for easy wheel removal. Highly efficient car type <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> are used.|$|R
5000|$|The Lion was an {{automobile}} built in Adrian, Michigan, United States, by the Lion Motor Car Company from 1909-12. The Lion had a four-cylinder 40 hp engine, and {{was available in}} at least three body types. The 1912 model cost $1,600 and came equipped with <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> with drums of 14 in diameter. A fire in 1912 destroyed 150 cars in the factory, and the company never recovered and closed.|$|R
25|$|Rover {{supplied}} 499cc {{single cylinder}} motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. The company {{began to focus}} on car production {{at the end of the}} war, but Rover still produced motorcycles with 248cc and 348cc Rover overhead valve engines and with JAP engines, including a 676cc V-twin. In 1924 Rover introduced a new lightweight 250cc motorcycle with unit construction of engine and gearbox. This had lights front and rear as well as a new design of <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{chassis frame}} has an {{underframe}} {{designed to make}} {{a unit of the}} engine and gearbox both of which are supported by it along the full length of both their sides. Suspension is by semi-elliptic springs all round. At the rear universal-jointed radius rods tie the rear-axle casing to the chassis frame. A triangular torque rod held at its front end by a spring buffer resists the reaction of driving and <b>braking.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> are fitted to the rear wheels together with an external hinged shoe brake behind the gear box.|$|R
50|$|The Topper had 5 inch <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> drum <b>brakes</b> on both wheels. The {{front brake}} was {{controlled}} by a hand lever on the left handlebar with a parking brake lock; the rear brake {{was controlled by}} a pedal.|$|R
5000|$|Rover {{supplied}} 499cc {{single cylinder}} motorcycles to the Russian Army during the First World War. When the war ended, {{the company began}} to focus on car production, yet Rover still produced motorcycles with 248cc and 348cc Rover overhead valve engines and J.A.P. engines, including a 676cc V-Twin. In 1924, Rover led the way with the unit construction of the engine and gearbox on a new lightweight 250cc motorcycle. This had lights on the front and rear as well as a new design of <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes.</b> [...] Following poor sales, Rover ceased to produce both bicycles and motorcycles. Between 1903 and 1924 Rover had produced more than 10,000 motorcycles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hand lever}} to the driver's {{right by the}} change-speed lever {{operates}} <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> on the back wheels, the foot brake pedal operates a contracting band on a drum just behind the gearbox. A hand adjustment for wear is provided for both rear and transmission brakes. The Times thought the suspension was not quite free from fore and aft movement but was otherwise satisfactory and comfortable on a rough road. The springs are set {{with a minimum of}} camber, they are half-elliptical, set on top of the axles and from 1923 Hartford shock absorbers were fitted at the back. [...] Steering is by worm and complete wheel and can be adjusted for wear ...|$|R
50|$|When {{production}} of the 350 resumed in 1920, it was much improved. The side-valve engine {{was replaced by a}} new overhead-valve design that produced 10 bhp. It also had <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> and chain primary drive. Cyril Williams won the first post war 1920 Isle of Man TT Junior race on his 350, even though he had to push the motorcycle home for almost four miles (mostly downhill) after a breakdown. AJS took the first four places in the 1921 Isle of Man TT, and Howard R Davies bettered his second place in the Junior by winning the Senior on the same 350 cc AJS. This was the first time a 350 had won the 500 cc Senior TT race. In 1922 Manxman Tom Sheard won the Junior on an AJS, with G Grinton, also on an AJS, taking second.|$|R
50|$|In 1925, a 500 cc {{version with}} linked {{front and rear}} brakes appeared, and the big end {{bearings}} were now fed oil through the crankshaft pin. The old 350 cc was dropped in 1926. For 1928 Rudge motorcycles were fitted with saddle tanks, and 8-inch <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> drum <b>brakes.</b> Stanley Glanfield designed a Rudge for dirt racing, marketed from 1928 as the Glanfield Rudge.|$|R
5000|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 39 mph. [...] There is a {{transmission}} brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> drum <b>brakes</b> on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Springing is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear of some of the cars. Artillery type wheels were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Light 20 has a {{top speed}} of 50 mph (52 mph on the TT versions) and the Heavy 20 47 mph. This speed would be reduced if a heavy body was fitted. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> drum <b>brakes</b> on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} a {{water-cooled}} twin-cylinder of 1800 cc enlarged to 1995 cc on later cars, with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves, {{and based on}} the original Royce engine but with an improved crankshaft. The power output was [...] at 1000 rpm. The car has a top speed of 39 mph. There is a transmission brake fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> drum <b>brakes</b> on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever.

50|$|The Plymouth {{automobile}} {{was introduced}} at Madison Square Garden on July 7, 1928. It was Chrysler Corporation's first {{entry in the}} low-priced field, {{which at the time}} was already dominated by Chevrolet and Ford. Plymouths were initially priced higher than the competition, but offered standard features such as <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> hydraulic <b>brakes</b> that Ford and Chevrolet did not provide. Plymouths were originally sold exclusively through Chrysler dealerships, offering a low-cost alternative to the upscale Chrysler-brand cars. The logo featured a rear view of the ship Mayflower which landed at Plymouth Rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts. However, the inspiration for the Plymouth brand name came from Plymouth binder twine, produced by the Plymouth Cordage Company, also of Plymouth. The name was chosen by Joe Frazer due to the popularity of the twine among farmers.|$|R

50|$|Brakes were {{mechanical}} on {{the rear}} wheels only, working either by pedal (external contracting) or lever (<b>internal</b> <b>expanding).</b> Following the owner's manual, either was sufficient for stopping under normal conditions.|$|R
50|$|With the Rover 8 and Rover 9/20 chassis and {{enlarged}} 9/20 engine the 10/25 chassis was conventional with rigid axles {{and leaf}} spring suspension all round, half elliptic at the front and quarter elliptic behind. The four cylinder, overhead valve engine's capacity had been increased by ten per cent to 1185 cc. Drive was to the rear wheels through a three speed gearbox. There were internally <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> on all four wheels. Its magneto ignition was replaced by coil ignition in 1929.|$|R
50|$|In 1913 {{the engine}} was {{replaced}} by a water-cooled Precision, V twin of 964 cc. There were other improvements including changing the <b>brakes</b> to <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> and replacing the chain with shaft drive. The price rose to £135.|$|R

50|$|The Premier cyclecar was {{launched}} in 1912. Described at the 1912 Motor Cycle and Cycle Car Show as 'a smart looking two-seater vehicle with coachwork torpedo-type body at 100 guineas'. The engine was a 998 cc air-cooled V-twin (85mm bore, 88mm stroke) with special heavy flywheel for cyclecar work and Bosch magneto. The transmission included a leather cone clutch and two speed gearbox (with reverse), and the rear axle included a differential, there was enclosed chain drive throughout. The chassis was of 'tubular trussed construction' with half elliptic front springing and quarter elliptic rear. The brakes comprised a foot operated band brake operating on the transmission countershaft, and two internally <b>expanding</b> <b>brakes</b> on the rear axle operated by the hand brake lever.|$|R
50|$|The wheels were of single-piece cast alloy, {{the front}} being {{equipped}} with sealed ball races, possibly {{a first for}} the industry.An alloy GB T91 Sprite caliper brake was employed at the front, while the rear brake was of the <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> type, integral with the three speed gear in the Sturmey Archer ‘AB’ hub. It appears as though the drive side flange of the hub was removed for fitting in the wheel.|$|R

50|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 55 mph. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a 12.5 in drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> 12 in drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways helper spring on the rear. The axle is located by a triangular strut linking axle and chassis and the main drive thrust is transmitted to the car by links between the ends of the axle and forward spring brackets. By this means the springs are only responsible for suspension. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{foot brake}} {{operates}} on the transmission and the lever brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. Both sets are of the <b>internal</b> <b>expanding</b> type. The adjustment for wear of the foot brake may be made by hand but adjustment of the rear brakes requires a spanner. Twelve months later front brakes were made available on new cars for a further £55. A year later again they were standardised on the 23-60 in July 1924 along with a redesigned front axle, springs and saddle-plate. Operated by the foot pedal the front brakes and the transmission brake were linked, the latter being given a slight lead. The brakes on the rear wheels were independently controlled by the handbrake lever.|$|R
