[...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour up a bit. It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E

[...] Skinner gives {{a description of the}} events leading up to his scheduled execution in 2010, which was stayed only minutes before it was to occur. He ate a large last meal and was given the last rites by a priest. He discusses his feelings approaching the execution, and his perception of time on death row.|$|E

Asked about same-sex marriage by the National Catholic Reporter after his appointment was announced, he indicated that same-sex couples cannot show children that their parents love {{each other in the}} same way that opposite-sex couples can: [...] "As children, if we don't know that our parents love one another, our lives are very unstable. That's why I think every child deserves a family where the father loves the mother, and the mother loves the father.... It's also important to say that we're not against gay people.

It was {{produced}} by Sergio Andrade and originally released in 1989 by Sony International. The album became massively popular with the mainstream Mexican audience because of songs such as [...] "Dr. Psiquiatra", [...] "Satisfecha", [...] "Ultimo Beso", and [...] "Mañana". This album is noted for using two popular English language songs: [...] "Last Kiss" [...] and [...] "Satisfaction", but both songs were sung in Spanish (in the version of a woman to a man, as Trevi would later described it). These songs (tracks four and five) were perfectly translated into Spanish and became very popular, helping the album sell over 2,000,000 copies.|$|E

5000|$|Fanning was {{appointed}} Acting Under Secretary of the Army and Chief Management Officer by President Obama on June 30, 2015. On September 18, 2015, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would nominate Fanning as United States Secretary of the Army, and the President did so on November 3, 2015. Fanning left that position on January 11, 2016, {{to concentrate on}} his confirmation, being succeeded in the temporary position by Patrick Murphy. The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee held Fanning's nomination hearing on January 21, 2016, and approved his nomination on a voice vote on March 10, 2016, though a hold was placed on it by Senator Pat Roberts, citing comments President Obama had made about closing the Guantanamo Bay prison. Senators John McCain, chair of the Armed Services Committee, and Roberts argued about the nomination in the Senate in late April 2016. McCain said: [...] "What we're <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> we're telling a nominee, who is totally qualified, totally, eminently qualified for the job, that that person cannot fulfill those responsibilities and take on that very important leadership post because of an unrelated issue. That is not the appropriate use of senatorial privilege." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the 2000s, musicologists {{and historians}} {{acknowledge}} {{the importance of}} distinguishing specifically which instrument a composer intended, or if the composer allowed the ensemble leader to choose the instruments for each part. Assigning specific names and classifying violoni as different types, as we are <b>doing</b> <b>here,</b> <b>is</b> a modern attempt to clarify things. Loosely described, bowed string instruments are made in families so that different sized members can play in different ranges, with treble instruments corresponding to the soprano and bass instruments corresponding to the lowest vocal range (or even lower, down to the [...] "contrabass" [...] register). Members of the violin family are the easiest to identify in this way: with the violin corresponding to the soprano, the viola to the alto singer, violoncello to the tenor, and bass to the bass ranges of the human voice (historically, the violin family was made in more than just these four sizes: there were originally several sizes of violas, as well as instruments smaller than the modern violin, for example). The viol family also comprises instruments in a multitude of sizes. In North America in the 21st century, we classify them as 'treble' viols (soprano), 'tenor' viols (alto range), 'bass' viols (tenor range) and 'great bass' viols, 'violoni' and violones (bass range).|$|E

Without the approval of the government and not known by whose invitation, the guest with US epaulets are staying in the capital’s hotel Shipka. What are they <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> not fully clear". This was the inception of the Military Liaison team in Bulgaria, and the first members of the liaison team arrived in Bulgaria in late July 1993, team chief was Colonel Gary G. Chamberlin accompanied by three more US military personnel. As elsewhere, the liaison team’s first task upon arrival was to develop a country work plan. Much patience was required on the part of the Americans to overcome the obstacles and complete the first work plan. The transparency of the contact program and repeated demonstrations of American intention to respond to priorities set by the host nation were the keys to this effort. The plan, completed in November 1993, contained a list of the 16 events, a plan for the next quarter consisting of 44 events, and a yearly work plan of 15 core events. Although the contact program was not able to conduct all of the events during the first quarter, the staff did schedule most of them during the remainder of 1994. This is how everything started and evaluated to the extent where the partners’ efforts are constant throughout the years and aim at achieving higher and higher levels of interoperability and mutual trust and understanding.|$|E

I only care what you think. What we’re <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> thinking, trying to understand”.
