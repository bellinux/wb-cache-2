40|$|Electrical power {{distribution}} on ships {{is similar to}} land based systems. Harmonic distortion is prevalent in both systems and equally detrimental in the modern era. It {{is important to understand}} and investigate the effect of harmonics on a ship’s Power Distribution System, when at sea, especially if the ship uses modern electronic variable speed drive (VSD) technology to control its electrical propulsion in conjunction with other electronic switching devices, such as, uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) and switch mode power supplies (SMPSs) as they are responsible for voltage and current waveform distortion. Further, in the modern era, over 90 % of the world’s global trade goods are transported on cargo ships and environmentalists are expressing great concern at the volume of greenhouse gas being released into the atmosphere by ships. A need has thus also arisen to investigate emissions when ships are “coldironing”. This is the process of providing <b>electrical</b> <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> to a ship that has docked or berthed in a harbour while its main and auxiliary engines are turned off to decrease emissions. This paper thus investigates and analyses the harmonic distortion levels on a ship using a measurement based case study research approach taking before and after an upgrade to a mining ship’s power system into account. The paper also looks at the need for coldironing by considering the emissions produced by docking ships. Recommendations are made. understanding power quality due to “Cold-Ironing ” [3] is also of importance. There is growing interest in ships’ “Cold-Ironing ” [3] namely, using shore power when docking, thus allowing them to turn off their main and auxiliary engines. Conducting a harmonic analysis on a ship, provides insight into the distribution methods, distribution scheme layout and determining the distortion level of waveforms onboard. With this insight, one is able to determine the distortion impact and implication of cold-ironing for both a ship and its shore power supply. Cold-ironing is a relatively new focus and idea for large sea going vessels and since there is only a limited amount of information available, this concept needs investigation.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis was {{an investigation of}} the causes that prevented large numbers of Pacific Fleet units' NSA expenditures from processing through the Fleet Resource Accounting Module (FRAM) at the Fleet Accounting and Disbursing Center Pacific (FAADCPAC), San Diego, CA. Six consecutive months' NSA expenditure errors from December 1989 to May 1990 were used in the analysis. The researcher concluded that the major cause of the problem was the use of wrong fund codes by the fleet units when they requisitioned their materials from the <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> activities. The researcher identified inadequate training of shipboard supply personnel and the lack of an edit/validation process at the <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> activities, as the major deficiencies.

40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, it is {{becoming}} an increasingly common requirement for ships to shut down ship generators and connect to high voltage shore power {{for as long as}} practicable while in port. Ship electrical equipment shall only be connected to <b>shore</b> <b>supplies</b> that are able to maintain harbor distribution system voltage quality. Voltage drop, which is produced by the possible loading conditions of a ship when connected to a <b>shore</b> <b>supply,</b> may result in unsatisfactory operation of, and damage to, electrical and electronic equipment on board and thus, must be considered in the harbor distribution system design in order to comply with the requirements of international standards. A simple and fast method able to estimate the expected magnitude of voltage drops and provide information about the effectiveness of the various mitigation methods is essential. This paper presents the methodology and results for evaluation of the voltage drops of a practical harbor electrical distribution system with high voltage shore connection (HVSC). The potential voltage drops of the implemented HVSC are quantified using standard analytical formulas. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the critical parameters that significantly affect voltage drops. The parameters that have great improvement benefits should have high priority for implementation in other distribution systems with HVSC. The results obtained in this paper can provide engineers with useful information regarding the actual magnitude of voltage drops, {{as well as on the}} effectiveness of mitigation options for voltage drops, which would greatly enhance HV <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> quality...|$|R

40|$|Shore power connection, a {{practice}} whereby shore-side electrical power is provided to vessels at berth in a port, {{is set to}} play a major role in shaping the future energy requirements of the commercial shipping industry. Short circuit level compatibility of systems is a problem when a ship power system is connected to a <b>shore</b> <b>electrical</b> distribution system. A method that is able to evaluate the shore-side and ship-side impedances and determine the prospective short circuit current level is essential. This paper aims at presenting a methodology for calculating the short circuit current in the shore power connection system. Two analysis models: IEC std. 61363 - 1 and IEC std. 60909 - 0 combined with IEC std. 60909 - 0 are developed and used in this paper for short circuit current analysis. Performance of the proposed method is validated by short circuit current calculation results gathered from several visiting ship scenarios in a practical shore power connection system. The proposed method can provide engineers with useful information about the prospective magnitude of short circuit currents, as well as on the effect of <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> on ship power system, to assist them in ensuring short circuit level compatibility and allowing the selection and setting of protective devices...|$|R

5000|$|In {{single-ended}} single-phase systems {{where the}} Earth and neutral are combined (TN-C, and {{the part of}} TN-C-S systems which uses a combined neutral and earth core), {{if there is a}} contact problem in the PEN conductor, then all parts of the earthing system beyond the break will rise to the potential of the L conductor. In an unbalanced multi-phase system, the potential of the earthing system will move towards that of the most loaded line conductor. Such a rise in the potential of the neutral beyond the break is known as a neutral inversion. Therefore, TN-C connections must not go across plug/socket connections or flexible cables, where there is a higher probability of contact problems than with fixed wiring. There is also a risk if a cable is damaged, which can be mitigated by the use of concentric cable construction and multiple earth electrodes. Due to the (small) risks of the lost neutral raising 'earthed' metal work to a dangerous potential, coupled with the increased shock risk from proximity to good contact with true earth, the use of TN-C-S supplies is banned in the UK for caravan sites and <b>shore</b> <b>supply</b> to boats, and strongly discouraged for use on farms and outdoor building sites, and in such cases it is recommended to make all outdoor wiring TT with RCD and a separate earth electrode.|$|R

40|$|The Micro-System design {{approach}} of electric systems has the purpose {{to improve their}} safety, maintenance, operation and reliability. The Micro-System design approach {{can be applied to}} the case of marinas, where pleasure craft may be moored. Marinas require a structured architecture for the <b>shore</b> <b>electrical</b> power distribution system, which supply power to distributed loads. In addition, the design must provide for solutions to electrical hazards, as possible stray currents circulating through the earth and the water. The Island-grounding system, which utilizes separation transformers grounded at the mid-point of their secondary sides, allows to supply loads divided into “islands” as independent electrical areas. This distribution system is an effective way to protect persons from shock hazards in installations with contained demand load, and to greatly limit electrical interferences among systems. According to these authors, the TN-Island-grounding system is the best option to <b>supply</b> <b>shore</b> power to pleasure craft in marinas. This paper substantiates that the TN-Island-grounding system allows the development of “hybrid” solutions that lend themselves to the application of either the NEC-USA or the IEC-UE codes and standards. This important achievement would contribute to eliminate technical obstacles and discourage market barriers still existing worldwide...|$|R
