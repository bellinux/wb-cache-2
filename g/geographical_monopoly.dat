40|$|CRM is {{becoming}} critical to organisations worldwide as global competition increases and technological innovations in communication continue to emerge. In this descriptive case study, we have investigated a utility provider – with a <b>geographical</b> <b>monopoly,</b> who has successfully implemented a complaint management system, {{as part of}} their CRM process transformation. We have applied the teleological process theory (Ven de Ven and Poole 1995) to describe the organisational change, based on our empirical research...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{attempts}} to identify whether product differentiation or geographical differentiation {{is the main}} source of profit for firms in developing economies by employing a simple idea from the recently developed method of empirical industrial organization. Theoretically, location choice and product choice have been considered as analogues in differentiation, but in the real world, which of these strategies is chosen will result in an immense difference in firm behavior and in the development process of the industry. Development of the technique of empirical industrial organization enabled us to identify market outcomes with endogeneity. A typical case is the market outcome with differentiation, where price or product choice is endogenously determined. Our original survey contains data on market location, differences in product types, and price. The results show that product differentiation rather than geographical differentiation mitigates pressure on price competition, but 70 per cent secures <b>geographical</b> <b>monopoly.</b> 2009 年度調査研究報告...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses Boundary Organization Theory (BOT) {{to examine}} the {{proposition}} that Dutch Environmental Co-operatives (ECs) conform to the characteristics of boundary organizations (BOs). Many conservationists believe BO-type institutions are essential for addressing eco-system management problems, but believe there are currently too few examples of BOs working across sustainability issues. It is concluded that ECs have organizational structures and work practices typical of BOs: they allow people on different sides of the land management for food and nature conservation boundary (land managers, conservationists, scientists and policy makers) to negotiate to transform agri-environmental schemes into boundary objects and scheme options into implementable standardized packages. This is achieved by adopting convening, translation, collaboration and mediation functions that create extended peer communities able to contribute important knowledge of eco-system management, whilst allowing each participate to remain within their respective professional boundaries and responsible to their different constituencies. As an example of BOs, ECs are a post-normal sustainability technology (PNST) that offers "clumsy" solutions to the "wicked" problem of eco-system management. BOs work in many fields across the globe, showing their underling organizational principals and working practices are not restricted to any particular issue or <b>geographical</b> <b>monopoly.</b> As such, ECs - adjusted to suit local priorities and circumstances - could {{be the basis of}} a more widely used sustainability-led governance unit most particularly where cultural practices favour collective and collaborative behaviour.

50|$|Although former {{competitors}} Bell Atlantic (a former Baby Bell) and GTE had assigned <b>geographical</b> <b>monopolies</b> varying {{by region}} in Virginia, they merged {{in the late}} 1990s to form Verizon, now the dominant local telephone service provider throughout Virginia, including both of these area codes. Over 85% of all telephone numbers {{in both of these}} area codes are served by Verizon, a regulated monopoly.|$|R

Brock says in The Telecommunications Industry: The Dynamics Of Market Structure, [...] "The {{provision}} allowed Bell and {{the independents}} to exchange telephones {{in order to}} give each other <b>geographical</b> <b>monopolies.</b> So long as only one company served a given geographical area there was little reason to expect price competition to take place." [...] AT&T focused on purchasing companies within specific geographic areas that increased its effective control of the telephone system market, while selling its less-desirable and previously acquired companies to independent buyers. Also included in the Kingsbury Commitment was the requirement that AT&T allow competitors to connect through its phone lines, which reduced the incentive of these companies to build competing long-distance lines.|$|R
40|$|Professor Fulda {{has plunged}} into the thorniest thicket of the {{regulatory}} process; he emerges, scratched but undaunted, with a useful and coherent account of what he finds there. In the transportation industries the reconciliation of regulation with competitive norms is most difficult. Other utilities, notably those with <b>geographical</b> <b>monopolies</b> like telephones, electricity, and gas, offer little scope for rivalry of any sort. Except in special cases such as competition between electricity, gas, and oil for domestic space heating use, we can achieve only a pale simulation of competitive pricing by way of rate regulation. In transportation, however, either the reality or the prospect of competition is almost always present. There are, to be sure, patches of monopoly, as when one railroad serves a coal-mining area, or one airline a small city with no practical likelihood of another entrant. But in major markets railroads face other railroads, sometimes water carriers too, and, ubiquitously, trucks. Airlines try to woo business from each other, and, without great success, to attract more of the great mass of travellers who insist on driving vast distances in their own cars...|$|R
40|$|Despite of an {{insignificant}} {{track record of}} quasi-market models in Sweden, new models of this kind have recently been introduced in health care; {{commonly referred to as}} "choice of care". This time citizens act as purchasers; choosing the primary care centre or family physician they want to be treated by, which, in turn, generates a capitation payment to the chosen unit. Policy makers believe that such systems will be self-remedial, that is, as a result of competition the strong providers survive while unprofitable ones will be eliminated. Because of negative consequences of the fragmented health care delivery, policy makers at the same time also promote different forms of integrated health care arrangements. One example is "local health care", which could be described as an upgraded community-oriented primary care, supported by adaptable hospital services, fitting the needs of a local population. This article reviews if it is possible to combine this kind of integrated care system with a competition driven model of governance, or if they are incompatible. The findings indicate that some choice of care schemes could hamper the development of integration in local health care. However, <b>geographical</b> <b>monopolies</b> like local health care, enclosed in a non-competitive context, lack the stimulus of competition that possibly improves performance. Thus, {{it could be argued that}} if choice of care and local health care should be combined, patients ought to choose between integrated health care arrangements and not among individual health professionals.
