40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe use of {{convolutional}} codes with <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding</b> is {{the most}} common error-correction technique in simple communication systems. A drawback of conventional <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding</b> is the limitation to a class of self-orthogonal codes which, in general, are non-optimum. Based on distance properties of the utilized code and test-error pattern analysis, we propose generalized <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding</b> that does not have the above mentioned limitation. This is minimum distance decoding and can be applied to any convolutional code while still maintaining its simplicity. Therefore, it has the advantage of being easily adopted in the existing systems. We can use complicated Viterbi or sequential decoder in large terminals and, with the same code, use the proposed decoder in small terminals; otherwise, both large and small terminals must utilize the same type decoder. Also, we may use the proposed decoding scheme to simplify and accelerate sequential type decoding. In addition, by means of the special recovery property of convolutional codes, advanced ARQ retransmission systems could be much improved; several practical applications are suggested and discussed in the last section of this paper...|$|E

After the release of their <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback</b> demo tape and a {{subsequent}} review by the Belgian industrial music magazine Sideline, they were signed to the European label, Hard Records, which released their first full-length CD, Overdosing, and gained the attention of another European record label, Zoth Ommog. The latter released <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback's</b> second disc, Technophoby, in 1997. This {{attracted the attention of}} the American industrial music distributors Metropolis Records, who released domestic versions of all subsequent <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback</b> releases. Bio-Vital, released in 1998, was the first <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback</b> album to enter the German Alternative Charts (DAC). In the same year, they released a second album with new tracks and remixes called Evolution. In 2000, Biagiotti and Dudas signed to the record label Bloodline to release Mechanical Horizon, which was preceded by the first ever <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback</b> single, [...] "Reflect in Silence". Three years later, <b>Decoded</b> <b>Feedback</b> switched to their current record label, Out of Line, and released Shockwave, which again was preceded by a single, [...] "Phoenix". In 2005, they released Combustion as well as the soundtrack for the Cindy Murdoch's short zombie film, Red Men Rising. Aftermath was released in 2010 and disKonnekt in 2012.|$|R

40|$|Maximum {{distance}} separable (MDS) convolutional codes {{were introduced}} in [1]. These are convolutional codes whose free distance achieves the generalized Singleton bound. Strongly MDS codes are an interesting subclass of MDS codes which {{were introduced in}} [2]. These codes are characterized by the property that their column distances reach the generalized Singleton bound at the earliest possible time step. In [2], it was shown that, for any positive integers n and δ, strongly MDS (n, n− 1, δ) -convolutional codes exist if the base field is large enough. It was also shown that, if n and δ are not too large, strongly MDS convolutional codes perform very well under <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding</b> {{in terms of the}} number of errors that can be corrected per time interval.

40|$|We {{investigate}} a cognitive radio network {{in which a}} primary user (PU) may cooperate with a cognitive radio user (i. e., a secondary user (SU)) for transmissions of its data packets. The PU {{is assumed to be}} a buffered node operating in a time-slotted fashion where the time is partitioned into equal-length slots. We develop two schemes which involve cooperation between primary and secondary users. To satisfy certain quality of service (QoS) requirements, users share time slot duration and channel frequency bandwidth. Moreover, the SU may leverage the primary feedback message to further increase both its data rate and satisfy the PU QoS requirements. The proposed cooperative schemes are designed such that the SU data rate is maximized under the constraint that the PU average queueing delay is maintained less than the average queueing delay in case of non-cooperative PU. In addition, the proposed schemes guarantee the stability of the PU queue and maintain the average energy emitted by the SU below a certain value. The proposed schemes also provide more robust and potentially continuous service for SUs compared to the conventional practice in cognitive networks where SUs transmit in the spectrum holes and silence sessions of the PUs. We include primary source burstiness, sensing errors, and <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding</b> errors to the analysis of our proposed cooperative schemes. The optimization problems are solved offline and require a simple 2 -dimensional grid-based search over the optimization variables. Numerical results show the beneficial gains of the cooperative schemes in terms of SU data rate and PU throughput, average PU queueing delay, and average PU energy savings...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1982. Bibliography: leaves 188 - 191. Microfiche. xi, 191 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAutomatic-repeat-request (ARQ) {{systems have}} been the most popular means for error control in digital {{transmission}} systems. They provide a relatively simple and highly reliable means for eliminating transmission errors. However, the throughput of an ARQ system may deteriorate badly with increasing bit-error rates especially if there are significant transmission delays such as experienced in satellite or long terrestrial circuits. This dissertation first proposes a class of mixed-mode protocols which incorporate a selective-repeat mode of retransmission. This is combined with a secondary mode to prevent receiver buffer overflow. The throughput analysis for these schemes is presented and shows that they can significantly outperform the conventional Go-Back-N procedure for transmission over circuits with delay. The analysis also shows how throughput is related to the size of buffer provided at the receiver. It is also demonstrated that the choice of secondary retransmission mode does not {{have a significant effect on}} the throughput but has a bearing on complexity. Further improvement in performance may be achieved by use of a hybrid ARQ system incorporating forward-error correction as well as retransmission. The dissertation considers some parity-retransmission schemes in which blocks of parity bits are used for retransmissions rather than repetition of the original information block. This enables the system to adaptively incorporate error correction as well as detection when channel bit-error rates increase. An analysis procedure is presented which permits comparison of throughput efficiency for a variety of ARQ retransmission protocols and forward-error correction codes. Particular attention is focused on the use of half-rate convolutional codes for error correction. A trellis algorithm is shown to be useful for computation of the error correction capability of modestly powerful convolutional codes with sliding-block <b>feedback</b> <b>decoding.</b> An alternative approach using combinatorial procedures is also presented. New rate one-half codes are found which are related to optimum orthogonalizable rate one-third codes. These related code pairs can be used in parity-retransmission schemes to provide more powerful error correction when channel bit-error rates deteriorate badly. Finally the throughput and reliability performance of the hybrid schemes is outlined for various combinations of retransmission protocols and error-correction systems. Results are presented for convolutional codes and block codes and indicate the possible tradeoffs between complexity and performance. It is concluded that convolutional codes with relatively simple sliding-block decoding can ensure high throughput is maintained on a hybrid ARQ system despite significant bit-error rates and transmission delays...|$|E

Then, an outer bound is derived using a generalization of the straight-line bound to errors-and-erasures decoders and the optimal error-exponent tradeoff of a feedback encoder with two messages. In addition, {{upper and lower bounds}} are derived, for the optimal erasure exponent of error-free block codes in terms of the rate.

The algorithm exploits shift structure present in the data model and the finite alphabet property of the signals. The proposed method possesses a separation property that allows the symbol sequences for each user to be estimated independently of the others. Problematic issues surrounding unknown and mis-matched channel lengths for the cochannel users can be handled effectively in the recursive equalizer. Additionally, if the cochannel signals are encoded prior to transmission, we show how the code structure can be incorporated into the recursive equalizer to im-prove its performance.
