40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} there are two major {{explanations}} to why Swedish forward interest rates have been high and volatile: (i) Investors' fears that the economy will switch to a high inflation regime give rise to a regime shift premium. (ii) Expectations of monetary policy actions amplify the effect on forward interest rates originating from fluctuations in inflation expectations. In an empirical investigation the quantitative importance of adjusting forward interest rates for regime shift premia is demonstrated. In a second step it is shown that an one percentage point increase of the one year <b>forward</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (adjusted for the regime shift premium) only corresponds to an increase of investors' inflation expectations (obtained from surveys) by approximately 0. 2 percentage points, suggesting {{that the rest of the}} <b>forward</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> movement reflects expectations of future increases of the future real short term interest rate, i. e. a tightening of monetary policy.

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{field theory}} {{description of the}} multivariate statistics of forward rate variations over time and maturities, involves a quadratic action containing a gradient squared rigidity term. However, this choice leads to a spurious kink (infinite curvature) of the normalized correlation function for coinciding maturities. Motivated by empirical results, we consider an extended action that contains a squared Laplacian term, which describes the bending stiffness of the FRC. With the extra ingredient of a ‘psychological ’ future time, describing how the perceived time between events depends on {{the time in the}} future, our theory accounts extremely well for the phenomenology of interest rate dynamics. <b>Forward</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> f(t, x) is the interest rate, agreed upon at time t, for an instantaneous loan to be taken at future time x> t, between x and x + dx. At any instant of time t, the forward rate curve (FRC) f(t, x) defines a kind of string which moves and deforms with time. Modelling the motion of this curve is of paramount importance for many financial applications [1]: pricing of interest rate derivatives, such as ‘caps ’ that limit the rate of loans that individuals take on their housing, interest swaps, risk management (asset liability management), etc. The industry standard is the so-called HJM model [2, 3]. This model has recently been generalized in different directions [4, 5, 6], in particular by one of us [7, 8, 9], who has proposed a two-dimensional Euclidean quantum field theory for modelling the <b>forward</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> curve. The <b>forward</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> dynamics has a drift velocity α(t, x) and volatility σ(t, x); it is convenient to define a driftless noise field A(t, x) by ∂f (t, x) = α(t, x) + σ(t, x) A(t, x).
