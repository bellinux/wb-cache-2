2500|$|According to Phillips, [...] "Ninety-five {{percent of}} the people <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> with were black, most of them of course no name people. Elvis fit right in. He {{was born and raised in}} poverty. He was around people that had very little in the way of worldly goods." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Smith, {{the song}} [...] "Can I Play with Madness" [...] "actually started {{life as a}} ballad <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on called 'On the Wings of Eagles'. Then Bruce had a verse for it but wanted to change the title to 'Can I Play with Madness.' I must admit, it did sound better that way. So we took that one and Steve liked it, too. It was Steve {{who came up with}} the time change in the middle and the {{instrumental}} passage, which again gave it that lift it needed." [...] According to Dickinson, however, Harris' addition resulted in [...] "a big row ... Adrian absolutely hated it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I was wrong," [...] Graham muttered, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> {{for about}} ten hours on end, and then rushed up to London in the car to try and keep my {{appointment}} with Holderness." ...|$|E

50|$|The perfect is not {{necessarily}} incompatible with other grammatical aspects. In English, for example, it can be combined with the progressive (continuous) aspect, wherein an event is viewed as temporary and ongoing. A form such as the present perfect progressive <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> combines the meanings expressed by the two aspects - viewing my working as an ongoing process, but one which is now completed (or, as in <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> for two hours, restricting attention to the completed portion of that process).|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> {{very hard}} at the office that summer, and was glad to think of my two weeks' vacation, which were to begin on the first Monday of the month. I had {{intended}} spending these two weeks in rural retirement at home, but an interview in the city with my family physician caused me to change my mind. I told him my plan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Kent, it was dreadful! I {{had come}} back that evening to the library to finish some work. I knew that Mr. Kelly was to dine out and that I would be alone. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> quietly for some time when I became aware of voices in the billiard-room. I tried not to listen, but {{they seemed to be}} quarrelling, and I couldn't help hearing. Oh, Mr. Kent, was I wrong?" ...|$|E
60|$|Yet the prospect, now, of a {{visit to}} the Kymes' was by no means so glowing as it once would have been. For I had seen visions, I had dreamed dreams, beheld a delectable country of my very own. A year ago--nay, even a month ago--how such an {{invitation}} would have glittered!... I returned at length to my theme, over which, before Jerry's arrival, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> feverishly. But now the glamour had gone from it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mostly London,' he said; 'but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> {{about in}} a good many places, and I don't look upon one as home more than the other.' ...|$|R

60|$|This <b>is</b> {{the climax}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> up to, and I {{call it a}} fine one; {{as good as a}} story to be {{continued}} ever ended an instalment with.|$|R
6000|$|Maxwell {{would not}} meet his wife's eye in answering. [...] "Oh, yes; the only {{question}} with me is, whether I can make it what you want. That has been the trouble all along. I know that the love-business in the play, as it stood, was inadequate. But yesterday, just before I got your note, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> it over in a perfectly new shape. I wish, {{if you have a}} quarter of an hour to throw away, you'd let me show you what I've written. Perhaps you can advise me." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{ten years}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working,</b> {{from time to}} time, on an autobiographical {{manuscript}} which I had called by various names, but which had finally solidified into A Son of the Middle Border. Even in my days of deepest discouragement I turned most of my energy to its revision. In the belief {{that it was my}} final story and with small hope of its finding favor in any form, I toiled away, year after year, finding in the aroused memories of my youthful world a respite from the dull grind of my present.|$|E
60|$|When {{my senses}} {{came back to}} me I was sitting in a small chamber, very {{different}} from the one in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working.</b> It was cosey and bright, with chintz-covered settees, colored hangings, and a thousand pretty little trifles upon the wall. A small ornamental clock ticked in front of me, and the hands pointed to half-past three. It was all quite familiar to me, and yet I stared about for a moment in a half-dazed way until my eyes fell upon a cabinet photograph of myself upon the top of the piano. On the other side stood one of Mrs. Marden. Then, of course, I remembered where I was. It was Agatha's boudoir.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{try to find}} her, {{and have}} one of our {{pleasant}} strolls. I sadly want one, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> very hard all this morning, and half the night." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, a remaster of nkramar's rip was {{released}} by community member Skittle021, saying, [...] "I {{would like to share}} something that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on for the past three years. Since late 2007, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on remastering the Xero Demo Tape to get it as close to studio quality as possible. Well, I've finally done it. I wasn't planning on releasing this to the public, but after showing it to a few friends and family members, they suggested that I do just that. So, here you go. Let me know what you think!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, by heaven, {{something}} must be said. That won't do at all, Mr. Mason. I presume you {{do not think that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> like a slave for the last four months for nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether you {{are indeed}} my friend or my enemy I am not even now sure," [...] I answered. [...] "I am {{learning}} to be suspicious of every person and thing which breathes. But as for this matter between the Prince and myself, it can make little difference who knows the truth. He shammed a fall over the cliff and a sprained ankle. Lady Angela and I started for the house to send a cart for him, but, before we were halfway across the Park, Grooton fetched me back. I found the Prince examining the papers on which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working,</b> and when I charged him with it he offered me a bribe." ...|$|E
60|$|That evening I {{was sitting}} with Madeline in the moon-lit porch. It was nearly ten o'clock, and ever since supper-time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> myself {{up to the point}} of making an avowal of my sentiments. I had not {{positively}} determined to do this, but wished gradually to reach the proper point, when, if the prospect looked bright, I might speak. My companion appeared to understand the situation--at least I imagined that the nearer I came to a proposal the more she seemed to expect it. It was certainly a very critical and important epoch in my life. If I spoke I should make myself happy or miserable forever; and if I did not speak I had {{every reason to believe that}} the lady would not give me another chance to do so.|$|E
60|$|When I was {{positively}} certain that I {{had left the}} little inn far behind me, I slackened my speed, and, perceiving a spreading tree by the road-side, I dismounted {{and sat down in}} the shade. It was a hot day, and unconsciously <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> very hard. Several persons on wheels passed along the road, and every time I saw one approaching I was afraid that it might be somebody I knew, who might stop and sit by me in the shade. I was now near enough to Walford to meet with people from that neighborhood, and I did not want to meet with any one just now. I had a great many things to think about and just then I was busy trying to make up my mind whether or not it would be well for me to stop at the Putneys'.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{write the}} moment of my arrival: be obliged to me, friend; for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to work still, like a Turk, or like a Jordan." [...] [OEuvres de Frederic, xvii. 71.] ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on radio and television, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> your sweet {{letter with}} news of Dr. John and his brother. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> on the book to-day very hard, after much interruption; it is two-thirds done now. So glad people are on tiptoe.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wrote {{two more}} {{articles}} and then, feeling more drowsy than ever, I rose {{and walked up}} and down the room to stretch my legs. My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what was the cause of the delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to find out. There was a straight passage, dimly lighted, which led from the room in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working,</b> and was the only exit from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the commissionnaire's lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half way down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage running into it at right angles. This second one leads by means of a second small stair to a side door, used by servants, and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street. Here is a rough chart of the place." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mirror is}} so {{situated}} that as I {{sit at the}} table I can usually see nothing in it but the reflection of the red window curtains. But a queer thing happened last night. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> for some hours, very much against the grain, with continual bouts of that mistiness of which I had complained. Again and again I had to stop and clear my eyes. Well, on one of these occasions I chanced to look at the mirror. It had the oddest appearance. The red curtains which should have been reflected in it were no longer there, but the glass seemed to be clouded and steamy, not on the surface, which glittered like steel, but deep down in the very grain of it. This opacity, when I stared hard at it, appeared to slowly rotate this way and that, until it was a thick white cloud swirling in heavy wreaths. So real and solid was it, and so reasonable was I, that I remember turning, with the idea that the curtains were on fire. But everything was deadly still in the room--no sound save the ticking of the clock, no movement save the slow gyration of that strange woolly cloud {{deep in the heart of}} the old mirror.|$|E
60|$|One {{of their}} three little {{children}} was deaf and dumb, Miss Maryon had been from the first with all the children, soothing them, and dressing them (poor little things, they had been brought out of their beds), and making them {{believe that it was}} a game of play, so that some of them were now even laughing. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> hard with the others at the barricade, and had got up a pretty good breastwork within the gate. Drooce and the seven men had come back, bringing in the people from the Signal Hill, and had worked along with us: but, I had not so much as spoken a word to Drooce, nor had Drooce so much as spoken a word to me, for we were both too busy. The breastwork was now finished, and I found Miss Maryon at my side, with a child in her arms. Her dark hair was fastened round her head with a band. She had a quantity of it, and it looked even richer and more precious, put up hastily out of her way, than I had seen it look when it was carefully arranged. She was very pale, but extraordinarily quiet and still.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Quite a time,' {{answered}} the Bishop. 'It began, did it not, General, {{the same day}} that the confounded furnace went out? The General here and Admiral Hay and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> at it for three days.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, and the galleys ready. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> {{like a horse}} at {{them all}} the morning, as you would let me do nothing else. And Goderic will not be back from the palace, you say, till nightfall!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Conrad, if {{we cannot}} find this fellow before Ben Soloman comes, I am {{with you in}} the business. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> for him on {{starvation}} pay for the last three years, and hate him as much as you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For {{the last}} two weeks I had been a wholly {{occupied}} man, intent only upon obeying the orders that came down to me. All through this time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> to the very limit of my mental and physical faculties, and my only moments of rest had been devoted to snatches of sleep. Now came this rare, unexpected interlude, and I could look detachedly upon what I was doing and feel something of its infinite wonderfulness. I was irradiated with affection for the men of my company and with admiration at their cheerful acquiescence in the subordination and needs of our positions. I watched their proceedings and heard their pleasant voices. How willing those men were! How ready to accept leadership and forget themselves in collective ends! I thought how manfully they had gone through all the strains and toil of {{the last two}} weeks, how they had toughened and shaken down to comradeship together, and how much sweetness there is after all in our foolish human blood. For they were just one casual sample of the species--their patience and readiness lay, as the energy of the atom had lain, still waiting to be properly utilised. Again it came to me with overpowering force that the supreme need of our race is leading, that the supreme task is to discover leading, to forget oneself in realising the collective purpose of the race. Once more I saw life plain....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do think, Miss Brander, I {{am working}} hard enough and steady {{enough to satisfy}} even you. I did so for six months in England with a fellow named Terrier. He was just the master I wanted. He had not a shadow of imagination, but was up in all the {{technical}} details of painting, and in six months' hard work I really learnt to paint; previous to that I knew nothing of painting. I could make a colored sketch, but that was all, now I am on the highway to becoming an artist. Goudé will only receive pupils whom he considers likely to do him credit, and on seeing two of the things I had done after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> with Terrier, he accepted me at once. He is a splendid master--out and away the best in Paris, and is really a great artist himself. He is a peppery little man and will tolerate no nonsense, and I {{can assure you that}} he is well satisfied with me. I am going to set to work to do a couple of pictures on my own account for next year's Salon. I should have waited another year before trying my wings, if he had not encouraged me to venture at once, and as he is very much opposed to his pupils painting for exhibition until they are sufficiently advanced to begin with a success, it is proof that he has at least some hopes of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That strong cigar," [...] I whispered feebly to myself; [...] "I ought {{never to}} have ventured upon it. And then the little room with all those people in it. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>working</b> very hard. <b>I</b> must really take more exercise." ...|$|R
