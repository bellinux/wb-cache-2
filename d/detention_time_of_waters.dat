In fact plant stems and leaves convert kinetic energy into turbulent kinetic energy, increasing drag and reducing flow velocity (Nepf 1999). Temmerman et al. (2012) showed that after cutting marsh vegetation over {{a relatively large}} area (4 ha) the flow velocity on the platform increased {{by a factor of}} 2 to 4, thus decreasing dramatically the travel <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> parcels.|$|R

The construction of constructed wetlands, in these rural areas allows the reproducing of mechanisms of degradation of pollutants that occur in natural wetlands, in a system for waste water purification. The process consists of passing the wastewater through a medium (usually after being pre-sedimented), where, roots of macrophytes and microbial communities that degrade organic matter in wastewater assimilating the nutrients existing in it, grow. The study of the hydraulic behavior of these alternative systems of sanitation {{was based on the}} analysis of constructed wetland of Barroca D'Alva in Alcochete with a subsurface horizontal flow. The performance evaluation and effectiveness of the tracer (potassium bromide) introduced, the measurement <b>of</b> <b>water</b> level inside the bed and the analysis of the hydrographs of the flow, allowed a study of the hydraulic behavior and also the development of a simplified one-dimensional model applied to the transport that occurs within the bed, which allows to model the <b>detention</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> a non reactive solute...|$|R
