25|$|In general, a {{capacitor}} {{is seen as}} a storage component for electric energy. But this is only one capacitor function. A capacitor can also act as an AC resistor. In many cases the capacitor is used as a <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitor</b> to filter or bypass undesired biased AC frequencies to the ground. Other applications use capacitors for capacitive coupling of AC signals; the dielectric is used only for blocking DC. For such applications the AC resistance {{is as important as the}} capacitance value.|$|E
25|$|This is {{critically}} important for decoupling high-speed logic circuits from the power supply. The <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitor</b> supplies transient current to the chip. Without decouplers, the IC demands current faster than the connection to the power supply can supply it, as parts of the circuit rapidly switch on and off. To counter this potential problem, circuits frequently use multiple bypass capacitors—small (100 nF or less) capacitors rated for high frequencies, a large electrolytic capacitor rated for lower frequencies and occasionally, an intermediate value capacitor.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{effective}} design of power distribution networks has become highly challenging with each technology generation.

40|$|With {{the edge}} rates of {{high-speed}} signals on boards increasing dramatically in modern PCB designs, {{it becomes more}} challenging to manage clean power supplies. The number of <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> used for a power delivery system keeps increasing as well. This causes two problems for board designers and layout engineers: 1) How to determine the numbers {{and the types of}} <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> needed for a particular design; and 2) Where to place the selected capacitors on board. Without a clear set of tools and methodologies to solve these two problems, many boards would have to be treated in a pessimistic and conservative way and would end {{up with a lot of}} unnecessary <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which increases design cost, reduces board reliability, and also makes it extremely difficult to place and route capacitors in a limited board space. This paper provides a solution for board designers to choose <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> early in the design process. It illustrates how it is not a good practice to place <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> with fixed values at every pin of a chip with the fastest switching speed.

50|$|One common kind of {{decoupling}} is {{to protect}} a powered circuit from signals in the power supply. Sometimes, for various reasons, a power supply supplies an AC signal superimposed on the DC power line. Such a signal is often undesirable in the powered circuit. A <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitor</b> can prevent the powered circuit from seeing that signal, thus decoupling it from that aspect of the power supply circuit.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{embedded}} capacitance material (ECM) is fabricated {{between the}} power and ground layers of the wireless sensor nodes, forming an integrated capacitance to replace {{the large amount of}} <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> on the board. The ECM material, whose dielectric constant is 16, has the same size of the wireless sensor nodes of 3 cm* 3 cm, with a thickness of only 14 μm. Though the capacitance of a single ECM layer being only around 8 nF, there are two reasons the ECM layers can still replace the high frequency <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> (100 nF in our case) on the board. The first reason is: the parasitic inductance of the ECM layer is much lower than the surface mount capacitors 2 ̆ 7. A smaller capacitance value of the ECM layer could achieve the same resonant frequency of the surface mount <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Simulation and measurement fit this assumption well. The second reason is: more than one layer of ECM material are utilized during the design step to get a parallel connection of the several ECM capacitance layers, finally leading to a larger value of the capacitance and smaller value of parasitic. Characterization of the ECM is carried out by the LCR meter. To evaluate the behaviors of the ECM layer, time and frequency domain measurements are performed on the power-bus decoupling of the wireless sensor nodes. Comparison with the measurements of bare PCB board and <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> solution are provided to show the improvement of the ECM layer. Measurements show that the implementation of the ECM layer can not only save the space of the surface mount <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors,</b> but also provide better power-bus decoupling to the nodes...|$|R

The system of <b>decoupling</b> <b>capacitors</b> used in power distribution systems with multiple power supplies is the focus of this paper.

High capacitance density MIM capacitors, placed between the last two metal layers, {{have been shown to be}} effective in achieving on-chip decoupling in high performance processors. There have been many reports in the literature on the use of high-k material such as Ta 2 O 5, HfO 2, ZrO 2 for MIM capacitors [1 - 5].
