He has {{described}} how he became aware of his humor early on: [...] "I realized I was funny at an early age, I realized I could make people laugh at a later age, and then by college time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> jokes in terms of writing".|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Ebert noted his own [...] "tendency {{to place}} what I now {{consider}} the year's best film in second place, perhaps because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{some kind of}} point with my top pick," [...] adding, [...] "In 1968, I should have ranked [...] above The Battle of Algiers. [...] In 1971, McCabe and Mrs. Miller was better than The Last Picture Show. [...] In 1974, Chinatown was probably better, in a different way, than Scenes from a Marriage. [...] In 1976, how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver? [...] In 1978, I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman. And in 1980, of course, Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion... although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the 1980s, {{it was only the}} second-best film of 1980... am I the same person I was in 1968, 1971, or 1980? [...] I hope not." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{frontman}} {{was more}} involved in the composition of Born Villain than he was for preceding records. Manson has said that this is a result of him beginning the project with a different mindset from that of his chief collaborator, Twiggy. He said he developed a [...] "clear idea" [...] of the album's direction early in its writing stages, which he was reluctant to share {{with other members of the}} band. He worked on the album in a minimally decorated apartment located above a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles, which was once owned by actor Billy Zane and was the site where Manson created his first painting in 1996. The album contains seven songs which feature the vocalist as a composer, including three where he is listed as the sole writer. At the time of the album's release, Manson distanced himself from the approach he took when creating previous albums, explaining: [...] "On the last two records I made, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people feel what I was feeling—which wasn't a good idea, because I was feeling like shit. Check mark number one: don't make records that make people feel bad." ...|$|E

We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} in Curve, O'Connor commented, [...] "I'm a dyke… although I haven’t been very open {{about that and}} throughout {{most of my life}} I've gone out with blokes because I haven't necessarily been terribly comfortable about being a big lesbian mule. But I actually am a dyke." [...] However, soon after in an {{interview in}} The Independent, she stated, [...] "I believe it was overcompensating of me to declare myself a lesbian. It was not a publicity stunt. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> someone else feel better. And have subsequently caused pain for myself. I am not in a box of any description." [...] In a magazine article and in a programme on RTÉ (Ryan Confidential, broadcast on RTÉ on 29 May 2003), she stated that while most of her sexual relationships had been with men, she has had three relationships with women.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why you felt that was insulting. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to keep us from having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless they have to get a blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin." [...] He also stated [...] "I don't believe adoption of children by homosexual couples is [...] {{in the best interests of}} children." [...] (In 1997 Minnesota enacted the Marriage Protection Act defining marriage as a [...] "civil contract between a man and a woman" [...] and stating that [...] "Lawful marriage may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex".) ...|$|E
