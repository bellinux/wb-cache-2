50|$|The <b>Gun</b> <b>Tunnel</b> is an {{intermediate}} altitude hypersonic wind tunnel {{that can be}} configured to produce hypersonic flows at roughly 30 to 40 km altitude. This uses a piston for isentropic compression. The hypersonic facility at IISC Bangalore, India has a high enthalpy <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which can produce Schlieren imaging and produce up to 8 mega joules of energy. Using a piston can be very tricky due to reflecting of shocks. At the facility, they use alluminium diaphragm to produce shocks and paper diaphragm to avoid shocks and pass through the hypersonic chamber. The pressure used is significantly higher like 30 times the atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|One form of HWT {{is known}} as a <b>Gun</b> <b>Tunnel</b> or hot shot tunnel (up to M=27), which can be used for {{analysis}} of flows past ballistic missiles, space vehicles in atmospheric entry, and plasma physics or heat transfer at high temperatures. It runs intermittently, but has a very low running time (less than a second).The method of operation is based on a high temperature and pressurized gas (air or nitrogen) produced in an arc-chamber, and a near-vacuum in the remaining part of the tunnel. The arc-chamber can reach several MPa, while pressures in the vacuum chamber can be as low as 0.1 Pa. This means that the pressure ratios of these tunnels are in the order of 10 million. Also, the temperatures of the hot gas are up to 5000 K. The arc chamber is mounted in the gun barrel. The high pressure gas is separated by the vacuum by a diaphragm that breaks down as its resistance is exceeded.|$|E
5000|$|The depots at Brisbane, Townsville and Port Moresby {{continued}} to be marked by the variety of their activities. They not only had to overhaul engines, inspect and repair parachutes, paint aircraft, fill oxygen cylinders, and install armament but {{they were expected to}} find all sorts of short cuts and to make odd pieces of equipment from material on hand. The machine shop at Townsville produced, among other things, special propeller tools, a jig-filing machine, an indicating apparatus for hollow-steel propellers, and an electric arc welder for high-melting point soldering on armatures. ... By September 1943, the Townsville depot had converted some 175 B-25C's and D's for low-level strafing, and then turned to the B-25G.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is built}} up {{due to the}} shock-tube theory {{as one of the}} {{high-speed}} ground test facilitiesand is distinguished with the shock tunnels by the design and use of the piston, which is the most important reason that makes the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> running for a longer time than the relative shock tunnel. The equilibrium piston theory supplies the rationality of the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel,</b> which assumes that the light piston used in the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> runs as the same speed as the shock interface between the high and low regions in the shock tube, and the piston mass could be calculated by the pressure and velocity relation in various regions and the energy conservation formula. The piston with more appropriate mass could result in the more steady running state of the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> and it could be experimentally validated by the curve of the total pressure, which is interpreted by its voltage signal of the pressure transducer. Based on that technique of equilibrium piston design, the running time of the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> could be estimated...|$|E

40|$|Detonations {{can be used}} to {{generate}} a high-pressure gas of high acoustic speed to drive a shock tube. Recently, detonation driven facilities have been implemented for meaningful hypervelocity testing. These facilities can be operated with the detonation wave propagating either downstream or upstream. The advantages and problems associated with these methods are discussed. In addition to a performance comparison between these two modes, comparisons with other high-performance techniques, such as free piston and <b>gun</b> <b>tunnels,</b> are also made. At present, detonation driven facilities are generally of lower performance than free piston tunnels. However, they appear easier to operate and have a lower capital investment.

40|$|Wind {{tunnels and}} other aero-thermal {{experimental}} facilities {{are likely to}} make a contribution to the optimisation of energy and propulsion systems for the foreseeable future. Short duration wind tunnels such as shock tunnels and gun tunnels rely on a transient compression rocess and are likely to generate significant turbulent fluctuations in the nozzle reservoir region. In the present study, the magnitude of likely stagnation temperature fluctuations in two such facilities is inferred from incompressible temperature fluctuations data obtained by other workers. The friction velocity Reynolds numbers for the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> and shock tunnel cases considered presently were ReT= 31, 579 and 24, 975 respectively. The RMS stagnation temperature fluctuations, when averaged over the pipe flow diameter, are estimated to be 15. 3 and 291 K for the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> and shock tunnel cases respectively. The estimated RMS value {{in the case of the}} <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> is significantly larger than the experimental value previously measured on the centre line of the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> nozzle of 2. 3 K.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} high Mach number free shear layers has been undertaken. The experiments were performed using a Mach 7 <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> facility and a planar duct with injection {{from the base}} of a central strut producing a Mach 3 flow parallel to the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> stream. This configuration is relevant to the development of efficient scramjet propulsion, and the <b>gun</b> <b>tunnel</b> Mach number is significantly higher than the majority of previous supersonic turbulent mixing layer investigations reported in the open literature. Schlieren images and Pitot pressure measurements were obtained at four different convective Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 1. 8. Only small differences between the four cases were detected, and the relatively large high-speed boundary layers at the trailing edge of the struct injector appear to strongly influence the shear layer development in each case. The Pitot pressure measurements indicated that, on average, the free shear layers all spread into the Mach 3 stream at an angle of approximately 1. 4 degrees, while virtually no spreading into the Mach 7 stream was detected until all of the low-speed stream was entrained. The free shear layers were simulated using a PNS code; however, the experimentally observed degree of spreading rate asymmetry could not be fully predicted with the k-epsilon turbulence model, even when a recently proposed compressibility correction was applied...|$|E
