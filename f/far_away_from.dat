It contains many well-known and inhabited star systems, but many more worlds remain uncharted.

5|$|The feint {{party was}} {{composed}} of 150 volunteers who ran into the hollow way and began to engage the British. After the British were in the hollow way, the 150 volunteers were reinforced by 900 more men.

5|$|The {{range of}} the {{original}} ages was also a problem, as the rate of Kula-Farallon spreading over that time would produce a chain of seamounts much longer than observed, and too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the continent to explain the continentally derived sediments. This objection is attenuated somewhat in that the newer ages show a smaller range of ages.|$|E

5|$|Within the Philippines, PAGASA issued {{no public}} storm warning signals, {{as the storm}} was too <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the country to prompt the {{issuance}} of such advisories.

5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} own, their food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E
5|$|Although Celia {{remained}} <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any populated landmasses, {{waves from}} the storm prompted storm advisories along the southern coastline of Mexico. Additionally, its outer bands brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero. Due to the high intensity and longevity of the hurricane, it significantly contributed to the record-high accumulated cyclone energy value for June 2010 in the eastern Pacific basin.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents, Germany's federal {{government}} {{is working on a}} new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization, with a particular focus on offshore wind farms. Under the plan, large wind turbines will be erected <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the coastlines, where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land, and where the enormous turbines won't bother the inhabitants. The plan aims to decrease Germany's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Ma-on posed {{a slight}} {{threat to the}} Mariana Islands and {{prompted}} the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished {{as a result of}} Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E
5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E

Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area formed along a dissipating cold front {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended <b>far</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the center. The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65mph (100km/h) early on October16. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the risk of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, such as the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado.
