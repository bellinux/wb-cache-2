2500|$|Modern Japan {{simply was}} cyberpunk. The Japanese {{themselves}} knew it and delighted in it. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{first glimpse of}} Shibuya, {{when one of the}} young Tokyo journalists who had taken me there, his face drenched with the light of a thousand media-suns—all that towering, animated crawl of commercial information—said, [...] "You see? You see? It is Blade Runner town." [...] And it was. It so evidently was.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, after a seven-month search, lead actor Daniel Radcliffe was {{discovered}} by producer David Heyman and writer Steve Kloves seated just behind them in a theatre. In Heyman's own words, [...] "There sitting behind me was this boy with these big blue eyes. It was Dan Radcliffe. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> first impressions: He was curious and funny and so energetic. There was real generosity too, and sweetness. But {{at the same time}} he was really voracious and with hunger for knowledge of whatever kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCaughey and {{her twin}} brother, William, {{were born in}} Pittsburgh to Albert Peterken, a factory janitor, and his wife, Ramona. The family moved around the Northeastern United States for six years before it settled down in Westport, Connecticut, where McCaughey's father did {{maintenance}} and later engineering work at a nail clipper factory. McCaughey recalled her parents' difficulty in affording medical treatment: [...] "my brother was a serious asthmatic as a child. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> parents {{sitting at the kitchen}} table wondering if they could afford to take [...] to the hospital." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{discovered}} that I {{did not like}} to live on the parlour floor of society. Intellectually I was as bored. Morally and spiritually I was sickened. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> intellectuals and idealists, my unfrocked preachers, broken professors, and clean-minded, class-conscious working-men. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> days and nights of sunshine and starshine, where life was all a wild sweet wonder, a spiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance. And I saw before me, ever blazing and burning, the Holy Grail.|$|R

2500|$|In her memoirs, {{she wrote}} {{of her time}} at the Odéon: [...] "It was the theater that I loved the most, and that I only left with regret. We all loved each other. Everyone was gay. The theater was a like a {{continuation}} of school. All the young came there... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> few months at the Comédie Française. That little world was stiff, gossipy, jealous. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> few months at the Gymnase. There they talked only about dresses and hats, and chattered about a hundred things {{that had nothing to}} do with art. At the Odéon, I was happy We thought only of putting on plays. We rehearsed mornings, afternoons, all the time. I adored that." [...] Bernhardt lived with her longtime friend and assistant Madame Guerard and her son in a small cottage in the suburb of Auteuil, and drove herself to the theater in a small carriage. She developed a close friendship with the writer George Sand, and performed in two plays that she authored. She received celebrities in her dressing room, including Gustave Flaubert and Leon Gambetta. In 1869, as she became more prosperous, she moved to a larger seven-room apartment at 16 rue Auber in the center of Paris. Her mother began to visit her for the first time in years, and her grandmother, a strict Orthodox Jew, moved into the apartment to take care of Maurice. Bernhardt added a maid and a cook to her household, as well as the beginning of a collection of animals; she had one or two dogs with her at all times, and two turtles moved freely around the apartment.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was what}} we liked to call a [...] "pay the rent" [...] job. It wasn't a script I liked, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> agent at the time saying, [...] "Look, {{you only have to}} work two weeks, and they're going to pay you a lot of money. We'll just say it was your first movie and they just didn't release it." [...] I think people were all fucked up on drugs. I don't know. I was a little removed, because I wasn't on the movie the whole time, but it seemed like it was just a mess. Like, when I'd go, I'd think--I like to make a movie where I know who the boss is. I like a big boss. I like a real director. And it seemed like it was just, [...] "Who's driving the ship here? What's going on?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Capp also lampooned popular {{recording}} idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley ("Hawg McCall," [...] 1957), Liberace ("Loverboynik," [...] 1956), the Beatles ("the Beasties," [...] 1964)—and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. [...] "Sinatra was {{the first}} great public figure I ever wrote about," [...] Capp once said. [...] "I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, {{and we were all}} surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always {{made it a point to}} send me champagne whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant..." [...] (from Frank Sinatra, My Father by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was [...] "cut to the quick" [...] over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action—as would Joan Baez later, over [...] "Joanie Phoanie" [...] in 1967.|$|E

2500|$|Enya {{described}} her upbringing as [...] "very quiet and happy." [...] At age three, she {{took part in}} her first singing competition at the annual Feis Ceoil music festival. She took part in pantomimes at Gweedore Theatre and sang with her siblings in her mother's choir at St Mary's church in Derrybeg. She learned English at primary school and began piano lessons at age four. [...] "I had to do school work and then travel to a neighbouring town for piano lessons, and then more school work. <b>I</b> ... <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> brothers and sisters playing outside ... and I would be inside playing the piano. This one big book of scales, practising them over and over." [...] At eleven, Enya's grandfather paid for her education at a strict convent boarding school in Milford run by nuns of the Loreto order, where she developed a taste for classical music, art, Latin and watercolour painting. [...] "It was devastating to be torn away from such a large family, but {{it was good for}} my music." [...] Enya left the school at 17 and studied classical music in college for one year with the aim of becoming [...] "a piano teacher sort of person. I never thought of myself composing or being on stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scenes {{from the}} film A Clockwork Orange were filmed in Friars Square in Aylesbury but {{did not make it}} to the final cut. This is the 'Librarian Scene' where outtakes from the shoot and {{rehearsal}} can be seen in Alison Castle's The Stanley Kubrick Archives published by Taschen. The opening scene when the droogs beat up the elderly Irishman is mistakenly cited as being filmed in the underpass linking Friars Square Shopping Centre with the railway station. Although Christiane Kubrick's book Stanley Kubrick– A Life in Pictures states this the underpass in the film has a different shape to the one in Aylesbury and these sequences were actually filmed in Wandsworth. According to Malcolm McDowell: [...] "We did a sequence in Aylesbury. The town square was decorated with giant rubber ducks, weird animals, they were huge, and we accosted an old guy from the library. I ripped out these priceless books that he had and I threw them up. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> line, it was taken from the book, it was: 'There's a mackerel of a cornflake for you.' The pages from the ripped books fall like confetti. The retribution was that Alex goes to the library when he is cured and all the old codgers in the library go: 'You were the one!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwarzenegger took to {{visiting a}} gym in Graz, {{where he also}} frequented the local movie theaters to see {{bodybuilding}} idols such as Reg Park, Steve Reeves, and Johnny Weissmuller on the big screen. When Reeves died in 2000, Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him: [...] "As a teenager, I grew up with Steve Reeves. His remarkable accomplishments allowed {{me a sense of}} what was possible, when others around me didn't always understand my dreams. Steve Reeves has been part of everything I've ever been fortunate enough to achieve." [...] In 1961, Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul, who invited him to train at the gym in Graz. He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends, when it was usually closed, so that he could train. [...] "It would make me sick to miss a workout... I knew I couldn't look {{at myself in the mirror}} the next morning if I didn't do it." [...] When Schwarzenegger was asked about his first movie experience as a boy, he replied: [...] "I was very young, but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> father taking me to the Austrian theaters and seeing some newsreels. The first real movie I saw, that I distinctly remember, was a John Wayne movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.
