This development is intended to support the Satellite Based e-Learning initiative in India. The scale-down DVB-RCS HUB is implemented around a single PC with other subsystems making it very cost effective and unique of its kind. This realization will drastically reduce the total cost of Satellite based Education Networks as very low cost commercially available Satellite <b>Interactive</b> <b>Terminals</b> (SITs) complying to open standard could be used at remote locations. The system is successfully tested to work with a commercial SIT using a GEO satellite EDUSAT which is especially dedicated for satellite based e-Learning. The internal detail of the DVB-RCS Forward and Return Link Organization and how it manages the Satellite <b>Interactive</b> <b>Terminals</b> access to the satellite channel using MF-TDMA approach has been described.

50|$|In most {{operating}} systems predating Unix, programs had to explicitly {{connect to the}} appropriate input and output devices. OS-specific intricacies caused {{this to be a}} tedious programming task. On many systems it was necessary to obtain control of environment settings, access a local file table, determine the intended data set, and handle hardware correctly in the case of punch card reader, magnetic tape drive, disk drive, line printer, card punch, or <b>interactive</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E

Indeed, the very first program may very well run for hours without needing access to a peripheral. As there were no users waiting at an <b>interactive</b> <b>terminal,</b> this was no problem: users handed in a deck of punched cards to an operator, and came back {{a few hours later}} for printed results. Multiprogramming greatly reduced wait times when multiple batches were being processed.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinction}} {{was made}} between <b>interactive</b> (timesharing) <b>terminals</b> and transactional <b>terminals.</b> Where <b>interactive</b> <b>terminals</b> were controlled {{directly by the}} operating system, transactional terminals were controlled from a batch program. Initially, this batch program, known as MCP for Multichannel Communications Program, was developed for the RCA and Sperry batch-oriented operating systems, TDOS (Tape-Disk Operating System) and DOS (Disk Operating System). Once {{it became clear that}} they would be phased out in favor of the much more robust interactive operating system, VMOS, MCP was ported to run on VMOS. VMOS (Virtual Memory Operating System) became the new moniker for TSOS on RCA Spectra 70 models 46, 61, 3, and 7 computers, and then initially on Univac Series 70 (formerly RCA) computers.|$|R

50|$|SCL is {{designed}} to allow both line-at-a-time interactive use from a console or from a command file, and creation of executable scripts or programs (when the language is compiled into object module format {{in the same way}} as any other VME programming language). The declaration of a procedure within SCL also acts as the definition of a simple form or template allowing the procedure to be invoked from an <b>interactive</b> <b>terminal,</b> with fields validated according to the data types of the underlying procedure parameters or using the default procedure parameter values.|$|E
5000|$|MCP and COS {{were always}} type 2 tasks. The {{computer}} operator {{would see a}} count {{of the number of}} tasks within each queue on the system console. A complete list of the task queues was available from any <b>interactive</b> <b>terminal</b> with administrator access via a field-written program known as [...] "Stat200". This program would scan the task queues every few seconds and display a rolling list of tasks on the terminal screen until it was interrupted or terminated. While not an officially released product, it became the defacto standard for task monitoring.|$|E
5000|$|Unix <b>interactive</b> <b>terminals</b> use Control-V to mean [...] "the next {{character}} {{should be}} treated literally" [...] (the mnemonic here is [...] "v is for verbatim"). This allows a user to insert a literal Control-C or Control-H or similar control characters {{that would otherwise be}} handled by the terminal. This behavior was copied by text editors like vi and Unix shells like bash and tcsh, which offer text editing on the command line.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of {{time-sharing}} computer systems in the 1960s it was common for a single institutional mainframe to control many <b>interactive</b> <b>terminals.</b> In such an environment server lag is acutely perceived. Furthermore, in many operating environments, scarce server resources such as CPU-seconds were often metered and charged against the account of the user running the program. An unintentional server hog could prove extremely costly in financial terms. These programs were often called run-away programs or endless loops.|$|R

50|$|OS/360 {{provided}} limited interactive {{facilities in}} Conversational Remote Job Entry (CRJE), Graphic Job Processing (GJP), <b>Interactive</b> <b>Terminal</b> Facility (ITF) and Satellite Graphic Job Processing (SGJP) {{prior to the}} Time Sharing Option (TSO), but IBM did not carry those forward to SVS. TSO continues to provide equivalent facilities, except {{that it does not}} support use of a 2250 as a terminal. Use of a 2250 from a batch job using Graphics Access Method (GAM) and Graphics Subroutine Package (GSP) remains supported. OS/360 included a batch debugging facility named TESTRAN; it was clumsier than the equivalent facility in IBSYS/IBJOB, and was not used much. With the advent of TSO TESTRAN became even less relevant, and SVS did not include it.|$|E
50|$|The main {{operating}} {{systems for the}} 1700 were the Utility System, which usually {{took the form of}} several punched paper tapes (resident monitor plus utilities), a similar Operating System for larger configurations (often including punched cards and magnetic tape), and the Mass Storage Operating System (MSOS) for disk-based systems. A Fortran compiler was available. Pascal was also available, via a cross compiler on a CDC 6000 series host. The Cyber 18 series, exploiting the extended instruction set, ran a disk-based OS, the <b>Interactive</b> <b>Terminal</b> Oriented System (ITOS). This system supported Fortran, Cobol, and UCSD Pascal. ITOS was a foreground/background system with multiple users connected via serial CRT terminals; user tasks ran in the background while the operating system itself ran in the foreground.|$|E

5000|$|The PL/I {{checkout}} compiler, (colloquially [...] "The Checker") {{announced in}} August 1970 {{was designed to}} speed and improve the debugging of PL/I programs.

It can be run from an <b>interactive</b> <b>terminal,</b> converting PL/I programs into an internal format, [...] "H-text". This format is interpreted by the Checkout compiler at run-time, detecting virtually all types of errors. Pointers are represented in 16 bytes, containing the target address and {{a description of the}} referenced item, thus permitting [...] "bad" [...] pointer use to be diagnosed. In a conversational environment when an error is detected, control is passed to the user who can inspect any variables, introduce debugging statements and edit the source program. Over time the debugging capability of mainframe programming environments developed most of the functions offered by this compiler and it was withdrawn (in the 1990s?) ...|$|E
