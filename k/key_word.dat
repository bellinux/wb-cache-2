5|$|Boston honored Russell by {{erecting}} {{a statue}} of him on City Hall Plaza in 2013: he is depicted in-game, surrounded by 11 plinths representing the 11 championships he helped the Celtics win. Each plinth features a <b>key</b> <b>word</b> and related quote to illustrate Russell's multiple accomplishments. The Bill Russell Legacy Foundation, established by the Boston Celtics Shamrock Foundation, funded the project. The art is by Ann Hirsch of Somerville, Massachusetts, in collaboration with Pressley Associates Landscape Architects of Boston. The statue was unveiled on November 1, 2013, with Russell in attendance.|$|E
25|$|Essentially all ciphers {{remained}} {{vulnerable to}} cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until {{the development of}} the polyalphabetic cipher, most clearly by Leon Battista Alberti around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi. Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel which implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the polyalphabetic Vigenère cipher, encryption uses a <b>key</b> <b>word,</b> which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the <b>key</b> <b>word</b> is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the <b>key</b> <b>words</b> used in Acta Cirurgica Brasileira from 1997 to 2012. METHODS: All the <b>key</b> <b>words</b> of all {{articles published in}} regular issues between 1997 and 2012 were analyzed, ensuring that these <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were in the MeSH database (Medical Subjects Headings) and the most used subject headings and most wrong repeated <b>key</b> <b>words</b> were ranked. RESULTS: > 4230 <b>key</b> <b>words</b> used in 990 articles were analyzed.

500|$|The Middle Kingdom {{genre of}} [...] "prophetic texts", {{also known as}} [...] "laments", [...] "discourses", [...] "dialogues", and [...] "apocalyptic literature", include such works as the Admonitions of Ipuwer, Prophecy of Neferti, and Dispute {{between a man and}} his Ba. This genre had no known {{precedent}} in the Old Kingdom and no known original compositions were produced in the New Kingdom. However, works like Prophecy of Neferti were frequently copied during the Ramesside Period of the New Kingdom, when this Middle Kingdom genre was canonized but discontinued. Egyptian prophetic literature underwent a revival during the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman period of Egypt with works such as the Demotic Chronicle, Oracle of the Lamb, Oracle of the Potter, and two prophetic texts that focus on Nectanebo II (r. 360–343 BC) as a protagonist.

500|$|Parkinson defines tales as [...] "...non-commemorative, non-functional, fictional narratives" [...] {{that usually}} employ the <b>key</b> <b>word</b> [...] "narrate" [...] (sdd). He {{describes}} it as the most open-ended genre, since the tales often incorporate elements of other literary genres. For example, Morenz describes the opening section of the foreign adventure tale Sinuhe as a [...] "...funerary self-presentation" [...] that parodies the typical autobiography found on commemorative funerary [...] The autobiography is for a courier whose service began under Amenemhat I. Simpson states that the death of Amenemhat I in the report given by his son, coregent, and successor Senusret I (r. 1971–1926 BC) to the army {{in the beginning of}} Sinuhe is [...] "...excellent propaganda". Morenz describes The shipwrecked sailor as an expeditionary report and a travel-narrative myth. Simpson notes the literary device of the story within a story in The shipwrecked sailor may provide [...] "...the earliest examples of a narrative quarrying report". With the setting of a magical desert island, and a character who is a talking snake, The shipwrecked sailor may also be classified as a fairy tale. While stories like Sinuhe, Taking of Joppa, and the Doomed prince contain fictional portrayals of Egyptians abroad, the Report of Wenamun is most likely based on a true account of an Egyptian who traveled to Byblos in Phoenicia to obtain cedar for shipbuilding during the reign of Ramesses XI.|$|E
