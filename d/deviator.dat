40|$|The thesis "Transmission of Prestressing Forces of External Tendons" {{covers the}} {{anchorage}} and deviation of external prestressing tendons in hollow-box-girder bridges. At first, the behaviour of different anchorage constructions {{was derived from}} the analysis of three full-scale tests. Numerical simulations verified the results. The behaviour can be described with regular strut-and-tie-models. The derived design procedure is based on simple equations and diagrams. Further research into <b>deviators</b> involved geometrical aspects as well as the determination of the load-carrying behaviour. The outcome of this is a new design procedure. The third emphasis of the thesis is the analysis of the corrosion protection of external tendons at <b>deviators.</b> In this regard 79 tests were conducted. The basic load-bearing behaviour of anchorage and deviation constructions of external tendons results from these investigations. The derived provisions simplify previous design procedures. The tests on the corrosion protection help to understand the stress condition of external tendons at <b>deviators.</b> Thus, improved external tendons can be developed...|$|R

25|$|Getting rid of Sandworms is possible, but tricky. First, {{they can}} only be fought from rocks. The Sandworm lures the attacking units into a great desert, and then turns against them, so chasing them down is futile. Apart from that, Sandworms are {{extremely}} resilient for most types of weapons, and immune to <b>Deviator</b> and spice mounds. It requires a combined fire of several heavy vehicles to make a Sandworm go away. Units and base defensive turrets will automatically fire at the Sandworm when it moves within range (except the Atreides in the early version of Dune II). Eventually, after the Sandworm has eaten enough vehicles, or its energy is drained to yellow, it will disappear and never emerge again. The radar marks them as a pulsating white dot.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} formal {{framework}} for handling deviation in settings where players divide resources among multiple projects, forming overlapping coalition structures. Having formed such a coalition structure, players share the revenue generated among themselves. Given a profit division, some players may {{decide that they}} are underpaid, and deviate from the outcome. The main insight of the work presented in this survey is that when players want to deviate, they must know how the non-deviators would react to their deviation: after the deviation, the <b>deviators</b> may still work {{with some of the}} non-deviators, which presents an opportunity for the non-deviators to exert leverage on <b>deviators.</b> We extend the overlapping coalition formation (OCF) model of Chalkiadakis et al.

We review some interesting aspects of the model, characterizations of stability in this model, as well as methods for computing stable outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} spatial differentiation on the sustainability of collusion on delivered prices. It shows that {{the choice of the}} punishment mechanism that enforces collusion is crucial for determining whether differentiation facilitates cartel pricing or not. If punishments are optimal, then differentiation tends to facilitate collusion. Optimal punishments impose minmax profits on <b>deviators</b> independently of the degree of differentiation. A high degree of differentiation then renders deviations less profitable, since it makes business stealing more costly but does not affect the <b>deviator's</b> punishment profits. Depending on the transport cost technology, excessive differentiation may have a countervailing effect, however, because it also implies high transport costs for the cartel. If collusion is sustained by standard grim trigger punishments instead, then collusion may be easiest for minimal differentiation. The reason is that competitive and thus grim trigger punishment profits are higher the higher the degree of differentiation.

40|$|Externallypost-tensioned steel tendons {{have long}} been an {{attractive}} option for increasing the design loads or correcting strength and serviceability problems in bridge and building structures. More recently, alternative solutions have been developed and implemented that use straight post-tensionedcarbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons, ideally enlisting their high-strength to failure, small relaxation, corrosion resistance, and light weight. In this paper, a novel CFRP system for external post-tensioning is presented. The solution consists of unbonded CFRP bars connected to dead- and live-end steel anchors by means of couplers that allow the bar to develop the full tensile strength. Intermediate <b>deviators</b> can be extended vertically to impart additional post-tensioning (PT) force and achieve a profiled bar configuration. The required uplift forces for deflectioncontrol of a flexural member are provided by modifying the number, position and extended height of the <b>deviators,</b> similarly to commercially available systems that use steel wire strands. The structural efficiency of such approach in controlling deflection is analyzed and discussed for single-span one-way members {{on the basis of}} a parametric study that considers the influence of member geometry, flexural stiffness, boundary conditions, and PT system layout.

40|$|Overlapping Coalition Formation (OCF) games (Chalkiadakis, Elkind, Markakis, Polukarov, & Jennings, 2010) are {{cooperative}} games where {{players can}} simultaneously participate in several coalitions. Capturing {{the notion of}} stability in OCF games is a difficult task: deviating players may continue to contribute resources to joint projects with non-deviators, and the crucial question is what payoffs the <b>deviators</b> expect to receive from such projects. Chalkiadakis et al. (2010) introduce three stability concepts for OCF gamesâthe conservative core, the refined core, and the optimistic coreâthat are based on different answers to this question. In this paper, we propose a unified framework {{for the study of}} stability in the OCF setting, which encompasses the stability concepts considered by Chalkiadakis et al. (2010) as well as a wide variety of alternative stability concepts. Our approach is based on the notion of arbitration functions, which determine the payoff obtained by the <b>deviators,</b> given their deviation and the current allocation of resources. We provide a characterization of stable outcomes under arbitration. Furthermore, we propose a criterion for an outcome to be in the refined or optimistic core, complementing the results of Chalkiadakis et al.
