5|$|Nevill {{was found}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} {{chair next to}} the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was {{a few inches from}} his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, a {{block of}} modern prison cells were built above <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> {{designed}} to house only the prisoners who worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens.</b> These cells were designed to house, usually, only one inmate at a time. Only trusted inmates that showed good behaviour and had cooking skills worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens.</b>|$|R

5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there. The women were initially held in the hospital building, and then in their own walled-off section of the prison, with cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and wash house buildings. The women were tasked with washing and mending prisoners' clothing, which was considered hard work.|$|E
5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich in olive oil, wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> whether they are health-giving or not.|$|E

5|$|The {{repertory}} of housekeeping instructions {{laid down}} by manuscripts like the Ménagier de Paris also include many details of overseeing correct preparations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Towards {{the onset of the}} early modern period, in 1474, the Vatican librarian Bartolomeo Platina wrote De honesta voluptate et valetudine ("On honourable pleasure and health") and the physician Iodocus Willich edited Apicius in Zurich in 1563.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey {{was carried out}} to investigate the occurrence of non-occupational pneumoconiosis in Ladakh, {{where there are no}} mines or industries. The clinicoradiological investigations of 449 randomly selected subjects from three villages showed typical cases of pneumoconiosis associated with progressive massive fibrosis and egg shell calcification of hilar glands. The prevalence of pneumoconiosis in these three villages was 2. 0 %, 20. 1 % and 45. 3 % and it corresponded with the severity of dust storms and the use of chimneys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens.</b> <b>The</b> dust concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> with no provision for a chimney were very high. The free silica content of the storms was between 60 and 70 %. Exposure to free silica from dust storms and soot from domestic fuels are suggested as causes of these cases of pneumoconiosis...|$|R

5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital bed and the latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed.

Homer then pulls out an axe and angrily chases Bart for using the device.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, William Sadler {{moved to}} Battle Creek, Michigan, {{to work at}} the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where he served as a bellhop and helped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> He also {{attended}} Battle Creek College for one year when he was 16. Both institutions had strong ties to his church and Sadler was mentored by local Adventist businessman John Harvey Kellogg, who heavily influenced Sadler's views. Sadler's early writings about health are similar to ideas advanced by John Kellogg, including the concept of autointoxication, and the idea that caffeine has negative health effects. He similarly condemned the consumption of tobacco, meat, and alcohol. Although Sadler did drink later in his life.|$|E
5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and two opposing fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E
