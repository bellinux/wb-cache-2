5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn <b>facial</b> <b>mask</b> may represent a separate colour. The head was evidently blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green <b>facial</b> <b>mask</b> {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{color and}} texture of the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant color is light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed around the body with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white <b>facial</b> <b>mask.</b> Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E

500|$|The Mascarene parrot was [...] {{in length}} {{with a large}} red bill and long, rounded tail feathers. Its legs were red, and it had naked red skin around the eyes and nostrils. It had a black <b>facial</b> <b>mask</b> and {{partially}} white tail feathers, but the colouration of the body, wings and head is unclear. Descriptions from life indicate the body and head were ash grey, and the white part of the tail had two dark central feathers. In contrast, descriptions based on stuffed specimens state that the body was brown and the head bluish but do not mention the dark central tail feathers. This {{may be due to}} the specimens having changed colour as a result of aging and exposure to light, as well as other forms of damage. Very little is known about the bird in life.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} face spoofing attacks (presen-tation attacks) has recently gained a well-deserved popu-larity. Mainly focusing on 2 D attacks forged by displaying printed photos or replaying recorded videos on mobile de-vices, {{a significant portion}} of these studies ground their ar-guments on the flatness of the spoofing material in front of the sensor. In this paper, we inspect the spoofing potential of subject-specific 3 D <b>facial</b> <b>masks</b> for 2 D face recognition. Additionally, we analyze Local Binary Patterns based coun-termeasures using both color and depth data, obtained by Kinect. For this purpose, we introduce the 3 D Mask Attack Database (3 DMAD), the first publicly available 3 D spoof-ing database, recorded with a low-cost depth camera. Ex-tensive experiments on 3 DMAD show that easily attainable <b>facial</b> <b>masks</b> can pose a serious threat to 2 D face recog-nition systems and LBP is a powerful weapon to eliminate it. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike {{other women}} of her time, Elisabeth used little {{cosmetics}} or perfume, as {{she wished to}} showcase her natural beauty, but she tested countless beauty products prepared in the court pharmacy, or prepared by a lady-in-waiting in her own apartments, to preserve it. Although one favorite, [...] "Crème Céleste", was compounded from white wax, spermaceti, sweet almond oil, and rosewater; she attached far less importance to creams and emollients, and experimented {{with a wide variety}} of facial tonics and waters, from which she apparently expected more results. Elisabeth slept without a pillow on a metal bedstead, all the better to retain her upright posture, with either raw veal or crushed strawberries lining her nightly leather <b>facial</b> <b>mask.</b> She was heavily massaged and often slept with cloths soaked in either violet- or cider-vinegar above her hips to preserve her slim waist, and her neck was wrapped with cloths soaked in Kummerfeld-toned washing water.

2500|$|Further {{differences}} between the KIF standard and those used internationally {{are found in the}} guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)—to an extent—and Ankara Kangal Derneği (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings {{than any of the other}} international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is head structure and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other Çoban Köpegi. In contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the Akbash and Anatolian. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Dogs have a black <b>facial</b> <b>mask,</b> and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, brindled, or spotted.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The present {{literature}} review, {{examined the}} effects of maxillary protraction in patients treated with different types of <b>facial</b> <b>masks.</b> METHODS: The review searched for relevant articles, including randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and uncontrolled trials. Comparisons were made between eight different types of facial masks: Delaire; Grummons; Petit; Turley; Batista; "Sky Hook"; Nanda and Türbinger. Following aspects were evaluated: a) the type of anchorage; the origin, direction and magnitude of forces and b) the relevant results of following skeletal and dental measurements: angular (SNA and SNB), linear (AFAI); vertical angles (SN. GoGn, FMA); dental (IMPA) and linear (1 -NA, 1 -NB). CONCLUSION: The results showed that there was no uniformity in the choice of anchorage type and form of application of forces between the <b>facial</b> <b>masks</b> examined, but there were similarities in skeletal and dental aspects: Anterior displacement of the maxillary complex (increase in SNA); anterior displacement of the upper anterior teeth (increase of 1 -NA), the lingual inclination of mandibular incisors (decrease of 1 -NB), down and back rotation of the mandible (increase AFAI, SN. GoGn, FMA, decrease in SNB) ...|$|R
30|$|Using {{pairwise}} comparison, other lifestyle, attitudinal, {{or behavioral}} characteristics measured {{in this study}} showed {{no difference between the}} two groups, including reported use of acne medication or cosmetic products for acne. There was no difference between the groups in their use of cosmetic procedures, including botox injections, resurfacing procedures, laser treatments, or dermal fillers. There was no difference in reported job satisfaction or in diagnosed atopic dermatitis or rosacea. In both groups, there was very limited use of cosmetic cleansers (other than “soap”), make-up removers, astringents/toners/fresheners, moisturizers, nighttime moisturizers, anti-wrinkle/anti-aging treatments, eye treatments, <b>facial</b> <b>masks,</b> <b>facial</b> exfoliators/scrubs, <b>masks,</b> and <b>facial</b> lightening/whitening products).
