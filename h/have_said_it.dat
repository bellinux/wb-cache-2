[...] Doyle, the guitarist, stated that Hot Chip change the original recordings when playing their music live. At the London-based studio called the Strongroom, [...] "One Pure Thought", [...] "Hold On" [...] and [...] "Shake a Fist" [...] were recorded live, instead of on multitrack, and were subsequently pieced together. This was the first occasion that Hot Chip had recorded music in a studio environment.|$|E

500|$|Charles Darwin's {{studies at}} the University of Cambridge {{included}} two other texts by Paley, and in his final exams in January 1831 he did well in questions on these texts. He had to stay on until June, and read Paley's Natural Theology as well as John Herschel's Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and Alexander von Humboldt's Personal Narrative: these books inspired [...] "a burning zeal" [...] to research natural history. After the Beagle voyage he began development of his theory of natural selection, and in 1838 opened a notebook listing [...] "books to be read", including [...] "Paley's Nat. Theology". In 1859, on completing On the Origin of Species, he told a friend [...] "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than Paley's Natural Theology: I could almost formerly <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> by heart." ...|$|E

[...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was recorded by Lennon in 1977, in his and Ono's Dakota building apartment in New York City, but was not complete. Lennon introduced the song on the cassette by imitating a New York accent and saying, [...] "Free—as a boid" [...] (bird). The other songs were [...] "Grow Old With Me", [...] "Real Love", and [...] "Now and Then". Ono says that it was Harrison and former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall who initially asked her about the concept of adding vocals and instrumentation to Lennon's demo tapes. Ono stated: [...] "People <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was all agreed when Paul came over to New York to induct John into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but it was all settled before then. I just used that occasion to hand over the tapes personally to Paul." ...|$|E

Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it....</b> This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E

500|$|During August 1944, two Tiger Ausf B {{tanks were}} {{captured}} by the Soviets near Sandomierz, and were soon moved to the testing grounds at Kubinka. During the transfer, the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather, where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox. The right suspension {{of one of the}} tanks had to be completely replaced, and its full functionality could not be re-established. The tank broke down again every 1015km. The 8.8 cm KwK 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy, which were on par with the 122mm D-25T. It proved capable of passing completely through its [...] "colleague", a Tiger Ausf B's turret at a range of 400 m. The armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152mm calibre. The welding was, despite careful workmanship, significantly worse than on similar designs. As a result, even when shells did not penetrate the armour, there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates, which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable. Further testing showed that the armour plate itself exhibited deficiencies in quality compared to earlier German tanks such as the Tiger I and Panther. Analysis of the Tiger Ausf B armour plate showed an absence of molybdenum (ascribed to a loss of supply, being replaced by vanadium), Some <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> gives the armour low malleability.|$|E
500|$|He {{was very}} careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and leave them open to interpretation. He {{explained}} in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture's finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, 'Now, {{what is it that you}} were trying to say in that picture?' And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was The Waste Land—what he meant by the poem. He replied, 'I meant what I said'. If I could <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> any differently, I would have". Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can both be appreciated by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual in the way that his films can because their [...] "emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects". He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction evoked by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a Time magazine interview in 1975, Kubrick further stated: [...] "The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves." [...] He also said [...] "Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the largely}} {{positive}} view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 {{that he had}} at some point announced, [...] "The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes." [...] A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though {{he was no longer}} dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement or holding in any way to its racist view: [...] "I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that." [...] Also, Red Robinson stated, [...] "Take a look at the things that are only publicized now, of how he'd be driving down the street and see a destitute black woman with a little child. He went and bought her a Cadillac. Now if this guy hated blacks, he wouldn't even have gone near them". Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and on the contrary elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist. Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland one evening, reported of Presley, [...] "He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest." [...] Dudley Brooks, an African-American composer and studio musician who worked with Presley during the 1950s and 1960s, also disputed allegations that Presley was a racist. Though the rumored remark was wholly discredited at the time, it was still being used against Presley decades later. The identification of Presley with racism—either personally or symbolically—was expressed most famously in the lyrics of the 1989 rap hit [...] "Fight the Power", by Public Enemy: [...] "Elvis was a hero to most / But he never meant shit to me / Straight-up racist that sucker was / Simple and plain".|$|E
