It is a material which exhibits simultaneous negative values for [...] permittivity, ε, and permeability, μ, in an overlapping frequency region. Since the values are derived {{from the effects of}} the composite medium system as a whole, these are defined as effective permittivity, εeff, and <b>effective</b> <b>permeability,</b> μeff. Real values are then derived to denote the value of negative index of refraction, and wave vectors. This means that in practice losses will occur for a given medium used to transmit electromagnetic radiation such as microwave, or infrared frequencies, or visible light – for example. In this instance, real values describe either the amplitude or the intensity of a transmitted wave relative to an incident wave, while ignoring the negligible loss values.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metamaterial}} {{was constructed}} as a periodic array of [...] copper split ring and wire conducting elements deposited onto a circuit-board substrate. The design {{was such that}} the cells, and the lattice spacing between the cells, were {{much smaller than the}} radiated electromagnetic wavelength. Hence, it behaves as an effective medium. The material has become notable because its range of (effective) permittivity εeff and permeability μeff values have exceeded those found in any ordinary material. Furthermore, the characteristic of negative (<b>effective)</b> <b>permeability</b> evinced by this medium is particularly notable, because it has not been found in ordinary materials. In addition, the negative values for the magnetic component is directly related to its left-handed nomenclature, and properties (discussed in a section below). The split-ring resonator (SRR), based on the prior 1999 theoretical article, is the tool employed to achieve negative permeability. This first composite metamaterial is then composed of split-ring resonators and electrical conducting posts.|$|E

40|$|Fractures in {{subsurface}} reservoirs {{are known}} to have significant impacts on reservoir productivity. Quantifying their importance, however, is challenged by limited subsurface observations, and intense computations for modelling and upscaling. In this paper, we present a workflow to construct and upscale fracture models based on outcrop studies in the Latemar carbonate platform (northern Italy). Fractures were first analysed to investigate their distinct characteristics throughout different sedimentological domains; that is, slope, margin and platform interior. Several fracture models were then built to represent different domains and were used to upscale fracture-network properties. Small-scale models were preferred to the reservoir-scale ones to enable multiple realizations and various sensitivity analyses in a time-efficient manner. The fracture characteristics of the Latemar Platform vary across different sedimentological domains. This variation results in a non-homogeneous permeability field that will influence flow behaviours. Fractures in the slope domain are typically tall but low in intensity, resulting in relatively low <b>effective</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> In the platform interior, smaller sizes of fractures combined with higher intensities give rise to higher <b>effective</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> In general, fracture intensities, aperture and their intrinsic permeability would {{have a significant impact on}} the permeability field.

50|$|Split ring {{resonators}} (SRRs) {{consist of}} a pair of concentric metallic rings, etched on a dielectric substrate, with slits etched on opposite sides. SRRs can produce an effect of being electrically smaller when responding to an oscillating electromagnetic field. These resonators have been used for the synthesis of left handed and negative refractive index media, where the necessary value of the negative <b>effective</b> <b>permeability</b> is due to the presence of the SRRs. When an array of electrically small SRRs is excited by means of a time varying magnetic field, the structure behaves as an effective medium with negative <b>effective</b> <b>permeability</b> in a narrow band above SRR resonance. SRRs have also been coupled to planar transmission lines, for the synthesis of transmission line metamaterials.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{magnetic}} permeability was originally achieved in a left-handed medium at microwave frequencies by using arrays of split-ring resonators. In most natural materials, the magnetically coupled response starts to taper off at frequencies in the gigahertz range, which implies that significant magnetism {{does not occur}} at optical frequencies. The <b>effective</b> <b>permeability</b> of such materials is unity, μeff = 1. Hence, the magnetic component of a radiated electromagnetic field has virtually no effect on natural occurring materials at optical frequencies.|$|E

As effective media, metamaterials can be characterized with complex ε(w) = ε1 + iε2 for effective permittivity and µ(w) = µ1 + i µ2 for <b>effective</b> <b>permeability.</b> Complex values of permittivity and permeability typically correspond to attenuation in a medium.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a theoretical explanation of the experimentally observed effect of non-monotonic field dependence of the <b>effective</b> magnetic <b>permeability</b> of ferrofluid emulsion. In a weak magnetic field, {{the growth of the}} induced droplet magnetic moment is faster than the linear one due to the droplet elongation accompanied by the reduction of the demagnetizing field. Thus, the emulsion magnetic permeability increases in weak magnetic fields. Further strengthening of the external magnetic field cannot lead to a significant decrease of the demagnetizing field, as the droplets are already highly elongated. On the other hand, the magnetic susceptibility of the ferrofluid reduces with the field strength. Hence, the <b>effective</b> magnetic <b>permeability</b> of the ferrofluid emulsion starts decreasing. The developed theoretical model describes well the experimental observations...|$|R

50|$|Previous {{studies of}} left-handed or {{negative}} index metamaterials {{were focused on}} the linear properties of the medium during wave propagation. In such cases, the view was that magnetic permeability and material permittivity are each non-dependent on {{the intensity of the}} electromagnetic field. However, creating tunable structures requires knowledge of non-linear properties where the intensity of the electromagnetic field alters the permittivity, or permeability, or both, which in turn affects the range of transmission spectra or stop band spectra. Hence, the <b>effective</b> <b>permeability</b> is dependendent on the macroscopic magnetic field intensity. As the field intensity is varied, switching between its positive and negative values can occur. Consequently, the material can switch from being left-handed to being right-handed, or vice versa.|$|E

The cluster could be characterized {{by a set of}} <b>effective</b> dielectric <b>permeabilities.</b> Their number coincides with the number of particles, where space arrangement in the cluster is correlated.

The renormalized photons are cycled or trapped inside the system of multi-scaled cavities inside the cluster.

Muskat included the new permeability-reducing parameter in the refined single-phase flow equations, and thus established a new differential equation that governs the flow of multi-phase fluids in porous media.
