40|$|We develop here a {{new method}} {{to fit the}} {{molecular}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials</b> obtained in quantum mechanical calculations {{to a set of}} classical electrostatic multipoles, usually point charges located at atomic positions. We define an object function of fitting as an integration of the difference of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials</b> in the entire 3 -dimensional physical space. The object function is thus rotationally invariant with respect to the molecular orientation and varies smoothly with respect to molecular geometric fluctuations. Compared with commonly employed methods such as the Merz-Singh-Kollman and CHELPG schemes, this new method, while possessing comparable accuracy, shows greatly improved numerical stability with respect to the molecular positions and geometries.

25|$|The {{electrical}} and physiological properties of ion channels are experimentally measured by inserting the channel into a lipid membrane separating two baths containing solutions of specific concentrations. A constant electrostatic bias is applied across the channel by immersing the electrodes {{in the two}} baths. Formulating boundary conditions that accurately represent these contact regions may require enormously large bath regions and is a challenging task. Beyond a Debye length from the membrane the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potential</b> and ion densities do not vary appreciably. This assumption has been supported {{by the results of}} continuum results presented earlier. For typical salt concentrations used in ion channel simulations, the Debye length is of the order of 10 Å. Using the assumption, Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the potential at the two domain boundary planes that are transverse to the channel, taking care that these planes are sufficiently far from the membrane.|$|E
25|$|In all {{most any}} of the methods in {{simulation}} of ion channels, the major computational cost comes from the calculation of electrostatic forces acting on the ions. In continuum models, for instance, where ionic density exist rather than explicit ions, the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potential</b> is calculated in a self-consistent manner by solving the Poisson equation. In MD simulations, on the other hand, the electrostatic forces acting on the particles are calculated by explicit evaluation of the Coulombic force term, often splitting the short-range and long-range electrostatic forces {{so they could be}} computed with different methods. In our model as a reduced particle method, the longrange electrostatic forces are evaluated by solving the Poisson equation and augmenting the forces so obtained with a short-range component. By solving the Poisson equation it is possible to self-consistently include the forces arising from the bias to the system, while this is a difficult issue to be addressed in MD simulations.|$|E
25|$|When solids of two {{different}} materials are in contact, thermodynamic equilibrium requires one of the solids assume a higher electrical potential than the other. This is called the contact potential. Dissimilar metals in contact produce what is known also as a contact electromotive force or Galvani potential. The magnitude of this potential difference is often expressed as a difference in Fermi levels in the two solids when they are at charge neutrality, where the Fermi level (a name for the chemical potential of an electron system) describes the energy necessary to remove an electron from the body to some common point (such as ground). If there is an energy advantage in taking an electron from one body to the other, such a transfer will occur. The transfer causes a charge separation, with one body gaining electrons and the other losing electrons. This charge transfer causes a potential difference between the bodies, which partly cancels the potential originating from the contact, and eventually equilibrium is reached. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Fermi levels are equal (the electron removal energy is identical) and {{there is now a}} built-in <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potential</b> between the bodies.|$|E
40|$|Quadrupole ion traps can be {{transformed}} into nonlinear traps with integrable motion by adding special <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials.</b> This {{can be done with}} both stationary <b>potentials</b> (<b>electrostatic</b> plus a uniform magnetic field) and with time-dependent electric potentials.

40|$|Hormones of the hematopoietin class mediate signal {{transduction}} by binding to specific transmembrane receptors. Structural {{data show that}} the human growth hormone (hGH) forms a complex with a homodimeric receptor and that hGH {{is a member of}} a class of hematopoietins possessing an antiparallel 4 -a-helix bundle fold. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that electrostatic interactions may have an important influence on hormonereceptor recognition. In order to examine the specificity of hormone-receptor complexation, an analysis was made of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials</b> of hGH, interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), interleukin- 4 (IL- 4), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and the hGH and IL- 4 receptors. The binding surfaces of hGH and its receptor, and of IL- 4 and its receptor, show complementary <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials.</b> The potentials of the hGH and its receptor display approximately 2 -fold rotational symmetry because the receptor subunits are identical. In contrast, the potentials of GM-CSF and IL- 2 Iack such symmetry, consistent with their known high affinity for hetero-oligomeric receptors. Analysis of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>potentials</b> supports a recently proposed hetero-oligomeric model for a high-affinity IL- 4 receptor and suggests a possible new receptor binding mode for G-CSF; it also provides valuable information for guiding structural and mutagenesis studies of signal-transducing proteins and their receptors...|$|R

500|$|The {{potential}} energy of an electron in an atom is negative, its dependence of its position reaches the minimum (the most absolute value) inside the nucleus, and vanishes when {{the distance from}} the nucleus goes to infinity, roughly in an inverse proportion to the distance. In the quantum-mechanical model, a bound electron can only occupy a set of states centered on the nucleus, and each state corresponds to a specific energy level; see time-independent Schrödinger equation for theoretical explanation. An energy level can be measured by the amount of energy needed to unbind the electron from the atom, and is usually given in units of electronvolts (eV). The lowest energy state of a bound electron is called the ground state, i.e. stationary state, while an electron transition to a higher level results in an excited state.
