Since no extra communication line and controllers are required, it is easily implemented and also increases the system modularity and reliability. By using the proposed approach the DC transmission losses can be reduced and system stability is not deteriorated for normal and fault scenarios.

40|$|The more {{electric}} aircraft initative {{results in}} significant {{challenges in the}} design of aircraft electrical power systems. Different power system architectures are currently being studied by the engineering community. In this thesis, a promising single DC bus-based, multiple-source multiple-load power system is investigated in terms of power management and stability. Due to its inherent modularity and ease of implementation, droop control, as a decentralised control method, has been widely used to cope with power sharing among parallel sources in the studied architecture. The thesis proposes a comparative study of different droop control approaches by focusing on steady-state power sharing performance and stability. •	Different droop control methods may lead to different stability margins. Until now, the effect of different droop control schemes on system stability has not been fully investigated. The thesis presents the control scheme for current-mode and voltage-mode systems, derives the corresponding output impedance of the source subsystem and analyses the stability of the power system. Based on the developed mathematical model, comprehensive modal analysis of the power system is performed. •	A generalised analytical impedance analysis is extended to a multi-source multi-load power system. To facilitate the analysis, the thesis proposes the concept of “global droop gain” as an important factor to determine the V-I bus characteristic and the stability behaviour of a parallel sources based DC system. •	Considering the tradeoff between voltage regulation and power sharing accuracy in droop control, this thesis proposes an improved voltage regulation method in multi-source based DC electrical power system. Due to the absence of additional controllers or communication lines, the proposed approach can be relatively easily implemented in a small scale DC electrical power system. The proposed approach effectively improves the load sharing accuracy under high droop gain circumstances with consideration of cable impedance. Optimal <b>droop</b> gain <b>settings</b> are investigated and the selection of individual droop gains has been described {{in order to reduce the}} distribution losses. Finally, the above-mentioned analytical results are confirmed by time-domain simulations and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} {{speed control}} scheme for diesel prime movers {{is presented in}} this paper. Diesel prime movers are characterized by nonlinear, time-varying parameters including a nonlinear input dead-time variation that introduces an unknown delay between the injection of fuel {{and the production of}} engine torque. Such plants are difficult to control by conventional proportional-integral (PI) controllers. It is shown that by assuming the existence of an additional system time constant, an explicit estimate of the plant parameters and dead-time may be obtained. The algorithm is fast converging. The resulting predictor can then be used to set up a k-step ahead predictive controller. Studies that compare the performance of the adaptive scheme to that of fixed, tuned PI controller are presented. The algorithm is shown to be flexible enough to operate under a wide range of <b>droop</b> <b>settings</b> and is equally applicable to various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} voltage control and {{provision}} of reactive power reserves were studied, for multiple generators {{connected to a}} common main transformer. The system that was considered consists of two power stations in Vik in Sogn, Hove and Refsdal, which are operated by Statkraft. Each of the power stations has two generators that {{are connected to the}} grid through a common transformer. In this thesis voltage control and reactive power should be analyzed, in an attempt to come up with suggestions to how voltage control of paralleled generators might be done. How the AVR's tuning of reactive droop and compensation would affect a power system with generators operating in parallel, and how utilizing different measuring points would affect the regulation, should also be investigated. The voltage drop across the transformers was also considered. In addition, the principles of the current strategy for control were discussed and tested, and Statnett's requirements regarding voltage control and provision of reactive power reserves were evaluated. To perform the different simulations, a simplified model of the actual system was made in the simulation programme DIgSILENT PowerFactory, and various functionalities in the programme were utilized. It should be mentioned that the voltage at both the generators' terminals and the transformer's grid side should be taken into account when investigating voltage control. It will not be sufficient to only consider the voltage at the terminals, as the transformer reactance will introduce some voltage drop. As a net droop is required on the generators' terminals in order to secure stable operation of paralleled generators, as was proved in the simulations, and the transformer reactance provides some voltage drop, the resulting droop at the transformer's grid side will be a result of both the <b>droop</b> <b>settings</b> as well as the transformer reactance. Hence, the transformer reactance limits how small the resulting droop at the grid side could be. When studying the voltage drop across the transformers, it was for this system found that the voltage variations at the generators' terminals, and the voltage drop across the transformers, were mainly related to the change in reactive power. The voltage variations were almost unaffected by the active power supply. The simulations investigating the effect of utilizing measurements from the transformer's grid side showed that there were no clear advantages by using this strategy. The stability was not improved, and the variations in voltage and reactive power remained equally large compared to the case when the measurements were taken from the generators' terminals. It was also found that there could not be a net compensation at the terminals of the paralleled generators, regardless of what measuring points were utilized. Hence, compensation could not be utilized in order to obtain a constant voltage at the transformer's grid side, when operating multiple generators connected to a common transformer. Consequently, a net droop must be applied at the generators for such cases, as mentioned above. The investigation of the AVR's tuning of reactive droop and compensation for one generator operating alone, showed that the generators might be able to contribute to improve the overall voltage control in the system. For a single operated generator compensation could be applied, and hence a more constant voltage might be obtained at the transformer's secondary side, dependent on the grid in which the generator is connected. The simulations investigating tuning of the AVRs, with respect to various voltage intervals, showed that the <b>droop</b> <b>settings</b> should be adjusted to suitable voltage ranges in order to improve the regulation. In today's system, the droop at the generators in Hove and Refsdal is of 5 % and 10 % respectively. But when considering the control procedure utilized, adjusting the reactive set point, the resulting droop at the secondary side is of about 33 % in Hove and 38 % in Refsdal. These droops are large, and the generators would consequently not provide much of a contribution to voltage and reactive power control. In order to obtain a better tuning of the AVRs, the power producer must first determine what voltage variations the droop should be adjusted to. If the power producer wants to avoid changing the set point for voltage or reactive power, even when large voltage variations are considered, a large droop is needed. On the other hand, if a smaller voltage range is considered, a larger contribution to voltage and reactive power control could be given if the droop is reduced. As mentioned above, the resulting droop on the grid side will be dependent on both the droop at the generators and the transformer voltage drop. It should also be mentioned that Statnett's requirements for voltage control and provision of reactive power reserves might be difficult for the power producers to meet, when operating paralleled generators. The simulations and analytical evaluations indicated that the resulting droop at the transformers' grid side were larger than what was found considering these requirements, due to the transformer reactance. In order to meet Statnett's demands the power producers operating paralleled generators might have to utilize control strategies that adjusts the AVR's set points, e. g. through a secondary control loop. Still, Statnett's requirements regarding voltage and reactive power control, and the cooperation between Statnett and the power producers, should be studied further, in order to approach the challenges related to the overall voltage control and system support of reactive power...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{penetration}} of distributed generation (DG) into existing electricity grids {{and the consequent}} development of active distribution networks (ADNs) have prompted an exploration of power distribution in a dc microgrid paradigm. Although dc power distribution has been implemented in aircraft, ships, and communication centres, the technology is still {{at an early stage}} and must be investigated with respect to technical feasibility when applied to distribution systems. In particular, the operation of a dc microgrid in both grid-connected and islanded modes and its integration into an existing ac infrastructure are subject to significant challenges that impede the practical realization of dc microgrids. On one hand, because the dc voltage profile is coupled with the injected active power at the system buses, it is seriously influenced by the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as solar and wind energy. In islanded operating mode, the presence of system resistance leads to a further trade-off between an appropriate system voltage profile and a precise power management scheme. On the other hand, the development of hybrid ac/dc microgrids introduces a fresh operational philosophy that enhances power sharing among ac and dc subgrids through the coupling of ac and dc steady-state variables. 	With these challenges as motivation, the primary goal of this thesis was to develop effective power management schemes and a steady-state analysis tool that can enable the reliable integration of dc microgrids into a smart hybrid ac/dc paradigm. Achieving this objective entailed the completion of three core studies: 1) the introduction of a robust control scheme for mitigating voltage regulation challenges associated with dc distribution systems (DCDSs) that are characterized by a high {{penetration of}} distributed and renewable generation, 2) the proposal of a supervisory control strategy for precise DG output power allocation that is based on DG rating and operational costs yet guarantees an appropriate voltage profile for islanded dc microgrids, 3) the development of an accurate and comprehensive power flow algorithm for analyzing the steady-state behaviour of islanded hybrid ac/dc microgrids, and 4) the optimization of hybrid ac/dc microgrids configuration. 	As the first research component, a novel multi-agent control scheme has been developed for regulating the voltage profile of DCDSs that incorporate a large number of intermittent energy sources. The proposed control scheme consists of two sequential stages. In the first stage, a distributed state estimation algorithm is implemented to estimate the voltage profile in DCDSs, thus enhancing the interlinking converter (IC) operation in regulating the system voltages within specified limits. If the IC alone fails to regulate the system voltages, a second control stage is activated and executed through either equal or optimum curtailment strategy of the DG output power. A variety of case studies have been conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and convergence characteristics of the control schemes that have been developed. 	The second element of this research is a multi-agent supervisory control that has been created in order to provide precise power management in isolated DC microgrids. Two aspects of power management have been considered: 1) equal power sharing, which has been realized via a proposed distributed equal power sharing (DEPS) algorithm, and 2) optimal power dispatch, which has been achieved through a proposed distributed equal incremental cost (DEIC) algorithm. Both algorithms offer the additional advantage of affording the ability to restore the average system voltage to its nominal value. Real-time OPAL-RT simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed algorithms in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) application. 	The third part of the research has introduced a sequential power flow algorithm for hybrid ac/dc microgrids operating in islanded mode. In contrast to the conditions in grid-connected systems, variable rather than fixed ac frequencies and dc voltages are utilized for coordinating power between the ac and dc microgrids. The primary challenge is to solve the power flow problem in hybrid microgrids in a manner that includes consideration of both the absence of a slack bus and the coupling between the frequency and dc voltage though ICs. In the proposed algorithm, the ac power flow is solved using the Newton-Raphson (NR) method, thereby updating the ac variables and utilizing them accordingly in a proposed IC model for solving the dc problem. This sequential algorithm is iterated until convergence. The accuracy of the algorithm has been verified through detailed time-domain simulations using PSCAD/EMTDC, and its robustness and computational cost compare favourable with those of conventional algorithms. 	The final part highlights the implementation of the developed steady-state models in obtaining an optimum hybrid microgrid configuration. The system configuration could be manipulated by changing the DG <b>droop</b> <b>settings</b> as well as the network topological structure. The contribution of both approaches has been investigated, through an optimum power flow (OPF) formulation, in improving the system loadability as the primary measure of the hybrid microgrid performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{power system}} {{characteristics}} are changing and new power {{production in the}} Nordic countries is dominated by modern wind turbines and small scale hydro power. These are wind turbines that are electrically decoupled from the power grid through converters and hydro units below 10 MW with less inertia constants. In Sweden the nuclear power {{will most likely be}} reduced in the years to come. Towards 2020 the HVDC capacity connected to Norway will be more than doubled as two new 1400 MW cables to Germany and Great Britain will come in operation. Overall this results in less rotating mass in the power system, creating a lower inertia level. Whether this will be a problem or not is crucial for operational strategies and system security. Especially low load scenarios are of concern, e. g. a summer day with high import, relatively high wind production and where large hydro and thermal units are off-line. There are requirements for the frequency reserves, but there are no requirements regarding inertia. Today the frequency containment reserves which are the primary reserves are organized as two separate mechanisms. FCR-N is for normal operation between 49. 9 - 50. 1 Hz with a requirement of 6000 MW/Hz, while FCR-D is for disturbances and is active between 49. 9 - 49. 5 Hz with a requirement of 3000 MW/Hz. The FCR-D response should be 50 % activated in 5 seconds and 100 % activated in 30 seconds. In addition there are a transient limit of 49. 0 Hz and a steady state limit of 49. 5 Hz. The question is whether these requirements will secure sufficient levels of inertia or if other measures must be taken. Possibilities of inertia compensation have been studied and simulated. Three alternatives were considered; synchronous condensers, synthetic inertia on wind turbines and synthetic inertia on HVDC. Synchronous condensers are a well established technology, while the synthetic inertia is a modern concept based on controls of power electronics and is still developing. Simulations were conducted in PSS®E using an aggregated Nordic model (Nordic 44). Three scenarios were considered. One of these was a reference scenario used to tune the model and included a recent outage of 1110 MW nuclear power in Sweden. Scenario 2 was a summer day from 2013 where production and load were low and import relatively high. This scenario was included to get an impression of the conditions today, as this is necessary to better estimate the future. The third scenario was a future scenario. The new HVDC cables in Norway were included and a summer day in 2020 with high import was considered in three versions. The first one (3 a) has a share of production similar of today, the next (3 b) was based on Statnett s worst case production portfolio including 20 % wind. The last one (3 c) is similar, but includes the possibility of synthetic inertia on both the installed wind and the VSC HVDC cables. When tuning the model response, several weaknesses of the Nordic 44 model were revealed. First of all voltage levels and lines were not up to date. Second, different area division in the model made it difficult to distribute production and load data. At last the capacity in some areas had to be expanded. In total this resulted in a load flow not reflecting the real situation. The aim of the work was not to improve the model and the dynamic analyses were conducted without too many changes. The model is simple and advanced functions as HVDC emergency power and parameter changes on governors were not included. Voltage dependence of the load appeared to be another factor of great influence in the model. The voltage regulation in the model is most likely not sufficient and it is probably another model weakness. The above mentioned factors might influence the results of the simulations. The same outage (1110 MW) was tested throughout the thesis. During the simulations both scenario 2 and 3 revealed low levels of inertia (135 to 104 GWs). Some outages (2 and 3 b) were also simulated from an initial frequency of 49. 9 Hz as a worst case scenario to check the FCR-D requirements. Doing so the frequency of both scenarios ended up below the transient limit, even though the outage was less than the dimension incident. Adjusting the <b>droop</b> <b>settings</b> mainly affected the steady state frequency. The FCR-D requirement of 50 % activation in five seconds was not met. Another option was considered; more hydro production on line at lower output. This increased both inertia and FCR and was therefore efficient. Anyway, this is not a desired way to increase the inertia as energy is assumed spilled. However this alternative met the 50 % activation after five seconds requirement with 40 % (of PMax) output on all hydro generators. This is remarkable as it does not reflect a realistic operation situation and is probably due to a slow model response. For inertia compensation synthetic inertia appeared to be a better alternative than synchronous condensers. This is due to the low inertia constant of the synchronous condensers compared to the flexible gain value of the synthetic inertia. Furthermore, the synthetic inertia needs more attention, especially the possibilities on HVDC cables. In this thesis a simplification was made; the wind model was also used to model the synthetic inertia from HVDC. As only import is studied this is possible. The disadvantage is that since the wind model is based on the mechanics of a wind turbine, the power taken from the rotor must be recovered. This is not the case for HVDC cables as the connecting country can be assumed unlimited. Wind plans in Norway are rather unclear and the government s target of 3000 - 3500 MW installed wind within 2020 might be too optimistic. However, the mentioned 2800 MW HVDC cables will be built and are therefore a more realistic source of synthetic inertia in Norway. Whether the FCR requirements will secure the levels of inertia is difficult to say from the model. The five second activation requirement seems to be very strict for these simulations using this model. Achieving 50 % after five seconds required lots of hydro power online at low output and this also coped with the other requirements. Anyway, this might be due to a slow model response and should not be seen as a finding. The structure of the FCR is a topic under investigation by the TSOs today. From these analyses the division between FCR-N and FCR-D {{do not seem to be}} optimal. Especially remarkable is how to relate the output requirement based on time with the requirement of frequency bias available. Clearer definitions of the different requirements or restructuring should be considered. As low inertia levels were reveled both in the past and future scenario action regarding inertia should be taken. A need to control the amount of inertia online is inherent. Therefore, possibilities for inclusion of inertia in the FCR market or creation of a separate market should be investigated...|$|E
