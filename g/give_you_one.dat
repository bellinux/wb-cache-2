2500|$|In {{his book}} [...] (2005), Malcolm Gladwell relates his conversations with market {{researchers}} in the food industry who put most {{of the blame for}} the failure of New Coke on the flawed nature of taste tests. They claim most are subject to systematic biases. Tests such as the Pepsi Challenge were [...] "sip tests", meaning that drinkers were given small samples (less than a can or bottle's worth) to try. Gladwell contends that what people say they like in these tests may not reflect what they actually buy to drink at home over several days. Carol Dollard, who once worked in product development for Pepsi, told Gladwell: [...] "I've seen many times where the sip test will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> result and the home-use test will give you the exact opposite." [...] For example, although many consumers react positively to the sweeter taste of Pepsi in small volumes, it may become unattractively sweet when drunk in quantity. Coke, on the other hand, may be more attractive for drinking in volume, because it is less sweet. A more comprehensive testing regimen could possibly have revealed this, Gladwell's sources believe.|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated {{the number of}} murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; {{but no one can}} go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: [...] "Mr. John Taylor-We will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>one</b> week to go, but if you are alive on next Saturday you will die." [...] Another, to three bosses, charged with [...] "cheating thy men" [...] had a picture of three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, [...] "This is your home." [...] In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he would ever see wife and children again.|$|E
