Although the silver screen used in RealD Cinema is brighter than the standard white screen used for 2D projection, the ZScreen polarization filter {{in front of the}} projector blocks half of the projected light, then half of the light reflected by the silver screen is filtered away by the polarized glasses. This results in less than 25% of the projected light reaching the eyes of the viewer. Conversely, in a standard 2D system, the only significant cause of light loss is absorption by the white screen. RealD estimates the viewer sees about 35% of the light when viewing RealD 3D when compared to a similarly projected 2D image on a standard white screen. The overall effect is that of wearing a pair of slightly darkened glasses in a standard movie theater, which could be compensated for by using projector lamps that are about three times brighter if a 100% compensation is intended.|$|E

An alternative procedure to identify the instantaneous damping history from the analytic signal was also presented.

The optical wideband regime may exceed analog to digital converters (ADCs) front-end bandwidth. Multi-channel sampling approaches, such as multicoset or interleaved ADCs, have been proposed to sample the wideband signal using several channels. Each channel samples below the Nyquist rate such that the overall sampling rate is preserved. However, this scheme suffers from two practical limitations that make its implementation difficult. First, the <b>inherent</b> anti-aliasing <b>filter</b> of the samplers distorts the wideband signal.

From a technial perspective, the physical security {{problem can be}} seen as minimising the probability that intruders and other anomalous events will occur unobserved. A robotic solution is proposed using an artificial immune system, traditionally applied to software security, to identify threats and hazards: the dendritic cell algorithm. It is demonstrated that the migration from the software world to the hardware world is achievable for this algorithm and key properties of the resulting system are explored empirically and theoretically. It is found that the algorithm has a hitherto unknown frequency-dependent component, making it ideal for filtering out sensor noise. Weaknesses of the algorithm are also discovered, by mathematically phrasing the signal processing phase as a collection of linear classifiers. It is concluded that traditional machine learning approaches are likely to outperform the implemented system in its current form. However, it is also observed that the algorithm’s <b>inherent</b> <b>filtering</b> characteristics make modification, rather than rejection, the most beneficial course of action.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a new method (named mean normalized gain, MNG) to systematically characterize the V˙O 2 temporal dynamics. Eight healthy, young adults (28 ± 6 years old, 175 ± 7 cm and 79 ± 13 kg) performed multiple pseudorandom binary sequence cycling protocols on different days and time of the day. The MNG was calculated as the normalized amplitude of the V˙O 2 signal in frequency-domain. The MNG was validated considering the time constant τ obtained from time-domain analysis as reference. The intra-subject consistency of the MNG was checked by testing the same participant on different days and times of the day.

For a theoretical model of a fiber laser we developed a numerical model and methods for characterisation of Er 3 +/Yb 3 + codoped fibres that serve as a gain medium of the laser. The numerical model is based on an iterative solution of the fibre propagation and the laser rate equations. The parameters or rare-earth ions doping are obtained from the measurements of the absorption saturation at a specific wavelength in the Er 3 +/Yb 3 + doped fibre by fitting the measured curves of the absorption saturation using the theoretical model. We propose and demonstrate both numerically and experimentally that an Er-doped 2 -C fibre (ErTCF) can be employed as a tracking narrow-band filter in tunable fibre ring lasers operating at 1550 nm wavelength range for line narrowing and wavelength stabilisation. The partial separation of the light paths for different wavelengths in the ErTCF coupler mimics the saturable absorption with inhomogeneous broadening. The slow Er ion saturation dynamics prevents wavelength hopping whilst it enables the filter to track the operation wavelength when the laser is tuned. The operation of the device is improved by utilizing the <b>inherent</b> <b>filtering</b> effect of a 2 -C fibre coupler.
