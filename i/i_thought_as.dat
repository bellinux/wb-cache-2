Frusciante has also noted his increased use of the Roland MC-202 for his electronic music, {{saying that he was}} at the point [...] "where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> much like a 202ist as I did a guitarist..."

500|$|Night {{fighter pilot}} Wilhelm Johnen {{commented on the}} arrival of Sayn-Wittgenstein at his unit: [...] "... A madman, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> I took my leave. Once outside I got into {{conversation}} with the Prince's crew. Among other things {{they told me that}} their princely coachman had recently made his radio operator stand to attention in the plane and confined him to his quarters for three days because he (the radio operator) had lost his screen [...] during a mission." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2008, Usher's father, Usher Raymond III, died. Both men regretted not {{spending}} more time in each other's lives. [...] "Prayer for You", the seventh track on Here I Stand, is an interlude dedicated to Usher's son, reflective on {{his relationship with his}} own father; [...] "No matter what happened, my father always prayed for me. The only difference is, I'm gonna be there to be the father that my dad wished he was to me." [...] The first album name that artists and repertoire representative Mark Pitts conceived was [...] "Measure of a Man", but that title had already been used by Clay Aiken for his debut album, so Usher called it Here I Stand. Pitts said, [...] "It was perfect because becoming a man is about going though pain, sorrow, and happiness. Usher's done that! From the love songs to the party joints, it's exactly the story he wanted to tell." [...] Usher noted Here I Stand as beginning [...] "a new chapter in my life"; the album's liner notes contain a verse from 1 Corinthians 13: [...] "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>as</b> a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things." [...] Here I Stand marked Usher's growth from boyhood to manhood. In March 2007, it was announced that work on the album had begun. Usher outlined the album's concept: [...] "A lot of what I plan to offer with this album is kinda standing in this spot ... The king's back. I ain't gonna say 'back,' I never left." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison was {{recalled}} to the squad, but {{omitted from}} the XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, [...] "fortunately", in his opinion: [...] "I say [...] fortunately because I never liked bowling at Old Trafford; {{it was more of}} a [...] spinner's wicket." [...] Only 24 wickets fell in the match, and both Jonathan Agnew and Paul Allott, rivals for a fast-bowling place, went wicketless. In the event, both Agnew and Allot were {{omitted from the}} next XI and Ellison was recalled for the fifth test. He remembers: [...] "When we got to Edgbaston I was advised not to play by Bernard Thomas (England physio) as I had a heavy cold. He thought I would not get through five days. The decision was left to me and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> I had come this far, then why not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1941, Captain Douglas Marr, the Deputy Assistant Provost Marshal of the Singapore Fortress Command, {{was accused}} of having {{committed}} [...] "an act of gross indecency" [...] with a male Malay youth, Sudin bin Daud, who denied being a [...] "catamite". Sudin claimed that on March 13 or 14, he was walking along Stamford Road, a supposed [...] "area for male prostitutes", at night when a car driven by Marr stopped, picked him up and brought him to his boarding house in Tanglin Hill. The offence against Section 377A allegedly took place there, he claimed, whereupon Marr gave Sudin some money and let Sudin take a watch before Sudin left, leaving his shirt there. In his defence, Marr claimed that {{he had wanted to}} get [...] "at the root of the homosexual type of vice and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>as</b> it transpires very foolishly, {{that it would be a}} good idea to question a catamite and to try and find out to what extent soldiers in different regiments were involved". Marr did not deny picking up Sudin, who he claimed approached him, but maintained that he merely questioned him back home to no avail, as he had mistaken Sudin for an Indian and spoken to him in Hindustani. On 16 April and 29 July, after a withdrawn appeal by the prosecution, Marr was acquitted of the charge, despite the fact that Sudin's shirt was found in his room. Sudin, who had pleaded guilty to the act of gross indecency and theft of the watch, was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment on 27 March.|$|E
