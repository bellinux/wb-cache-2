5000|$|Scales are {{not usually}} random, but are based upon simple {{divisions}} of either the Imperial system, or the Metric system.For example, 1:48 scale is 1/4" [...] to 1-foot (or 1" [...] to 4 feet) and 1:72 is 1" [...] to 6 feet, while metric scales are simpler, such as 1:100th, which equals 1 centimeter to 1 meter.1:72 scale was first introduced in the Skybirds wood and metal model aircraft kits in 1932. Skybirds was followed closely by Frog which produced 1:72 scale aircraft in 1936 under the [...] "Frog Penguin" [...] name. According to Fine Scale Modeler magazine, 1:72 was also popularized by the US War Department during the Second World War when it requested models of single engine aircraft at that scale. The War Department also requested models of multi-engine aircraft at a scale of 1:144. The War Department was hoping to educate Americans in the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> These scales provided the best compromise between size and detail. After WWII, manufacturers continued to favor these scales, however kits are commonly available in 1:48, 1:35, 1:32, and 1:24 scales.

It is assumed that the aircraft has no inbuilt navigational sys-tem, nor any sensors mounted on its control surfaces. The con-trol column and pedals manipulated by the pilot can only visu-ally be observed. For the time of data logging, an external sen-sory system (GPS, IMU) and a camera system were deployed on the airplane supporting the collection of flight data. The paper presents the data acquisition solutions required for aircraft’s nonlinear model identification, {{with an emphasis on}} the determination of the control surface positions as the sys-tem’s input signals using image processing. During flight, the control column and pedal positions manipulated by the pilot are recorded using a video camera and with post processing, data is converted to control surface (rudder, elevator, aileron) positions. The 3 D positions of the pilot’s control column are determined from 2 D pixel values. The input signals are then calculated us-ing this information and the control surface characteristics. The input signals and state variables determined with a state esti-mator are regarded as input signals for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> an <b>aircraft’s</b> nonlinear model.

40|$|An {{important}} step in system <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> is the estimation of stability and control derivatives from flight data along with an assessment of parameter accuracy.
