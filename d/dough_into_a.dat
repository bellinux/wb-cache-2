I then went among the various cooks, to compare their receipts for making [...] "duffs:" [...] and having well weighed them all, and gathered from each a choice item to make an original receipt of my own, with due deliberation and solemnity I proceeded to business. Placing the component parts in a tin pan, I kneaded them together for an hour, entirely reckless as to pulmonary considerations, touching the ruinous expenditure of breath; and having decanted the semi-liquid <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> canvas-bag, secured the muzzle, tied on the tally, and delivered it to Rose-water, who dropped the precious bag into the coppers, along with a score or two of others.|$|E

5000|$|First, wheat or {{rice flour}} is turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> soft <b>dough</b> by adding {{water and a}} little bit of salt. Then, the dough is put in a bowl, water is added and the dough has to be [...] "rinsed" [...] until the water is {{saturated}} with starch from the <b>dough,</b> turning <b>into</b> <b>a</b> muddy white color. The remainder of the dough is now removed, and the bowl is left to rest overnight at a cool place to allow the dissolved starch to precipitate.|$|R
5000|$|Oliebollen are {{a variety}} of {{dumpling}} made by using an ice cream scoop or two spoons to scoop a certain amount of dough and dropping the <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> deep fryer filled with hot oil.

50|$|The only {{ingredient}} needed {{when making}} àmàlà is {{boiling water and}} one of the types of flour. Once the water has come to a boil, the heat is reduced. The flour is added and stirred until all the water is absorbed. More hot water is added, then the dough is left to simmer for approximately five minutes. Then the dough is kneaded until it has the desired texture. Kneading the <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> smooth paste is {{the most difficult part of}} making àmàlà.|$|E
50|$|Bread-making was a woman's task. It was {{generally}} {{carried out by}} several women at once, due to its labour-intensive nature.

5000|$|Khanom khrok or coconut-rice pancakes (ขนมครก, [...] ) {{are one of}} {{the ancient}} Thai desserts. They are {{prepared}} by mixing rice flour, sugar, and coconut milk to form a dough. Usually, khanom khrok is composed of two batters, one salty and one sweet, both of which are cooked in a heating mantle-a hot indented frying pan. After heating, khanom khrok will be picked out of the mantle and the two half-circular <b>doughs</b> formed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> circular shape.|$|R
50|$|Shakoy or siyakoy {{from the}} Visayas islands (also known as lubid-lubid in the {{northern}} Philippines) uses a length of <b>dough</b> twisted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> distinctive rope-like shape before being fried. The preparation is {{almost exactly the same}} as doughnuts, though there are variants made from glutinous rice flour. The texture can range from soft and fluffy, to sticky and chewy, to hard and crunchy. They are sprinkled with white sugar, but can also be topped with sesame seeds or caramelized sugar.|$|R
50|$|Retarding {{may occur}} {{at any time}} during {{fermentation}} and is accomplished by placing the <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dough retarder, refrigerator, or other cold environment to slow the activity of the yeast. The retarding stage is often used in sourdough bread recipes to allow the bread to develop its characteristic flavor. A cold fermentation stage is sometimes used to develop flavor in other artisan breads, with a part of the dough ("pre-ferment") before the final mixing, with the entire dough during bulk fermentation, or in the final fermentation stages after shaping.|$|E
50|$|Dasik {{is shaped}} {{with a wooden}} or {{porcelain}} press that forms a patterned confectionery. The press is engraved with a design that forms an embossed pattern on the dasik piece. The design would symbolize the family's name in order to wish for a long life or for a special event, like hwangap or 60th birthday or weddings.Press the <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Dasikpan that has letters, flowers or a geometric pattern is embossed. The surface of dasik has letters, flower patterns, or Chinese letters 壽·福·康·寧 representing long life, luck, health and peacefulness. Two dasikpan forms one set. Its length is 30∼60㎝, width is 5∼6㎝, and thickness is 2∼3㎝.|$|E
5000|$|Ring {{doughnuts}} {{are formed}} {{by one of}} two methods: by joining the ends of a long, skinny piece of <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> ring, or by using a doughnut cutter, which simultaneously cuts the outside and inside shape, leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole (from the dough removed from the center). This smaller piece of dough can be cooked {{and served as a}} [...] "doughnut hole" [...] or added back to the batch to make more doughnuts. A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and pinched into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole. Alternatively, a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough (batter) directly into the fryer.|$|E
5000|$|Baking: The proofed <b>dough</b> {{is loaded}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hot oven for baking.

When baked, it is usually rubbed with butter, and then eaten with spicy chole (chickpea curry).|$|R
5000|$|The Mr. Pastie is an {{oven-baked}} pie. It {{consists of}} a handmade <b>dough</b> shell, folded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> half-circle around a filling traditionally consisting of [...] "ground beef, diced potatoes, and minced onion." [...] Fillings may incorporate additional vegetables, such as carrots and peas, and Real English Foods has made pasties containing chicken, pork, ham, and sausage.|$|R
50|$|Place the flour, baking powder, {{salt and}} mace {{in a medium}} bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an {{electric}} mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well-combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll the <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat {{the oil in a}} deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts.|$|E
5000|$|The dish is {{composed}} of dough containing copious amounts of fat, flour and water. The form of fat used is usually ghee (clarified butter). Some people add sweetened condensed milk to the mix. The entire mixture is kneaded thoroughly, flattened, oiled and folded repeatedly. It is then allowed to proof and rise, and the process is repeated. These days, many restaurants do not prepare the dough themselves, tubs of prepared balls of dough are delivered by truck from a central facility. The final round of preparation consists of flattening the dough ball, spreading it out until paper thin (this is usually done by [...] "tossing" [...] it on a flat surface), and then gathering this thin sheet of <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> long rope-like mass. This [...] "rope" [...] is then wound into a knot or spiral and then flattened, so the ideal roti consists of thin flakes of dough when cooked, fluffy {{on the inside and}} crisp on the outside. Up until the 1970s it was common for cooks to make the [...] "rope" [...] quite long and form a spiral that went around several times (much like the modern [...] "roti bom"), but this is no longer the case, probably because the amount of dough used per roti is about half of what it used to be, and a roti made this way would be only the size of a [...] "roti bom". When making varieties with fillings, however, the fillings (be it egg, chopped onions, etc.) is spread or sprinkled on the thin sheet of dough, which is then folded into a square, trapping the fillings inside.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{processing}} {{conditions on the}} shear-induced migration of starch and gluten was described. A shearing device was used to induce a separation of wheat <b>dough</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> gluten rich fraction and a starch phase. A two-stage mechanism for separation was observed: first local aggregation of gluten, followed by migration of the gluten domains to {{the apex of the}} cone. The process was not strongly influenced by variations in the process conditions, possibly because a change in process parameter could have opposing effects on stages 1 and 2. Severe process conditions can lead to gluten damage and thereby a reduction in the driving force for separation. A relatively low temperature (10 – 15 °C) and low rotational speed (10 rpm) had a positive effect on the gluten migration inside the shearing device. A simple model was proposed to explain the effect of process parameters on the second stage of the gluten migration proces...|$|E
50|$|Bannocks {{are flat}} cakes of barley or oatmeal <b>dough</b> formed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> round or oval shape, then cooked on a griddle (Scots: girdle). The most {{authentic}} versions are unleavened, {{but from the}} early 19th century bannocks have been made using baking powder, {{or a combination of}} baking soda and buttermilk or clabbered milk. Before the 19th century, bannocks were cooked on a bannock stone (Scots: stane), a large, flat, rounded piece of sandstone, placed directly onto a fire, then used as a cooking surface. Several varieties of bannock include Selkirk bannocks, beremeal bannocks, Michaelmas bannock, Yetholm bannock, and Yule bannock.|$|R
5000|$|Rugelach closely {{resemble}} schnecken, an eastern European (Poland, Russia, Ukraine) Jewish pastry that generally has cream cheese dough and is rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cylinder and sliced, becoming a flat spiral, whereas rugelach are formed from individual triangles of <b>dough</b> and rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crescent shape. In recent years, chefs have introduced savory versions of these pastries, filled with chicken and schmaltz or salmon and boursin cheese.|$|R
50|$|Qutab {{is made by}} {{creating}} a stiff dough from flour, water, eggs, and salt. The <b>dough</b> is rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> thin circular layer and the middle of each circle filled with stuffing before finally being folded <b>into</b> <b>a</b> crescent shape. The resulting patties are griddled {{on both sides and}} served by pouring over butter on top. Qutab is usually served with yoghurt with green coriander, fennel and sumac.|$|R
