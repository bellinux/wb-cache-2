5|$|The 2008–09 {{season began}} with more time off in November due to {{separate}} leg and shoulder injuries. After returning, {{he was hit}} into the boards by Edmonton Oilers captain Ethan Moreau on 17 December 2008, and suffered a broken rib. He missed 15 games before returning on 20 January 2009. Limited to 60 games, he managed five goals and 25 points in the regular season. In the ensuing playoffs, Salo scored seven points in seven games, including game-winning goals in both game ones {{of the first and}} second rounds against the St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks, respectively. Salo injured himself in game two of the second round, tearing his <b>gluteus</b> medius muscle while taking a slapshot in which he scored. He played through the injury the following game before missing the next two matches. Following his return, the Canucks were eliminated in the sixth game by the Blackhawks. Salo had three goals and seven points in seven games.|$|E
25|$|The anterolateral {{approach}} {{develops the}} interval between the tensor fasciae latae and the <b>gluteus</b> medius. The <b>Gluteus</b> medius, <b>gluteus</b> minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after {{the replacement of the}} joint.|$|E
25|$|The {{perforator}} of the sc-GAP flap courses {{between the}} <b>gluteus</b> medius and maximus muscles. Using the septocutaneous gluteal artery perforator obviates {{the need for}} intramuscular dissection.|$|E
25|$|The lateral {{approach}} is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires {{elevation of the}} hip abductors (<b>gluteus</b> medius and <b>gluteus</b> minimus) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley), or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using sutures. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this, the relatively wide shape (front to back) of the pelvis provides greater leverage for the <b>gluteus</b> medius and minimus. These muscles {{are responsible for}} hip abduction which plays an integral role in upright balance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} incisions, defined by their {{relation}} to the <b>gluteus</b> medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool), antero-lateral (Watson-Jones), anterior (Smith-Petersen) and greater trochanter osteotomy. There is no compelling evidence in the literature for any particular approach, but consensus of professional opinion favours either modified anterolateral (Watson-Jones) or posterior approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The <b>gluteus</b> maximus has its origin between (and around) the iliac crest and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The <b>gluteus</b> maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the <b>gluteus</b> medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The {{more common}} lateral extra {{articular}} type of snapping hip syndrome {{occurs when the}} iliotibial band, tensor fasciae latae, or <b>gluteus</b> medius tendon slides {{back and forth across}} the greater trochanter. This normal action becomes a snapping hip syndrome when one of these connective tissue bands thickens and catches with motion. The underlying bursa may also become inflamed, causing a painful external snapping hip syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In {{surgical}} praxis, {{the abdomen}} {{is the primary}} donor-site for harvesting the tissues to create the free flap, because that region of the woman’s body usually contain’s sufficient (redundant) adipocyte fat and skin -tissues that are biologically compatible and aesthetically adequate {{for the construction of}} a substitute breast. The secondary donor-sites for harvesting adipocyte and skin tissues to create a free flap are the regions of: (i) the <b>gluteus</b> maximus muscles, (ii) the medial thigh, (iii) the buttocks, and (iv) the waist of the woman’s body.|$|E
25|$|The entire arm is {{referred}} to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the olecranon or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. The buttocks are the <b>gluteus</b> or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis.|$|E
25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis is to go forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the <b>gluteus</b> maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|Musculoskeletal imaging: PET {{has been}} shown to be a {{feasible}} technique for studying skeletal muscles during exercises like walking. One of the main advantages of using PET is that it can also provide muscle activation data about deeper lying muscles such as the vastus intermedialis and the <b>gluteus</b> minimus, as compared to other muscle studying techniques like electromyography, which can be used only on superficial muscles (i.e., directly under the skin). A clear disadvantage, however, is that PET provides no timing information about muscle activation because it has to be measured after the exercise is completed. This is due to the time it takes for FDG to accumulate in the activated muscles.|$|E
25|$|However, {{given the}} very real {{possibility}} of a limp, constant and/or debilitating pain, complicated treatment and impaired mobility later in life, careful developmental monitoring is indicated and early intervention is often the result. The worst possible consequence of non treatment is developing early arthritis, sometimes even during teenage years. All treatment aims to delay the onset of arthritis, but no treatment is fully successful in avoiding it; and, all available treatments bear the risk of inflicting equivalent damage. Most unfortunately, studies have as yet {{been unable to find}} a method of predicting outcomes in either the surgical/orthopedic treatment of the condition in infants and young children, or the surgical treatment of these early treatments' negative outcomes later in life (such as arthritis, avascular necrosis, trochanteric bursitis, and bone spurs of up to 2cm just medial of the <b>gluteus</b> maximus insertion point on the greater trochanter due to excessive friction).|$|E
25|$|The {{regions of}} the hip are all located in the thigh: anteriorly, the sub{{inguinal}} region is bounded by the inguinal ligament, the sartorius, and the pectineus and forms part of the femoral triangle which extends distally to the adductor longus. Posteriorly, the gluteal region corresponds to the <b>gluteus</b> maximus. The anterior region of the thigh extends distally from the femoral triangle to {{the region of the}} knee and laterally to the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior region ends distally before the popliteal fossa. The anterior and posterior {{regions of the}} knee extend from the proximal regions down {{to the level of the}} tuberosity of the tibia. In the lower leg the anterior and posterior regions extend down to the malleoli. Behind the malleoli are the lateral and medial retromalleolar regions and behind these is the region of the heel. Finally, the foot is subdivided into a dorsal region superiorly and a plantar region inferiorly.|$|E
25|$|While {{the first}} mention of urinary {{incontinence}} occurs in 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus, the first mention of FI {{in a medical}} context is unknown. For many centuries, colonic irrigation was the only treatment available. Stoma creation was described in 1776, FI associated with rectal prolapse in 1873 and anterior sphincter repair in 1875. During the mid 20th Century, several operations were developed for instances where the sphincters were intact but weakened. Muscle transpositions using the <b>gluteus</b> maximus or the gracilis were devised, but did not become used widely until later. End-to-end sphincteroplasty is shown {{to have a high}} failure rate in 1940. In 1971 Parks and McPartlin first describe an overlapping sphincteroplasty procedure. Biofeedback is first introduced in 1974. In 1975, Parks describes post anal repair, a technique to reinforce the pelvic floor and EAS to treat idiopathic cases. Endoanal ultrasound is invented in 1991, which starts to demonstrate the high number of occult sphincter tears following vaginal deliveries. In 1994, the use of an endoanal coil during pelvic MRI shows greater detail of the anal canal than previously. During the last 20 years, dynamic graciliplasty, sacral nerve stimulation, injectable perianal bulking agents and radiofrequency ablation have been devised, mainly due to the relatively poor success rates and high morbidity associated with the earlier procedures.|$|E
500|$|An email hoax {{describes}} the attacks by the South American Blush Spider in public toilets. The alleged spider's scientific name is Arachnius <b>gluteus,</b> where [...] "gluteus" [...] {{is supposed to}} mean [...] "buttocks" [...] (since there are muscles in the buttocks called <b>gluteus</b> maximus), and [...] "arachnius" [...] is a made-up word intended to mean [...] "spider". The hoax spider shares some characteristics with the two-striped telamonia (Telamonia dimidiata), {{and there is an}} updated version of the hoax using that name for the spider's species, {{with the rest of the}} text left unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|... the other, {{the short}} head, {{arises from the}} lateral lip of the linea aspera, between the {{adductor}} magnus and vastus lateralis, extending up almost {{as high as the}} insertion of the <b>gluteus</b> maximus; from the lateral prolongation of the linea aspera to within 5cm. of the lateral condyle; and from the lateral intermuscular septum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sciatic nerve}} block {{is done for}} {{surgeries}} at or below the knee. The nerve {{is located in the}} <b>gluteus</b> maximus muscle. The popliteal block is done for ankle, achilles tendon, and foot surgery. [...] It is done above the knee on the [...] posterior leg where the sciatic nerve starts splitting into the common peroneal and tibial nerves.|$|E
2500|$|Extra-articular {{snapping}} hip syndrome is {{commonly associated with}} leg length difference (usually the long side is symptomatic), tightness in the iliotibial band (ITB) on the involved side, weakness in hip abductors and external rotators, poor lumbopelvic stability and abnormal foot mechanics (overpronation). [...] Popping occurs when the thickened posterior aspect of the ITB or the anterior <b>gluteus</b> maximus rubs over the greater trochanter as the hip is extended.|$|E
2500|$|Five months later, {{this time}} with Admir Al Akbar in his corner, Happer {{returned}} to the Food Truck Rodeo where he successfully defended the GOUGE Raleigh Championship against Seymour Snott. Later on, he wrestled against Snott, Rob McBride, Jimmy Jack Funk, Jr. in a 6-man tag team match with Mikey Gambino and Lou Marconi. Happer also beat Mike West at the September 24 [...] "Fallout in Butner" [...] show. On October 8, he defeated Lou Marconi (with Count Grog) at Bud Light Concert Series in Raleigh. During the show, Happer attacked Jimmy Jack Funk, Jr. following his match with <b>Gluteus</b> Maximus. At Maul-O-Ween 2011, he beat Leatherface to retain the Raleigh Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Immediate though {{temporary}} {{relief of}} piriformis syndrome {{can usually be}} brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the piriformis muscle. [...] Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though {{the use of such}} medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the <b>gluteus</b> maximus, <b>gluteus</b> medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the piriformis. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, [...] transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and massage physiotherapy of the piriformis muscle region. One study of 14 people with what appeared to be piriformis syndrome indicated that rehabilitation programs that included physical therapy, low doses of muscle relaxants and pain relief medication were effective at alleviating most muscle and nerve pain caused by what the research subjects had been told was piriformis syndrome. [...] However, as this study included very few individuals and did not have a control group not receiving treatment (both serious methodological flaws), it provides no insight as to whether the pain in the piriformis would have simply dissipated on its own without any treatment at all and is therefore not only uninformative, it may actually be misleading. The injury is considered largely self-limiting and spontaneous recovery is usually on the order of a few days or a week to six weeks or longer if left untreated.|$|E
2500|$|Avoid {{using the}} {{pectoral}} muscles, such as by pushing {{on the chair}} arms to assist one's self out of a chair, or by using the arms to assist in sitting down. Proper standing technique is to rock {{three times in the}} chair and then stand to provide momentum for moving the center of gravity from the sitting to the standing position. Proper sitting technique is to slowly lower the bottom toward the chair seat using <b>gluteus</b> and quadriceps muscles ("legs only") without grabbing the chair arms. Second, patients should avoid lifting objects utilizing the pectoral muscles: carrying light objects with arms extended [...] down at sides, and lifting light objects with the elbows pressed to the chest and using the biceps, are acceptable. Also, avoid using the arms overhead.|$|E
2500|$|The ventral hip muscles {{function}} as lateral rotators and {{play an important}} role in the control of the body's balance. Because they are stronger than the medial rotators, in the normal position of the leg, the apex of the foot is pointing outward to achieve better support. The obturator internus originates on the pelvis on the obturator foramen and its membrane, passes through the lesser sciatic foramen, and is inserted on the trochanteric fossa of the femur. [...] "Bent" [...] over the lesser sciatic notch, which acts as a fulcrum, the muscle forms the strongest lateral rotators of the hip together with the <b>gluteus</b> maximus and quadratus femoris. When sitting with the knees flexed it acts as an abductor. The obturator externus has a parallel course with its origin located on the posterior border of the obturator foramen. It is covered by several muscles and acts as a lateral rotator and a weak adductor. The inferior and superior gemelli represent marginal heads of the obturator internus and assist this muscle. The three muscles have been referred to as the triceps coxae. The quadratus femoris originates at the ischial tuberosity and is inserted onto the intertrochanteric crest between the trochanters. This flattened muscle act as a strong lateral rotator and adductor of the thigh.|$|E
2500|$|The nerves of the sacral plexus pass {{behind the}} hip joint to {{innervate}} the posterior {{part of the}} thigh, most of the lower leg, and the foot. [...] The superior (L4-S1) and inferior gluteal nerves (L5-S2) innervate the <b>gluteus</b> muscles and the tensor fasciae latae. The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S1-S3) contributes sensory branches to the skin on the posterior thigh. [...] The sciatic nerve (L4-S3), the largest and longest nerve in the human body, leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. In the posterior thigh it first gives off branches to the short head of the biceps femoris and then divides into the tibial (L4-S3) and common fibular nerves (L4-S2). The fibular nerve continues down on the medial side of biceps femoris, winds around the fibular neck and enters {{the front of the}} lower leg. There it divides into a deep and a superficial terminal branch. The superficial branch supplies the peroneus muscles and the deep branch enters the extensor compartment; both branches reaches into the dorsal foot. In the thigh, the tibial nerve gives off branches to semitendinosus, semimembranosus, adductor magnus, and the long head of the biceps femoris. The nerve then runs straight down the back of the leg, through the popliteal fossa to supply the ankle flexors {{on the back of the}} lower leg and then continues down to supply all the muscles in the sole of the foot.|$|E
50|$|The gluteal muscles {{include the}} <b>gluteus</b> maximus, <b>gluteus</b> medius, <b>gluteus</b> minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. They cover the lateral {{surface of the}} ilium. The <b>gluteus</b> maximus, which forms most of the muscle of the buttocks, {{originates}} primarily on the ilium and sacrum and inserts on the gluteal tuberosity of the femur {{as well as the}} iliotibial tract, a tract of strong fibrous tissue that runs along the lateral thigh to the tibia and fibula. The <b>gluteus</b> medius and <b>gluteus</b> minimus originate anterior to the <b>gluteus</b> maximus on the ilium and both insert on the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae shares its origin with the <b>gluteus</b> maximus at the ilium and also shares the insertion at the iliotibial tract.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{with the}} hip flexed, the <b>gluteus</b> medius and minimus {{internally}} rotate the thigh. With the hip extended, the <b>gluteus</b> medius and <b>gluteus</b> minimus internally rotate the thigh.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Posterior view of <b>Gluteus</b> maximus and <b>Gluteus</b> medius ...|$|E
50|$|The normal <b>gluteus</b> maximus gait is {{when the}} <b>gluteus</b> maxims begins to {{contract}} at moment of heel-strike, slowing forward motion of trunk by arresting flexion of hip and initiating extension. When <b>gluteus</b> maximus is weak, trunk lurches backward (<b>gluteus</b> maximus lurch) at heel-strike on weakened side to interrupt forward motion of the trunk.|$|E
50|$|The <b>gluteus</b> maximus is {{the largest}} and most {{superficial}} of the three gluteal muscles. It makes up {{a large portion of the}} shape and appearance of the hips. It is a narrow and thick fleshy mass of a quadrilateral shape, and forms the prominence of the nates. The <b>gluteus</b> medius is a broad, thick, radiating muscle, situated on the outer surface of the pelvis. It lies profund to the <b>gluteus</b> maximus and its posterior third is covered by the <b>gluteus</b> maximus, its anterior two-thirds by the gluteal aponeurosis, which separates it from the superficial fascia and integument. The <b>gluteus</b> minimus is the smallest of the three gluteal muscles and is situated immediately beneath the <b>gluteus</b> medius.|$|E

5000|$|The {{adductor}} {{group is}} responsible for hip adduction. Abduction primarily occurs via the <b>gluteus</b> medius {{as well as the}} <b>gluteus</b> minimus.|$|E
50|$|The Trendelenburg {{gait pattern}} (or <b>gluteus</b> medius lurch) is an {{abnormal}} gait (as with walking) caused by {{weakness of the}} abductor muscles of the lower limb, <b>gluteus</b> medius and <b>gluteus</b> minimus. People with a lesion of superior gluteal nerve have weakness of abducting the thigh at the hip.|$|E
