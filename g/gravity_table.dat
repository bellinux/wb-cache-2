The original sample, obtained before the <b>gravity</b> <b>table</b> separation, and four fractions (heavy, medium heavy, medium light, and light) obtained from the discharge edge of each <b>gravity</b> <b>table,</b> were analyzed for physical (bulk density, weight of 100 seeds, volume, specific gravity, terminal velocity, purity, breakage susceptibility, and pericarp injury), physiological (standard germination, cold germination, conductivity, and field emergence), and chemical composition (NIR protein, oil, and starch contents);Both gravity tables performed similarly as determined by the seed quality of various fractions.

[...] In 1687 Isaac Newton in Principia Mathematica showed this was because the Earth had a slightly [...] oblate shape (flattened at the poles) caused by the centrifugal force of its rotation. [...] At higher latitudes the surface was closer {{to the center of the}} Earth, so gravity increased with latitude.

Preparation of coal in washing plants employs number of circuits (in parallel) for cleaning operation and each circuit is designed to optimally process a specific size range of coal particles (Cierpisz 2017). Thus, the implementation for recovery of coal {{particles from}} tailing dams has to depend on methods which used for coal washing and the size distribution of particles (Bu et al. 2017). The dissemination of fine ash-forming minerals in the coal structure has a critical challenge in recovery of coal particles from tailing dams.

There are statistically significant differences in major and minor diameters, the sphericities and the densities between moldy and healthy corn kernels. The moldy corn kernels had a smaller major diameter, greater sphericity and a lower density. Results indicated that removal of fine material from the corn lot through size screening could significantly reduce aflatoxin in the remaining lot. Further removal of small size kernels through cleaning with a screen cleaner and removal of lower density kernels with a <b>gravity</b> <b>table</b> gave an additional reduction of aflatoxin in the remaining corn lot. ^ Reductions of aflatoxin achieved by conventional heating (using a convection oven and water bath) and microwave heating to degrade the aflatoxin were also investigated. The presence of water is critical to aflatoxin degradation during heating. Aflatoxin is very stable during dry heating and a temperature of 150 ºC is required to initiate decomposition of aflatoxin. HPLC-MS studies revealed that aflatoxin B 1 was converted into its enantiomer by dry heating. During wet heating for 1 h at 80 °C, 73...|$|E
50|$|Vibrating Element Transducers: This type of {{instrument}} {{requires a}} vibrating element {{to be placed in}} contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of specific gravity are made using oscillating U-tube meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80 °C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true specific <b>gravity</b> and contain <b>tables</b> relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.|$|R
40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) solar arrays {{are placed}} into orbital {{configuration}} by a complex deployment system. Its two wings each comprise twin seven square solar panels located by a twelve foot articulated boom. The four spring-driven hinge lines per wing are rate-limited by viscous dampers. The wings are stowed against the spacecraft kinematically, and released by five pyrotechnically-actuated mechanisms. Since deployment failure would be catastrophic, {{a total of}} 17 deployment tests were completed to qualify the system for the worst cast launch environment. This successful testing culminated in the flawless deployment of the solar arrays on orbit, 15 minutes after launch in November 1997. The custom gravity negation system used to perform deployment testing is modular to allow its setup in several locations, including the launch site in Japan. Both platform and height can be varied, {{to meet the requirements}} of the test configuration and the test facility. Its air pad floatation system meets tight packaging requirements, allowing installation while stowed against the spacecraft without breaking any flight interfaces, and avoiding interference during motion. This system was designed concurrently with the deployment system, to facilitate its installation, to aid in the integration of the flight system to the spacecraft, while demonstrating deployment capabilities. Critical parameters for successful testing were alignment of deployment axes and <b>tables</b> to <b>gravity,</b> alignment of <b>table</b> seams to minimize discontinuities, and minimizing pressure drops in the air supply system. Orbital performance was similar to that predicted by ground testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} {{print is}} faded. The output {{is the best}} quality possible at this time. Chromium {{is one of the}} less common metals, but recognition of its valuable properties has led to its use in an ever-increasing variety of industries. Of particular interest are the properties of chromium in alloys which are of prime importance during war time. [ [...] . ] With Canada's entry into the present war (September, 1939) abnormal conditions are again in evidence, and chromium has become a strategic war metal. [ [...] . ] Chromite ores are concentrated by <b>gravity</b> concentration, using <b>tables,</b> jigs, and accessory equipment. The crushing and grinding operations carried out preliminary to jigging and tabling operations inevitably produce a good deal of very finely divided mineral. [ [...] . ] The tests described in this thesis were made, in an attempt to increase the efficiency of chromite concentration, by eliminating some of the loss of the finer sizes. As the title suggests it was felt that flotation might provide a solution of the problem, and as a result many flotation tests were carried out. [ [...] . ] Time limitation prevented the investigation of several leads which were uncovered, and for this reason the present thesis is not intended to be a complete and finished statement. However, it is felt that continued investigations along lines disclosed and suggested in this report may help to solve the problem outlined, whether the ultimate solution is to be credited to flotation, deflocculation, rubber mat blankets, cleaner and recleaner tables, or any combination of such processes.
