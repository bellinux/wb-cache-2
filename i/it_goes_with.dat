500|$|In September 1978, Joy Division {{made their}} {{television}} debut performing [...] "Shadowplay" [...] on So <b>It</b> <b>Goes,</b> <b>with</b> an introduction by Wilson {{in which he}} misidentified Sumner, and not Hook, as being from Salford. In October, Joy Division contributed two tracks recorded with producer Martin Hannett to the compilation double-7" [...] EP A Factory Sample, the first release by Tony Wilson's record label, Factory Records. In the NME review of the EP, Paul Morley hailed the band as [...] "the missing link between Elvis Presley and [...] the Banshees". Joy Division joined Factory's roster, after buying themselves {{out of the deal}} with RCA. Rob Gretton was made a partner of the label so as to represent the interests of the band. On 27 December, Ian Curtis had his first recognisable epileptic episode. During the ride home after a show at the Hope and Anchor pub in London, Curtis experienced an epileptic seizure and was taken to a hospital. In spite of his illness, Joy Division's career progressed. He appeared on the cover of 13 January 1979 issue of the NME following the persistence of music journalist Paul Morley. That month the band recorded their first session for BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel. According to Deborah Curtis, [...] "Sandwiched in between these two important landmarks was the realization that Ian's illness was something we would have to learn to accommodate".|$|E
2500|$|The {{investigators}} note {{parallels between}} the two stories. They soon conclude that the hyena symbolizes the cook, the zebra the sailor, the orangutan Pi's mother, and the tiger represents Pi. Pi points out that neither story can be proven and neither explains {{the cause of the}} shipwreck, so he asks the officials which story they prefer: the one without animals or the one with animals. They eventually choose the story with the animals. Pi thanks them and says: [...] "And so <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> God." [...] The investigators then leave and file a report.|$|E

60|$|Complexion! Well, {{there is}} only one {{complexion}} worth considering--a creamy white, relieved by delicate peach pink. <b>It</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> everything, and is always effective. Rich olives, striking pallors-- yes, you hear of these things doing well. The professor's experience, however, is that for all-round work you will never improve upon the plain white and pink. It is less liable to get out of order, and is the easiest at all times to renew.|$|E
50|$|Nothing is said of {{the fate}} of the ring in the Fourth Age, but it was most likely either again passed to the Kings of Gondor and Arnor, {{descendants}} of Aragorn and Arwen, or <b>it</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Arwen to her grave in Cerin Amroth.|$|R

The bishop is weak, and he wants somebody near to him to be strong. She was strong,--perhaps too strong; but he had his advantage out of it. After all I don't know that his life has been so terribly bad. I daresay he's had everything very comfortable about him. And a man ought to be grateful for that, though very few men ever are." ...|$|E

Had there been a second son, the second son would have had it. As it is, <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} property--just as it ought to do, you know. Four {{thousand}} a year isn't so bad, you know, considering that she isn't more than a girl yet, and that she hadn't sixpence of her own. When the admiral died, there wasn't sixpence, Lord Fawn." ...|$|E

There are two ways to get into a top, besides the lubber-holes. The true way to walk aft is to begin forrard; tho’f it he only in a humble way, like myself, d’ye see, which was from being only a hander of {{topgallant}} sails, and a stower of the flying-jib, to keeping the key of the captain’s locker.” ...|$|E
