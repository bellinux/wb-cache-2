5|$|In {{addition}} to British outposts on the Atlantic coast at Tangier and the Cumberland Islands, {{there was a}} similar outpost on the Gulf coast at Prospect Bluff on the Apalachicola River in Spanish East Florida which attracted Redstick Creek Indians and Black Seminoles.

5|$|McGinnity {{purchased}} the Newark Indians of the Class-A Eastern League (EL) for $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in 1909 from Frank J. Farrell. The press reported that McGinnity would operate {{the team as}} a farm team of the Giants, though he denied these reports. When McGinnity could not retain manager Harry Wolverton, he stepped in as player-manager <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians.</b> That season, he had a 29–16 record. His 422 innings pitched and 11 shutouts set EL single-season records. He also won both games of doubleheaders on August 27, 1909, and July 23, 1912.|$|E

5|$|The 1948 Cleveland Indians {{season began}} with Black {{maintaining}} {{a spot in}} the starting rotation.

After signing a new contract, Black earned his first victory of 1948 on May 23 in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, winning 51 in the second game. Early on in the season, due to the Indians' pitching depth, Black, along with Al Gettel and Bob Muncrief, lost their starting jobs and were moved to the bullpen, though there were plans to still use Black occasionally as a starter. He missed some playing time in June {{as the result of a}} bone chip in his left big toe, suffered during batting practice. He pitched <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> for most of the rest of the season, making ten starts in 18 total appearances, finishing the season with two wins and losses, a 5.37 ERA, and 52 innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Tucker and Allie Clark both {{attempted}} to make the Indians roster to begin the 1951 season, as the additions of Harry Simpson and Minnie Miñoso made it likely that {{one or both of}} them would be traded or released. Tucker played only one game <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> on April 29 when he recorded a strikeout in his lone at-bat. In early May, the Indians sent him to their Triple-A minor league affiliate, the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League; his last major league game was April 29.|$|E
5|$|American {{public opinion}} blamed the {{violence}} on British interference in American affairs through financial and munitions support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians.</b> This {{led to a}} further deterioration of relations with Britain and was a catalyst of the War of 1812, which began six months later. By the time the US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its war against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Natives soon rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region would continue until well after the War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of the Thames.|$|E

5|$|Born in Oklahoma {{and raised}} in Arkansas, Seerey played {{football}} and baseball in high school.

He was primary a starting outfielder the next five seasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians,</b> but {{led the league in}} strikeouts four times. He was traded partway through the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox, and a month after being traded became one of 18 MLB players to hit four home runs in one game. The following season, he was sent to the minor leagues, and played a few seasons in the farm system for the White Sox before retiring.|$|E
5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolomé de las Casas to plead once again <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indians</b> with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to argue for the Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
