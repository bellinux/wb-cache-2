5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, <b>it</b> <b>forces</b> and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

25|$|They {{argue that}} a predicate's {{argument}} structure is represented in the syntax, and that the syntactic representation of the predicate is a lexical projection of its arguments. Thus, {{the structure of a}} predicate is strictly a lexical representation, where each phrasal head projects its argument onto a phrasal level within the syntax tree. The selection of this phrasal head is based on Chomsky's Empty Category Principle. This lexical projection of the predicate's argument onto the syntactic structure is the foundation for the Argument Structure Hypothesis. This idea coincides with Chomsky's Projection Principle, because <b>it</b> <b>forces</b> a VP to be selected locally and be selected by a Tense Phrase (TP).|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco {{participated in}} a panel {{discussion}} with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in Architecture Boston.

Sacco observes, [...] "Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, {{to have their own}} opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly... frees us." [...] Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and <b>it</b> <b>forces</b> people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced.

500|$|In {{the second}} letter, the Drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting {{the king and}} merely hinting at his {{relationship}} with Wood's patent; while the Drapier accuses Wood, he constantly refers to the king's authority and power to issue legal tender (this is called [...] "the King's Prerogative"). In particular, the Drapier claims that the king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency. As the Drapier points out, the constitution establishing Ireland as a kingdom limits {{the authority of the}} monarch because <b>it</b> <b>forces</b> the people of Ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency. Throughout this argument, the Drapier compares the king's ability to print money with the petty amount of political power held by Wood, which undermines the image of the king as the supreme authority in Ireland while hinting that the king is not protecting the rights of the Irish people. The Drapier stops himself before he commits treason, and he instead argues that the king would never accept a patent that could harm Ireland; to the Drapier, the king would never act {{in such a way as}} to help Wood harm the people of Ireland.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, <b>it</b> <b>forces</b> Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so much left unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
