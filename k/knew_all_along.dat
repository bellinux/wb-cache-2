Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David was not trying to murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{government}} announcement appeared on television, Kujau took {{his wife and}} mistress to Austria; he introduced the latter to Edith as his cleaner. After he saw a news report a few days later, naming him as the forger, and hearing that Stern had paid ninemillion DMs, he first phoned his lawyer and then the Hamburg State prosecutor; the forger agreed to hand himself in at the border between Austria and West Germany the following day. When police raided his house, they found several notebooks identical to those used in the fraud. Kujau continued to use {{a variation of the}} story he had told Heidemann—that of obtaining the diaries from the East—but he was bitter that the journalist was still at liberty, and had withheld so much of Sterns money from him. After thirteen days, on 26 May, he wrote a full confession, stating that Heidemann <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> that the diaries were forgeries. Heidemann was arrested that evening.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed {{their enemy}} {{to have the}} {{battlefield}} of his choosing. Even then they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until {{the last day of}} the battle, he conducted an essentially defensive campaign suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a numerically inferior force and needed all the men he could muster, he nevertheless had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat he anticipated for the enemy army.|$|E

25|$|In July 2011, Texas EquuSearch (TES), a {{non-profit}} group which {{assisted in the}} search for Caylee from July to December 2008 when she was believed to be missing, sued Anthony for fraud and unjust enrichment. TES estimates that it spent more than $100,000 searching for Caylee even though she was already dead. TES founder and director Tim Miller estimates that the abortive search for Caylee expended 40% of the group's yearly resources which could have been spent looking for other missing children. It only learned that Anthony <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> that Caylee was dead when the trial began. TES and Anthony eventually settled out of court on October 18, 2013. TES was listed as a creditor to Anthony and was entitled to $75,000.|$|E
25|$|It {{is later}} {{revealed}} that Diana survived and Victoria {{is with her}} at her mansion where 47 watches them from his scope thus revealing that only he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> he hit Diana with a shot {{that would not be}} fatal. The game ends with a message from Diana to 47 welcoming him back to the ICA and thanking him for his help. This also reveals that the story from the end of Blood Money to Absolution was all one daring hit contract on individuals within the Agency by Diana and executed by 47 to protect Victoria and terminate the assassin cloning project. In the epilogue, Detective Cosmo Faulkner of the Chicago Police Department, who has been tracking 47 since the Terminus Hotel fire, is having trouble discovering 47's identity until Birdie offers to help him for a price.|$|E

500|$|Mellon {{was aware}} of which artists had {{submitted}} which designs, and {{has been accused of}} discriminating against Fraser as a woman. [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen stated, [...] "it has been learned that Mellon <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> who had submitted the winning models, and his male chauvinism partly or wholly motivated his unwillingness to let a woman win." [...] Bowers, however, noted that Mellon had approved Fraser's designs for commemorative coins several times, as well as those by other women, and that no contemporary source speaks to any bias on Mellon's part. [...] Bowers called the belief [...] "modern numismatic fiction". [...] Fraser's design was used in 1999 as a commemorative half eagle issued 200 years after Washington's death.|$|E
500|$|Burt first {{appears in}} [...] "Preggers", the show's fourth episode. He catches his son Kurt dancing to Beyoncé's [...] "Single Ladies", and Kurt {{claims that it}} is a {{football}} exercise, and that he is now a kicker on the William McKinley High football team. Fortunately for Kurt, fellow glee club member and football quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) helps him get a tryout for the team, and he becomes its kicker in truth. Burt attends Kurt's first game, and after a final-second touchdown ties the game, Kurt kicks the extra point to win it. Buoyed by his success, Kurt comes out to his father. Burt tells him he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> Kurt was gay and loves him just as much.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{discovery}} process, the court granted Voom's motion for sanctions. The New York State Supreme Court found that EchoStar's Dish Network [...] "systematically destroyed evidence" [...] {{in the case}} and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by EchoStar demonstrated that EchoStar <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> that there was no breach...and would prove Voom’s case.” The Judge also stated that he would tell jurors that Dish Network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to Voom’s case.|$|E

2500|$|An {{analogous}} {{differentiation of}} the Fourier series of P dX {{demonstrates that the}} off-diagonal elements of the Poisson bracket are all zero. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate variables, such as X and P, [...] is the constant value 1, so this integral really is the average value of 1; so it is 1, as we <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> because it is dJ/dJ after all. But Heisenberg, Born and Jordan, unlike Dirac, were {{not familiar with the}} theory of Poisson brackets, so, for them, the differentiation effectively evaluated {X, P} in J, θ coordinates.|$|E
2500|$|A talking raven named Hugi (of {{the usual}} color) arrives, {{and tries to}} {{distract}} Corwin with fatalistic philosophy.

[...] A mythological jackal offers to lead Corwin on a short-cut to the Courts, but instead leads him to its lair, where Corwin kills it in self-defense. [...] He finally finds a shadow with the Courts' sky, but is aghast to discover that the Courts still lie across a huge wasteland. [...] The raven Hugi returns and pointedly tells him it <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along,</b> so he kills it for his dinner.|$|E
2500|$|Williams, {{who left}} {{after the season}} to become {{defensive}} coordinator of the St. Louis Rams, was summoned to NFL headquarters after the investigation concluded in mid-February. He initially denied any involvement, but recanted and admitted everything {{in a meeting with}} Goodell. After the story broke, Williams issued a statement calling his involvement [...] "a terrible mistake." [...] Williams said that he <b>knew</b> <b>all</b> <b>along</b> the slush fund broke the rules, and that [...] "I should have stopped it" [...] rather than get further involved. Goodell {{said in a statement that}} he found it [...] "particularly disturbing" [...] that the Saints were deliberately trying to injure other players. He said that players and coaches involved in the scheme could face fines or suspensions, and the Saints could be docked picks in the 2012 NFL Draft and future drafts.|$|E
