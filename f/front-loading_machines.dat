50|$|S-format tapes {{could be}} played back in older top-loading {{standard}} U-Matic decks {{with the aid}} of an adapter (the KCA-1 from Sony) which fitted around an S-sized tape; newer <b>front-loading</b> <b>machines</b> can accept S-format tapes directly, as the tapes have a slot on the underside that rides along a tab. U-Matic S tapes had a maximum recording time of 20 minutes, and large ones 1-hour, although some tape manufacturers such as 3M came out with 30-minute S-tapes and 75-minute large cassettes by using a thinner tape. It was the U-Matic S-format decks that ushered in the beginning of ENG, or Electronic News Gathering.|$|E
50|$|The Downy Ball is {{a variant}} sold by Procter & Gamble {{specifically}} designed for use with traditional agitator-based top-loading washing machines which lack built-in fabric softener dispensers, and it won't work correctly on <b>front-loading</b> <b>machines.</b> Liquid fabric softener is poured into the Downy Ball through a hole on the top side. The ball is then tossed into the washing machine with the clothes and detergent, where it floats in a vertical position, with an internal rubber weight floating inside and trapping the softener inside. In the spin cycle, between the wash and rinse cycles, the internal rubber weight moves aside due to Newton's first law of motion, allowing the fabric softener to spill out onto the clothes, {{just in time for}} the rinse cycle.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Staber Industries {{released}} the System 2000 washing machine, {{which is the}} only top-loading, horizontal-axis washer to be manufactured in the United States. The hexagonal tub spins like a <b>front-loading</b> <b>machine,</b> using only about one third as much water as conventional top-loaders. This factor has led to an Energy Star rating for its high efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{agitator}} and the drum are {{separate and distinct}} in a top-loading washing machine, the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a <b>front-loading</b> <b>machine.</b> Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of {{the agitator}} during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.|$|R

5000|$|Water leakage: Top-loading {{machines}} are {{less prone to}} leakage, because simple gravity can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top. True <b>front-loading</b> <b>machines</b> require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out. This seal may leak and require replacement. However, many current front-loaders use so little water {{that they can be}} stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level. Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a floor drain or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a solenoid valve getting stuck in the open position.|$|E

The dosing device used for the compact powder laundry detergent is not included. In the use phase of both trigger sprays, the use of a cloth, paper, or other implement to wipe the surfaces was excluded, as the focus of the LCA is on the product itself.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{vibration}} of washing machines is a challenging issue to be considered. The vibration of the washing machine is mainly due to the unbalanced mass of clothes distributed in the washing drum. This occurs most frequently in the spin-drying stage, because the drum spins at a relatively high speed causing the clothes to be pressed against the inner wall of the spin drum, and these can become a large unbalanced mass {{until the end of the}} stage. Particularly, in a <b>front-loaded</b> washing <b>machine</b> (drum-type washing machine), the unbalanced mass of clothes easily occurs and very severe due to the effect of gravity. The vibration of the washing machine is transferred to the floor causing noises, unpleasant feeling for humans, and failure of the machine.|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{two main}} types of washing {{machines}} {{exist in the}} market. Depending on how cloths are placed in and out the washer, they are classified into front load washers and top-load washers. Both of them present the same inconvenient and uncomfortable practice when collecting the laundry: clothes that remain at {{the surface of the}} spinning basket are difficult to reach, therefore imposing great strain into the users back and neck area, {{especially in the case of}} front-load washers. The aim of this work is to present the design of a detachable opening system for <b>front-load</b> washing <b>machines.</b> This design is unique since it allows the inner drum to be horizontally drawn from the whole machine in order to remove the cloths after the washing process. This system introduces a higher efficient and comfortable procedure than current systems use.

5000|$|The {{company was}} {{established}} in 1950 by Karl-Erik Andersson, whose first invention was a washing machine. The company started producing a fully automatic <b>front-loading</b> washing <b>machine</b> and a compact dishwasher in 1965, and started exporting their products in 1967. The original name was Junga Verkstäder, but after having been acquired by Asea in 1978, the name was changed to Asea Cylinda, later becoming ABB Cylinda after the merger of Asea with the Swiss Brown Boveri Corporation to form ABB.In 1984, they introduced the washing machines as we know of today: no springs, four shock absorbers and a door that directly connects to the outer drum, the latter being a unique design for domestic front loaders. The top loaders (only sold in Europe) also have four shock absorbers and no springs.The company was acquired by Finnish furniture manufacturer Asko (founded by Aukusti Heikki Asko-Avonius) in 1988. The name was also changed to Asko ASEA. Somewhere around 1992, ASEA was dropped from the name and it became Asko.Asko Appliances was acquired by the Italian Antonio Merloni Group in 2000.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{focuses on}} the {{theoretical}} analysis, design, fabrication and characterization of a small Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid damper. It can be potentially applied to a horizontal axis, <b>front-loading</b> washing <b>machine.</b> In such washing machines, although washing cycle is slow, spin cycle is much faster. During acceleration from washing cycle to spin cycle, the tub passes through its resonant speed requiring relatively high damping. On the other hand, high damping results in increased force transmission to the housing and noise at high-speed spin cycle. Controllability of the MR fluid damper allows adjustment of damping requirements for different cycles and helps to reduce the noise at high speed spin cycle while limiting the tub motion at resonance. A patented geometry of an MR valve developed by Composite and Intelligent Materials Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno is {{used as the basis}} of this new design to satisfy the requirements of the application. Fabricated prototype damper is characterized using harmonic displacement input. Test results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions and design values.

40|$|Because {{customers}} are requiring <b>front-loaded</b> washing <b>machine</b> to handle big capacity laundry and have faster rotation speed to increase drying ability, there are being {{a lot of}} studies for achievement of high speed dehydration, high-strength and lightweight of washing machine in the latest washing machine business. It is essential that strength of Drum Assembly which is composed of spin drum, shaft, flange is improved to attain that target. In term of spin drum, {{it is difficult to}} realize joint strength required at high speed operation because joint strength of mechanical press-joining method is low remarkably in comparison with welding. Also in case of shaft system, stress from bending and twisting are complexly loaded onto the shaft supporting the horizontal drum, causing problems in fracture strength and fatigue life. The results of this study show optimal joining condition for mechanical press-joining by performing lots of tensile joining strength test with various specimen under multi-change of important design factor such as seaming width, bead area and bead depth etc. and the optimal design of shafting system for big capacity, high-rotation drying through strength analysis, experiment and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>front-loading</b> washing <b>machine</b> is an {{integral}} part of household life for many, with little notice given to the extensive interplay of physical, chemical and thermal phenomena taking place as the clothes inside tumble. With over 250 billion washes carried out annually in Europe a lone, it has a staggering environmental impact due to its energy and water usage and also due to the chemicals that are drained to the sewage system at the end of a wash. There are two practical routes for reducing this impact; improving the design of the machine so that it requires less energy or water, or improving detergent formulations so that the required level of cleaning is achieved at lower temperatures and with a reduced input of product. The work presented in this study was initially carried out with the aim of designing better detergent formulations. A long the way, the results also enabled new tools for better washing machine design to be developed. For both routes, the basic requirement was to develop an understanding of the mechanisms which result in mechanical cleaning of textiles, which is the focus of results presented in this study. ...|$|R

50|$|The common <b>front-loading</b> {{commercial}} washing <b>machine</b> also {{differs from}} consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models pump used washer water out, allowing the waste line {{to be located}} above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only gravity to expel used water. A drain in the rear, {{at the bottom of}} the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and drain. The trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height, and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.|$|R
50|$|Some {{machines}} {{which actually}} load {{from the top}} are otherwise much more similar to <b>front-loading</b> horizontal-axis drum <b>machines.</b> They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, {{but there is no}} front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life.|$|R
30|$|In this research, optimal {{design of}} a flow-mode MR damper to {{suppress}} the vibration of <b>front-loaded</b> washing <b>machines</b> was undertaken. After a brief introduction, the general governing equation of the washing tub assembly is derived. The position of the two springs and the two dampers to suppress the machine vibration was then optimally determined based on the governing equation. A configuration of the MR damper for the washing machine was then proposed, and the damping force was obtained based on the Bingham rheological model of the MR brake. The optimization problem for the damper was constructed such that the viscous coefficient of the damper is minimized and the yield stress force of the damper is greater than a required value that attenuates almost the resonant peak of the tub mechanism. The optimal design of the MR damper for a prototype washing machine was obtained based on the ANSYS finite element analysis of the MR damper magnetic circuit and first-order optimization method. The results show that performances of the MR damper are significantly improved with the proposed optimal design. A prototype of the optimized MR damper was manufactured, and experimental results {{on the performance of}} the prototype damper were obtained and presented. It was shown that the experimental results well agreed with the modeling one obtained from finite element analysis. As the second phase of this study, dynamics of the whole prototype washing machine equipped with the MR damper will be obtained and experimental results on the prototype washer will be conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the optimized MR damper.|$|R
40|$|In the {{household}} appliance industry piecework coating of body components has been successively substituted by usage of coil-coated sheets. For components with low strains or components not visible {{for the customer}} and therefore with no requirements concerning the visual impression these organic-coated materials bear a proper possibility for cost savings. But besides that, for high quality household appliances there are high visual requirements on the front panels. Already the gloss reduction of the coating layer due to higher strains restricts the application for front panels in most cases. From an economic point of view the application of coil-coated sheets even for these components is highly demanded. For an acceptable substitution the resulting paintwork properties after the forming process {{should be able to}} forecast within numerical simulations. Therefore the forming-induced gloss reduction of the respective coated material has to be determined in a proper manner. This paper deals with analyses concerning the forming-induced and strain-state-depending gloss reduction of a coil-coated material commercially used for white goods components. The investigations include measurements of strains and gloss by using an in situ approach. For that purpose, material specimens are formed using a modified experimental setup referring to the Marciniak-Test (ISO 12004 - 2). A fundamental advantage of the in situ measurements is a minor demand of experiments together with a high resolution of the measured variables. In conclusion, based on the experimental results a conceivable forming limit criterion is defined and integrated in an exemplarily simulation model. The front panel of a <b>front-loading</b> washing <b>machine</b> is used as a practice-oriented application example. Using of the pursued approach improper gloss reductions on the formed panel can be predicted within forming simulation...|$|R
