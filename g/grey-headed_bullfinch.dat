40|$|An Eimeria {{species is}} {{described}} from a domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica). Sporulated oocysts (n = 35) were subspherical, {{with a smooth}} bi-layered oocyst wall (1. 0 μm thick). Oocysts measured 20. 2 × 16. 1 (22. 0 – 18. 9 × 15. 7 – 18. 9) μm, oocyst length/width (L/W) ratio, 1. 38. Oocyst residuum and a polar granule were present. The micropyle was absent. Sporocysts are elongate-ovoid, 13. 0 × 6. 1 (14. 5 – 12. 5 × 5. 5 – 7. 0) μm, sporocyst L/W ratio, 2. 13 (2. 0 – 2. 2), sporocyst residuum was present, composed of numerous granules in a spherical or ovoid mass. Each sporocyst contained 2 banana-shaped sporozoites, 12. 3 × 3. 5 (11. 8 – 13. 0 × 3. 3 – 3. 6) μm. A spherical-ellipsoid posterior refractile {{body was found in}} the sporozoites. A nucleus was located immediately anterior to the posterior refractile body. Molecular analysis was conducted at three loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA genes and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI). At the 18 S locus, the new isolate shared 98. 0 % genetic similarity with three Isospora isolates from Japan from the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica). At the 28 S locus, it grouped separately and shared 92. 4 % and 92. 5 % genetic similarity with Isospora anthochaerae (KF 766053) from a red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) from Australia and an Isospora sp. (MS- 2003 – AY 283845) from a Himalayan <b>grey-headed</b> <b>bullfinch</b> (Pyrrhula erythaca) respectively. At COI locus, this new isolate was in a separate clade and shared 95. 6 % and 90. 0 % similarity respectively with Eimeria tiliquae n. sp. from a shingleback skink in Australia and an Eimeria sp. from a common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) from America. Based on the morphological data, this isolate is most similar to Eimeria labbeana. As no molecular data for E. labbeana is available and previous morphological data is incomplete, we refer to the current isolate as E. labbeana-like...|$|E
