5|$|As the Interstate was completed, the {{highways}} that it replaced {{were removed from}} the state highway system. In 1973, the SR84 designation was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.|$|E
5|$|Service roads allowed {{engineers}} to separate local access <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. As such, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then Highway25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then Highway122), Erin Mills Parkway, Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then Highway10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and Highway27.|$|E
5|$|A metal-surfaced {{road from}} US 20 in Rushville to {{north of the}} Niobrara River was {{constructed}} between 1940 and 1948. It was extended south to north of Cravath Lake by 1953. The road was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system map in 1957, and was re-added in 1960, as N-250. A narrow road was extended from N-250 to N-2 around 1981–82, {{but it was not}} part of N-250 until 1996. The routing has not changed significantly since.|$|E

5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, disconnected, segment {{was added to}} the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were added to M-72. M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the last segment was completed, the number was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> and the freeway was added to I-75.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state highway system as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{changes were}} {{occurring}} {{in the eastern part}} of Jefferson County. The portion of highway from Ryan east to the Love County line was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system on December 31, 1937. As a result, SH-32 was discontiguous; one section stretched from Davidson to Ryan, while another began at a spur ending at the Jefferson–Love county line and continued east from there. The portion of SH-32 concurrent with US-81 between Waurika and Ryan, once necessary to connect to the now-decommissioned road, was removed on February 24, 1938. Both of these sections of road were reinstated as part of SH-32 on February 29, 1944.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There {{it turned}} east running {{concurrently}} with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. The spur south of Merrit remained a state highway {{through at least}} late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was turned back to local control and removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has not been used since.|$|E
5|$|SR163 {{was first}} {{designated}} during the 1964 highway renumbering as a road extending from U.S. Route410 in Sumner to SR18 in Auburn. The corridor was previously {{a part of}} the Pacific Highway from 1913 to 1923, and later became a branch of State Road5 in 1925. State Road5 became PSH5 during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937, and the branch stayed designated. SR163 was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system in the late 1960s, and became part of SR167.|$|E
5|$|The Rübel family {{restored}} commercial citrus {{production and}} set about repairing the earthquake damage. They successfully lobbied to have Camulos listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. In 2000, it was further designated a National Historic Landmark. Although the main house was restored in 1996, funding was not available to restore the smaller buildings until 2006, with construction completed in spring 2007. The rancho is on State Route 126, but little is visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> {{commissioning}} to 1976, {{there was}} only one fork of SH-3 between Shawnee and Ada, which was the path of current SH-3E. SH-3W and SH-3E were created on 4 October 1976; the new SH-3W took over all of SH-13. Other than minor realignments, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> remains essentially <b>the</b> same today.|$|R

5|$|The routing of NY99 was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike, a 19th-century toll road {{that began in the}} town of Hopkinton and passed through central Franklin County {{on its way to the}} hamlet of Port Kent on the shores of Lake Champlain. The portion of the turnpike between Duane Center and Merrillsville was designated as NY99 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It remained unchanged until September26, 1994, when the NY99 designation was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E
5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} through the small community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river turns away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> and SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|US23 was {{commissioned}} on November 11, 1926, with {{the debut of}} the United States Numbered Highway System. The MSHD removed the M-10 and M-65 designations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> at the time. As it was originally designated, US23 crossed into Michigan from Ohio south of Temperance and ran north to Ypsilanti via Ida and Maybee. Once the highway entered Ann Arbor, it followed the roads that preceded the modern freeway up to Flint. From Flint to Saginaw, US23 ran concurrently with US10. On the way north to Bay City, the highway ran {{on the west side}} of the Saginaw River before turning north to the Standish area. From Standish to Mackinaw City, US23 initially took a more inland route through the northeastern LP.|$|E
50|$|<b>From</b> Roxburgh, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> turns southeastward, passing Ettrick, Raes Junction and Beaumont, {{where it}} turns away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Clutha, before {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{close to the}} original strike in the Central Otago Gold Rush. <b>From</b> here, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> continues past Waitahuna and the twisting Manuka Gorge, reaching the plain of the Tokomairaro River at Clarksville, three kilometres south of Milton.|$|R
50|$|<b>From</b> Ibarra, <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{continues}} {{south for}} 115 km until reaching Quito.|$|R

5|$|Upon its {{inception}} in 1921, a very different M-86 was routed along a portion of present-day M-66 from M-46 at Six Lakes northward to Remus, ending at M-24 (modern M-20). A few years later in 1924–25, M-66 was extended north to Remus, supplanting the contemporary M-86. At the same time, the M-86 designation was relocated to Ionia County to run from M-44 in Orleans to M-43 (present day M-66) just east of there. In late 1929, M-44 was extended east from Orleans to junction with M-43, once again, causing M-86 to be supplanted and removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system.|$|E
5|$|When the {{original}} state trunklines were designated, an M-11 ran {{the length of}} the Lake Michigan shoreline from the Indiana state line to Mackinaw City. That highway was replaced in 1926 by two of the then-newly created US Highways. A second highway was given the M-11 designation at that time in the Saline area. This highway was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system and the designation decommissioned in 1954. The current M-11 was designated in 1961 along a set of roads in the Grand Rapids area that includes portions of a former route of US Highway 16 (US16) in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30 PM, all {{westbound}} Interstate 78 {{traffic is}} {{stopped at the}} Hamburg exit due to numerous disabled vehicles. At 10:40 PM, Governor Ed Rendell declared a disaster emergency. On the 15th at 3:54 AM, state troopers and emergency personnel began walking miles of Interstate 78, waking up truckers who have gone to sleep as traffic begins to move. At 5 PM on the 15th, the state orders Interstate 78 shut down in both directions from Interstate 81 in Lebanon County to Route 100 in Lehigh County. At 6 PM on the 15th, plowing begins and continued through the night. Additional snow removing equipment was brought in from {{the western part of}} the state to help with the clearing of the highway. Highway officials along with the National Guard and State Police worked to clear the stuck trucks and cars <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> therefore plowing and ice removal can get fully underway. On the 16th, the interstate remained closed throughout the day as crews continued to plow and remove ice. On the 17th at 4 PM, the interstate reopened.|$|E

25|$|On <b>the</b> U.S. Interstate <b>Highway</b> System, in {{most states}} exits are {{numbered}} based on <b>the</b> nearest milepost <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> western or southern terminus within that state. Several that are {{less than half a}} mile (800 m) from state boundaries in that direction are numbered as Exit 0.|$|R
5|$|By June 15, 1942 the {{highways}} in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A Bypass US16 (BYP US16) designation {{was assigned to}} the portion of M-114 that traveled around the southwest side of Grand Rapids (now M-11), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along {{the east side of the}} city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time. By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> system. The eastern leg was assigned a BYP US131 designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A BYP M-21 designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs. East Beltline now carries M-37 and M-44.|$|E
5|$|East of South Ann Street, both {{directions}} of NY167 overlap with NY5, following the four-lane road {{along the southern}} edge of downtown to a junction with East Main Street on the city's east side. NY167 reconnects with NY169 here, which leaves East Main Street to briefly follow NY5 and NY167 along the riverside arterial. The resulting overlap between NY167 and NY169 is a wrong-way concurrency, with NY169 southbound overlapping NY167 northbound and vice versa. NY169 splits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> after just one block to proceed south across the Mohawk River while NY5 and NY167 remain concurrent to {{the eastern edge of the}} city. Here, NY167 forks from NY5, running east as a two-lane street through the undeveloped eastern fringe of Little Falls. The highway rises in elevation as it heads out of the Mohawk River valley and passes into the adjacent town of Manheim.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the California Transportation Commission (CTC) {{approved}} shifting SR 111 {{onto the}} new SR 86 expressway {{after it was}} completed, using SR 195 to make the connection. When the SR 86 expressway was fully constructed, SR 195 was {{to be removed from}} the state highway system according to state law; that expressway was finished in 2001. However, this removed the connection <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> portion of SR 111 to the new expressway carrying both SR 111 and SR 86 north from the state highway system. Caltrans officially deleted most of SR 195 in 2009, leaving a gap in SR 111 following deletions of the old routing that was now bypassed by the expressway. In December 2014, with Riverside County and Caltrans both supporting, the CTC transferred the remaining portion of SR 195, from the new SR 86 expressway to SR 111, to become part of SR 111. SR 195 still appears in Caltrans documents dated from 2014.|$|E
