A 8, 800 mm long duct with 230 mm x 230 mm square cross section is constructed, and an injection nozzle with 20 mm x 230 mm outlet with the angle of 30 ﾟ is installed at 2, 100 mm from the inlet. In addition to full span injection, the nozzle with 80 % span is installed to observe the effect of three dimensionality. Measured pressure gains under various flow ratios showed good agreement with the theory based {{on the law of}} momentum. The velocity distribution with full span injection showed the existence of two dimensional separation bubble, while partial injection cases revealed a stronger <b>down</b> <b>wash.</b> Numerical simulation was carried out and it was confirmed that a good qualitative agreement existed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree-dimensional {{unsteady}} Navier-Stokes equations are numerically solved {{to simulate}} the aerodynamic interaction of rotor, canard and horizontal tail in hover based on moving chimera grid. The variations of unsteady aerodynamic forces and moments of the canard and horizontal tail {{with respect to the}} rotor azimuth are analyzed with the deflection angle set at 0 ° and 50 °, respectively. The pressure map of aerodynamic surfaces and velocity vector distribution of flow field are investigated to get better understanding of the unsteady aerodynamic interaction. The result shows that the canard and horizontal tail present different characteristics under the downwash of the rotor. The canard produces much vertical force loss with low amplitude fluctuation. Contrarily, the horizontal tail, which is within the flow field induced by the <b>down</b> <b>wash</b> of the rotor, produces only less vertical force loss, but the amplitudes of the lift and pitching moment are larger, implying that a potential deflection angle scheme in hover is 50 ° for the canard and 0 ° for the horizontal tail...|$|E

40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of the "Preliminary report on free flight testing" (report no. NACA-TR- 70), presents a detailed theoretical analysis of statical stability with free and locked controls and also the results of many free flight test on several types of airplanes. In developing the theory of stability with locked controls an expression for pitching moment is derived in simple terms by considering the total moment as the sum of the moments due to wings and tail surface. This expression, when differentiated with respect to angle of incidence, enables an analysis to be made of the factors contributing to the pitching moment. The effects of slipstream and <b>down</b> <b>wash</b> are also considered and it is concluded that the C. G. Location has but slight effect or stability, and that stability is much improved by increasing the efficiency of the tail surfaces, which may be done by using an "inverted" tail plane. The results of free flight tests with locked controls are discussed at length and it is shown that the agreement between the experimental results and theory is very satisfactory. The theory of stability with free controls is not amendable to the simple mathematical treatment used in the case of locked controls, but a clear statement of the conditions enables several conclusions to be drawn, one of which is that the fixed tail surfaces should be much larger than the movable surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Scalar (heat or mass) {{transfer}} {{plays an}} important role in many industrial and engineering applications. Difficulties in experimental measurements means that there is limited detailed information available, especially in the near-wall region. Prediction in simple flows is well documented and the basis for development of many Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. This is, however, not the case for scalar transfer, especially when the Prandtl (Pr) or Schmidt number (Sc) is much greater than unity. In complex flows that involve separation and reattachment, the scalar transfer coefficient is significantly different to that of fully developed turbulent flow. The purpose of this Thesis is to investigate high Prandtl number (Pr ≥ 10) scalar transfer in fully developed (pipe) and disturbed (sudden pipe expansion) turbulent flow using CFD. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is the most straight-forward approach to the solution of turbulent flows with scalar transfer. However, this technique is computationally intensive because all turbulent scales need to be resolved by the simulation. Large eddy simulation (LES) is a compromise compared to DNS. Instead of resolving all spatial scales, LES resolves only the large-scales with the small-scales being accounted for by a subgrid-scale model. Chapter 2 details the mathematical, numerical and computational details of LES with scalar transfer. From this, an optimized and highly scalable parallel LES solver was developed based on state-of-the-art LES subgrid-scale models and numerical techniques. Chapter 3 provides a verification of the LES solver for fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Reynolds numbers between Re = 180 and 1050 were simulated with a single Prandtl number of Pr = 0. 71. Detailed turbulent statistics are provided for Re = 180, 395 and 590 with varying grid resolution for each Reynolds number. The results from these simulations were compared to established experimental and numerical databases of fully developed turbulent pipe and channel flows. The LES solver was shown to be in good agreement with the prior work with most discrepancies being accounted for by only reporting the resolved (large-scale) component directly reported from the LES results. For a Prandtl number close to unity, the mechanisms of turbulent transport and scalar transfer are similar. The near-wall region was shown to be dominated by large-scale sweeping structures that bring high momentum and scalar concentrations to the near-wall region. These are convected parallel to the wall as diffusion mechanisms act to transfer this to the wall where dissipation takes effect. An ejection structure then acts to transport the resultant low momentum, scalar depleted fluid back to the bulk to be replenished and continue the cycle. As the Prandtl number increases, molecular diffusivity decreases relative to viscosity, and the mechanisms of scalar transfer differ to those at Pr = 0. 71. This is investigated in Chapter 4 using simulations at Re = 180, 395 and 590, with detailed statistics at Re = 395 for Pr = 0. 71, 5, 10, 100 and 200. Where possible the results are compared to other numerical work and the LES solver was shown to accurately resolve the higher Prandtl number flows. There are marked variations in the scalar transfer with increasing Prandtl number as the turbulent scalar transfer becomes concentrated closer to the wall and dominated by large-scale turbulent structures. Sweeping structures are still responsible for bringing the high scalar concentrations towards the wall, however, high Prandtl number scalars are unable to completely diffuse to the wall in the time that the structure is convected parallel to the wall adjacent to the diffusive sublayer. Therefore, most of the high Prandtl number scalar is returned to the bulk via the ejection structure rather than being dissipated at the wall. Chapter 5 uses the sudden pipe expansion (SPE) to investigate disturbed turbulent flow for an inlet Reynolds numbers of Reb = 15600 and a diameter ratio of E = 1. 6. These simulation parameters were chosen to match the experimental LDA measurements of Stieglmeier et al. (1989). The LES results for a range of grid resolutions were shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental work. From the LES results it was determined that the fluctuations in the wall shear stress are important in the near-wall turbulent transport. These are the result of eddies originating from the free shear layer down-washing and impinging upon the wall. This is a more effective sweeping mechanism than that observed for the fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Despite the down-wash structures impinging upon the wall, a viscous sublayer still exists in the reattachment region, albeit much thinner than the fully developed turbulent pipe flow further downstream. Using the same Reynolds number and diameter ratio, scalar transfer simulations were also undertaken in the SPE with Prandtl numbers of Pr = 0. 71, 5, 10, 100 and 200. An applied scalar flux was used to heat the expanded pipe wall. The LES results are in agreement with experimental Nusselt numbers from Baughn et al. (1984) for Pr = 0. 71. The disturbed turbulent flow enhances the scalar transfer and this is the result of <b>down</b> <b>wash</b> events transporting low (cold) scalar from the inlet pipe to the near-wall of the expanded pipe. This cools the heated wall and enhances localized scalar transfer downstream of the expansion. A diffusive sublayer still exists in the reattachment region within the viscous sublayer for Prandtl numbers greater than unity. As the Prandtl number increases the diffusivity decreases relative to viscosity and near-wall scalar transfer enhancement decreases as the diffusion time-scales increase...|$|E
