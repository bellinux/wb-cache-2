5|$|Wood is pulped {{for paper}} {{and used in}} the {{manufacture}} of cardboard and made into engineered wood products for use in construction such as <b>fibreboard,</b> hardboard, chipboard and plywood. The wood of conifers is known as softwood while that of broad-leaved trees is hardwood.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density <b>fibreboard</b> (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally weatherproof, Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E
25|$|The second {{byproduct}} (acidogenic digestate) is a stable, {{organic material}} consisting largely of lignin and cellulose, {{but also of}} a variety of mineral components in a matrix of dead bacterial cells; some plastic may be present. The material resembles domestic compost and can be used as such or to make low-grade building products, such as <b>fibreboard.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Fibreboards</b> {{were made}} from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]) using the thermo-mechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical pulping (CTMP). The boards were made without binders (insulation boards) and with {{aminoplastic}} resins as a binder (medium density <b>fibreboards</b> (MDF)). The results of a joint research work, {{carried out by the}} University of Göttingen and the Fraunhofer-Institute for Wood Research (WKI), Braunschweig, revealed that the pulping techniques (TMP and CTMP) have a significant influence on the chemical composition and the emission level of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from fibres and binderless <b>fibreboards.</b> Binderless <b>fibreboards</b> made from TMP release more aliphatic aldehyds and ketones compared to those made from CTMP. However, the emission of acetic acid was, in general, much higher from CTMP and binderless <b>fibreboards</b> made therefrom. Moreover, the results indicate that volatile organic compounds generated during the pulping process (TMP and CTMP) could interact with the binders used for making medium density <b>fibreboards</b> (MDF) affecting both the level of VOC emission and the chemical composition of the released volatile organic compounds (VOC) ...|$|R
40|$|Wood <b>fibreboards</b> {{can serve}} as {{alternative}} sustainable insulation material for external thermal insulation component systems (ETICS). In Germany, the application of ETICS with wood <b>fibreboards</b> is restricted to low buildings. The restrictions are mainly caused by the smouldering tendency of the wood <b>fibreboards.</b> Thus, {{the development of an}} ETICS with wood <b>fibreboards</b> for multi-storey buildings complying with the requirements would provide a new scope of application for this sustainable insulation material. This paper presents first results of standardised and innovative investigation methods as basis for the development. These investigations and analyses concern the fire behaviour, especially smouldering processes, the plaster system, other constructive protection measures as well as risk and safety analyses...|$|R
40|$|Highly environmentally-friendly <b>fibreboards</b> were {{manufactured}} by hot-press moulding using Posidonia ocaeanica wastes and a partially biobased epoxy resin as binder. <b>Fibreboards</b> with a constant fibre content of 70 wt % were successfully {{manufactured by}} thermo-compression. The {{effects of a}} conventional alkali treatment were compared to the synergistic effects that additional silanization with two silanes (amino and glycidyl) can exert on the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of <b>fibreboards.</b> The results revealed a remarkable improvement of the mechanical properties with {{the combination of the}} alkali treatment followed by the silanization. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed increased resin-fibre interactions due to the synergistic effect of both amino- and glycidyl-silanes. These <b>fibreboards</b> represent a formaldehyde-free solution and can positively contribute to sustainable development as the lignocellulosic component is a waste and the binder resin is partially biobased...|$|R
25|$|Biscuits are {{predominantly}} used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density <b>fibreboard.</b> They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing {{mortise and tenon}} joints as they are easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E

500|$|Subwoofers {{have been}} {{designed}} using a number of enclosure approaches: bass reflex, acoustic suspension, infinite baffle, horn loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass. Each enclosure type {{has advantages and disadvantages}} in efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost. Subwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density <b>fibreboard</b> (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials. [...] Because of the high air pressure they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.|$|E

500|$|The [...] was {{supplied}} with a [...] tonearm as against a [...] on the , {{and is available}} only in black finish. Earlier models had a glass platter, wood surround-frame plinth and S-shaped arm; Rega changed to using a <b>fibreboard</b> platter on the P2 which it describes as being [...] "CNC machined HDF which is then , giving a platter with good mass and accuracy." [...] Compared to the , the Rega [...] has a thicker, heavier plinth; the drive motor is mounted on the plinth using a rubber suspension for improved isolation. The glass platter is also thicker, as is the felt mat.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Lim Juan of The Star {{speculated that}} the revised P2 looked [...] "a lot less {{substantial}} than its ancestor", because of cost-cutting. Whilst the platter of the costlier Rega decks, P3 and P25, continued to be of glass, reviewers derided the <b>fibreboard</b> platter of the P2 as [...] "not inspiring much confidence". The plinth, which the Rega website described as a low mass particulate core sandwiched by highly rigid phenolic laminates, [...] "looks like any plain cheap medite board", according to Lim. The badly-toleranced medite platter proved unpopular with prospective buyers so Rega reverted to glass platters for a while, until the P2 was discontinued in 2005.|$|E
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density <b>fibreboard</b> (MDF) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E

MDF plants utilise wood waste purchased from sawmills and plywood mills in the Bintulu area and occasionally from the Tanjung Manis timber processing zone located {{at the mouth of the}} Rajang River. Synthetic resins, which are required to hold wood dust together, constituted 20% of the total production cost of the wood panel products. MDF plants in Bintulu are operated by Daiken Sarawak Sdn Bhd, which was founded on 15 February 1994. The briquette plant is operated by Cipta Briquette Sdn Bhd. A glue/adhesive factory in Bintulu is owned by Bintulu Adhesive & Chemicals Sdn Bhd. It produces urea formaldehyde resin and phenol formaldehyde resin for plywood and chipboard manufacturing at Kemena Industrial Estate. Urea precondensate is also produced to supply ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser (ABF) plant.|$|E

2500|$|Fourth, in [...] "limited fund" [...] cases, a {{class action}} ensures that all plaintiffs receive relief and that early-filing plaintiffs do not raid the fund (i.e., the defendant) of all its assets before other plaintiffs may be compensated. See Ortiz v. <b>Fibreboard</b> Corp., 527 U.S. 815 (1999). A class action in such a {{situation}} centralizes all claims into one venue where a court can equitably divide the assets amongst all the plaintiffs if they win the case.|$|E
40|$|In DIN EN 622 - 5 {{there are}} two options to test the {{moisture}} resistance of bonds in <b>fibreboards,</b> namely the V 100 -test and the V 313 -test. Similar options apply also for particleboards. Results of research work conducted on medium density <b>fibreboards</b> reveal that vacuum-pretreatment of the samples prior the V 100 -test increases the transverse tensile strength. On the contrary, vacuum-pretreatment reduces the transverse tensile strength measured according to the V 313 -test. The reasons for such a behaviour are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps (CTMP) {{were made}} from waste particle- and <b>fibreboards.</b> Medium density <b>fibreboards</b> (MDF) {{were made from}} {{industrial}} refiner fibres {{in combination with the}} CTMP using urea-formaldehyde resin as a binder. The physical properties and the formaldehyde content of the MDF were determined. The results reveal that MDF made from CTMP of waste particle- and <b>fibreboards</b> meet the standards according to EN 622 - 5, type MDF. The bending strength and internal bond of MDF made from industrial TMP is higher compared with MDF from chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps from waste panels. However, the thickness swelling of MDF made from pulps derived from waste panels is clearly lower compared with that of MDF made from industrial TMP. Furthermore, MDF made from pulps derived from waste panels show a lower formaldehyde content than MDF from virgin fibres. It seems that residues of chemicals from the pulping process (CTMP) acts as a formaldehyde scavanger...|$|R

In this study <b>fibreboards</b> were manufactured with different leather amounts by using spruce fibres, as well as vegetable and mineral tanned leather shavings (wet white and wet blue). The NIR spectroscopy was used to analyse the raw materials {{as well as the}} wood leather <b>fibreboards.</b> Moreover, the physical and mechanical features of the wood leather composite <b>fibreboards</b> were determined to characterize their properties for the further data analysis. The NIR spectra were analysed by univariate and multivariate methods using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. These results demonstrate the potential of FT-NIR spectroscopy to estimate the physical and mechanical properties (e. g., bending strength). This phenomenon provides a possibility for quality assurance systems by using the NIRS...|$|R
50|$|Fibreboard: The core {{is made up}} {{of medium}} or high density <b>fibreboard.</b> Floors with a <b>fibreboard</b> core are hygroscpoic and must never be exposed to large amounts of water or very high {{humidity}} - the expansion caused from absorbing water combined with the density of the <b>fibreboard,</b> will cause it to lose its form. <b>Fibreboard</b> is less expensive than timber and can emit higher levels of harmful gases due to its relatively high adhesive content.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past {{increasing}} {{attention has been paid}} to the use of natural adhesives as a binder in the wood-based panel industry. Nowadays, two german companies are using Quebracho tannin and Wattle tannin for the production of particleboards and medium density <b>fibreboards</b> (MDF), respectively. Up-to-now no serious attention has been given to bond <b>fibreboards</b> by tannin derived from spruce bark. Results of research work carried out in the last two years are presented on the use of spruce tannin as a binder for medium density <b>fibreboards.</b> The results reveal that spruce tannin can be used to partially substitute Quebracho tannin in MDF up to about 60 %. Such boards still meet the specification of moisture resistant MDF (according to EN 319 and EN 321). Moreover, spruce tannin can be used to 100 % as a binder for the production of MDF for indoor use (type MDF EN 622 - 5). Furthermore, it was shown that postthermal treatment of the MDF bended by spruce tannin has a significant positive effect on both thickness swelling and formaldehyde release...|$|R
