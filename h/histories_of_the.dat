5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{historian}} Frantz Funck-Brentano used the archives to undertake detailed research into the operation of the Bastille, focusing on the upper class prisoners in the Bastille, disproving many of the 18th-century myths about the institution and portraying the prison in a favourable light. Modern historians today consider Funck-Brentano's work slightly biased by his anti-Republican views, but his <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille were highly influential and were largely responsible for establishing that the Bastille was a well-run, relatively benign institution. Historian Fernand Bournon used the same archive material to produce the Histoire de la Bastille in 1893, considered by modern historians {{to be one of the}} best and most balanced 19th-century <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille. These works inspired the writing of a sequence of more popular <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including Auguste Coeuret's anniversary history of the Bastille, which typically focused on a handful of themes and stories involving the more glamorous prisoners from the upper classes of French society.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly contradicts the other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, {{professional}} historians began to reevaluate the force's history. A wider set of themes, including social, {{race and class}} issues, began to be analysed, resulting in more challenging <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force being published. Legal challenges brought before the Canadian courts in the 1980s resulted in the release of archive material about the force's role in the First World War for the first time, generating further new lines of research.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E
5|$|Braithwaite {{remained}} in the British Army {{after the war and}} commanded a brigade in the British Army of the Rhine. While stationed in Germany, he wrote a foreword for one of the regimental <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NZEF. He relinquished his temporary rank of brigadier general in 1920, and reverted to his substantive rank of colonel to take up a brigade command in the Territorial Force. He eventually retired from the British Army in November 1925, with the honorary rank of brigadier general. He died in Camberley, Surrey, on 15 October 1937, survived by his wife and children. Braithwaite Street in the Wellington suburb of Karori is named for him.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} modern <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arab nation in {{contrast}} to a history of an individual Arab country was composed by Darwaza in the late 1920s under the title Lessons of Arab History: From Antiquity to Present Times. In the book, Darwaza begins by describing the origins of the Semitic peoples, the rise of Islam, the end of Arab rule in the Middle East by Turkic groups, and the foreign rule over the Arabs by Western powers. The book was intended {{to be used as a}} textbook in primary and secondary schools throughout the British Mandates of Palestine and later Iraq, hence its simplified and direct language. Nonetheless, it played a pioneering role in the development of pan-Arabism.|$|E

5|$|The castle is classed as a Grade I listed {{building}} and a Scheduled monument. The site, managed by English Heritage, {{is open to}} the public. Until the 1970s, the pogrom of 1190 was often underplayed by official <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle; early official guides to the castle made no reference to it. In 1978, however, the first memorial tablet to the victims was laid at the base of Clifford's Tower, and in 1990 the 800th anniversary of the killings was commemorated at the tower. Recently, commercial interests have sought to introduce retail development to the area surrounding it. Citizens, visitors, academics, environmentalists, local businesspeople and Jewish groups have opposed the development with some success, winning a lengthy and bitter public inquiry in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The epitomes of Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Epitome de Caesaribus offer compressed secular political and military <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period. Although not Christian, the epitomes paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|E

The first full-length, non-fiction book covering the battle, John Myers Myers' The Alamo, was published in 1948.

5|$|A {{number of}} <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bastille were {{published}} immediately after July 1789, usually with dramatic titles promising the uncovering of secrets from the prison. By the 1830s and 1840s, popular histories written by Pierre Joigneaux {{and by the}} trio of Auguste Maquet, Auguste Arnould and Jules-Édouard Alboize de Pujol presented {{the years of the}} Bastille between 1358 and 1789 as a single, long period of royal tyranny and oppression, epitomised by the fortress; their works featured imaginative 19th-century reconstructions of the medieval torture of prisoners. As living memories of the Revolution faded, the destruction of the Bastille meant that later historians had to rely primarily on memoires and documentary materials in analysing the fortress and the 5,279 prisoners who had come through the Bastille between 1659 and 1789. The Bastille's archives, recording the operation of the prison, had been scattered in the confusion after the seizure; with some effort, the Paris Assembly gathered around 600,000 of them in the following weeks, which form the basis of the modern archive. After being safely stored and ignored for many years, these archives were rediscovered by the French historian François Ravaisson, who catalogued and used them for research between 1866 and 1904.|$|E
5|$|By 1600, {{irrigated}} paddy {{fields were}} developed in the central highland Betsileo Kingdom, and were extended with terraced paddies throughout the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina a century later. The rising intensity of land cultivation and the ever-increasing demand for zebu pasturage had largely transformed the central highlands from a forest ecosystem to grassland by the 17th century. The oral <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Today, {{the spirits of the}} Vazimba are revered as tompontany (ancestral masters of the land) by many traditional Malagasy communities.|$|E
