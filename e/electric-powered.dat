5|$|A test {{fleet of}} 10 i-MiEVs was {{deployed}} in Masdar City in Abu Dhabi in 2011 {{as part of}} a one-year pilot to test a point-to-point transportation solution for the city as complement of its sustainable public transportation systems, the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) and the Freight Rapid Transit (FRT), both of which consist of automated <b>electric-powered</b> vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{small lake}} {{is a local}} {{favorite}} for fishing. Lake Winfield Scott is stocked with rainbow trout and also contains local species of warmwater fish such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Also on the lake are a boat ramp, boat dock and swimming area with a sand beach. The Forest Service allows only man-powered and <b>electric-powered</b> watercraft on the lake.|$|E
5|$|The train's {{derailment}} caused {{severe damage}} to the Overhead Line Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting {{in a number of}} other <b>electric-powered</b> services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's fail safe design.|$|E
5|$|The Oare Gunpowder Works, {{scene of}} the 1916 explosion, is now a country park and nature reserve {{open to the public}} free of charge. The Oare Marshes are an {{important}} reserve for birds. There is an information centre near the site of the former Harty ferry over the Swale to the Isle of Sheppey. Remains of the process houses and other mill leats have been conserved, and various trails are signposted. An early 20th century <b>electric-powered</b> gunpowder mill which was transferred to Ardeer in 1934 has been repatriated to the country park and is on display. The 18th-century works bell has also been repatriated and is on display at Faversham's Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre. Stonebridge Pond, {{on the site of the}} original Chart Mills, was donated to Swale Borough Council in the early 1980s. It is now a haven for wading birds.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, Boeing {{announced}} plans to acquire Aurora Flight Sciences to expand its capabilities to develop autonomous, <b>electric-powered</b> and long-flight-duration aircraft for its commercial and military businesses. The acquisition is subject to review by regulatory authorities.|$|E
25|$|Light rail staff, security, {{and volunteers}} {{produced}} a largely hitch-free opening {{day for the}} new rail system on June 26, 2004. Officials estimated 30,000 people boarded the <b>electric-powered</b> trains during the transit system's first day of service. Train rides were free. Each station featured live entertainment and food as a diversion for the long waits to board the trains. Predicted daily ridership was 19,300 for 2005 and 24,600 for 2020.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010 it was {{announced}} the PRT would not expand beyond the pilot scheme due {{to the cost of}} creating the undercroft to segregate the system from pedestrian traffic. Subsequently, a test fleet of 10 Mitsubishi i-MiEV electric cars was deployed in 2011 as part of a one-year pilot to test a point-to-point transportation solution for the city as a complement to the PRT and the freight rapid transit (FRT), both of which consist of automated <b>electric-powered</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The trains on the street-level section are {{powered by}} third rail rather than {{overhead}} catenary (the technology used by most other U.S. <b>electric-powered</b> at-grade rail systems), {{a decision that}} exposes wayward pedestrians {{to the risk of}} electrocution. A fatal accident in 1977 involving a severely intoxicated Korean immigrant who attempted to urinate on the third rail at the Kedzie station eventually resulted in a famous Illinois Supreme Court decision in 1992 affirming a verdict of $1.5 million against CTA.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 the Sou’wester {{sailboat}} was created. 62 original Sou’Westers were built, {{making it}} the largest fleet of single design cruising boats of its time. During the 1950s, Hinckley began experimenting {{with the use of}} fiberglass to construct his yachts’ hulls. His first fiberglass boat, the Bermuda 40 sailing ship, was released in 1959. The last Hinckley-built wooden boat was the 1960 “Osprey.” Throughout the 1960s the company provided navigation systems along with auto-pilot and <b>electric-powered</b> furling mainsails.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} {{of an electric}} tram in Saint Petersburg occurred on August 22, 1880. Fyodor Pirotsky, an engineer who demonstrated the tram to the public, hoped that the Horsecar Stock Company, which possessed a monopoly on all rail transportation in the city, would consider replacing traditional horse-drawn rail carriages with <b>electric-powered</b> ones. Despite {{the fact that all}} tests were successful, Pirotsky's proposal was dismissed on the grounds that equipping existing tram tracks for electric traction and purchasing or building compatible tram vehicles would be too expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Rental Car Center (RCC) is a {{one-stop}} {{facility that}} houses 13 rental car brands and vehicles for ATL guests. Operating 24 hours a day, {{seven days a}} week, the RCC {{is just a few}} minutes away from ATL via the ATL SkyTrain, an <b>electric-powered</b> automated people mover system that connects the Rental Car Center to additional parking and the airport. The following rental car companies operate from the RCC: Advantage, Airport Rent A Car, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, E-Z Rent-A-Car, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Payless, Sixt and Thrifty.|$|E
25|$|From {{as early}} as 1888 <b>electric-powered</b> bicycle lamps were {{manufactured}} but did not become a viable proposition until 1898. They comprised an incandescent bulb and either a lead-acid battery or a dynamo. Lead-acid batteries were replaced by dry cells and later by alkaline batteries. Dynamos improved in efficiency and reliability, recently being incorporated into the wheel hub, for example. Moulding techniques for plastics also improved, allowing lens optics to be improved and cost reduced. Incandescent bulbs were replaced first by sealed-unit halogen lamps and later by high-output light emitting diodes.|$|E
25|$|An {{intensive}} {{restructuring of}} the economy, industry and politics of the country {{began in the early}} days of Soviet power in 1917. A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin. One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major {{restructuring of the}} Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country. The plan was developed in 1920 and covered a 10 to 15-year period. It included construction of a network of 30 regional power stations, including ten large hydroelectric power plants, and numerous <b>electric-powered</b> large industrial enterprises. The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.|$|E
25|$|In the {{investigations}} on radiant heat in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in <b>electric-powered</b> lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a dark background and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, {{the result is the}} ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).|$|E
25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father {{in a place called}} Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, the family moved to a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding to rewind the armature and convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an <b>electric-powered</b> one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E
500|$|Horse racing was not {{the only}} draw of the track. [...] In 1900, a race was staged at the track between a {{gasoline-powered}} automobile and an electrically powered automobile. [...] At the time, there were more electric cars in the country than gasoline-powered ones. [...] The race in Chicago was the first time a gasoline-powered car beat an <b>electric-powered</b> one in a race.|$|E
500|$|Lake Jean is a [...] warm-water fishery {{that is open}} to fishing, ice fishing, swimming, and boating. Common {{game fish}} include panfish, trout and bass. Boating is {{permitted}} on the lake, which has two boat launches. Gasoline-powered boats are prohibited. Canoes and other human-powered boats are permitted, as are sail boats and <b>electric-powered</b> vessels. There is a boat rental concession on the lake, which has canoes, kayaks, row boats, and paddle boats available. No fishing is allowed in the Glens Natural Area.|$|E
500|$|After {{stopping}} {{the beating of}} Czolgosz, McKinley's next concern was for his wife, urging Cortelyou to take care how she was told of the shooting. [...] The initial crowd reaction had been panic, and an attempt to flee the hall, which was frustrated by others surging inwards {{to see what had}} occurred. [...] As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an <b>electric-powered</b> ambulance, there was a moan from the crowd {{at the sight of the}} President's ashen face. [...] Foster rode with him on the way to the fair's hospital. [...] On the way there, McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object. [...] "I believe that is a bullet." [...] McKinley had been shot twice; one bullet had deflected off a button and only grazed him; the other had penetrated his abdomen.|$|E
500|$|In late 2012, Ashdod won a NIS 220 {{million grant}} from the Israeli Transport Ministry to improve public {{transportation}} and decrease private car use. According to the municipality's plans, a 20-kilometer ring of road arteries will be given priority in public transportation. These arteries will carry four bus rapid transit lines. In the city's more crowded areas, such as Herzl Boulevard or {{the western part of}} Menachem Begin Boulevard, a public transportation lane will be paved {{in the center of the}} road. In other areas, the right-hand lane will be reserved for public transportation. Buses will also be given priority at traffic lights; electronic devices will allow a bus to signal its approach, causing the light to turn green. In addition, an <b>electric-powered</b> bicycle rental network will be set up, and [...] of bicycle paths will be paved in the city.|$|E
500|$|In 1931, Judge Mellon's son Richard B. Mellon, {{brother of}} Andrew Mellon, and C. C. Macdonald {{acquired}} the park under a partnership {{known as the}} Idlewild Management Company. The first season under the financial support of Mellon and the management of Macdonald and his family brought electricity to the park, allowing for later operating hours and <b>electric-powered</b> rides, including a three-row Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel. The park also debuted a den of black bears that year. The bears were across the path from a cage of monkeys, who escaped in 1932. Park management offered a reward of $3 each ($ each in [...] ) {{for the return of}} the seven monkeys, believing that they had been set loose. R. Z. Macdonald later said that his father, C. C., was always amused and pleased with the publicity that the escape created, though he never formally accused his father.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 the {{university}} began {{construction on the}} Wolfe Center for the Arts. The [...] facility opened in 2011 with performance space, as well as work and classroom areas for art studies of the School of Art, the Department of Theatre and Film, and the School of Musical Arts. The facility was designed by Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta, the firm's first American project. That same year, BGSU built a $40 million residence hall project that included two new residence halls, one a traditional-style dorm and a second suite-style for upperclassmen. The residence hall project added more than 800 beds. In the fall of 2011, BGSU opened The Oaks dining hall. The Oaks was constructed with sustainable designs that included a hybrid solar and wind power system to fulfill Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), an <b>electric-powered</b> truck to distribute food on campus, and a rooftop garden. The building used sustainable and recycled construction materials.|$|E

[...] At one time, UPS used <b>electric-powered</b> trucks (made by White Motors) for {{deliveries}} in Manhattan, NYC. There {{were only a}} few hundred of them, but they were notable for their [...] "spooky silence" [...] when running.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} in the 1880s that <b>electric-powered</b> [...] "trolleys" [...] first became practical. The Chicago {{companies}} hesitated at first to install these faster and more efficient systems because of their heavy investment in cable cars. But the smaller Illinois cities and the Calumet Electric Street Railway of the South Side built successful systems, causing the Chicago companies to feel themselves dropping behind. By the mid-1890s most of them had begun the conversion to electricity, which was completed in 1906.|$|E
2500|$|The Souricette {{has also}} been flown as an all-electric aircraft. On Sunday, 23 December 2007, the Electravia team and the {{association}} APAME first flew its Souricette <b>electric-powered</b> open-cockpit airplane at Aspres sur Buech airfield, Hautes Alpes, France. This Souricette was a special BL1E model and called [...] "Electra" [...] for this occasion. Test pilot Christian Vandamme flew for 48 minutes, covering [...] This aircraft is powered by an 18-kW (24hp) electric engine driven by a 47kg (104lb) KOKAM Lithium polymer battery.|$|E
2500|$|Continuing the enterprise’s unusual {{deals and}} history, Romer is {{believed}} to have gone to Sierra Leone in 1991, along with $25 million from 40 different clients. Romer was later convicted of defrauding $7 million from investors, as well as being handed a 22-year prison sentence. Some of the Solargen cars have been converted to run with regular AMC engines (including the [...] "personal demo car of the owner of Solargen") and {{only a few of the}} original <b>electric-powered</b> Concord wagons still exist while some are not operational when they are sold.|$|E
2500|$|These {{vehicles}} usually carry {{motive power}} in each individual unit. [...] Trams, light rail vehicles and subways {{have been widely}} constructed in urban areas throughout the world since the late 19th century. [...] By the year 1900, <b>electric-powered</b> passenger cars were ubiquitous in the developed world, but they fell into decline after World War II, especially in the U.S. [...] By the year 2000 they had regained popularity and modern lines were being rebuilt {{where they had been}} torn up only 40 years earlier to make way for automobiles.|$|E
2500|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} {{may also}} establish a vehicle classification system for determining a tax amount. In the United Kingdom, a vehicle is taxed {{according to the}} vehicle's construction, engine, weight, type of fuel and emissions, {{as well as the}} purpose for which it is used. Other jurisdictions may determine vehicle tax based upon environmental principles, such as the user pays principle. In another example, certain cities in the United States in the 1920s chose to exempt <b>electric-powered</b> vehicles because officials believed those vehicles did not cause [...] "substantial wear upon the pavements".|$|E
