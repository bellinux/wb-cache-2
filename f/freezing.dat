5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and <b>freezing</b> rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The {{southern}} Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above <b>freezing</b> with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below <b>freezing</b> again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th.

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above <b>freezing,</b> and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below <b>freezing,</b> when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below <b>freezing.</b> In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{observed}} soil <b>freeze</b> depth data from 14 meteorological stations on the Three Rivers Source Region (TRSR) in China during 1960 to 2014, trends in the <b>freeze</b> depth, first date, last date, and duration of frozen soil were analyzed, together with other meteorological variables, such as air temperature, snow depth, and precipitation, observed at the same locations. The results showed the following. (1) A continuous, accelerated decreasing trend in <b>freeze</b> depth appeared in the TRSR during the 1985 – 2014 and 2000 – 2014 periods, compared with that during the 1960 – 2014 period. (2) The <b>freeze</b> first date had been delayed and the <b>freeze</b> last date had been advanced significantly. The advanced trends in <b>freeze</b> last date were more significant than the delayed trends in <b>freeze</b> first date. The <b>freeze</b> duration also experienced an accelerated decrease. (3) The <b>freeze</b> depth and period were strongly affected by air temperature, thawing index, and soil moisture (precipitation), but not by snow. The <b>freeze</b> depth, <b>freeze</b> first date, <b>freeze</b> last date, and duration also influenced each other. (4) These decreasing trends in <b>freeze</b> depth and duration are expected to continue given the increasing trends in air temperature and precipitation in this region...|$|R

5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} <b>freezing</b> at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below <b>freezing</b> temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the <b>freezing</b> air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

Before Mr. <b>Freeze</b> was on the series, he was always called Mr. Zero. In this version, he continues to be campy like the comic books and is given an alias of [...] "Dr. Art Schivel".
