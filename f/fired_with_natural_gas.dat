40|$|AbstractThe {{integration}} of an aluminium plant and post-combustion CO 2 capture {{has been investigated}} and the different integration possibilities have been evaluated technically and economically. The technology used for aluminium production is the Hall-Héroult and the current cell design necessitates that large amounts of false air is supplied to the cells. This results in a CO 2 concentration in the process gas at around 1 vol%, which is considered uneconomical for CO 2 capture. By increasing the CO 2 concentration to 4 vol% implementation of CO 2 capture becomes more likely and this is therefore {{the basis of the}} current investigation. Two integration tasks have been undertaken, one is placement and configuration of the post-combustion CO 2 capture plant relative to the aluminium plant (160 kt CO 2 /yr), and the second is energy integration options for CO 2 capture. The results showed that there is flexibility in placement and configuration of the capture plant as aluminium plants are likely to be stretched over large distances. The investigation of the energy integration options was {{based on the assumption that}} 85 % of the CO 2 produced in the aluminium production was to be captured. The benefit of utilizing waste heat from the aluminium production for use in CO 2 capture was confirmed and it was found that approximately 65 % of CO 2 could be captured using waste heat. The additional energy needed for capturing the remaining 15 % of the CO 2 could then either be generated in an external energy plant, <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> coal, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> or biomass, or with electricity taken from the grid. The burning of fossil fuels in the energy plant results in increased CO 2 generation which is also included for CO 2 capture so that the assumption that 85 % of the CO 2 from the aluminium production was maintained. The results of the cost estimation showed there is some advantage to usin...|$|R

40|$|The Second Generation Model (SGM) is {{employed}} to examine four hypothetical agreements {{to reduce emissions}} in Annex I nations (OECD nations plus most of the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union) to levels {{in the neighborhood of}} those which existed in 1990, with obligations taking effect in the year 2010. We estimate the cost to the United States of complying with such agreements under three distinct conditions: no trading of emissions rights, trading of emissions rights only among Annex I nations, and a fully global trading regime. We find that the marginal cost of returning to 1990 emissions levels in the United States in the absence of trading opportunities is approximately $ 108 per metric ton carbon in 2010. The total cost in that year is approximately 0. 2 percent of GDP. Emissions reductions are accomplished via energy conservation across a broad range of residential, commercial, industrial and transportation activities and by replacing coal <b>fired</b> power stations <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> facilities. International trade in emissions permits lowers the cost of achieving any mitigation objective by equalizing the marginal cost of carbon mitigation among countries. This is sometimes referred to as “where ” flexibility. “Where ” flexibility allows least expensive emissions reductions to be undertaken first, regardless of where they occur among trade participants. For the four mitigation scenarios in this study, economic costs to the United States remain below 1 % of GDP through at least the year 2020. This was the case even in the scenarios where the United States met its mitigation targets without international trading of carbon permits. 1 Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is operated for the U.

The hybrid CHP system is based upon a gas turbine <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and using biofuel in the supplementary firing facility. The performance of different types of hybrid CHP systems is studied, using different turbines types and sizes as well as biomass fuel for supplementary firing the gas turbine exhaust gas stream.

To accomplish the aim of the study and using as simulation tools GateCycleTM and CycleLinkTM, two main figures of merit are investigated: the Total Annual Heating Cost and the Marginal Global CO 2 Reduction Cost of such systems. The results of the study show that Hybrid CHP technology is not an attractive option for the conditions investigated.

40|$|Most of {{the thermal}} power {{stations}} of the Public Power Corporation of Greece (P. P. C.) which operate with brown coal (lignite) {{are not able to}} operate with their nominal capacity, and this represents the main difficulty for PPC's efforts to cover the demand for electric power in Greece. This problem can be explained with the observed considerable deviation of the lignite quality from its preestimated value which forces lignite fired Units of 300 MWel to render most of the time 250 MWel which represents a significant economic loss. Considering the fact that natural gas will be available as a primary energy source for Greece in the next years, the possibility of its utilization in the existing electrical energy production structure, should be examined. The paper discusses the integration possibility of gas turbines <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the same existing lignite fired power plants of northern Greece. A wide range of possible methods of retrofitting brown coal fired power plants with gas turbines is available and a number of alternative solutions are evaluated in this paper.

The increase of the electric power production and the increased efficiency of the total process together with the required modifications of the existing equipment and the availability of the plant, are the main criteria for the evaluation of the proposed alternatives.

The studied boiler is 160 MW, gas <b>fired</b> <b>with</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas,</b> water-tube boiler, having two vertically aligned burners. The boiler model is a 3 D problem that involves turbulence, combustion, radiation in addition to NOx modeling. The 3 D computational fluid dynamic model is developed using Fluent simulation package, where {{the volume of the}} furnace was divided into 371000 control volumes with more concentration of grids near solid walls and regions of high property gradients. The model provides calculations of the 3 D temperature distribution as well as the rate of formation of the NOx pollutant, enabling a better understanding on how and where NOx are produced.

The generated data is then used to train and test the developed neural network softsensors for emission prediction based on the conventional process variable measurements. The softsensors were constructed using Polynomial Networks (PolyNets), which are a special class of the recently introduced Functional Networks.
