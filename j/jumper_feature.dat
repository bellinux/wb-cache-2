50|$|From 2000 to 2015, the club's home <b>jumper</b> design <b>featured</b> a stylised eagle on a tricolour of navy blue, {{white and}} gold. This jumper was {{introduced}} during the 2000 season {{along with a}} much criticized ochre away jumper {{as part of a}} rebrand of the club to coincide with the new millennium. The ochre jumper was later dropped at the end of 2002 in favor of an updated version of the club's former royal blue jumper, which was worn during their 1992 and 1994 premierships. During October 2015, the club announced a navy version of the royal blue jumper would replace the tricolour guernsey as the club's home uniform for 2016 and beyond.|$|R

2500|$|From 2018, the Eagles' home {{guernsey}} {{will see}} a return of the club's former 'royal blue' design used prior to 2000, updated to feature the club's new logo. The club's away strip, which already uses a variation of this design with the royal blue and gold colours swapped around, will be updated to feature the new logo but will otherwise remain relatively unchanged. Between 2000 and 2015, the club's home <b>jumper</b> design <b>featured</b> a stylised eagle on a tricolour of navy blue, white and gold. This jumper was introduced during the 2000 season along with a much criticised ochre away jumper {{as part of a}} rebrand of the club to coincide with the new millennium. The ochre jumper was later dropped at the end of 2002 in favour of an updated version of the club's former royal blue jumper, which was worn during their 1992 and 1994 premierships. Starting in 2010, the Eagles also wore a third, predominantly white guernsey in order to avoid visual clashes with teams who used similar colours. It was dropped as the club's designated clash jumper at the end of 2016, in favour of an updated version of their original 1987 [...] "yellow peril" [...] guernsey. During October 2015, the club announced a navy version of the royal blue jumper would replace the tricolour guernsey as the club's home uniform from 2016, and was used until the introduction of the current design.|$|R
