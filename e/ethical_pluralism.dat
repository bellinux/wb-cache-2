50|$|In ethics, value {{pluralism}} (also {{known as}} <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> or moral pluralism) {{is the idea}} that there are several values which may be equally correct and fundamental, and yet in conflict with each other. In addition, value-pluralism postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values may be incommensurable, in the sense that there is no objective ordering of them in terms of importance. Value pluralism is opposed to value monism.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper on}} {{training}} prospective teachers investigates {{the meaning of}} teaching vocation and teaching profession within educational organisations, {{in the context of}} the knowledge society and in the midst of European convergence. The elements that have influenced and still influence teachers’ professional situations are analysed: tradition, social transformation, advances in research and teachers’ current needs. Then how teaching has evolved as a vocation is studied and the nature and characteristics of teaching as a profession are examined. We conclude that teaching is a vocational profession in an environment of <b>ethical</b> and moral <b>pluralism...</b>|$|R

Pluralist theories of truth deny this assumption. According to <b>pluralism,</b> <b>ethical</b> propositions might be true by more than one property, for example by virtue of coherence; propositions about the physical world might also be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about. Pluralism, in short, holds out the prospect that propositions might be [...] "true in more than one way".|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{over the}} erosion of a {{comprehensive}} public conception of morality are longstanding in political philosophy, but while some contemporary political philosophers see the relevant cause as being {{an increase in the}} acceptance of ethical relativism, others see this trend as the result of an increased intrusion of a market-based ethos into various social spheres that have traditionally been the province of non-market values. Thus while both accounts agree on the normative claim that there are certain values appropriate to particular areas of our lives, and on the descriptive claim that these values seem to be under threat, each postulate a different aetiology for the perceived phenomenon. This paper tentatively accepts the two claims over which both accounts agree, and examines the question over which they do not; the issue of causation, as well as looking at the feasibility and desirability of reversing the perceived progression. Taking into account cross-cultural longitudinal empirical studies of attitudinal change towards various socio-cultural issues, this paper postulates in qualified accordance with the first proposed aetiology, suggesting <b>ethical</b> and cultural <b>pluralism</b> to be prior to market forces, while accepting the probability that each play a significant role, and looks at the likelihood and advisability of change...|$|R
50|$|The central {{subjects}} of Blokland's work are {{the meanings of}} freedom, autonomy, paternalism and emancipation; cultural politics and cultural policy; <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> of philosophers like Isaiah Berlin and political pluralism of political scientists like Robert Dahl and Charles E. Lindblom; the process of modernization (rationalization, differentiation and individualization); the dissemination, potencies and flaws {{of the market and}} bureaucracy; the development of (the thinking on) democracy, policy-making and planning; and the history and potency of political science.|$|E
50|$|However, argues Blackburn, ethics {{cannot be}} entirely realist either, for {{this would not}} allow for {{phenomena}} such as the gradual development of ethical positions over time. In his 1998 book, Ruling Passions, Blackburn likens ethics to Neurath's boat, which can be changed plank by plank over time, but cannot be refitted all at once for risk of sinking. Similarly, Blackburn's theory can explain the existence of rival ethical theories, for example {{as a result of}} differing cultural traditions - his theory allows both to be legitimate, despite their mutual contradictions, without dismissing both views through relativism. Thus, Blackburn's theory of quasi-realism provides a coherent account of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism.</b> It also answers John Mackie's concerns, presented in his argument from queerness, about the apparently contradictory nature of ethics.|$|E
5000|$|The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study 076 of 100 Zidovudine in maternal-infant {{transmission}} of HIV {{had been published}} in 1994. This was a placebo controlled trial which showed a reduction of nearly 70% {{in the risk of}} transmission, and Zidovudine became a de facto standard of care. The subsequent initiation of further placebo controlled trials carried out in developing countries and funded by the United States Centers for Disease Control or National Institutes of Health raised considerable concern when it was learned that patients in trials in the US had essentially unrestricted access to the drug, while those in developing countries did not. Justification was provided by a 1994 WHO group in Geneva which concluded [...] "Placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative antiretroviral drug regimens to prevent {{transmission of}} HIV".These trials appeared to be in direct conflict with recently published guidelines for international research by CIOMS, which stated [...] "The ethical standards applied should be no less exacting than they would be in the case of research carried out in country", referring to the sponsoring or initiating country.In fact a schism between ethical universalism and <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> was already apparent before the 1993 revision of the CIOMS guidelines.|$|E
40|$|The XX century, in the Western countries, {{offered a}} profusion of conceptions, {{frequently}} similar in the tension they generate, but almost never exempt from strong ideological premises, {{and most of all}} inconclusive and discordant in their practical applications. The beginning of the new Millennium, almost as a reaction, has developed an utopia of a new, so called, postmodern humanism. These conceptions are not anti religious, but rather post secular. They represent a considerable challenge to the Christian Churches’ educational tradition, that in turn are convinced to possess (as a monopoly?) the universality of the symbolic goods. It is a challenge on the ground of values and ultimate goals (problem of the <b>ethical</b> and religious <b>pluralism,</b> freedom of religion and belief, new paradigm of the relationship science-faith), but also a challenge on the field of educational procedures and institutional frameworks (conflict between public and private, relevance of the media pervasiveness, primacy of the instrumental knowhow over the humanistic one, the cultural generational gap, etc [...] .). Among the conditions to confront this educational challenge in a correct manner, the article strongly suggests, in order to handle the new complexity of the reality, to adopt a strategy of graduality, to reinstate at the centre of one’s thought and life the formation of an ethic of responsibility...|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} give a {{normative}} account of citizenship education {{in the context of}} deliberative democracy. Within the framework of reasonable pluralism. civic life is not as ethically minimal as many liberals think. I will argue that liberal democracy needs to incorporate the idea of deliberative democracy in order to achieve its aspiration for the teaching and learning of active and reciprocal citizens within the framework of reasonable <b>pluralism.</b> <b>Ethical</b> traits. dispositions, and characters are essential liberal vi 11 ues to bring about a flourishing liberal democratic life. Using the conception of deliberative democracy, I theorize an ethically robust conception of the political person for liberal citizenship education that could accommodate the ideas of public reason, political morality and civic action. In so doing, I propose a framework of citizenship as reasonableness by reformulating Rawls's political liberalism and supplementing it with Dewey’s Pragmatism - especially his ideas of human intelligence. freedom as individuality and cooperative inquiry. As such, liberal democratic citizenship could be attentive to civic duties. active civic participation, and cultivation of liberal virtues. This framework also demonstrates an authentic understanding of liberal democratic polity as an ethical project of cooperative living and fulfills the inherent requirements of liberal theory, both in terms of articulating an ethically robust conception of the political person as well as accommodating moral difference in a diverse society. In addition, the educative feature of public deliberation suggests that reasonable citizens could thoroughly internalize public reason and political morality through practising deliberative civic action. Through the lens of deliberative democracy, this project aims to advocate a thick conception of citizenship education for contemporary liberalism in order to address the theorization of the civic self and the moral demands of liberal democratic citizenship.

40|$|The thesis {{argues that}} there are a number of pluralist ethical {{theories}} each one of which exemplifies traits that make it compatible, to different degrees, with different liberal doctrines. The pluralist ethical theories on which I focus are Berlinian value pluralism, lexical pluralism, non-linear value pluralism, value pluralism as reasonable disagreement and Kekes' theory of primary and secondary values. While delineating these pluralist variations, I also investigate their relationship with moral relativism and moral objectivism. Then I proceed to examine their compatibility with different liberal doctrines. The liberalisms examined are Mill's liberalism, Rawls' liberalism in A Theory of Justice and Rawls' liberalism in Political Liberalism, while there is also reference to Kekes' conservatism which is derived from pluralist premises. Then I continue by focusing specifically on the relationship between <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> and Raz's liberal perfectionism. I present my understanding of Raz's liberal system of ideas and I specify the two concepts in which I will tackle the issue of its compatibility with <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism.</b> Firstly, I exercise the methodology that I have used in my discussion regarding the compatibility between different pluralisms and different liberalisms by examining the compatibility of liberal perfectionism with ethical pluralisms of variable radical aspirations. Secondly, I examine the compatibility in question through an inquiry into Raz's theory of value. This inquiry, however, does not yield results only with respect to the compatibility between liberal perfectionism and <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> since it also reveals a problem which relates, but cannot be completely identified with, the issue of the compatibility between liberal perfectionism and <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism.</b> Namely, the theory of value upon which Raz bases his liberal perfectionist doctrine is too ambiguous and after closer inspection it becomes apparent that if liberal perfectionism is to be a valid doctrine, it must advocate some kind of conservatism which must be further complemented by a belief in meliorism...|$|E
40|$|I {{trace the}} {{development}} of an emerging global Information and Computing Ethics (ICE), arguing that <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> – as found in both Western and Asian traditions – is crucial to such an ICE. In particular, <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> – as affiliated with notions of judgment (phronesis in Aristotle and the cybernetes in Plato), resonance, and harmony – holds together shared ethical norms (as required for a shared global ethic) alongside the irreducible differences that define individual and cultural identities. I demonstrate how such pluralism is already at work in both contemporary theory and praxis, including in development projects in diverse cultures. I conclude with a number of resonances between this global pluralism and African thought and traditions that thus suggest that such a pluralism may also succeed in the African context, as diverse African cultures and countries seek to benefit from ICTs while maintaining their cultural identities...|$|E
40|$|Building on {{the works}} of James J. Helm, I {{argue that it is}} both {{fruitful}} and plausible to read Aeschylus’s Oresteia as expounding a coherent moral outlook. Going beyond Helm, I offer a reading of the trilogy as incorporating a system of deontic requirements that amounts to a kind of noncodi able <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> that does not fall prey to any blatant self-contradictions and that can be interpreted either as a form of nonnaturalist realism or as a kind of communitarian constructivism...|$|E
40|$|This volume tackles {{the burden}} of {{judgment}} and the challenges of ethical disagreements, organizes the cohabitation of scientific and ethical argumentations {{in such a way}} they find their appropriate place in the political decision. It imagines several forms of agreements and open ways of conflicts resolution very different compared with ones of the majority of political philosophers and political scientists that are macro-social and general. It offers an original contribution to a scrutinized interpretation of the precautionary principle, as structuring the decision in interdisciplinary contexts, to make sure to arrive this time to the “Best of the Worlds”. In its first part, the book goes beyond the epistemic “abstinence” we encounter in a lot of political theories, {{in the name of the}} rawlsian burden of judgment or because theses theories are underdetermined regarding the argumentative requirement they claim (Habermas or the theory of the deliberative democracy). This book defends an <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> a third way distinct of relativism or monism. This book presents an exhaustive view of the ethical theories and reintroduces them in the dialogical and interdisciplinary theory of argumentation. In the same vein this book presents several forms of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> of values. In its second part, it joins theses problems and the ones of decision in situation of uncertainty, the coexistence of sciences in assessment, a distinction of scientific and ethical values that is not a dichotomy, and a confrontation of hypotheses. The author explores in detail how the precautionary principle characterizes different uncertainty sources in the scientific work and proposes to lean on it to distribute disciplines assessing technologies according to the distinction between entre experts and scientists, and to ensure an epistemic pluralism (inter-disciplinary and intra-disciplinary). Finally, this study defends a new meta-ethical pluralist theory at the same level as the power of the actual controversial technologies and environmental challenges. From this point of view it answers some limitations of Hans Jonas ethics, because it thinks about the <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> the development of a public policy and more nuanced models of justification...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{confluence of}} globalization and <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> is at the origin of many ethical challenges that confront us nowadays, both in practice and in theory. One of the challenges arising from the development of globalization, {{has to do with}} respect for cultural diversity. It is often said that the success of economic globalization tends towards social and cultural homogeneity. To the extent that cultural diversity is usually seen as a valuable reality, that global trend seems to contradict our efforts to respect <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> both personal and cultural, within society. In this paper I argue that a) ethical minimalism, despite its emphasis on tolerance and justice, does not take pluralism seriously into account in present-day society, and b) ethical minimalism is not suited to balance the homogenizing trend of globalization. Certainly ethical norms are necessary, but by no means are they sufficient in themselves to encourage either justice or tolerance; nor are they sufficient to inspire and encourage good practices and sound regulations. Instead, a virtue-based ethic has the capacity of inspiring and encouraging good practices. Particularly, a virtue-based ethic is able to inspire a serious dialogue about ethical and legal issues both in the public arena and within organizations...|$|E
40|$|John Gray is the thinker who has reconstructed {{the main}} tenets of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> {{inherent}} {{in the work of}} its initiator - Isaiah Berlin - and pointed to its consequences for political philosophy. In particular he singled out three levels of conflict in ethics identifiable in Berlin’s writings: among the ultimate values belonging to the same morality or code of conduct, among whole ways or styles of life and within goods or values which are themselves internally complex and inherently pluralistic. It is the third, internal kind of conflict that proves to be the richest in implications. Because it undermines a whole constellation of contemporary liberal doctrines informed by the Kantian-Lockean tradition that conform to the legal paradigm. From the pluralist perspective such monumental theories (e. g. those of Rawls or Dworkin) are no longer sustainable due to the recognition that no ultimate value is immune to the phenomenon of incommensurability. Thus, irresolvable conflicts may also break out within the given regulative value. Confronting <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> with general reflection on law has mostly negative consequences. Nevertheless, the incommensurability thesis sheds considerable light on certain legal disputes. This claim will be illustrated by interpreting from the pluralist perspective the controversy over the verdict by the European Tribunal of Human Rights of 3 November 2010 concerning hanging crosses in classrooms...|$|E

40|$|EIn {{this paper}} I intend {{to put forward}} some {{criticism}} of the purely procedural model of bioethics, which, in fact, leads to delegating to biopolitics and biolaw the finding of a purely pragmatic solution to the issues for which bioethics was “invented” over forty years ago. This delegating takes place after {{the transition from the}} thesis, dear to modernity, whereby in ethics reasoning should avoid any discussion regarding its foundation or ultimate justification (Etsi Deus non daretur) to the contemporary affirmation of a substantial ethical agnosticism, which, {{in the name of the}} incommensurability of morals, should construct procedures as if no sole substantial moral were possible (Etsi ethos non daretur) and act as a guarantor of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism.</b> These theses will be discussed and an attempt will be made to demonstrate why it is necessary to establish a link between true and good, and how this is possible only by referring to ontology. The conclusion points to the need to propose bioethics explicitly in terms of content that satisfies the presumed axiological neutrality of procedural bioethics, which however, turns out to be theoretically weak and practically unable to protect the <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> for which it would like to be the guarantor. The conclusion is that only by referring to ontology can bioethics, which is a fully fledged form of moral philosophy, act as a guarantor of pluralism within the truth and oppose the authoritarian tendencies concealed under the liberal guise of ethical agnosticism...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to define}} the {{foundation}} and nature of contemporary liberalism. Chapter 1 will {{provide an overview of}} different interpretations of what liberalism is, followed by a general definition of liberalism as a political doctrine with four distinct features: importance of liberty, centrality of persons, commitment to <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> and suspicious attitude towards state power. Chapter 2 will propose that the foundation of liberalism thus conceived is an understanding of persons as free and equal. Persons being free means that there is no normative authority over persons in politics except the one which is properly justified; this is the justification thesis. Persons being equal means that there is no normative authority over persons in ethics. This implies a committed openness to pluralism, since there is no normative position from which to adjudicate. Chapters 3 and 4 will establish that we have good reasons to believe persons are free and equal - or at least that we have reason to treat them as such. In Chapter 5 I present the idea of perfectionism and distinguish perfectionist liberalisms from political liberalisms, as well as considering some ways in which one might make the case for perfectionist liberalism. Finally in Chapter 6 I bring the discussion to a close, first by looking at some objections to perfectionism found in the literature, and then demonstrating that if we take the idea of persons as free and equal as a foundation of liberalism, then we cannot be perfectionist, since these two notions are in conflict with one another. More specifically a perfectionist approach to liberalism cannot meet the justification thesis and cannot be open to <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism.</b> The thesis provides a comprehensive view of liberalism and its foundation and thus helps to settle an important debate within contemporary liberalism between perfectionism and anti-perfectionism...|$|E
40|$|International {{business}} research in emerging countries has grown rapidly {{over the past}} few decades due to globalisation and an increase in business opportunities. Therefore, the western institutions are placing more emphasis on conducting research in emerging countries. More importantly, each institution has its own approved ethical guidelines for research. Ethical guidelines are frequently embedded within western value systems and are unable to address ethical dilemmas when conducting research, particularly in emerging countries. The authors’ experiences of conducting research in four emerging countries are used to demonstrate some of these unexpected ethical dilemmas. This paper attempts to provide a conceptual framework for managing ethical challenges. A reflexive methodology is used to show how researchers can navigate around ethical dilemmas.

Yet the irreducible <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> that characterizes contemporary society seems to make it impossible to impose a single system of values as a source of social cohesion and identity reference. In this book, Lucio Cortella argues that Hegel’s theory of ethical life can provide such a grounding and makes the case through an analysis of Hegel’s central political work, the Philosophy of Right. Although Hegel did not support democratic political ends and wrote in a historical and cultural context far removed from the current liberal-democratic scene, Cortella maintains that the Hegelian theory of ethical life, with its emphasis on securing a framework conducive to human freedom, nevertheless offers a convincing response to the problem of the ethical uprootedness of contemporary democracy...|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} political theory, perfectionists {{believe that the}} state should promote substantive conceptions of the good through its legislation. Supporters of neutrality, instead, claim that the state should refrain from doing so. In this article I analyse perfectionism in relation to Jürgen Habermas’ theory of discourse and deliberative politics (1996) and critique Habermas’ distinction between ‘ethical’ and ‘moral’ discourses (1984, 1990). By relating Habermas’ theory to George Sher’s account of perfectionism (1997), I argue that we can establish the meta-ethical grounds for a model of deliberation encompassing ethical matters (that is, questions concerning the good life) {{not confined to the}} limits of specific communities. I conclude by arguing that ethical deliberation is not only feasible but also desirable. Given the fact of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> and in order to show respect towards their fellow citizens, political perfectionists ought to be ready to show how their ethical claims (which they want to see translated into state policy) relate to deeper meta-ethical human goals on which we can ideally find a consensus through deliberation...|$|E
40|$|Isaiah Berlin (1909 - 1997) {{has contributed}} {{greatly to the}} fields of ethical and {{political}} theory, {{as well as in}} the study of the history of ideas, with probably his lectures on the intellectual history of freedom – Four Essays on Liberty – and his critique of Utopian political theory – The Crooked Timber of Humanity – being the most widely read and discussed. In this study, however, it is mainly his combination of value pluralism in ethical theory – the belief that there are several objective values or ends and that these on occasion collide, leaving us with hard choices – and a cautious and moderate liberalism in political affairs that is drawn to the readers’ attention. It has been said in recent times, most prominently by John Gray and John Kekes that Berlin’s attempt at combining value pluralism and liberalism was and will always be a failure, as an endorsement of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> actually leads away from liberal conclusions in politics. Against this view, I have pointed to the fact that both these authors base their rejection of any possibility of liberal pluralism on their own subtle, but in the end far-reaching, changes to Berlin’s ethical theory, as well as in an unhelpfully restrictive view of what kind of theory liberalism is. What they have found, I argue, is not that liberalism and value pluralism simpliciter are perpetually locked in metaphysical combat – a finding which would indeed be devastating to Berlin’s political theories – but the far less disturbing discovery that their own rather eccentric versions of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> and some more ambitious forms of liberal theory are incompatible. During the last years, also, several defences of liberal pluralism have been published, most notably by George Crowder and William Galston. While both of them rather astutely point to several compelling arguments against there being any fundamental and unbridgeable conflicts between liberalism and value pluralism, I find the fact that they believe that pluralism leads directly to quite different types of liberal theory to raise a few questions of their own. I have therefore attempted to argue that pluralism instead has few direct, political consequences outside of a commitment to moderation and prudence, and that pluralists, and anyone else for that matter, should instead be persuaded by the apparent successes of liberalism and liberal ways of organising societies, and equally discouraged by the demerits of its alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{question}} of the universality of human rights has {{much in common with}} the {{question of}} the universality of ethics. In the form of a multidisciplinary reflexive survey, the aim {{of this article is to}} show how human rights discourses derive from more basic principles related to basic needs. These needs are the universal grammar for moral principles, which will be distinguished from ethical norms. Ethical norms, I will argue, are rules that develop in social groups to put into effect moral principles through communicative action and therefore develop as culturally specific norms, which guide behaviour within these social groups. This will explain why ethical norms contain some universal principles, but are largely culturally specific. In order to shed some light on the universality debate, I will show how moral principles translate into ethical norms and might manifest through communicative action in human rights law. For this purpose the article develops a socio-legal account on social norm-creation that bridges moral universality and legal universality via <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> which in effect explains why despite the universality of moral principles, the outcomes of ethical rationales can vary extremely...|$|E

User-centred and participatory design approaches, while grounded in everyday wisdom, cannot {{be expected to}} address ethical reflection consistently, as multiple value systems come into play.

Phronesis describes wisdom and judgment garnered from prac tical experience of specific situations in context. Applied phronesis contributes everyday wisdom to challenging issues for vulnerable target users. Drawing on research into mHealth technologies for psychological wellbeing, we explore how phronesis can inform ethical design. Using a case study on an app for self- reporting symptoms of depression during pregnancy, we present a framework for incorporating a phronetic approach into design, involving: (a) a wide feedback net to capture phronetic input early in design; (b) observing the order of feedback, which directly affects value priorities in design; (c) <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> recognising different coexisting value systems; (d) acknowledging subjectivity in the disclosure and recognition of individual researcher and participant values. We offer insights into how a phronetic approach can contribute everyday wisdom to designing mHealth technologies to help designers foster the values that promote human flourishing...|$|E

40|$|It {{is clear}} at fi rst sight that sport {{is a very}} complex phenomenon, which generates ethical contradictions.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} theories of interreligious dialogue and Muslim-Christian dialogue specifically. The aim is to examine whether Legenhausen’s non-reductive religious pluralism, rooted in Shi’a theology, is a successful {{solution to the problem}} of difference involved in Hick’s (reductive) hypothesis. Such a study is important because it investigates what types of theories of interreligious relations are “difference-respecting” in the sense that they are capable of recognizing the significance of religious and cultural differences as invaluable resources for interfaith dialogue. The research approach adopted is a critical analysis of the relevant literature, undertaken from a philosophical/phenomenological perspective. The findings are that Legenhausen’s position does not solve the problem of difference to a satisfying degree because a) it is based on inclusivist thinking and thus faces the charge of spiritual superiority and b) by excusing differences between Muslim and Christian beliefs by reference to the concept of qasir (incapability), it does not take otherness seriously, which makes it even more reductive than classical pluralisms. The main conclusion is that a truly egalitarian account of religions, sensitive to issues of difference, needs to bridge the gulf between objective observer perspectives (adopted by pluralists) and insider views on interfaith issues (promoted by religiously specific approaches like Legenhausen’s). As an alternative theory it is therefore recommended to combine the best of both approaches into a (religiously non-specific) model of witnessing, based on minimal <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism...</b>|$|E

We note the 2012 guidelines by the Association of Internet Researchers, which advocates for <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> for minimizing harm, and for the responsibility of the researcher where codes are insufficient. As a point of contrast, we evaluate Markham’s (2012) radical argument for data fabrication as an ethical practice. In reflecting on how researchers of the digital media practices of youth resolved their dilemmas in practice, we take up Markham’s challenge of identifying evolving practice, including researchers’ workarounds, but we eschew her solution of fabrication. Instead, we support the emerging consensus that while rich data is increasingly available for collection, it should not always be fully used or even retained in order to protect human subjects in a digital world in which future possible uses of data exceed the control of the researcher who collected them...|$|E

Communities are experiencing an enrichment of new ideas, and unique opportunities to learn about those with whom we share the world. At the same time, we are witness to emerging tensions and value conflicts - especially in the health care system. This has given rise to what some have termed the problem of pluralism: the challenges associated with formulating public policy and shaping health care practices for parties who have deep moral disagreements. 	 It has been proposed that the practice of informed consent in health care is an effective solution to the problem of pluralism, as it allows individuals to make decisions according to their own moral commitments and control the care they receive. In this thesis, I argue that informed consent is not a value-neutral practice. Rather, it is grounded in particular values and beliefs, and reflects a particular understanding of health and illness. Consequently, I argue that the practice may not be able to fully address the problem of pluralism. 	I begin by exploring the dynamics of <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism</b> and the structure of the health care system in Canada. I focus, specifically, on the challenges that arise from this complex intersection of ethics and health. Next, I establish the ways in which the practice of informed consent is embedded with particular values. Finally, I discuss strategies for making the practice of informed consent more accommodating of diversity. I argue that there are, however, limits to the possible accommodations that can be made, due to the complexity of the issues and the structure of the health care system in Canada...|$|E
40|$|Scientists' moral {{responsibilities}} {{have become}} a focus for the scientific community over the postwar decades. International and regional networks of leading academic bodies have responded to a widely perceived increase in scientific fraud and the ensued loss of public trust in science during the 1980 s, and initiated a discussion {{with a view to}} codifying good practice in research. While scientists' “external” responsibilities towards society and the humankind have been variously addressed, codes drafted since then mainly dwell on problems of misconduct concerning scientists' “internal” responsibilities towards science and to the scientific community. They also reflect an <b>ethical</b> <b>pluralism,</b> which declines justifying moral standards in research with reference to universal ethical principles. However, the need for such justification has been first recognized decades ago, during the Doctor's Trial in Nuremberg, where the shortcomings of the established ethos of science and the inadequacy of the Hippocratic ethics in safeguarding human rights in research had become flagrant, with the resultant Nuremberg Code of 1947 introducing a human rights perspective into Hippocratic ethics. This paper argues for the necessity of an integral ethical justification of scientists' both external and inner responsibilities, as put down or assumed by internationally acclaimed codes of conduct. Such necessity is validated by the evidence that a historical current to monopolize ethical thinking in the name of science and nullify philosophical ethics lies at the root of an anti–morality that relativized human worth and virtually legitimized human rights violations in scientific practice. Kantian ethics based on humans' absolute inner worth, and Popperian epistemology rooted in respect for truth and for humans as rational beings, pledge an ethical justification of moral norms in science so as to reinforce the latter against intrusions of anti–morality. The paper concludes with an attempt to such a justification for scientists' external responsibilities...|$|E
