As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out a place they could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the <b>drive</b> <b>section</b> and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E

40|$|A new conception, electro-magnetically controlled, diaphragmless {{shock tube}} was {{realized}} and {{tested in the}} laboratories of University of Florence. A piston separates the co-axial driver and <b>driven</b> <b>sections.</b> The piston is kept in position by a force of an electromagnet acting on an iron disc linked to its rod. In order to obtain very short opening time, light materials were tested for moving devices: aluminum, ergal, titanium and iron. Opening time was measured using contact sensors. Several different dimensionless <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> lengths were tested by changing the <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> length and by reducing the <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> diameter. The influence of the two factors on shock presence and shock formation was analyzed separately. Tests were carried out for driver-to-driven pressure ratios of up to 22, obtaining shock waves at Mach number of up to 1. 70 with a difference from the theoretical value for a straight shock tube of 9 %. A configuration for increasing the useful test time after the shock passage is also proposed and tested.

40|$|The {{shock tube}} is a device {{in which a}} normal shock wave is {{produced}} by the interaction of fluids at significantly high-pressure difference. The shock tube is comprised of two sections known as driver and <b>driven</b> <b>sections.</b> These two sections are interacted with the high-speed valve or a bursting disc. When the interaction happens, a shock wave forms almost instantaneously and propagates into the <b>driven</b> <b>section,</b> while simultaneously an expansion wave propagates {{in the opposite direction}} into the driver section. The most commonly used technique to set-up such initial conditions is the use of a bursting diaphragm; however, a high-speed valve provides better control over the event. In the given setup, a high-speed valve is used for the generation of the shock wave. In this setup, solenoid valves are placed at various locations to control the filling and the safe operation. The shock tube is fitted with three pressure sensors. First pressure sensor is placed in the driver section whereas two other pressure sensors are placed in the <b>driven</b> <b>section.</b> A T-joint is placed in the <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> to mount a specimen for the study. The particular setup has computerized data acquisition system, which can record information up to 1 MHz. The operation of the shock tube and its various sensors is programmed to auto-trigger to gather the information...|$|R
50|$|The {{low-pressure}} gas, {{referred to}} as the driven gas, is subjected to the shock wave. The high pressure gas is known as the driver gas. The corresponding sections of the tube are likewise called the driver and <b>driven</b> <b>sections.</b> The driver gas is usually chosen to have a low molecular weight, (e.g., helium or hydrogen) for safety reasons, with high speed of sound, but may be slightly diluted to 'tailor' interface conditions across the shock. To obtain the strongest shocks the pressure of the driven gas is well below atmospheric pressure (a partial vacuum is induced in the <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> before detonation).|$|R
40|$|A {{shock tube}} is {{proposed}} {{in which the}} flow conditions between the shock wave and advancing interface are expected to range from low subsonic to moderate supersonic speeds.

40|$|International audienceIn a {{conventional}} shock tube, {{the driver and}} the <b>driven</b> <b>sections</b> have similar (if not identical) cross-sectional area and the diaphragm opened area, upon rupturing, is practically equal to the tube cross-sectional area. Such geometry results in generating a well-formed shock wave in the tube's <b>driven</b> <b>section.</b> The present experimental work checks the effects that changes in the diaphragm ruptured area have on the generated shock and rarefaction waves. Experiments were conducted in an 80 mm by 80 mm cross section shock tube generating incident shock waves having Mach numbers within the range from 1. 06 to 1. 25. In each run, pressure histories were recorded along the driven and the driver sections of the shock tube. The recorded pressures reveal that progressive reduction in the diaphragm open space resulted in a weaker shock and both longer time and distance until the compression waves generated close to the diaphragm coalesces into a shock wave. In addition, reducing the open space of the diaphragm resulted in a significant slow down in the high pressure reduction prevailing in the driver section...|$|R

40|$|AbstractShock tubes create {{simulated}} blast waves {{which can}} be directed and measured to study blast wave effects under laboratory conditions. It is desirable to increase available peak pressure from ∼ 1  MPa to ∼ 5  MPa to simulate closer blast sources and facilitate development and testing of personal and vehicle armors. Three methods are experimentally investigated to increase peak simulated blast pressure produced by an oxy-acetylene driven shock tube while maintaining suitability for laboratory studies. The first method is {{the addition of a}} Shchelkin spiral priming section which supports a deflagration to detonation transition. This approach increases the average peak pressure from 1. 17  MPa to 5. 33  MPa while maintaining a relevant pressure-time curve (near Friedlander waveform). The second method is a bottleneck between the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>sections.</b> Coupling a 79  mm diameter driving section to a 53  mm <b>driven</b> <b>section</b> increases the peak pressure from 1. 17  MPa to 2. 25  MPa.
