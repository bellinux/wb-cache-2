5|$|Despite his popularity, Goldschmidt {{left office}} after only one term, {{becoming}} an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for {{several of the}} causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation, Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon's Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> take over Portland General Electric, a local utility company. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed him to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had {{a sexual relationship with}} a minor girl 30 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{began the}} liberation of the Philippines on 25 October 1944, with a landing at Leyte island in the central Philippines. After a base was {{established}} at Leyte, American forces landed at Mindoro island on 13 December. This operation was conducted to secure airfields {{which could be used}} to attack Japanese shipping in the South China Sea and support the largest element of {{the liberation of}} the Philippines, a landing at Lingayen Gulf in north-western Luzon that was scheduled for 9 January 1945. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) suffered heavy losses <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> attack the Allied fleet during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944 which, when combined with the losses during the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944, left it unable to conduct further major battles. However, it remained capable of raiding Allied positions.|$|E

5|$|What this {{effectively}} did was {{shift the}} bombing campaign southwestward to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The interdiction {{campaign against the}} enemy logistics corridor was massively expanded due to the increased number of U.S. aircraft (approximately 500 planes) made available by the closure of Rolling Thunder. By November 1968 bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed by 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November. By {{the end of the}} conflict, U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft would drop over three million tons of ordnance on Laos, three times the total tonnage dropped on North Vietnam. The new campaign against the trail was unprecedented, and not just due to the numbers sorties flown or munitions expended. The U.S. was going to field its latest technology <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> prevent the North Vietnamese from toppling the South Vietnamese government.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} parties opposing the retail reforms physically disrupted and forced India's parliament to adjourn again on Friday 2 December 2011.

25|$|In this context, the {{government}} began handing out food supplies {{as a means to}} ensure votes. Pauker attested that, in several places, the state was frustrated <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> purchase grain from peasants, who argued that the price was small and the supplies insufficient. Eventually, the Central Committee took the decision to import grain (and especially maize) in large quantities, an action overseen by Gheorghiu-Dej.

50|$|Mainz {{was more}} {{successful}} <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> expand {{on the other}} side of the Main (river): in 1425, the archbishop purchased the district of Steinheim from the Lords of Eppstein. Thus Mainz continued to present a threat to the County of Hanau.|$|R
25|$|In 1848, the First Schleswig War started, as Schleswig-Holstein {{was trying}} to {{separate}} from Denmark, and Denmark considered it {{a part of the}} country. The Kingdom of Prussia, the Austrian Empire and the German Confederation, sent troops to support Schleswig-Holstein <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> secede from Denmark, and {{become a part of the}} German Confederation. Wishing to defeat Denmark before German, Austrian, and Prussian troops arrived, 7,000 Schleswig-Holsteinian soldiers under General Krohn occupied Flensborg on March 31, 1848.|$|E
25|$|Louisville {{continued}} to struggle during the 1980s <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> redevelop and expand. It fought with other Jefferson County communities in two more failed attempts {{to merge with}} county government in 1982 and 1983. Barry Bingham, Jr. sold the family business Standard Gravure in 1986, which sent the company into a major restructuring in the following years. The Courier-Journal {{was one of the}} papers printed by Standard Gravure. On September 14, 1989, Joseph Wesbecker, on medical leave due to mental illness and work-related stress, entered the Courier-Journal building and shot and killed eight employees, injuring another twelve before killing himself.|$|E
25|$|Having {{dealt with}} the {{foregoing}} issues, Holmes now confronted whether West Virginia had a duty {{to pay for the}} new bonds and certificates issued by Virginia between 1871 and 1900 <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> discharge the one-third debt remaining on its books. The Supreme Court had ruled on the legality of Virginia's debt substitution and duty to pay in numerous cases over the past. Citing Hartman v. Greenhow, 102 U.S. 672 (1880) and McGahey v. Virginia, 135 U.S. 662 (1890), in particular, Holmes observed that the Court had already intimated that West Virginia had a duty to pay these outstanding debts, and now he reaffirmed that duty explicitly.|$|E

25|$|Also {{important}} were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing {{the national}} purpose and his skill {{in keeping the}} border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. The Confederate government failed <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.|$|E
25|$|The British {{government}} did not find this response satisfactory and it eventually brought its case to the International Court of Justice, having failed <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> involve the Security Council in the matter. It was the first case adjudicated by the ICJ, and in December 1949 the court awarded the British the sum of £843,947 or US$2,009,437 having found that, irrespectively of who laid the mines, the Albanians ought to have observed any such action, since the minefield {{was so close to}} their coast, and thus they failed to inform the British of the danger. The Court also rejected the self-defence argument advanced by the United Kingdom and found that the mine-clearing operations undertaken by the British during Operation Retail, in the absence of prior Albanian consent, were illegal.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of , the Ottoman light cruiser Mecidiye sailed out of the Dardanelles on a {{scouting}} mission. At 10:40, Delfin launched a torpedo against Mecidiye {{from a distance of}} 800 meters, but failed to sink it, as the torpedo broke surface and passed by the ship. This is the first recorded launch of a torpedo by a submarine in battle. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> return to Tenedos, the ship ran aground on a shoal north of the island, and had to drop its lead ballast in order to escape. This however meant that the ship was unable to submerge any more, and therefore sailed back to Piraeus. Delfin, along with Xifias {{and the rest of the}} Greek fleet, were confiscated by the French in 1916, during the Greek National Schism. When they were returned in 1919, they were in a bad shape, and the following year, they were decommissioned.|$|E
50|$|Some {{commentators}} have remarked that the work-in was hugely {{successful in the}} short-term, at halting the laissez-faire, free-market ideas that many in the then Conservative government wanted to implement.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of World War II, the Luftwaffe {{launched}} devastating air attacks against besieged cities.

25|$|Despite the uncongenial {{report of}} his Commission, the Malan {{government}} {{was willing to}} elevate Fagan to the Appellate Division, the country's highest court, in October 1950, to replace the departed Chief Justice Watermeyer. Concern was growing at that stage that the Nationalists were trying to fill the Appellate Division with loyalists, but in Fagan's case these concerns were, again, attenuated; despite his links with the government, he was a moderate whose appointment was justified on merit.Fagan's most significant judgments were about private law, raising little political intrigue: he established that gambling debts are unenforceable in South African law, and that undue influence vitiates a contract. But he did find against the government <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> enforce the Population Registration Act, 1950, raising the standard of proof required to classify a person as 'non-European' on the provocative basis that Parliament could not have intended something so unjust as foisting that status on a person without adequate proof.|$|E
25|$|The 4th Session of the Central Council, held in Moscow from March 9–15, 1926, began {{just as the}} 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI came to a close. At both {{of these}} gatherings Solomon Lozovsky had {{delivered}} reports which identified Great Britain — where a miners' strike {{was in the air}} — and in particular the countries of Asia and the Pacific as areas presenting the greatest opportunities for the Profintern <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> construct a world revolutionary movement. Amsterdam had paid scant attention to Asia, leaving the field open to the Profintern's efforts, Lozovsky noted in his report to the Comintern Executive. RILU did make an effort to break new organizational ground outside of Europe as early as February 1922 when it established a Moscow office comparable to the Comintern's Eastern Bureau, headed by Buffalo, New York druggist Boris Reinstein, Bulgarian-American IWW member George Andreychine, and H. Eiduss. But now, even as European prospects dimmed, the situation looked brighter in Asia and the Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Colonel Ramírez {{was just one}} act in a macabre war by the Medellín Cartel against the Colombian State <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> outsmart it. But {{it was also a}} {{milestone}} which resulted in the fight against the cartel being quickly strengthened with the international support of the DEA in order to hunt down the main ringleaders. On August 18, 1989 a successor of Ramírez, Colonel Waldemar Franklin Quintero, was also murdered by the same cartel, but 4 months later, on December 15, 1989 justice received its first meaningful victory in that war with the death of Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, alias The Mexican. The next success was when Pablo Escobar Gaviria, alias El Patrón, surrendered himself to the authorities in 1991, however he made sure that the Colombian government would agree to a non-extradition regulation so that he could not be extradited to the United States. Afterwards, he escaped and tried to create his own war against the State, but he was shot down by the Police Special Force on December 2, 1993.|$|E
