Open {{to the public and}} free of charge, the museum was privately established in 1937 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> by a joint resolution of the United States Congress.

The Gallery's collection of paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, sculpture, medals, and decorative arts traces the development of Western Art from the Middle Ages to the present, including the only painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the Americas and the largest mobile created by Alexander Calder.|$|E
25|$|In June 2017, the Senate voted 98 to 2 for a {{bill that}} had been {{initially}} drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia′s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the 2016 election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran, and North Korea; the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law. An identical bill was introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives in July and passed in the house on July 25, with 419 votes in favor and 3 against. On July 27, the bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate, which provoked Russia′s president Putin into pledging response to ″this kind of insolence towards our country″. On August 2, president Donald Trump signed the bill into law (the ″Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act″). Simultaneously, the president issued two separate, simultaneous statements. One of those said, ″While I favor tough measures to punish and deter aggressive and destabilizing behavior by Iran, North Korea, and Russia, this legislation is significantly flawed. In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions″. The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress, giving them time to reverse such a move. It targets Russia's defense industry by harming Russia's ability to export weapon, and allows the U.S. to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources. One of Trump′s statements noted that ″by limiting the Executive’s flexibility, this bill {{makes it harder for}} the United States to strike good deals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together.″ The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure {{on the part of the}} European Union.|$|E

Bryan argues that sustaining an imperialist policy would necessitate maintaining a large standing army, cultivating a culture of militarism, and forcing the Filipinos to be subjects of the United States rather than citizens of their own state. [...] Bryan also contrasts American policy in Cuba against the situation in the Philippines; he says that giving the Cubans freedom and not doing the same with the Filipinos is contradictory and goes against the precedent set in Cuba. In the speech, Bryan states that America should be not use its power to spread its forces. He appeals to the values he says are inherent in American democracy and that America should follow the words of its past presidents, specifically Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson.|$|R

500|$|The {{nation and}} the {{constitution}} survived {{the rising tide of}} financial and political corruption during President Grant's two terms in office from 1869 to 1877. With slavery no longer the clear moral issue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people,</b> and absent the dynamic leadership of Abraham Lincoln taken by an assassin's bullet, the nation for a while floundered in the seas of financial and political indulgence. The high-water mark of the flood of corruption that swept the nation took place in 1874, after Benjamin Bristow was put in charge to reform the Treasury. [...] In 1873, Grant's friend and publisher, Mark Twain, along with coauthor Charles Dudley Warner, called this American era of speculation and corruption the Gilded Age. Between 1870 and 1900, the United States population nearly doubled in size, gainful employment increased by 132 percent, and non farm labor constituted 60 percent of the work force.|$|E

[...] He argues that Article V remains the most clear and powerful way to register the sovereign desires of the American public with regard to alterations of their fundamental law. In the end, Article V is an essential bulwark to maintaining a written Constitution that secures the rights of the people against both elites and themselves.|$|E
