2500|$|Since {{a central}} tenet {{of the flat}} tax is to {{minimize}} the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad [...] special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [...] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them. [...] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the funds paid out as dividends have already been taxed. [...] It's a <b>debatable</b> <b>question</b> if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [...] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible. Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.|$|E

Over {{and over again}} I notice that he contrives to divert the conversation from general topics, and to lure me into talking of myself; and, stranger still (unless I am quite mistaken), Sir James understands and encourages him. Under various pretenses I am questioned about what I have suffered in the past, and what plans of life I have formed for the future. Among other subjects of personal interest to me, the subject of supernatural appearances is introduced. I am asked if I believe in occult spiritual sympathies, and in ghostly apparitions of dead or distant persons. I am dexterously led into hinting that my views on this difficult and <b>debatable</b> <b>question</b> are in some degree influenced by experiences of my own. Hints, however, are not enough to satisfy the doctor's innocent curiosity; he tries to induce me to relate in detail what I have myself seen and felt. But by this time I am on my guard; I make excuses; I steadily abstain from taking my friend into my confidence. It {{is more and more}} plain to me that I am being made the subject of an experiment, in which Sir James and the physician are equally interested. Outwardly assuming to be guiltless of any suspicion of what is going on, I inwardly determine to discover the true motive for the doctor's presence that evening, and for the part that Sir James has taken in inviting him to be my guest.|$|E
6000|$|The <b>debatable</b> <b>question</b> is, was the [...] "demon," [...] or {{the actual}} expanse of sky, first in evolution? That cannot {{precisely}} be settled, {{but in the}} analogous Chinese case of China we find heaven (Tien) and [...] "Shang-ti, the personal ruling Deity," [...] corresponding to the Huron [...] "demon". Shang-ti, the personal deity, occurs most in the oldest, pre-Confucian sacred documents, and, so far, {{appears to be the}} earlier conception. The [...] "demon" [...] in Huron faith may also be earlier than the religious regard paid to his home, the sky.(1) The unborrowed antiquity of a belief in a divine being, creative and sometimes moral, in North America, is thus demonstrated. So far I had written when I accidentally fell in with Mr. Tylor's essay on [...] "The Limits of Savage Religion".(2) In that essay, rather to my surprise, Mr. Tylor argues for the borrowing of [...] "The Great Spirit," [...] "The Great Manitou," [...] from the Jesuits. Now, as to the phrase, [...] "Great Spirit," [...] the Jesuits doubtless caused its promulgation, and, where their teaching penetrated, shreds of their doctrine may have adhered to the Indian conception of that divine being. But Mr. Tylor in his essay does not allude to the early evidence, his own, for Oki, Atahocan, Kiehtan, and Torngursak, all undeniably prior to Jesuit influence, and found where Jesuits, later, did not go. As Mr. Tylor offers no reason for disregarding evidence in 1892 which he had republished in a new edition of Primitive Culture in 1891, it is impossible to argue against him in this place. He went on, in the essay cited (1892) to contend that the Australian god of the Kamilaroi of Victoria, Baiame, is, in name and attributes, of missionary introduction. Happily this hypothesis can be refuted, as we show in the following chapter on Australian gods.|$|E

Nevertheless, this remains a <b>debatable</b> <b>question</b> in Bulgaria until today, as this is a semi-active waterfall, not a constant one (not having constant flow of water) unlike the 124.5 metres high Raysko Praskalo (Heavenly Spray) also situated in Bulgaria. Water falls from the vertical Skaklia cliff when there is heavy raining or after the massive melting of snow at the end of winter or early spring, otherwise little water can be seen from farther distances. When active, however, the waterfall is easy to recognize from tourists standing many kilometres away from it, especially if they approach it from the north-west parts of Bulgaria. In the waterfall area a lot of remains from the ancient Bulgarian village Patleina have been found. Beautiful throughout the entire year it overlooks the town of Vratsa and the Vratsa lowlands. The waterfall is a summit spot of different goat routes.

If there exists an order out of all permutations such that there is no crossing among branches for both trees, we claim that it is the most visually pleasing order for both trees.

We further show that the multitude of results fuelling this debate can come from misspecification issues and selecting the appropriate sample for the analysis. Finally, we quantify the importance of segregation in the income gap between Blacks and Whites in the post-Apartheid South Africa. We find that segregation can account for up to 40 percent of the income gap at the median. It is even often a larger contribution than education all across the income distribution...|$|E

The main attention is paid to new observations, irrespective of whether a paper includes detailed interpretation of an event or simply reports the beginning of operation of a new tool. The radiation mechanism of a ZP on a double plasma resonance (DPR) remains the most widespread and standard, though ten alternative mechanisms have been offered. However, in a number of works difficulties with the explanation of a complex zebra are noted, especially in combination with fiber bursts and spikes. Therefore, several papers in which description of the radiation mechanism of a ZP on the DPR is improved are considered in more detail. Without positional observations we have a great opportunity to follow the dynamics of flare processes using SDO / AIA images in several EUV lines.

40|$|It {{might not}} have been {{foreseen}} that William Rehnquist would have a marked influence on the Supreme Court’s interpretation, construction, and application of the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses. And yet, he certainly did. Kent Greenawalt wrote that Rehnquist – or, more precisely, the “Rehnquist Court” – “turned the constitutional law of religion upside down. ” “[W]e have moved,” he reported, “from expansive readings of both of the religion clauses to narrow readings of the Free Exercise Clause and of very important aspects of the Establishment Clause. ” It is suggested in this paper that in facilitating and guiding the “move[s]” identified by Greenawalt, Rehnquist for the most part “turned the constitutional law of religion” right-side up, rather than “upside down. ” He left the Court’s Religion Clauses doctrine better than it was before, that is, better rooted in the Constitution’s text, history, structure, and values than it was when he joined the Court. In any event, that the “move[s]” happened, and that they happened in no small part because of him, seems beyond dispute. Rehnquist was able, for the most part, to exercise both judicial humility in the face of politically accountable actors’ attempts to deal with <b>debatable</b> <b>questions</b> of policy and morality – including most of the questions that arise in free-exercise and non-establishment cases – and careful review of measures and actions that might compromise the structural integrity of our Constitution. This paper’s appreciative review of his contributions to the Court’s Religion Clauses doctrine will, it is hoped, serve as a reminder that cases involving tension or collision between political and religious authority implicate the “first principles” of our constitutional experiment no less than those involving federal interference with the states’ appropriate functions or regulatory overreach by Congress.
