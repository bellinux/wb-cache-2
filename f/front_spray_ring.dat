As one of the nation's largest rocket testing facilities, the performance and design limitations of diffusers are of great interest to NASA's Stennis Space Center. This paper describes a series of tests conducted on four diffuser configurations to better understand the effects of inlet geometry and throat area on starting behavior and boundary layer separation. The diffusers were tested for a duration of five seconds with a 1455 -pound thrust, LO 2 /GH 2 thruster to ensure they each reached aerodynamic steady state. The effects of a water <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> at the diffuser exits and a water-cooled deflector plate were also evaluated. Static pressure and temperature measurements were taken at multiple axial locations along the diffusers, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were used as a tool to aid in the interpretation of data. The hot combustion products were confirmed to enable the diffuser start condition with tighter second throats than predicted by historical cold-flow data or the theoretical normal shock method. Both aerodynamic performance and heat transfer were found to increase with smaller diffuser throats. <b>Spray</b> <b>ring</b> and deflector cooling water had negligible impacts on diffuser boundary layer separation. CFD was found to accurately capture diffuser shock structures and full-flowing diffuser wall pressures, and the qualitative behavior of heat transfer. However, the ability to predict boundary layer separated flows was not consistent...|$|R

40|$|Air {{or water}} cooled heat {{exchangers}} (HX) are typically utilized as condensers or coolers for air-conditioning, refrigeration or process cooling applications in both {{commercial and industrial}} sector. However, {{air cooled heat exchanger}} performance degrades considerably with rise in ambient air temperature and water cooled coolers require considerable pumping power, a cooling tower and may consume a significant amount of water which may come from fresh water sources. Evaporative cooling offers a unique solution to this problem, where a small amount of wetting water evaporates on HX surface to boost performance in high ambient air temperature conditions. In this study, several evaporative cooling technologies were applied to three wavy-fin HXs to quantify capacity enhancement ratio (CER) and air-side pressure drop penalty ratio (PR&# 916;Pa) compared to respective dry case baseline values. Effect of varying wetting water flow rate, air velocity, fin spacing, hydrophilic coatings, spray orientation and inlet air temperature and relative humidity was investigated on hybrid heat exchanger performance. Several new performance comparison parameters were defined to compare different evaporative cooling approaches. Deluge cooling achieved overall highest CER but at a PR&# 916;Pa that was similar in magnitude to the CER. This limitation was found to be inherent to the nature of wetting water distribution method itself. Although <b>front</b> <b>spray</b> cooling tests indicated PR&# 916;Pa~ 1, <b>front</b> <b>spray</b> evaporative cooling technology was found to have up to 23 - 75 % lower CER at 60 - 100 % lower PR&# 916;Pa compared to deluge cooling. In order to understand the wetting behavior a novel visualization method was proposed and implemented, which consisted of borescope assisted flow mapping of water distribution within the HX core as a function of air velocities and wetting water flow rates. It was found that up to 85 % of HX volume remained dry during <b>front</b> <b>spray</b> cooling which accounted for lower capacity enhancement and deluge cooling forms non-uniform and thick water film which causes bridging and increased PR&# 916;Pa, A larger component level testing with HX size similar to commercial units allowed to identify constraints of different evaporative cooling methods, which would not be possible if tests were performed at a smaller segment or fin level. A novel spray cooling technology utilizing internal jet spray cooling within HX volume was both proposed and implemented and a provisional patent # 61 / 782, 825 was obtained. Compared to <b>front</b> <b>spray</b> cooling at a given spray rate, internal spray cooling could either achieve up to 35 % higher HX cooler capacity, or obtain same HX cooler capacity at approximately three times lower air-side pressure drop. Alternatively, at same air-side pressure drop wetting water savings of up to 68 - 97 % are achieved. Internal spraying combines advantages of conventional technologies and overcomes the drawbacks, by getting CER of approx. 3. 8, without film carryover and at PR&# 916;Pa= 1, while getting maximum wetting uniformity. Intermittent cooling combined with internal spraying could reduce water consumption as evaporative cooling sustains though the brief period when spray is turned off. Thus, potential for significant energy and water savings, targeted cooling, and retrofit design offers significant commercialization opportunity for future hybrid evaporative coolers. Discussions are underway for the inclusion of this technology into product line up of a leading HX manufacturing company...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to establish whether commercial sources of dried blood meals available in New Zealand offer useful sources of digestible protein for chinook salmon. Three blood meals were evaluated to assess their suitability as ingredients in salmon feed. In vitro digestibility was determined using the pepsin and pronase digestibility assays. In vivo digestibility was determined by feeding diets to chinook salmon formulated to contain 20 % dried blood meal (batch dried, <b>ring</b> dried or <b>spray</b> dried), and 80 % of a basal diet and by correcting for the digestible protein supplied by the basal diet. Chromic oxide was included in the diets as an indigestible marker. The apparent digestibilities of crude protein and amino acids were determined based on samples of faeces collected after 7 days of feeding the respective test diet to chinook salmon. Feces were collected by a manual stripping of the hindgut. Crude protein contents were uniformly high, at 92. 0 %, 93. 1 % and 89. 6 % for the batch, <b>ring</b> and <b>spray</b> dried blood meals respectively. Amino acid contents were also generally high, with the exception of the essential amino acid methionine. All crude protein digestibility determinations ranked the blood meals as: <b>spray</b> dried > <b>ring</b> dried > batch dried. In vitro N digestibility values determined by pronase assay were 60. 5 %, 25. 5 % and 9. 0 % for <b>spray,</b> <b>ring</b> and batch dried bloods, respectively. The pronase assay yielded significantly (P< 0. 001) higher digestibility values than did the pepsin assay in the case of <b>ring</b> and <b>spray</b> dried blood meals, corresponding values for crude protein digestibility with the pepsin assay were 27. 8 %, 18. 9 % and 8. 4 % for <b>spray,</b> <b>ring</b> and batch dried bloods, respectively. The in vivo apparent faecal digestibility of protein in the dried blood meals determined in the chinook salmon were highest for the spray dried blood meal (68. 4 %), lower in ring dried blood meal (46. 3 %), and very low in the batch dried blood meal. The amino acid digestibilities were similarly ranked, with the difference between <b>ring</b> and <b>spray</b> dried blood meal being statistically significant for 9 of 17 assayed amino acids (P< 0. 05). A secondary aim of the study was an evaluation of the laboratory rat as a model animal for determining protein digestibility in the chinook salmon. Batch dried blood meal was fed to rats in an experimental design closely following that set for the chinook salmon, and the apparent digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids were determined based on sampling of ileal digesta. Ileal crude protein digestibility for this batch dried blood meal in the rat was also very low (3. 9 %), suggesting that the rat may be a suitable model animal for prediction of protein digestibility in chinook salmon. Differences in the protein digestibility of the blood meals appeared to be inversely related to the time spent in processing and drying. It appears that <b>spray</b> and <b>ring</b> dried blood meals may be suitable for inclusion in chinook salmon diets in partial replacement of fishmeal proteins.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of observations of a waterspout funnel and <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> performed under a cumulus line over the Great Salt Lake for about 5 min shortly after sunrise on June 26, 1985. These observations {{were used as}} the basis for a study of the initiation and evolution of waterspouts through a series of numerical experiments at two scales, that of a cloud and a waterspout. The cloud scale was simulated using an improved Goddard-Schlesinger model with nearby Salt Lake City soundings. Results showed that for each mode of cloud initiation, the vortex that started at the anticyclonic center grew faster than those started at other centers. This result strongly suggests that the cloud vorticity was important in its initiation. The greatest azimuthal speed for the bubble-initiated cloud was 11 m/s, when the vortex model was started at 28 -min cloud time with time-varying boundary conditions, whereas it was 21 m/s when started at 12 min in the line-initiated cloud.

Flow maps for deluge and <b>front</b> <b>spray</b> cooling are presented at varying inlet air velocities and wetting water flow rates.

40|$|This report {{documents}} the design, assembly, {{and operation of}} a Pilot-Scale Evaporator built and operated by SRTC in support of Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Project at the DOE's Hanford Site. The WTP employs three identical evaporators, two for the Waste Feed {{and one for the}} Treated LAW. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator was designed to test simulants for both of these waste streams. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator is 1 / 76 th scale in terms of evaporation rates. The basic configuration of forced circulation vacuum evaporator was employed. A detailed scaling analysis was performed to preserve key operating parameters such as basic loop configuration, system vacuum, boiling temperature, recirculation rates, vertical distances between important hardware pieces, reboiler heat transfer characteristics, vapor flux, configuration of demisters and water <b>spray</b> <b>rings.</b> Three evaporation test campaigns were completed. The first evaporation run used water in order to shake down the system. The water runs were important in identifying a design flaw that inhibited mixing in the evaporator vessel, thus resulting in unstable boiling operation. As a result the loop configuration was modified and the remaining runs were completed successfully. Two simulant runs followed the water runs. Test 1 : Simulated Ultrafiltration Recycles with HLW SBS, and Test 2 : Treated AN 102 with Envelop C LAW. Several liquid and offgas samples were drawn from the evaporator facility for regulatory and non-regulatory analyses. During Test 2, the feed and the concentrate were spiked with organics to determine organic partitioning. The decontamination factor (DF) for Test 1 was measured to be 110, 000 (more than the expected value of 100, 000). Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A antifoam agent was tested during both Tests 1 and 2. It was determined that 500 ppm of this antifoam agent was sufficient to control the foaminess to less than 5 per cent of the liquid height. The long-term testing (around 100 hours of operation) did not show any fouling of reboiler or other loop piping. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator will be used in the Semi-Integrated Pilot Plant tests.

The PMP is basically a jet mixer powered by a pressure/vacuum supply system. A prototype PMP {{was provided by the}} Russian Mining and Chemical Combine and evaluated as a potential retrieval tool in FY 1997 at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Based on this evaluation, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and DOE staff determined that a modified PMP would meet project needs for bulk mobilization of sludge from {{one or more of the}} Gunite and Associated Tanks (GAAT) at ORNL. In FY 1998, PMP technology was selected for deployment in one of the GAAT to mobilize settled solids. Deployment of the PMP was expected to reduce operation and maintenance costs required to utilize more expensive retrieval systems. The following series of cold tests and inspections were conducted on one of the three PMP units provided to verify the acceptability and readiness of the mixing system for operation in the GAATs at ORNL: (1) Inspections and measurements designed to evaluate the integrity of the equipment: Fabrication shop inspections, Equipment inspections, Vibration/oscillation measurements, Hydrostatic pressure tests. (2) Functionality of the system components: Tank riser interface functionality, Decontamination <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> (DSR) functionality, Valves, actuator, sensors, and control system functionality, Support fixture tests; and Contamination control assessment. (3) Mixing and operational performance of the PMP system: DSR performance, PMP debris tolerance, PMP performance with water only, PMP cleaning radius determination, and PMP performance with sludge surrogates.

The {{formation}} method of the intersecting hole nozzle, each hole is {{formed by the}} converging {{of two or more}} child holes, is proposed, for the purpose of accelerating the fuel-air mixing process of direct injection internal combustion engines. In order to examine the macro characteristics of intersecting hole nozzles, three single-orifice intersecting hole nozzles, with the intersecting point of the axes of child holes locating inside, outside, and right at the exit surface, were manufactured. And high speed photography was employed to visualize, thus to quantify the angle and penetration of, the spray from these intersecting hole nozzles in a vessel under ambient room temperature and pressure of 0. 1 to 2. 0 MPa. The experimental results showed that the spray from intersecting hole nozzles were fan-shaped, which were beneficial for prompting the fuel-air mixing. Particularly, when the intersecting points of the axes of child holes locate right at the exit surface, the longest spray penetration was obtained, and the <b>spray</b> <b>front</b> angle is slightly smaller than side angle. While the intersecting points of the axes of child holes locate inside or outside the exit surface, the spray penetration is shorter, and the <b>spray</b> <b>front</b> angles are extremely larger than side angles under pressure of 0. 1 to 2. 0 MPa.

40|$|A testing {{facility}} (Cold Test Loop) was constructed and operated {{to demonstrate the}} efficacy of the Accelerated Waste Retrieval (AWR) Project's planned sluicing approach to the remediation of Silos 1 and 2 at the Fernald Environmental Management Project near Cincinnati, Ohio. The two silos contain almost 10, 000 tons of radium-bearing low-level waste, which consists primarily of solids of raffinates from processing performed on ores from the Democratic Republic of Congo (commonly referred to as ''Belgium Congo ores'') for the recovery of uranium. These silos are 80 ft in diameter, 36 ft high {{to the center of the}} dome, and 26. 75 ft to the top of the vertical side walls. The test facility contained two test systems, each designed for a specific purpose. The first system, the Integrated Test Loop (ITL), a near-full-scale plant including the actual equipment to be installed at the Fernald Site, was designed to demonstrate the sluicing operation and confirm the selection of a slurry pump, the optimal sluicing nozzle operation, and the preliminary design material balance. The second system, the Component Test Loop (CTL), was designed to evaluate many of the key individual components of the waste retrieval system over an extended run. The major results of the initial testing performed during July and August 2002 confirmed that the AWR approach to sluicing was feasible. The ITL testing confirmed the following: (1) The selected slurry pump (Hazleton 3 - 20 type SHW) performed well and is suitable for AWR application. However, the pump's motor should be upgraded to a 200 -hp model and be driven by a 150 -hp variable-frequency drive (VFD). A 200 -hp VFD is not much more expensive and would allow the pump to operate at full speed. (2) The best nozzle performance was achieved by using 15 / 16 -in. nozzles operated alternately. This configuration appeared to most effectively mine the surrogate. (3) The Solartron densitometer, which was tested as an alternative mass flow measurement device, did not operate effectively. Consequently, it is not suitable for application to the AWR process. (4) Initially, the <b>spray</b> <b>ring</b> (operated at approximately 2300 psi) and the nozzles provided by the pump vendor did not perform acceptably. The nozzles were replaced with a more robust model, and the performance was then acceptable. (5) The average solids concentration achieved in the slurry before Bentogrout addition was approximately 16 % by weight. The solids concentration of the slurry after Bentogrout addition ranged from 26 % to approximately 40 %. The slurry pump and ITL system performed well at every concentration.

Two F-111s swept past the fishing boat, followed by a pair of F-4s and a pair of A-7s, which began firing in front of the swift boats and then directly at the swift boats, causing one of them to turn back to Koh Tang. The jets were then joined by an AC-130H Spectre gunship from the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing which proceeded to engage the second swift boat with its cannons. An A-7D then sprayed the Swift boat with its 20 mm cannon, sinking it. The fighters then came at the fishing boat dropping bombs and firing their cannon into the water in <b>front</b> of it, <b>spraying</b> the boat with shrapnel. The fighter crews reported back that 30 to 40 Caucasians had been seen on board the fishing boat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} better {{research}} on the spray characteristics of biodiesel and n-butanol blends, an experimental study of spray characteristics of different fuel mixtures was investigated in a constant volume vessel using high speed photograph method, and analyzed the influence of different proportions of acidic oil biodiesel and n-butanol on the macroscopic parameters of spray penetration, spray cone angle and so on. The results show that {{with the increase of}} acidic oil biodiesel ratio, the air entrainment is weakened, spray penetration gradually increases and spray cone angle decreases under the same injection pressure and back pressure. After adding n-butanol in acidic oil biodiesel and diesel mixture fuel, the surrounding air entrainment is enhanced, and <b>spray</b> <b>front</b> end widen. With the increase of mixing ratio, spray penetration increases first, then decreases. The spray cone angle increases after adding n-butanol, and decreases with the increase of mixing ratio. The results show that adding n-butanol can be used as one of the methods to improve biodiesel spray characteristics...|$|R

The signal transmission form which is different form the international popular dry slip ring is put forward; the <b>spray</b> wet slip <b>ring</b> {{is developed}} to improve the measuring precision and the service life. The signal processing form which is different form the international popular gathering card is put forward and the embedded DSP shape signal processing hardware system is developed to improve the measuring precision and the anti-interference ability. The shape signal processing software system whose function contains error compensation, pattern recognition, establishment of the target shape and the close-loop control calculation is built to implement the intelligentized shape meter. The shape meter has been test chronically on the 1250 mm cold strip mill of Angang Steel Company Limited and the test result indicates that the measuring signal is stable and reliable and the closed-loop control of shape is implemented...|$|R
5000|$|The 6,000 candela [...] "automatic {{focusing}} arc lamps" [...] were wired in 3 {{series circuits}} for dimming, could each be moved 2 ft within [...] "silver parabolic reflectors" [...] to narrow or widen the 19 beams, and were positioned in concentric rings around a central light. The lights extended into glass cylinders protruding through the underwater ceiling and were each beamed through switchable disks of colored gels into water jets (there {{was also a}} lighted central geyser). The ~2,000 nozzles included umbrellas, ball <b>sprays,</b> wheat sheaves, <b>rings,</b> fans, funnels and whirligigs; {{with many of the}} nozzles around the lamp housings. [...] An underground control room on the south of the basin allowed the lighting and hydraulics operators to view through three closely spaced windows in the basin wall 6 in above the pool surface. A pump recirculated up to 100,000 gallons per hour from the pool in the 120 ft basin. [...] The fountain also had 88 incandescent lamps on the inner edge of the basin's concrete coping, and the Brooklyn Heights and the Nassau Electric railroads donated the electricity.|$|R
2500|$|Gorgeous George {{was soon}} {{recruited}} to Los Angeles by promoter Johnny Doyle. [...] Known as the [...] "Human Orchid", his persona {{was created in}} part by growing his hair long, dyeing it platinum blonde, and putting gold-plated bobby pins in it (which he called [...] "Georgie Pins" [...] and distributed to the audience). Furthermore, he transformed his ring entrance into a bona-fide spectacle that would often take up more time than his actual matches. [...] He strolled nobly to the ring {{to the sounds of}} [...] "Pomp and Circumstance", followed by his valet and a purple spotlight. Wearing an elegant robe sporting an array of sequins, Gorgeous George was always escorted down a personal red carpet by his ring valet [...] "Jeffries", who would carry a silver mirror while spreading rose petals at his feet. While George removed his robe, Jeffries would <b>spray</b> the <b>ring</b> with disinfectant, ostensibly Chanel No. 5 perfume, which George referred to as [...] "Chanel #10" [...] ("Why be half-safe?" [...] he was famous for saying) before he would start wrestling. Moreover, George required that his valets spray the referee's hands before the official was allowed to check him for any illegal objects, which thus prompted his now-famous outcry [...] "Get your filthy hands off me!" [...] Once the match finally began, he would cheat in every way he could. Gorgeous George was the industry's first true cowardly villain, and he would cheat at every opportunity, which infuriated the crowd. His credo was [...] "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat!" [...] This flamboyant image and his showman's ability to work a crowd were so successful {{in the early days of}} television that he became the most famous wrestler of his time, drawing furious heel heat wherever he appeared.|$|R
