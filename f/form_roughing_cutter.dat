5000|$|Roughing or Finishing: Different {{types of}} cutter are {{available}} for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A <b>roughing</b> <b>cutter</b> may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A finishing cutter may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, {{the large number of}} flutes leaves little room for efficient swarf removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.|$|R

60|$|As {{the first}} {{shock of the}} change of light passed, I saw about me more distinctly. The little sloth-like {{creature}} was standing and staring at me. My conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow passage between high walls of lava, {{a crack in the}} knotted rock, and on either side interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds leaning against the rock <b>formed</b> <b>rough</b> and impenetrably dark dens. The winding way up the ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured by lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, which accounted for the disagreeable stench of the place.|$|R
50|$|Mount Porndon is {{the central}} higher part of a {{volcanic}} complex including lava flows, tuff deposits and scoria cones and craters. The site covers a broad area including the major elements of volcanic sequence. A number of basalt lava flows extend from Mount Porndon <b>forming</b> <b>rough</b> stony rises, some of which reach Lake Corangamite. The younger of these flows formed an irregular lava disc roughly 3 km in diameter with a distinct and almost continuous perimeter in places forming a rocky wall 10 to 15 meters high. The stony rise flows have been dated at 300,000 years.|$|R
50|$|The western section {{consists}} of seven smaller shell middens <b>forming</b> a <b>rough</b> shell ring. The eastern area {{consists of}} five much larger shell middens, also <b>forming</b> a <b>rough</b> shell ring, and enclosing {{the remains of}} the settlement. The 27 varieties of shells excavated indicate that the nearby Ogawawa inlet was salt water in the early Jōmon period, but had become brackish by the middle Jōmon period. In additions to shells, the middens also contained fragments of pottery, tools, and many fish bones, bones from swans, ducks, deer, boars and other animals, indicating the varied diet of the local inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|Some {{significant}} improvements are achievable; e.g. silver nanorods of 55±12 nm diameter and 12.8 µm average length at 0.5 vol.% increased the thermal conductivity of water by 68%, and 0.5 vol.% of silver nanorods increased thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol based coolant by 98%. Alumina nanoparticles at 0.1% {{can increase the}} critical heat flux of water {{by as much as}} 70%; the particles <b>form</b> <b>rough</b> porous surface on the cooled object, which encourages formation of new bubbles, and their hydrophilic nature then helps pushing them away, hindering the formation of the steam layer.Nanofluid with the concentration more than 5% acts like non-Newtonian fluids.|$|R

40|$|The {{components}} extracted by aqueous phenol from whole {{cells of}} Bacteroides fragilis were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and shown {{to consist of}} a series of strain-specific, cross-reactive and common antigens, Regularly-spaced ladder patterns on silver-stained gels indicated that in most strains the LPS was present as a predominantly smooth type, but with chain lengths of varying molecular mass, ranging within each particular strain from essentially <b>rough</b> <b>forms</b> to long chain-length smooth <b>forms.</b> The <b>rough</b> <b>form</b> of the LPS at the gel front possessed an antigen common to most of the strains investigated. Another antigen, which migrated behind the rough LPS on SDS gels, was common to all strains of the species. The smooth LPS forms and the other high molecular mass components were strain-specific antigens.
